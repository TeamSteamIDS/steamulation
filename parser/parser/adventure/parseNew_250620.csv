												Let me express something before we get into this: I am a pansy. I have yet to completely finish the first Amnesia. I have a backlog of horror games (including some point n' clicks) that grows every day. Because I have a problem. I LOVE horror games... but like an ice cream enthusiast who happens to also be lactose intolerant, horror games do not love me. So there you have it; that's the score.Now that being said, I'm going to power through this one to completion. Know why? Because it's that good. Oh man is this game good. It is a testament to why horror games are so great... and why even now, in a market saturated with action horrors and tired old tropes, you'll still find an ""Among the Sleep."" This game is horrifying. Care to know why? What's the biggest issue plaguing the horror genre? That's right: termites. And player empowerment. Sometimes I'm a big, brave guy lugging around a shotgun. Sometimes I'm running around with a camera. Sometimes I might as well be stark naked. But I always find myself on equal ground with the baddies. Sure they're menacing, but I'm faster. And smarter. And sometimes more heavily armed. And suddenly we're not playing a horror game anymore. So how do we remove player empowerment, a hypothetical developer might muse? How do we make the player feel like a babe lost in the woods?  We turn them into a ♥♥♥♥ing babe, right down to the wobbles and coos and imaginary friends.And when I tell you that makes this game immersive and terrifying, I'm not kidding. When you pause the screen you cover your little eyes. When you move at all, AT ALL, you make adorable little sounds of struggle. And when you, the player, gaze into that mother♥♥♥♥ing abyss, that sucker stares right back. Every shadow hides a menace, every sound betrays a would-be threat. Everything is so big and intimidating. The whole environment just mocks you as you explore it semi-impotently. Because you're a baby. A smart baby, yes. But a baby. And that big, scary world is out to get you.I'm not remotely done with this game. I know I have a ways to go. I'm already freaked out - in a good way! If you have a passing interest in horror, you won't be disappointed. Now I'm going to go clean the boom-boom out of my pants and press onward.			"

												Among the Sleep is a horror game that has a really unique aproach to horror. But will you want to play this through ? In Among the Sleep you dont play as an adult but instead as a two year old child. The game begins and its our birthday and we get a teddy bear as a present. But one night you wake up to find out that the teddy bear and your mom is missing so its up to you to find them. So how is Among the sleep ? Im kinda mixed on this game honestly. The gameplay is smooth and its a blast to play but there are problems that weigh down the experience. First of all the game is just like amnesia. The main charecter is defensless and theres nothing you can do about it so you have to hide to get away from monsters. The game also throws in puzzles you need to solve to get to the end. So now for the pros and cons. Pros: The game looks amazing. Its just amazing to see a nightmare world through a childs eyes. The story has a great set up and the ending is also really good. Atmosphere is outstandng and its one of the best i have ever seen in a horror game. But now for the cons. The game is incredibly short only an hour to beat. Easy puzzles that dont feel like they should be there. Sometimes frustrating stealth segments. Confusing map layouts and sometimes wonky controls. Overall Among the Sleep is an excellent horror game but it has its fare share of problems. I highly suggest you get this game on a sale and not full priced and dont go in expecting a masterpiece and you should be all good. I give Among the Sleep a 7/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												I finished the game in a single sitting (roughly 2½ hours).I don't think that there's replay value to this game either, unless it gets mods at some point.Even so, I would recommend playing this for it's strong atmosphere, and the intense moments.If I had to give this some scores between 1-10, here's what I think:Gameplay: 5/10Story: 6/10Atmosphere: 8.5/10If you are on the edge about this one, then maybe pick it up later, during a sale.It's a game worth experiencing.

***After latest patch***I've always been fascinated by the game concept, to be introduced to the world through a child's eyes. Where everything and anything is possible. A world so full of life and colors, danger and adventure, fear and magic. Nothing your plain adult life could bring you close to. A world where you can be the hero of your bedtime story. You begin your adventure at night, the time when we rest after a long day, time where nothing mostly ever happens. But not for a 2 years old! Among the Sleep, introduces you to a terrifying experience, which is completely insane and traumatizing on a basic human level. Takes place on a stormy late night, your mother is missing and you're a helpless little infant who sets off on a quest to rescue her. While he faces his fears of being lost in the dark, monsters lurking in the closets and every dark corner, worlds shifting, objects stretching which gives the illusion of hellish presence in the most clever ways I have ever seen, that you begin to imagine things and jump at the slightest noise. A psychological masterpiece.Many recent horror games, such as Outlast, Amnesia, DreadOut and more, have been aiming to achieve making the player feel helpess in the face of danger or supernatural exsitence, by stripping away any means of fighting back. Which is probably the scariest feeling of all. But I can't imagine what could be more helpless than a little toddler, who can't yet talk and can barely walk, so you're basically forced to cope with your surrounding.A big thank you to the Devs for releasing an update with new achievements. Being an achievement hunter, I had to replay the game, and it was even more rewarding than my first playthrough. It opened my eyes and made me realize what a special little game it was. It also added a Slenderman feeling into it, only a toddler version.The game runs perfectly smooth, haven't encountered a single problem, still has its amazing visuals and physics and I noticed a greater update in the ambiance and sounds, which creates a much better horror atmposphere.  I strongly believe this game deserves a lot more credit, as it leaves a strong impact on you that a lot of big titles can't do. With its provoking story and innovation to the horror genre, I urge you to try it.Such rich gem is very rare to find!			"

												**Key was donated from the developer to review**   Introduction            Among the Sleep is a horror game where you play a 2 year old. Without spoilers, the game takes a look into the bad situations a small child could get into, through the child’s eyes. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and the game as a whole is a gem. Among the Sleep is not without fault though, I did find the game very short and the graphics were a little weird. (The graphics may have been a deliberate decision made by the developers) Although 20$ is a bit expensive for how short this game was, I would say I would still pay it for the great experience. As with all horror games I would highly suggest you playing with headphones on max volume. Without spoilers, I would like to say that the ending is thought provoking and really made me thing about how young children may perceive the world around them. -HiPFiRED   Pros                Thought provoking story  Amazing atmosphere  Unique take on the horror genre     Cons               It’s a bit expensive for how short it is Graphics a bit weird at times    If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group  "

												Among the Sleep, it was rather good, and I did enjoy it. Though it has some issues. Animations at the beginning they just, they look horrible. I'm sorry to say. The achievements are broken I didn't get one of them, and I beat the game.The game was good, and I enjoyed the storyline, and it was a completely different take on any horror experience, and it was such a beautiful original idea. But at a $20 price tag, that's a bit much. I waited a year and a half for this game, and though I did enjoy it, that $20 thrown on it, was steep, very steep. I beat the game, my first playthrough in 103 minutes. $20 for an hour and a half of play, I have to admit, it's not worth every penny. But I did enjoy the game. Hopefully we could see a free DLC for a little bit of a compensation of how short the game really was. If you want to check out the game, and see if you think it's worth a buy, check out http://www.twitch.tv/diablobah/profile/pastBroadcasts and click on the video boxes, those are my past broadcasts of the whole game, from start to finish.

												This is an excellently executed horror game. It tugged at my emotions and I identified somewhat well with the toddler that stars in this game. While my own mother wasn't too similiar to the one in the story, I did closely identify with the kinds of negative problems a problematic parent can bring into your life, especially at a young age. As such I think I identified a bit too closely with the toddler and it actually left me feeling a bit emotionally distressed for awhile. Due to this, I'll issue a minor warning to people that the game addresses some really difficult mother parenthood negatives and how it can effect the child(ren) involved in somehing like that.  This could be very disturbing for some people, especially those who had issues with their female parent.			"

												Scarier than outlast...better paced than outlast.FAR TO SHORT. I love the game, flawless, polished indie title. But i doubt it has much more than 1 hours gameplay. If you Love horror games buy it, but at 14.99 this game isnt worth it and that hurt me to say.Its a great game in every way but i cant justify that price for a demo worth of content. Zero collectables and zero other activities other than the main plot. its worth £8 anything more and your getting ripped off content wise.Horror fans must buy. But i cant recommend at its price.			"

												Before I say anything else, let me clear the air - I'm a red-blooded two-fisted American straight white male who found Duke Nukem's cigar-chomping sexist mass-killing schtick hilarious. BUT... what do you say about a game you progress through by murdering mobs of faceless mooks? That game mechanic goes beyond ""it's been done"" to the point of ""why are we still doing this?""Among the Sleep is different. Its protagonist is non-gendered skillfully enough that I could easily assume it was a he... but a female player could just as easily assume it was a she, and neither of us would find anything ""weird"" about that.  And I didn't beat up, much less kill, a single other character in the entire game... even though it was a horror game, and a legitimately scary one.  And even though in the reveal at the end of the game I was presented with more than sufficient reason to harbor ill-will toward the antagonist... the natural progression of the game didn't force me to, but allowed me to /discover/ a touching, compassionate gesture instead.  That, again, felt perfectly natural when it happened.Make no mistake, this is a horror game, it is a creepy one, and it has some truly scary moments in it. It is captivating, it is not a light casual romp. And yet... it breaks completely free of the ""kill mooks to progress"" mold without feeling in any way forced. Do yourself a favor: set three to four hours aside and Play. This. Game.			"

												I'm so ashamed of myself. I can't believe I had this game in my library for close to a year and ignored it for all that time. I was so in the mood for shooters or some puzzle games that everything else was pushed to the side. But one day I was in the mood for something where I could traverse at ankle height and defecate myself involuntarily, and, boy, am I glad I found this little gem to scratch that particular itch.This is going to be a slightly awkward one to write about because half the fun of the game is not knowing exactly what it is then discovering it as you go along, most of which is best left unsaid. What I can say about it, though, is it's predominantly a psychological horror played through the eyes of a small boy on his second birthday as you crawl your way through stages related to his life in search of his missing mother along with the aid of his tiny teddy bear friend, occasionally toddling around on your hind legs like a wee little Rory Calhoun. It sounds like it could be gimmicky or a million miles away from anything that would typically be relevant to your interests, but believe me, there's so much more beneath that unassuming surface.By doing something as small as lowering the player's view to ground level, there's instantly a very fresh and unique feel to the game. Add to that the fact you're playing as a baby trying to navigate an adult world where a simple everyday object now becomes a sizable hurdle, and you've got something even more captivating. But then throw it all inside a horror game and you've got the perfect recipe for something really special. All of that could have been enough by itself, but they took it even further and went to great lengths conveying the world as filtered through the barely developed mind of an infant.It's incredibly easy to take for granted, and I never really thought about it myself 'til now, but this game really makes you think about and appreciate what it must be like to inhabit the world as someone who's practically a stranger to it, and how it does that is a stroke of genius, as everything that's unfamiliar becomes alien and terrifying. A crash of lightning feels like an earthquake, or a household appliance could be an evil monster waiting to get us should we disturb it, even words on labels or books are gibberish symbols since we don't understand how to read them. You can even hug your teddy bear at times to make you ""feel safe"", ""safe"" in this case being to illuminate the path immediately ahead of you. The way it plays with your perceptions and interpretations of everything around you and feeds you back distortions of the child's own fragmented memories is a master stroke of design and execution that succeeds from the start right through to the increasingly dark end.That end won't be too far for most people, maybe between two-and-a-half and three hours of play, and could easily be done in a single sitting (which I'd recommend). And while the length didn't bother me (if anything, it probably would have suffered were it drawn out any longer), the cost certainly would, and had I paid full price I would have been a little irked by it, given that it has little to no replay value beyond that time. But otherwise, I can't praise this highly enough. There's so much more I want to say about it, but unfortunately I can't without spoiling it, and I wouldn't want to rob any player of both the wonder and horror that awaits them here. So turn off the lights, turn up your headphones, and immerse yourself in the marvel that awaits in Among the Sleep.			"

												Heartbreaking.The game is about a 2 year old boy and his teddy bear. From the start it's obvious what is happening, and this isn't just another supernatural horror game. What makes it really sad is the fact you see it from the point of view of the child. As you progress more is revealed as to what is happening, and how a childs mind may interperet and try to block out these things. It just goes to show that children really are innocent.As for price, a bit expensive with little replay value, maybe wait for a sale or bundle if you are unsure on it :)			"

												For me, the unique perspective of Among the Sleep is what really makes it a great game.The main distinction between a horror game and a creepy FPS is that the player tends to be mostly defenseless - they can only run and hide, hoping not to get dragged out from underneath the bed by whatever lurks in the dark. I can hardly think of a more vulnerable protagonist than a two-year old child, which makes this aspect incredibly strong here. If you have trouble even walking, trying to hide and run from a threat becomes almost unbearable.The atmosphere is great, there are quite a few very scary moments, and I loved the minimalist story telling that says so much by telling so little.On the negative side the game is sometimes very dark, so much so that some places are just pitch black and it's easy to get disoriented/stuck. Also the main threat loses some of its potency once you've seen it a few times and have figured out how to avoid/get away from it. But at that point the story has revealed itself enough to take over as the driving force to find out where things are going. If you have a basic grasp on FPS controls/movement the game takes about 2.5 - 3 hours to finish.All in all I warmly recommend this game, not only to seasoned horror fans, but to anyone looking for an outside-the-box experience from a new perspective.

												После тех 2 часов, за которые я прошёл игру, я подумал: а правильно ли я сделал, что отдал за игру 400 рублей? Знаете что, я думаю да.Такие игры выходят раз в 10 лет. На протяжении всего прохождения (без спойлеров) мы видели лишь те чувства, которые испытывал двухлетний ребёнок. И каждый из нас, кто когда-то боялся темноты, одиночества, отсутствия внимания со стороны родителей - обязательно вспомнит себя. И если вы любите почувствовать на себе совершенно новый опыт от видеоигры - обязательно купите эту игру. Лучшая история о чуствах малыша, только что начавшего познавать тягости жизни.10/10._____________________________________________After 2 hours (time that was spent for the whole game completion) I was thinking: is the game worth it's money? Yes, it really is.You will see a game like this once a decade. From the start until the end I've experienced the emotions of a two years old child, who just started getting this world from the bad side. Each of us, who had childish phobies (like afraid of darkness or being alone) will remember himself playing this game. If you want to experience something literaly new - this game is definetly for you.10/10.			"

												Among the Sleep is a game of perspective and confusion, seen through the eyes of a toddler in a world vastly larger and more terrifying.Its appeal is largely wrapped in this unusual viewpoint, but it's so novel and well executed that it's a strong enough hook to pivot a game around that if shown any other way would likely fall entirely flat. Seeing the dark and often surreal world around you from barely a few feet off the ground, your awkward steps making a quick escape unlikely as you stumble and fall in an attempt to run from the nightmares that haunt you, is frightening and enthralling. The vulnerability felt through playing as such a small character is immense, and had me scurrying under chairs and attempting to pry open cabinets as my only defense was to hide where the monsters pursuing me wouldn't think to look.It's hard to deny that beyond making your way from each twisted environment to the next there's very little interactivity to be found in Among the Sleep, but in most cases this works in the games favor and makes sense given a toddler's limited motor skills. There aren't involved puzzles or elaborate mechanics to deal with, it's simply you and your teddy bear trying to find your mother before the horrors around you find you first, and this simplicity allowed me to fully embody my role in this world that was intentionally beyond my comprehension. Much of the narrative is told nonverbally through the environment, with themes of alcoholism, domestic abuse, and child abandonment dripping out of bits and pieces of the world as they painted an exceptionally bleak picture in an already oppressively eerie game.Among the Sleep isn't without its flaws; there are moments when its gameplay becomes too shallow even for how deliberately designed it is to be that way, the voice acting ranges from acceptable to weird, and many of the textures can be shockingly muddy. But what it's trying to be, and in most ways entirely succeeds, is something that will stick with me long after the credits finish and I sit in the dark hoping the child I'd been playing as finds better days to come.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Another long-ish one I think, ladies and jellybeans. This is the first horror game that I have played, and despite the fact horror games usually don’t seem that appealing to me, Among the Sleep was the first to actually get me to buy and try.Of course the main appeal to this game, at least in my opinion, is the quite dramatic perception change compared to usual games. You play as a 2 year old boy, who can barely walk and whose perspective on life is a lot different to us adults. It’s actually pretty cool being so small and everything around you that in normal situations wouldn’t be a problem, suddenly becomes a challenge. This game is also quite surreal. You aren’t quite sure what is going on at times and it is never really spelt out for you, so on a certain level, this game is open to interpretation. It has a strong message to it, but the way that it was done and the details about the game make you wonder slightly. The level design was fairly creative, the general mechanics are all the same for how the baby gets around, but each level had a different thing going on. It wasn’t too repetitive and of course that works in its favour. Horror wise, someone with anxiety like myself would definitely get a little worked up playing this in the dark on their own. The ambient sounds and noises are definitely enough to rustle you and it definitely caught me out a few times. But like I mentioned before, I don’t exactly play many horror games so I wouldn’t know what those Horror veterans strive for. Compared to other games I imagine that this isn’t the scariest of games.I think the only thing about this game people might not be so happy about would be its length. I personally don’t mind short games, I think as long as the game has core strengths to it, I’m happy with it being short and sweet. But other people might not agree. It took me 3 hours to finish the game (and start a new one to go back for 1 achievement) but it definitely felt shorter.TL;DR : All in all, this game has an interesting story, great atmosphere and the tiny-man’s perception is new and refreshing for any game let alone horrors. Only fault being it was pretty short (for most people, I would assume).–------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------An update to the above review,The developers, for whatever reason, added in additional (somewhat pointless) achievements for gathering collectable drawings throughout the levels. Having already 100%ed this game, I may have just been a little salty that I had to go back and re-complete for collectables that added nothing to the game, but honestly I don’t see why it was necessary.It would have been nicer if the drawings you collected were something you could actually look at and throughout the game help piece together more interesting little bits of information about the family or something. I had already played the game, so me and my boyfriend played it through the second time around together.As I imagine it is for many horror games, there isn’t much replay value for this game. The second time was a lot less interesting to me and I don’t think my boyfriend enjoyed it all that much either. I’ve found recently that I definitely get scared from horror games easier when alone, so maybe this is purely an “alone, playing at night with headphones” type of game. There seemed to be a few immersion-breaking bugs and glitches this time around that killed any ambience in the game (I.E. The monster glitching out and laying horizontally on the floor walking in a circle like a spooky Catherine wheel).Going back to do another run and get all the added achievements took me up to a 9 hour total play time. Which seems to mean that it took us 6 hours this time around. A lot of time was wasted looking around the nooks and crannies for collectables. Which I honestly think kind of distracted from the game. But I know that slightly OCD people like me and my boyfriend may not be able to help themselves.All in all I think the game was better without the collectables, and it seems to very much be a “play once” kind of experience, but as much as I have moaned here, I still like it. Give it a go.TL;DR : Decent story and an interesting perspective from a toddler’s point of view. It’s pretty short and they have added in a batch of fairly tedious new achievements for gathering collectables that in my opinion distract from the game. It’s a “play once” kind of game but I would still definitely recommend it.			"

												Starts off strong, with great atmosphere and potential, but seems to run out of ideas quickly, falling into standard tropes and game mechanics. The beginning was somewhat tense and could have developed into something truely frightening, but  in the end became quite pedestrain.The over naraitive was interesting with subtle hints along the way to reveal the climax, and whilst it was strong it didn't really add to the experience.Most damning is its very short length, even if you take the time to explore and lack of replay value. Overall a decent game, but falls short of expecations and its potential.			"

												It's an interesting idea, but I was not really a fan.  The game is extremely short (as of writing this, I have beaten the game, but not even played it long enough for a single card drop), and fairly predictable.  Plus, there was no real sense of urgency.  It wasn't even until near the very end of the game that I even knew you could get a game over.  The atmosphere is more nonsensical than spooky.  And the concept of playing as a toddler is lost rather quickly when you're solving puzzles, rather than picking up the toy plane and shoving it in your mouth.The underlying idea, of trying to piece together what could be a rather mundane occurrence, as seen through the warp of a child that does not understand what's going on, is a highly interesting one.  The execution here doesn't quite pull it off.It doesn't do a terrible job of it, and there's plenty for people to like.  I'm just not one of those people.On a more technical side, the game qualifies for an ""auto fail"" for me in that I cannot change the movement controls to arrows.  Fortunately, I was able to play the game with an Xbox 360 controller, but being left handed, I cannot use a standard WASD setup.  Nor can anyone with a different keyboard layout.  Preventing us from rebinding movement controls in game is something that no PC game should do.			"

												Among the Sleep is horror type adventure game where you are a 2 year old boy who has got a brand new talking bear for his birthday. You work your way through progressively harder and longer puzzles to find your mother who has gone missing. I really enjoyed the atmosphere set by the lighting and sound in Among the Sleep. It is on par with Amnesia in that sense. Although it's not as scary as Amnesia, there are still times where it had me pausing the game for me to catch my breath because I was wetting myself. For some reason I couldn't get my controller to work with this game, which is a shame since it is the perfect game to use with a controller, but there isn't anything wrong with mouse and keyboard controls, ever. I'd say wait for this game to go on sale before you pick it up, it's quite short and the £14,99 is a bit much for a game which is only about three hours long.			"

												I really dislike horror games. They tend to have a very weak or pointless story (if they even bother to have a story at all) and the settings in which they take place are pretty over done (stone castle/old mansion or science lab/hospital). Then there are monsters like ""unknown killer monster x"" which have very little reason to exist in the game's world other than to walk around and make you hide. Then there are stupid level design choices and puzzles that don't really work or are far to complicated when your character can just use that freaking axe its carrying and break a damn window to get out. But enough about annoying horror tropes, lets talk about Among The Sleep.This is one of the best horror games I've played. Its not something I say ever find easy to say since I dislike horror games in general but Among The Sleep is just that good. The art and level design of the game really stands out overall. Twisted but familiar the levels of the game never feel like they are repeating and the developers took great care in crafting each and every part of them. It was fun just exploring the levels (like a child) just to see what little bits they had hidden around.The puzzles aren't hard at all and or pretty much ""Find item X to open door"" but the search for the key never feels tedious or repetitive since there is always new places to explore. I often ended up finding a key to a door before finding the door due to me having fun wandering around.The monsters feels very much like part of the world. It is familiar but also very twisted. Throughout the game you start to discover what the creatures are but that doesn't make it less scary and only enroots it to the world the developers have made.The game is about 3 hours long, shorter if you just run around as fast as you can without taking the time to look around but its a great 3 hours. This game does not need to be 12 or 20 hours long since there is barely any back tracking or filler content trying to push that gameplay timer just a bit further. During those 3 hours though you get a strong sense that they kept everything that worked well and weren't afraid to remove what wasn't working. This is a quality game that deserves to be in everyone's library even for people like me who are not fans of horror.			"

												The simple act of presenting a game through the eyes of a toddler is ingenious. Not too long ago Bioshock 2 gave us a somewhat exaggerated and short taste of what it might be like wondering around madness as a small child. Among the Sleep stumbles a bit in game design, but it does have something new to offer.The opening finds you staring through a distorted glass before you drop your cup and your mom comes in to feed you cake. Someone knocks on the door, and as she leaves the room, her raised voice is heard which cues the visuals and sound to intensify until she returns to carry you of to your room. What is being displayed in this sequence is an almost innate pang or irritation that swells up when a parent is upset. Among the Sleep then follows this sequence by setting players firmly into their toddler limbs with quick crib escape in order to introduce the young protagonist to  a cordial, talking teddy bear who attempts to rid the child of fear. It is quite the opening. The child's comforts are made clear through the mother and friend, as are his limitations and abilities with his toys and Brobdingnagian world of everyday objects and furniture. Among the Sleep attempts to carry these motifs throughout the game through various objects and designs from eerie coats and countless doors to the memories of happiness the child must find. While these are nice ideas, there are some hiccups in gameplay that mar the experience a bit.Among the Sleep is marketed as a horror game, which means that the surprise is somewhat ruined as people will now be searching for scares. It is also this focus on horror that takes away power from the monsters in the game. Horror is the visceral, the monsters, or Carpenter's The Thing in the flesh; terror is more of what we build up in our minds, the monsters we imagine when the lights flicker or the floorboards creak. Among the Sleep crafts terror expertly with the humming of a TV and the dancing of shadows, but it is the actual sight of the monsters that take away the power they had. This is no slight against the monster's design, because good monsters are hard to make; in general whatever we imagine in our own head will probably be scarier than what an artist can represent. Pushing the player to face a monster that is in fact not as creepy as the atmosphere the game created so well, is a misstep.The game's pacing is a bit uneven. The structure of returning to a home and filling it with memories is understandable, if a little heavy handed, but these bits of going to the little home come off as more of a chore. There were also some areas, such as the swamp section, that were easy to get lost in because everything looked the same. Some large areas with lots of climbable objects seemed suspiciously designed to take up more time than necessary. The game's sense of style really seemed to shine when it was recreating the real and only adding in bits of distortion, but most of the game is filled with wildly warped areas that did not appeal to me as much.Time is also another important issue with Among the Sleep. Standing at only a few hours with the middle area dragging a bit is a rough edge. The game is not that challenging ( though I did have a monster sneak up on a me few times, and I did fall off a bridge more than once which sent me back further than I would have liked) and there is very little interaction or gameplay involved: you crawl around and climb to your heart's content with little consequence and with not much else to do aside from grab key items. The lack of player involvement stacks on with the pacing issue.Among the Sleep is not perfect, but it is an interesting game. Some sections should probably have been longer while others could have been trimmed away. The shift in settings might be welcome for some, but I rather liked the hints of imagination at play. Aside from the minor gripes, it is an enjoyable game. There are definitely some elements in Among the Sleep that I hope to see in other games.			"

												I honestly love this game. The fact that you are only 2 years old and you are getting put through all this. With great atmosphere and Heart-Pounding moments, you always are wanting to look behind you to see if you are being chased. I think this is possibly more scary than Amnesia. While you are struggling for survival from 3 monsters, you and your compainion, Teddy, are forced to escape. When i played this, I was scared to death. I think this game is best horror game of 2014!			"

												Ok lets start by saying i had high hopes for this game and although i loved the demo i sort of feel cheated by the actual full release.Now dont get me wrong this game is one that has production values that a lot of the bigger games would be envious of and the story in game is one i have not seen told in this medium before so far so good (BUT and there is a BUT,which we will come to shortly).The graphics do an admirable job of putting the illusion forward that you are a baby exsisting in an adults world,and at times some of the things that frighten you wouldent do as an adult but when seen from a childs perspective are nothing more than terrifying.The sound in game is top notch with your mum sounding like she really loves you (she has genuine concern in her voice,put forward brilliantly by the actor that plays her) and your character the baby sounds just like he should  ""GOOING"" and ""GAAING"" at the right time in game but the character that steals the show is Teddy.Taddy is voiced brilliantly and also potrayed really well in game with the graphics putting forward his floppy and,well just teddy like moves and attitude to perfection at times you will need his guidance as you can feel lost and listening to him helps you on the right track and also holding him close in dark areas helps comfort you and also light the way (literally).The story is told really well and like i have said is (considering as your a baby in game) one i have not seen in this medium before and is very adult in nature and also quite harrowing the nearer you get to the end of the game,and come that point it all makes sense and like i have said is one that to be honest got to me and was quite upsetting.So why did i say there was a BUT before,well its a great game but before you know it its all over and even though the game has a really good story and a satisfying ending you do feel cheated as the game is really short and by the time you come to the ending you will be like ""IS THAT IT"",now hopefully this can and should be addressed with DLC (and the DLC should be free as the main game itself is very expensive).So do i recommend this game well yes its unlike anything you have played before but it will also leave you wanting more and is just to short at the asking price,so if unlike me you have patience wait for a sale and pick it up then as it will be better value for money when its at least half the price it is at the moment.

												The survival horror genre has an identity crisis as of late. Capcom pumps out action titles, calls them Resident Evil and somehow they get classified as survival horror. I miss the classic survival horror titles like Silent Hill and Eternal Darkness. There was hope of a revitalization with Kojima’s P.T. but that ended before it could even get started. Enter Among the Sleep from Killbrite Studio and after a few trailers I thought this could finally be the survival horror return I’ve been waiting for. Does Among the Sleep deliver, and is it truly survival horror?Among the Sleep takes you through a trippy adventure told through the eyes of a two year old as he tries to find his mother, preventing you from achieving this is a shadow like individual (very similar to Slender Man). Not only that but you have a companion talking stuffed teddy bear (named Teddy for obvious reasons). How could this not be a survival horror title? Like I said earlier, Among the Sleep is told through the eyes of a toddler and I mean that literally. This is a first person toddler title and through your adventure you will crawl, climb and kinda run. While also picking up objects such as drawings and other children’s toys along the way. Among the Sleep is not a very long game; clocking in around 3 hours. I really don’t want to dive into the stages involved in the game for spoiler purposes. I will say you get to explore the child’s house rather early in the game and this is where the game starts you down the rabbit hole on its eerie nightmarish adventure.Basic controls involve; crawling, grabbing items (holding items has them float in air which reminds me of Half-Life) and hugging Teddy to lighten up areas as well as calm the toddler down. Controls and gameplay are very basic and honestly that's not what’s important about Among the Sleep. The atmosphere and musical score is what I was looking forward to most, and in my opinion it is the most crucial part of any survival horror title. So I’m happy to report that while the game is very short, the environments and mood throughout really enhanced the storytelling experience. Playing Among the Sleep with the lights off will deliver more creeps and scares than Capcom has been able to deliver with any Resident Evil title for the past 10 years.Among the Sleep is a baby step (see what I did there) in the right direction when it comes to the survival horror genre. It’s an original concept and a very unique experience. Not to sound like a broken record, but Among the Sleep feels like it’s over just as it’s getting into its groove and that’s really my only major complaint. Hopefully this isn’t Killbrite Studio’s only entry into the survival horror genre because I would love to see what else they could pull off with a longer story and bigger budget.			"

												I've played this a little the past 2 days and was surprised how quickly it ended. It took me 2.9h to complete, and I even replayed one chapter because I missed an achievement.  But man, I loved every minute of it. It has a nice creepy atmosphere and its beautifully made. I wont call this a horror though, there are creepier games around. Its a very easy game... there are some puzzles or fetch objectives but you wont get stuck for too long. After playing for an hour I was mistaken by thinking you can't die in this game. Well, you can die. I fell into the water once and got caught by the evil entity. Dying teleports you back to the last autosave, which isnt that far away.   This game is on sale now for 17,99. Although I absolutely love this game I think its overpriced, a lot. For 18 euros I expected more gameplay than those 3 hours and imo this game has no replay value once you've beaten the game.Buy it on a sale is my advice. But definately get this.Oh and the ending was good, very good. Thumbs up to the devs!EDIT: I encountered 1 bug that made me return to a last savepoint. (The part where a box blocks a bridge. You have to remove the box for the bridge to pass through a hole in the wall. After removing the box the bridge didnt move. It did when I tried again).			"

												It is an interesting idea to play as a small child, unable to do most things, with a fantastical view of common events.  Unfortunately, what we have is a muddled, dark, linear and very short game with only the faintest wisps of a story.  It also features some of the most nausea inducing camera-work I have seen in a long while, and a very tight FOV with no adjustment did not help.  The limited checkpoint save system is also an annoyance.   The majority of the game involves walking through a random hodge-podge of closets, basements, and dream-scape forests, linearly collecting objects to open the ""gates"" to move to the next section.  Then the game is over.  For something that needed to have a compelling and interesting story, Among the Sleep just fell flat.  Not recomended.			"

												You'll be put in the shoes (well, the romper suit, actually) of a 2 year old toddler who wakes up in the middle of the night to find his teddy bear missing. Once the comforting companion has been tracked down, the two unlikely heroes have to make their way through their nightmarishly distorted home, only to find themselves trapped in surreal dreamscapes, which can only be escaped by unlocking suppressed memories. Soon enough, very real horrors start seeping into this fairy tale world of the subconcious. ""Among the Sleep"" truly is a masterpiece of interactive storytelling. Even though this is a very short game that should not take you more than four hours to finish, I urge you to get this. Gaming experiences this intense and imaginative are hard to come by.			"

Amnesia:Early YearsAmong the Sleep brings out the best of horror/adventure/puzzlesque genre. First thing you have to realize, you play for a two years old kid. You are not very fast, neither tall and of course everything is from his point of view so scary things can be more scarier.This (for me) original concept, thrives on stunning level design where children nightmares become reality, where every sound creeps me out, and where biggest fear comes from unknown evil.As we progress further and further, we're recovering earliest happy memories, while environment around us hinting, that every one of these memories are hiding terrible truth from us.Ending sequence is somewhat heartbreaking and it added another layer to story - emotional this time.Among the Sleep is game of high quality. It has amazing atmosphere, terrifying moments as well as emotional impact.I strongly recommend to give this game a try.Grade: B+ "

												Among the Sleep is a first-person horror game where you play as a Toddler. The game is a bit more of an experience game, or if you will, a 'Crawling Simulator', though there are a few physics-based puzzles, and a few occasional sections where you get stalked by a monster.It's your second birthday, and your mom has given you a teddy bear for this special occasion. However, when left on your own in your playpen, the bear begins to move and talk on its own devices. Soon it tells you it wants to show you something, but you need to be in the dark...As a toddler, you can crawl, walk, and run a bit (though running for a while will make you trip). Crawling is faster than walking, and you can fit under tight spaces, but walking let's you see more and interact with higher-things. There are a variety of objects to interact with and pick-up in your environment, and the physics of objects are all pretty well handled. You can also climb up onto objects that are waist-high for you.With these mechanics, you are let off to explore and interact with things to progress. The first half of the game is more of a straight-up 'Crawling Simulator' type of game, as while there are some small puzzles and some good atmosphere, nothing really comes to hunt you... That is, until the second half of the game.Sound design is top-notch. The music is appropriately odd and somewhat mystical, but what really needs to be mentioned is environment sounds. As a 2-year old, the world is still a foreign and strange place, and sounds we as adults find familiar take on strange properties through the imagination  of a child. The sound design is legitimately unnerving and creepy, and is honestly one of the first horror games in a long while that I've been this impressed with how it handled its sound design. It leans perfectly on the thin line between the familiar and the strange and terrifying.Graphics and art direction also deserve mention. The game looks good, with a sort of unique creepy cartoony-fantasy look that really fits the tone of the game. The art direction is also extremely well handled, especially in the later locations, and contain a lot of imagination and visual imagery that is easy to stick with you. The game gets more surreal as it goes on, and gets more twisted, and the imaginative art direction makes quite a few visual splendors to behold.Scariness is subjective, but while the game could of maybe been scarier with a few more tricks, I would say it did manage to unnerve me, surprise me, and tense me up on a few occasions. The sound design made me not want to continue every now and again, and the few encounters with monsters were appropriately tense and scary.But the monster encounters are very few, which is both in my eyes a good thing and a bad thing. On one hand, the two different monsters the game has never became overly familiar due to how infrequent they were, and both managed to really tense things-up whenever they did appear, and provided interesting challenges and context to situations. But on the other hand, there were many sections, especially in the middle part of the game, where I felt a little too safe.The game maybe could of dared to be a little scarier and explore a few of the possibilities it raises with it's fantastic atmosphere and a few implied danger scenarios that don't actually lead into anything, but arguably its infrequent quality is what helps the game stay tense.The story was interesting, while not entirely too surprising, I would say that it was handled rather well. Some nice use of symbolism throughout.But it's one flaw is that it's rather short, being about 2-4 hours long. Those two to four hours are rather well-done, but it did leave me wanting more at it's conclusion, and some may not want to pay $20 for a 2-4 hour experience.But Among the Sleep is a good little horror game that will likely stick with you some after completing it. It doesn't rely overly on jump scares, and unnerves with atmosphere, fantastic sound design, strange moments, and a few infrequent monster encounters. It's short and sweet, and will likely be appreciated by fans of 'Walking Simulator Experience' type of games with a little more gameplay, and horror fan who especially appreciate atmosphere.			"

												This was a pretty unique game. You are playing as a two year old whose birthday it is. Your mom givse you a teddy bear, but then something happens that cause her to get freaked out and puts you in your room while I suppose she is dealing with it. You and your now animate teddy go on a little adventure at which point your mom realizes you got out of your playpen and puts you to bed for the night. You hear somethign and start to wake up. Your teddy is taken from you and your crib knocked over, which is where the real adventure begins.This is a horror game as seen through the eyes of a two year old, and it brilliantly handles this through creepy sights and sounds and some ambiguous monster that starts to hunt for you as the story progresses.There are a couple times where you will jump a little, but it isnt really a scary game per se. It is however creepy, and the subject matter is quite dark and depressing. The end is both sad and hopeful all at once.I will say without giving anythign away that this topic will be relevant and quite poignant for a lot of people, and it may even be the sort of game that brings real tears to you depending on your own set of circumstances growing up. While I didnt experience the things that happen in this game, I can appreciate how much this might affect some people.Outside of that, the adventure is filled with mystery and awe.I think this was a very well made game that also handled a sensitive topic quite well and did an amazing job of bringing the world as seen through two year old eyes to life perfectly.This one is a 10/10 for sure.

												This game is one of my favorite all time games. The last horror game that I absolutely loved was Amnesia the Dark Descent and after that I thought no horror game would ever be as good, until they came up with this and many people refered it as Amnesia from the point of view of a baby. Now if you think you were absolutely defendless in Amnesia, you can guess that it gets even worse because, how what can possibly a baby do against the things that lurk in the shadows except from hiding in places he can only access? You won't be completely alone on the baby's adventure though, they were kind enough to give you a teddy bear companion that could talk to you and lights up when you hug him. Which is a very recomforting item in the middle of a very messed up baby's world. What I liked the most is that, since the protagonist is still a baby well the way they see the world is so much different of what it is. And also since some parts of the game is going through the memories, well it's no secret that human process memory very different before the age of 3, so the vision of those memories is a pretty disorted world from what it actually is, making the experience even scarier for the player. Since the begining I had a pretty good idea of what was going on, nevertheless that made me constantly worry even more about the baby and feel powerless at the idea. Even though my suspicious were true it still managed to give me a shock in the ending, because the game is truly immersive. I'd try to play in one sitting for better experience, and also because unfortunately I've heard people complainig that game files got somehow deleted after a while of not playing (I don't know if this has been fixed in a patch though, since it's been a while since I heard those complaints).So to wrap this up, if you want a unique and genuine horror experience, it's worth checking this title out, it can get spooky without the need of cheap jumpscares, it has stealth elements, a loyal companion and an eerie environment.Update as Nov 2016:Saving system may still mess up somehow, so take my advice to beat it in one sitting or ASAP.

												Among the Sleep is a short horror game where you play a toddler who appears to be living out a kids nightmare.It's an interesting concept that works really well. Graphically and sound wise it is very good, and the game is not without its scares and jumps. In some places it's actually quite creepy. The puzzles are quite basic, but interesting enough to keep you playing. There is a story too which resolves nicely at the end.My only real complaint is that it really is all over within 5 hours. There is a prologue which I am yet to play, but I'm not sure I would be going back to replay it, now that I have played it once.I recommend picking it up if its going cheap.			"

												Is this game good, no, is this game terrible, no, but this game is truly brilliant, every noise and every moment has you looking back to see what was the cause of the noise, it truly is terrifying and yet so immersive, I have yet to see an overused mechanic or protagonist, to be honest, can you name another game where you play as a 2 year old Toddler? I know for sure I can't think of one...With that said, I found that the audio queues seemed a little too loud, I could here the monster coming from a mile away, the Teddy seemed a little useless to me and only seemed to fit a narrative point of view, voice acting was really good and did not get old and tiresome, the start however seemed to drag a little, especially with the Teddy asking what everything is, he seemed to just stop his dialogue and wait a few seconds before proceeding to talk.Now with above all taken care of, how are the main mechanics of the game?, they are solid and work really well, you really get the feeling that you are a scared and defenseless Toddler, you clumsely walk through the terrain like a Toddler would and if you run for too long, he loses breath and falls over, the scenery is beautiful, even when it's dark Among The Sleep still manage to make it look stunning, the atmosphere is creepy, with doors creeking, glasses breaking, footsteps lightly walking behind you and the mothers voice in the background all seem to add it's own sense of creepyness, the Monsters scream is terrifying when you least expect it and it has it's quiet points to add to the tension of if and when the monster apears to devour your innocent 2 year old soul, I was scared of every inch of the game, though it may not be the scariest of horrors, but it's the only one that kept me on the edge of my seat right through, you get the feeling of accomplishment, only to realize that you still have to get back and place the piece and continue onwards, however the monster is predictable but not in a way that ruins the experience, I personally don't think the monster is the main experience, the universe is stunning, it's like a gothic picture that has come to life, it's frighteningly beautiful and atmospherically superb.Now you may ask,""Is it worth $19.99/£14.99?""Yes it is, it's a stunning piece of artwork and the devs have truly done a great job with Among The Sleep and it has great potential to further what it already has acheived, with atmospherically stunning visuals and great progression, you are never left thinking that you have seen this before, buy it and see for yourself, I guarentee that you won't be dissapointed at all.I would personally rate this 9 out 10, there is a few issues here and there, but none that I have found to be game breaking or none that take away from the immersion that Among The Sleep gives you.I hope this has helped you to choose whether or not this game is worth your time and money and I can't wait to see what Krillbite have to offer in their bright looking future.For more reviews follow our Curator Page "

Review What would you do if you were two years old and you were awoken abruply in the middle of the night?You'd look for your mom, of course!This is how Among the Sleep begins.You're just two years old, took your bottle, ate some cake, won a cute Teddy bear, went to bed and you're abruptly awoken in the middle of the night.Time to look for mommy!However, the search for your mom's arms will be terrifying.Through basic controls like walking, crawling, grabbing items, running (or trying to) and hugging your Teddy bear, you'll face creepy noises, puzzles and will hide from unkillable enemies.You should play it in a dark room and don't forget your headphones!Explore the environment, the rooms, play close attention to the noises and if something goes wrong, squeeze your Teddy bear, he'll light your way!If you enjoyed Papo & Yo you'll probably enjoy Among the Sleep.Rating:9/10Pros: Great atmosphereCreepy sound effectsNice graphicsIntriguing storyA few jump-scaresFree DLC - Prologue Cons: Save systemNo replay value (just for achievements) For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

												The only remotely negative thing I can say about this game is that it's short. I finished it in about 3hrs. Other than that, this was a pretty good game. One of the best aspects about this game is the atmosphere! The gameplay was unique and the storyline was interesting. If you don't mind spending close to 20$ on a short game, then go for it. If you're not comfortable spending that much on such a short game, then buy it when it's on sale. Either way, you should play this game.			"

												This is a short horror adventure game from the perspective of a toddler trying to find his mum with his teddy bear friend to help him out along the way. Interesting playing from the perspective of a toddler. The atmosphere is great  the environments are well made, being rather creative and imaginative with a sad story.It's a little bit scary. Trying to avoid the monsters did freak me out a bit. It does a good job of making you feel small in a big world.I like how unique the game is seeing everything through the eyes of a infant.This game is definitely worth playing, it was interesting and fun mostly.6/10 I rate it as ok as it's a bit too short taking me just over 4 hours to complete as I did not rush and I got lost a bit.

												Two years old boy in the hands of a player. Plus, a horror game. Remember how excited I was when I saw that game coming. Even tried the alpha version, which scared the hell out of me already. But even then I feared that this game will be too short, which happens sadly often today. And this is the main defect of the game, for me maybe the only one. I literally crawled in fear and sometimes ran till I fell down (literally, again - remember that you're just a little boy - if you will run too long, your character will simply fell down). I listened to the weird sounds surrounding me and wandered through dream-like locations. I was scared to death. All of this happened too fast, but it was very intense experience!			"

												Among the Sleep is a cleverly written survival horror game developed by Norwegians. It is a unique little game in the sense that the protagonist is a two-year-old little boy who's aided by his Teddy bear in order to go through various horrors that are lurking in their house. The story begins with a birthday celebration that reveals Teddy to be the gift. However, he is taken from the boy and in chapter 1 we need to retrieve him quickly only to realise that the real protection from the dark can only be offered by mom. The journey then continues to find mom and along the way we encounter some monsters and cleverly thought out puzzles.The game has a great atmosphere and for full immersion a headset is required - similarly to the Amnesia games. The Unity engine does its job properly and the visuals look great. The only downside is the game's short story: it can be completed in a mere 2 hours including its DLC content which is a kind of prologue and is meant to be played after the story is done.Overall, Among the Sleep is a good game that I can recommend mainly to the fans of the genre. Hopefully, the guys at Krillbite Studios will develop a - much longer - sequel or another game with similar level of quality.UPDATE: The latest update (version number 2) introduces some new achievements (all related to collectibles) along with some nice graphics enhancements thanks to the new version of the Unity engine.

												When I do a review the review is based on how the game looks and the story line. and is it worth   the price of the game. I got my game on sale awhile back but the price is 15 bucks. For a game that is 15 bucks i give the graphics an average rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars. I seen better graphics on cheaper games but the game is meh on that catagory. For the story line i give it 4 out of 5 stars. Not many people make games with a storyline like this which makes it good. Story line is sad but truth that goes on in the world today. Seeing life as a two year old and how he see abuse. The achievments are kinda tricky to get. There are guides you can go to if you are having trouble as well as youtube videos which wont make it impossible to get them.			"

												Forget COD and BF, This is the real deal. You think you are tough? Then why not test your limits as a 2 year old toddler who is completely defenseless against every odd. The creepy voices, sounds will make your toddler scared as hell. In search of his mommy he will surely come across some pretty scary stuff for a mind of a two year old.Price tag may bit up for a short game like this. And yes it is short. Some may say it's a wanna-be amnesia clone. But isn't most games are clones of past games? Hasn't any modern game took the formula of Quake? Delta Force? Soldier of Fortune? So yes it might look like amnesia, but took on a complete different path. 2 year old character animations are also in remarkable state. You run for few miniutes and you fall, You wanna get away from scary stuff, close your eyes with your hands, mumble when scared is some of them.So don't buy this if you wanna complain about your money and being short or just wanna complain about being a clone. Enjoy it, as it is. I looked very forward when buying this on steam, so even up voted during the greenlight. So if you really wanna some piece of art, something different than running, killing or probably hacking or solving your own murder. Consider this as fresh game.Game - 9/10!			"

												The demo was great, and the ideas behind are pretty awesome, but in reality it's only 1,5 hour long Amnesia clone that's not worth the money they want for it. It needs a lot more content and ideas behind it to actually be good, and as it is now, it's downright disappointing. Do not buy.			"

												In Among the Sleep you take control of a two-year old child. The game starts with an opening scene where you celebrate your second birthday. Your mum feeds you some cake before taking you upstairs with a birthday present delivered by someone who your mother does not invite in (maybe the father). The gift turns out to be a teddy bear, which comes to life and acts as your guide throughout the game. Shortly after you are off to bed, you wake up in the middle of the night to your cot being dragged across the room before tumbling over. After some wondering you realize that your Mummy is not in her bed and you set off on an adventure of sorts to find her again. It is clear that you are in a dream world but the further you go into the game, the darker it becomes.The control system is good. You have two main modes of getting around, walking and crawling. Crawling is faster, but you ca not carry anything or hug your teddy (he gives you light when you do so). While walking you are slower but from the standing position you can climb up onto furniture and boxes. In fact all the animations throughout the game are good. A cool little feature is when you pause the game, the child brings his hands up to cover his eyes.The graphics are good so far, could be a few more details but nothing big to complain.Sound plays a huge part in the game. Teddy will talk to you sometimes to help guide you through the story but usually you are listening to the sound of your mum humming a lullaby with you trying to head towards the source. Also you can hear some eerie music, creaky doors or floorboards or other objects moving or falling.The game itself is too short. I finished it within 109 minutes. Among the Sleep is not scary at all but it has a great atmosphere. The ending of the game is pretty shocking. I will not tell you anything, you have to play and see it by yourself.I can recommend Among the Sleep but you should wait for a discount, 19,99€ is a bit too much for only around 110 minutes of gaming.Sounds 9/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I was quite surprised by this game. I had not really heard too much about it aside from the fact that you play as a toddler, and it's creepy. The game offers a unique perspective as you view the world through the eyes of a child, and it's a pretty scary world; There's a lot of creepiness to it, and in the end, you'll understand why, but I won't spoil that.You are not alone in this world though as your faithful friend, Teddy, an actual talking teddy bear, goes with you, helping you out and keeping you company. As far as length, it's around 4-5 hours? There's also a Prolouge, which is about an hour or so in length, and it is its own chapter, though I'd recommend playing it AFTER the main game for perspective. There's definitely a creepy atmosphere, along with hiding from...something...and being quiet. The audio in this game is top notch, with creepy sounds of all types here and there, setting the mood nicely and making your hair stand on end. I highly suggest playing with headphones on to fully experience it. The overall gameplay is pretty simple as you walk or crawl from place to place, figuring some puzzles out, and discovering what awaits in the next room. There's also some collectables which come in the form of children's drawings that are hidden throughout the levels.It's a nice spooky game with interesting imagery and gameplay, so this definitely comes with a thumbs up from me!

												I backed this game on Kickstarter and have been waiting for it ever since! I am not a big horror fan, but I felt that the take these guys were taking on it was cool and intriguing. I give this game a lot of credit for the art and the atmosphere! The story is okay, but very sad, and it's tough to play as a baby/toddler.It might just be me, but I work at an elementary school and deal with kids very often, so my heart goes out to them and hope they succeed in their search for what they're after. I never want to be responsible for a two year old drowning to death. I was personally extremely put off by the ability to die in such a gruesome way. I was also reminded of the reveal of the aliens in Signs when I first saw the ""Mysterious Character"". I was much more scared when dealing with something that allowed my mind to search for what it could possibly be, once I saw it, it kind of made it more tangible and easier to deal with. The sound development was awesome! I also agree with some of the other reviews in terms of the price, it's the same price as Rust. Rust's replayability is practically infinite, any linear story is a tough $20 price tag these days, let alone an hour and a half one. I see how much you guys put into it, and it definitely shows! But I wish you decided to sell it for less, with the hopes of more people being able to experience it with less worry about getting the time out of their money.Overall, I think as an indie game, this is up there with Gone Home in my list of favorites in the last couple years. Great job! And I can't wait to see the next project!			"

												Once again, Krillbite studio has brought us on a thought provoking adventure. Their first being The Plan, which was a 'preview' of their first shot at developing with the Unity engine... and quite frankly changed my view of what defines a good game in a matter of 2 minutes time.It seems that this small group of developers has a knack of thinking outside of the box. Again using the Unity engine, Among the Sleep puts you in the unique position of viewing the world through the eyes of a two year old. Never before has a lovable protagonist been so helpless. Using this gameplay method in a horror game is a stroke of genious, since you have no way of defending yourself against unknown evils. It really adds to the feeling of helplessness. Periodic jumpscares plus extraordinary psychologically tense background noise creates an unnerving edge-of-your seat venture.This game is not without its flaws. Glitches abound, and the the monotone surroundings feel clausterphobic at times. I also found that for the price, it was surprisingly short.This game could use some depth and length, but all in all, it was a very unique experience that I would recommend for gamers who enjoy something new. 8/10.

												I love this game. Simple, highly functional gameplay. Absolutely beautiful design, both graphically and plot-wise. I don't want to go into too much detail, as to spoil things. However, I will say the way the story unfolds was really well done, in my opinion.You play as a toddler, your only friend being your loyal teddy bear. You go on a quest to find your mom. Stuff happens.My only complaint with this game is that it was far too short. And I say that because of how much I enjoyed the game. It's sort of like when your favorite TV show decides to end when it's still perfect and everyone loves it. Going on any longer might have spoiled things, but I still wish for it nonetheless.10/10, would recommend			"

												Very powerful story, and a great example of ""do, don't show"" in its presentation.  This isn't some Dear Esther ""walking simulator,"" but the mechanics of the game are so rooted in the narrative that they only add to the atmosphere, while never feeling like ""game tropes.""  For exmaple, hugging your teddy bear makes you feel better, and also provides a little bit of light to see in dark areas.  There's a sequence toward the end that really made me feel like a toddler who's just knocked something over and knows he's in trouble for it.  This is not the scariest game I've ever played, at least not until I reached the end and understood what was actually going on.If you like horror games but don't want something too intense, or if you think maybe games can be art without having to be boring, this is well worth your time.

												I'm going to review this one a tad prematurely; that is to say, in spite of having only played what I believe constitutes about the first two-thirds of the game (as this is the third - count 'em! - recently-released horror game or DLC I've bought which my three year-old, piece-of♥♥♥♥♥♥laptop seemingly can't handle, technologically-speaking...thankfully, a new computer is on the horizon).  I feel pretty confident in opining, however, that if you like the sound of this game's basic premise - in short, Amnesia-style horror from the perspective of a two-year old toddler - this isn't liable to disappoint.  Unless you're one of the ""this game it too short"" brigade, in which case you probably should have learned not to buy these sorta games by now, especially at or near full-price.     It's slow to build, and a LOOOOONG time before you encounter any true ""danger"" within the game, but when that moment comes in which you realise that, yes, the spooky creatures you've been safely spotting from afar ARE actually interested in moving in for a closer look, it's every bit as legitimately pants-browning as the best horror games you've ever played.  What's more, the ""child-like"" perspective, while not fully reinventing the wheel, does put quite a different spin on well-worn first-person adventure gaming themes; for example, where other games would require your character to push a crate up against a wall in order to access a high vent, in this one your toddler has to pull a kitchen chair up just to reach a regular-height surburban door handle!  Everything feels quite dauntingly HUGE to our diminutive hero, making it feel not unlike Alice trapped in a nightmare Wonderland (one in which she never managed to find the antidote to the shrinking potion)!    It's super-spooky, super-imaginative, has amazingly atmospheric sound design, and your best friend/sole ally is a talking teddy-bear!  So what are you waiting for?  Unless the answer is ""a better computer"", you really don't have any excuse...unless you're a complete wuss, of course.  C'mon, are you really so much of a wuss that you're not willing to brave the same horrors as a TWO YEAR-OLD KID?!  Teddy's waiting for you...Verdict: 9/10.			"

												I remember my first teddy bear when I was a little girl. His name was Rufus. He was actually my best friend for a long time until I was able to imagine friends without the need of a physical face. He still huddles among the boots of my closet, negotiating with all the sock-monsters in there.For many children, the security of a soft, cuddly friend can really make or break their day, and there is something incredibly endearing in being able to experience this through the eyes of a toddler, as an adult.The knowledge that such simple things seem so terrifying at such a young age, makes complete sense when you understand that a child's mind is bursting with unbridled creativity. - I recommend you play with headphones for full immersion.As a whole, I loved this game.The storyline was surprisingly refreshing - it's odd how stereotypical visions have a tendency to creep up on your subconscious, grab you by the heels and shout 'Gotcha!' even when you think you have them equalled.- Short and sweet. My only complaint to be that it could have been a little longer, though there is an epilogue that I also recommend playing through.SO many cuddles for Teddy.If you have a few hours to spare, I suggest trying out Among the Sleep.

												I can recommend this game, but be aware of three things:a) other than playing as a small child, this game doesn't do much of note and doesn't really expand the genre in any wayb) I'm not a big fan of horror games, so you might walk away from this less satisfied than mec) it's not worth its current asking price (19.99 euros)This was a nice experience, but it is very short for that price (even if a longer game would surely outstay its welcome). When it costs 10 dollars or around 6 euros, that's when I can say ""Go For It"". I was one of the Kickstarter backers, and I can't say I quite got my money's worth - but I'm happy to have helped out a starting, young indie dev team.			"

												Only an hour or so into the game but already enjoying it, its nice to see a new take on the horror genre.Most new horror games make you feel vulnerable by doing the same thing of taking away any weapons, which doesn't always make sense as you normally play as a adult character who should be able to pickup a pipe and use it to defend themselves. This has always annoyed me slightly as you feel forced into being vulnerable even though in real life the chances are you would find a weapon to defend yourself. In this game however, you play a 2 year old toddler so it makes sense to not give you weapons etc and it makes a nice change to know that in real life a toddler probably wouldn't be able to defend itself very well.Even though I'm yet to complete the game I'm already in love with it and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh take on the horror genre.

The story and atmosphere were splendid.If you are a fan of intelligent game design and horror gaming, you should definitely give this one a try! This one left me grasping for air, just as much as it made me d'aww! 5/5			"

												I should sleep.  Somewhere among the sleep is me, half awake and bufuddled.  The barely awake dad who has to see what is terrifying my 2 year old at 3AM.  Those dark hallways with toys everywhere, been there. *You* try walking through that minefield of balls, dolls, and wooden blocks.  But I've seen the terror in thier eyes, tears falling and crying out frantically for someone to make them feel safe again.  And in no other game has it ever been recreated with such clarity.In this game you are two years old again.  Toddling long.  Crawling is faster.  Exploring the hidden world that always seems foreboding.  Mundane objects take on a menacing appearance, unknown sounds all the more spine chilling.  And also in this game, there is a tone of something else.  Alcohol bottles strewn across the floor.  Refridgerator doors left wide open.  In the world of Among the Sleep you must traverse the completely believeable household universe of two year old terror.  Gameplay is mostly interacting with objects, some simple puzzles.  You travel through some toddler nightmare lands collecting items to fit in a slot, or solving a way to smash open a toy chest.  Then a bit of cat and mouse chases with a monster that looms nearby, searching for you.  Seeking you out all the time.  Visually, it's quite well done and a lot of attention to game detail with shadow and specific uses of color.  I played with both a KB&M and Controller, both work very well.  No in game crashes for me and I never got stuck on geometry or bugs.  I have to add, that although this is a horror game, you are limited the horror of a two year old.  It's not a gorefest of a demon infested graveyard waiting for you, it's a  playground with ledges and hiding holes, spooky libraries, or being chased in a coat closet.  These are familiar areas to most of us and it may or may not frighten you.  I would say for those who cannot endure most horror games, this is substanially less anxiety causing.  Perhaps with some, it may hit a few heartstrings which you will discover later towards the end.The game is a story more than anything.  Not a visual novel or a game with lots of in-game dialogue, but a storytelling nonetheless.  And at the end, you'll see what the true terror is that plagues our little character.  The full game is a little short. After I was done I played the DLC which is also short where you save your plush toys from the cold, but a little scarier than the main game.  Among the sleep is a good game, a gamble really in this age of horror games.  And it's well done.   At $20 I personally think that it's pricey.  I got this in a bundle, though, and think it was money well spent.Forgot to add - in the kitchen I spent a good bit of time destroying everything I could get my little hands on.  Wreaking the dishes and lobbing a coffee maker off the counter was bliss. Destruco-Toddler skill points +10.  Cheers.			"

												What a scary game! It was all going well at the beginning: I spotted a weird shadow and those coats were a bit scary, but they didn’t do anything. So I thought, okay, it looks like this game will be scary, but there won’t be anything to hurt me. Oh boy, was I wrong. When I had my first encounter with the monster, I almost had a heart attack. I was hiding under the shelves for about half an hour trying to find the courage to continue. I’m such a wuss when it comes to horror games, which is funny because I love horror games. But I faced my fears and succeeded. After that, the monster didn’t scare me anymore and I learned how to use the game sounds to my advantage to know when it was close. The Prologue DLC also gives a nice insight on the story.			"

												An amazing game, it wins the creepiness trophy! Play it in the dark with headphones and a controller, don't waste it.It's a horror adventure game, you'll have to find your way, find items and often have to hide. If things get too rough, hug your teddy and squeeze him hard as he'll light your way :) There's child drawings to collect along the way and 10 achievements to make. The game is divided in chapters and you can choose to replay any chapter in the main menu. The save system is a bit odd: if you quit the game you'll have to restart on your latest chapter but within the game there's a lot of checkpoints. The game lasted approximately 6 hours. There's no replay to it though, unless you want to find all the hidden drawings.This game have an amazing atmosphere, graphics are okay - simple but effective - you see the world through a child's eyes so the objects and the textures are simples, the colors very saturated and everything look huge. They did a great job on the sounds and the music.This game is a small gem, go play it now! Wait.... what's that behind you?			"

												I completed this game in about 117 minutes so this is not the longest game, doesn't have much replayability.However the game has pretty great atmosphere and the later chapters (6 chapters in all) are genuinely creepy. I experienced a huge amount of clipping here and there, as well as some glitches that almost broke the game in Chapter 5. The story is great. It's simplistic but takes some effort to actually put together. The other realm is heavily symbolic and for the story alone I recommend taking a look at it. However for the $20 price tag then it's a hit or miss.If you are picking up this title then I recommend to take in the environment and try to analyze its symbolism as there is huge amounts of it in here.

												A very interesting idea. And when you get right down to it, can be deep. If you pay attention to all the small details, you can really get a idea what really is going on before the ending. It has its odd moments, but what game does not.  But overall it can be scary at times and the ending can make you think.I will say there needs to more games like this to show what things a child can go through and how important you are to the child when you are a parent. In this case, make or break a child.I hope to see more of this kind of stuff in the future. A job well done.			"

												Among the Sleep appeared as a pretty standard sort of horror game. Loud sounds, jumpscares, woohoo. Surprising it was to play something as refreshing as this. The story stuck me particularly strongly, which through the course of the game, dulled my senses to the horror elements (If you're very observant, you'll figure it all out before you get to the end). This was personally was a good thing. I jump-scare easily and find it annoying when it becomes a game's main gimmick. Not here; awesome game, folks; kudos. I'd not mind playing through this another time tonight just to see what I missed from the first time around.			"

												Shortest game ever made!This game will take you roughly 1 to 2 hours to complete, literally.  A massive majority of people are completing it in under 2hours.  So bare that in mind when looking at the price.The graphics are really nice and well done.The sounds are really great, spot on and creepy.The controls are so easy and simple to get used too, you really cannot complain.The game contains some really nice features, like the ability to open and close doors, pick stuff up, carry the teddy, crawl around and underneath stuff, and even look at the floor when walking and see the toddlers stomach and hands move.  It really has some nice features added to the game.The game is also really scary on many parts.  I streamed my content with this game and enjoyed all 2 hours of this game before completing. There are some really great scary parts, which you really do not expect.  I thought Outlast was the scariest game ever played and I am now having doubts and thinking this, because I am a 26year old grown man and this game made me jump and scream like a girl on some really silly but odd parts.I even got jumped at coats on a coat rack because the shape and style looked like a ghost or monster or whatever you want to call it.  So the game has that fear factor and good fun for this.Is the game worth the £13.49 -10% right now as I write this review or the full £14.99 price after the promotion.... Erm to me I think no!I brought this game hoping for so much more game time and play, to find I completed it in under 2hours and it has no real replay value, is like a massive shock.Really, wait for a deal on this game to buy, and I know it is not really supporting the developers but then we could say, well do not charge overprice for a 2hours extended demo game.I played the demo and it scared me and thought wow, I will buy.  I brought it the moment it hit the store, installed and thought I have time to play some before I go out so I played 2hours and was complete and really annoyed and let down.  £14.99 + 2hours = Annoyed. The price being asked is not worth the time it needs.  As soon as the game goes on sale for below 50% then buy it instantly.  If you see a 75% off sale on this game, you would be a fool to miss it, but right now full price no!			"

												Among The Sleep disappointed me in many ways. First, we were promised that the game would last up to 3 hours. I finished it in 90 minutes. In the end I can't blame no one but myself. If a developer says it's this big, it's usually a couple of hours shorter. My bad. Second, we were told this would be a horror game, but it didn't scare me for one second, even if some of the chases creeped me out.So there's that, and the fact that there isn't much exploration to do, and if you do find things that pique your interest they usually can't be interacted with.But, there are some good things to say about the game. The textures, for example, are sharp and the graphics are, at times, colorful, Something you don't see very often in horror games. The voice acting is also pretty good and the way that you see things through the eyes of a 2 year old is different (it has a bit of a fisheye effect) and well done. Pressing escape is also a cute way to bring up the menu. And running for too long will make you fall on your hands and feet. Small little details that I can always appreciate, no matter if the game is good or bad. The story is actually pretty good, too. Good, but predictable.But... I just can't recommend this. I would absolutely recommend this if it cost €10 or less, but asking twice as much is outrageous for a game that can be finished in one sitting. To be honest... I feel a bit ripped off. And that's not a feeling that I have very often. So my advice would to be to wait for a sale. Just give it a few weeks/months.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												This game was one of the best horror games I played. I don't understand why some criticize the game.Positives:1. It's scary in the usual sense, but also in a different way.2. The message behind this game runs deeper and more emotional, and it hit me a little.3. I love the mechanics of hiding and running. It brings suspense and horror to the player, and I like that.4. Cutscenes are well animated.5. Environments are very eery and creepy.Negatives:1. This is minor, but I think the teddy bear would have much more personality if it moved his mouth when talking, and having different emotions visible on the face.2. Have more levels and monsters.3. Game is a tad too short, but this is a minor thing as well, because exploration in the game is encouraged.I would recommend this game to anyone, and I hope this company makes more games like this in the future, and maybe other companies can follow. 9.5/10.

												This is a really interesting exploration of childhood trauma in a couple of phases:Initially you are exploring the house and new areas, solving simple puzzles with no particular peril - and to be honest, all that really kept me going were the cleverly designed and interesting areas to explore (put me in mind of the Void for sort of eerie). It then sort of evolves into an Amnesia style avoid the monster, with the identity and nature of the monster becoming clearer and clearer. It's not a very good 'jump scare' game (though I think it tries really really hard to be one) but I still enjoyed it once I got going, and at the end. It certainly made me feel and think. I bought it on sale and that feels fair... I completed it in about 2 hours (having to redo an entire area because of annoying save system though...). If you're interested in the above, I recommend. I think reading the negative reviews, people perhaps missed the point of the game and the type of horror it represents.  "

												When I played the demo, I thought the game looked good enough to try out. After playing for a bit, I started getting...comfortable. I truly believed that the entire game was just creepy music/atmosphere and jump scares...no big deal. They even get slightly predictable, but I was still enjoying the atmosphere and puzzles. Suddenly, the creepy, distant monster that pops up occasionally was actually attacking me! The game lulled me into a false sense of security and then yanked that security away. The noises that came out of me were created by sheer panic.I've played a wide variety of horror games and this is definitely worth giving a shot!			"

												Playing as a toddler is Among the Sleep's obvious draw. I thought it was clever inversion that crawling makes you go faster (anyone who's interacted with toddlers knows this is true, too). The visuals all based on how a 2-year old interprets the world makes for some a fantastic and creepy atmosphere.The game is short, but I think it needed to be. Any longer and it would've overstayed its welcome.I recommend getting it, if only for its uniqueness. It's woth buying on a discount like it is as of this writing. "

It's a horror game with a 2-year old protaganist, so naturally there's fairly disturbing content and concepts in the game. I felt the designers did an excellent job of portraying the child-like perspective of the protaganist, and the locatons & settings were just theright mixture of creepy & surreal without ever going over the top.

												First, the bad: its short. Even with the free DLC extra chapter, its short... like under 4 hours short. There is not a ton of replay value unless you get drawn into the story and want to go back to see little meta-clues and child-drawings you missed. The couple of graphical glitches, overlapping lighting through doors, odd seeing through objects at odd angles... not bad honestly, and definitely not game-breaking.The good: this is a rather well told dark story, and seeing it explored through the body of a 2-yr old child is a very unique approach to telling it. Your adult-brain logic being used to guide the character through the puzzles and tale aside, they've done quite a good job of making you feel like you're interacting through a toddler. As a small child you are clumsy, slow, very poorly armed and armored against the shadows that crawl along the walls and roar out through the dark... your only defense is to hide and find comfort in the warmth in your teddybear guide and traveling companion.There are a few jumpscares, but absolutely no gore... this game uses nothing but unease, shadows and noises, the surreality of childhood nightmares and exagerations, and the inherent helplessness of your character as the basis for it's horror. A significant part of the entire storyline involves some well written emotional manipulation; if you play these kinds of games in any sort of emersive mind-set (or you're just kinda over-emotional like I can be), you will get a far greater experience from this game. You'll be motivated to help the child through this journey, feel afraid of the creepiness of this world, and seeing the tale through the end will feel rather moving in bad and good ways... potentially triggery ways, depending on your own childhood...If you don't do emersive gaming, if you dont allow yourself to play these kinds of games as if you were nervous about the surroundings, if you just plow through these kinds of hide-from-the-monster horror games... this will be a short game with not much meat on it, and you will likely feel more dissapointed than profound.Recommended to purchase on sale. Despite the effort and atmosphere that obviously went into the game, the full price of $20 is just a little bit steep for the length.			"

			Among the Sleep Developed and Published by Krillbite Studio Among the Sleep is a first person horror from the perspective of a two year old.		

This game does a wonderful job at making you feel like a 2 year old.  Everything is scarier as a rugrat, when not only are you defenseless, but you've only just recently learned how to walk.  The game itself keeps you on edge, timing each new threat perfectly, and keeping it interesting.			"

												This is actually the first game I willingly purchased on Steam and I don't regret it. Between the atmosphere, gameplay, and storyline, i loved every minute of Among The Sleep. The creepy noises had my heart racing at times and it's been a while since a game has triggered any form of anxiety for me. All in all, I highly recommend playing. Among The Sleep provides a completely new outlook in terms of ""horror survival"" by placing you in big, scary world as a small, defenseless child.			"

Pros:        good voice acting        very nice graphics        good controls        decent story        Teddy is done really wellcons        very short, leaves you wanting more to exploreoverall 9/10 only because of the length of the game			"

												Brilliant throughout, even if the game stumbles in the polishing department (it's occasionally glitchy) , it doesn't detract from the overall experience.Equal parts adorable, petrifying and just downright depressing, Among the Sleep is unlike anything I've ever played, and manages to say a lot in it's brief 2 hour campaign.It's definitely worth a play, and if you can't justify the current price tag due to it's short length, then wait untill it's 50 - 75% off.Horror fans and people just looking for great story should feel right at home with Among the Sleep.

												Very cool game. It's not the typical horror game considering you're playing a toddler, which gives it a nice little twist. I loved the story, and the ending scene was fantastic.. it wasn't what I was expecting! This whole game was brilliantly made and a lot of thought went in to it. The game's ""scary-ness"" definitely increased the farther you got into the game.To give you an idea of what you do in the game, you explore areas trying to uncover the secrets of what happened to the toddler's mom. You explore different ""zones"", and your objective is to basically collect pieces of the puzzle (items) while hiding from monsters.However, the game itself is very short. I finished the whole game in maybe 4 hours, and that was me taking my time. I also think it's overpriced ($15) considering how short it is. I would recommend getting it whenever it's on sale. But other than that, the game was great! It had a great story, it was creepy and scary, and it wasn't difficult to play. I recommend trying it!			"

												Very original idea, great story, creepy and possibly my new favourite game. My only complaint is that it isn't long enough. The puzzles are easy and I usually prefer them to be harder, but they are perfect for this game and don't pull you out of the story like some of the more frustrating ones in other games do. I've been obsessed with all things horror since I was a kid, so it generally takes a lot to creep me out, but this game did. I know a lot of folks will disagree, but for me this was probably the creepiest game I've ever played. I think a big part of that is the shadow creatures you encounter, a lot of horror games (and movies) often lose that creepy atmosphere for me once the monster is revealed because I often find them too cheesy, but this game really plays on the fear of the unknown in that and many other ways.This game also did an amazing job of making me feel like I was the character, which is not easy since you play as a 2 year old. The atmosphere it creates had me on edge the whole time, so I was hiding under every bed and thinking just about everything was the legs or feet of a creature while I was under there. On top of this you crawl faster than you walk, you have to drag and climb on objects to reach door handles, hugging your teddy bear companion provides a light source, etc. A must play for anyone into atmospheric horror in my opinion. 10/10 and I really hope Krillbite will expand on this game further and/or release more survival horror in the future.

												Among the Sleep is an eerie exploration game with light puzzle elements.  The hook is you play as a toddler, embarking through a dream/nightmare world to find your missing mother.  The dev did a nice job with the toddler aspect.  For example you crawl faster than you walk, your companion is a teddy bear, and everything that looks interesting is maddeningly out of reach.  The puzzles are simple fetch quests, but they too are filled with things from the world of a 2 year old that make them endurable even though it’s a bit boring at times.  You will play shape fit games, search for jigsaw pieces, explore through playground equipment and perform many other tot friendly activities as you make your way through the adventure till the surprising ending.  While the toddler elements make Among the Sleep interesting and worth playing, the gameplay is little more than a walking errr make that crawling simulator without any real scares.  You will occasionally avoid the ""Fear"" that is chasing you, mostly by hiding, which can be creative at times, but other than that it’s a linear and simple affair.  More creepy than scary, a decent play when you have a few hours to kill one dark evening and want to try a different spin on a ""horror"" game.  Sometimes the real “fear” in life lies where you would least expect it.			"

												This game is honestly terrifying at times, the atmosphere itself sets it apart from other horror games. I won't go into too much detail as I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone planning to play Among the Sleep, but I♥♥♥♥♥♥myself when the forest ♥♥♥♥♥ got involved. That's something straight out of a nightmare. I'm pretty certain a lot of the horrors the toddler is going through are due to his mother. During the early stages of my playthrough, I was certain I heard her having sex in the next room. So far the puzzle aspects of the game are pretty simple but when it's combined with such an enthralling environment and a great story, it's easy to look past those things and enjoy it for what it is. An awesome game and at the time of writing this review, my favourite in the First-Person Horror genre.			"

												Among the Sleep‘s short two-to-three hour run-time includes some great ideas and design, but the overall experience feels lacking. Lacking in the terms of scares, most of all. I’m all for a slow buildup until things really start to become chaotic and terrifying, but some of the game’s best moments occur in the last half hour. The ending of the game is worth giving some notable praise, though, as I did not see it coming and it’s pretty effective in its message.All in all, Among the Sleep is a tad disappointing but far from mediocre. It also shows a lot of promise on the part of Krillbite Studios and their talented staff. For their breakout title, funded through limited Kickstarter funds, I’m impressed and anxiously await their next project.full review: http://www.relyonhorror.com/reviews/review-among-the-sleep "

YouTube™ Video: Teddy Ruxpin - Roulette's Play: Among the Sleep Part 1 - Let's Play Adventure Horror ( Steam ) 

			Views: 776		

			That Teddy has to be up to no good.. Something about him just makes me not trust him.. I think it was the tone of his voice when we were in the closet or maybe his second laugh that sounded vaguely...		

Among the Sleep is beautifully done, especially since they used the Unity engine. Bear is innocently creepy. A++ would footy-jammies again.+ World is engaging and engrossing in atmosphere.+ Music and audio is haunting and well done.+ Voice acting is believable and not over-acted/campy+ The art style is very pleasing to the eye and mystical, though can be cartoony at times (which could be offputting for some)-/+ Amnesia like controls which while better here than in those games can feel clunky at times and cause you to not do the actions you mean to, but does make the game more immersive. - Once in a while a frame here or there will drop or a collision detection error will go off, but nothing game breaking- Puzzles can be feel too easy at times, but the ease prevents breaking the flow of the game as well. but some like a challenge.This game is definitely worth playing especially when caught on sale, but can be a bit short!

												Among the Sleep is a good game. However, it is not for everyone. The game has good atmosphere, an intriguing story and is well put together. The only thing I want to complain about is the norwegian translation, which is irrelevant if you're not norwegian anyways. There is still a lot of dialog, both in the main game and dlc, that is not translated. This is mainly when the  mom is talking in the background, or the doll at the end of the dlc.  It's not that big of a deal, but it is something that annoyed me some what. The game is rather short, and I bought in on sale. If you really need a game that has great atmosphere and a story, its definitely worth the money, but if you're not that desperate, you should probably buy it at a sale.			"

												Definitely worth the buy if on sale. As many have said, the story is actually rather short. I find the psychology behind it, though, absolutely intriguing. Seeing the world and events thus following through the eyes of a child truly does pose new questions. Influence is a powerful thing. The message/purpose behind the game was indeed enlightening and such a great adventure, ending on a serious note of concern.If you are a fan of Amnesia, SOMA, or games of the like where you must explore a rich story in light of dark and mysterious atmospheres, I definitely would pick up a copy. Though with the campaign being so short, catching it on sale would be recommended:P Great game though! Definitely worth a playthrough or two simply from the imaginative perspective.			"

												I'm a little bit mixed.This was a very short game (~2hr or less, I don't know how you could spend 3hr unless you died a ♥♥♥♥ ton. I died the most from, ""Hey, I'm going to swim, hohkay?""). More could have been done with the world they created and the puzzles could be a lot more challenging. The final stage itself is completely expoitable.Aside from that, It's graphically beautfiul with solid, reasonably realistic game mechanics. The underlaying theme tries true to real life and I always dig looking from a different perspective (even though it's painfully obvious what it would be). All in all, a good play-through.			"

Title: Among the SleepGenre:  Action, Adventure, IndieDeveloper:  Krillbite StudioPublisher: Krillbite StudioRelease Date: 29th May 2014TL;DR, VerdictReally interesting premise for a horror game. Takes camera away from you a lot so motion sickness can be an issue. Worth the play if you want something a little different from typical horrors.*Note as a motion sickness gamer I will keep trying to play this game because I do like it.* P.S : this game made sure I looked suspicious  to my teddy ProsGood voice actingGood atmosphere and soundsBright, contrasting environments for your main character, the sort of colours you expect to see in a small child's roomConsIf you have video game motion sickness, don't play this Gameplay This game focuses on a toddler's view of the world, and how their active imagination distorts things and makes things more unsettling. You start off looking into the bottom of a glass, except the effect is confusing - just like how a toddler must feel when interacting with so many new objects and unfamiliar environments. The music in the background and the mother's crooning voice makes the game unnerving for something that everyone does to their children. The screen sometimes shakes and despite the normal settings of the game, ordinary things are made more nightmarish by your baby's first person viewpoint and way of looking at the world. Almost everything can have a sinister undertone to it. When you have full control of the baby you prefer to crawl around for speed rather than walk, and you interact with the objects and environment around you. And the teddy bear.The voice acting is quite good, the speakers to your baby all use that special voice  reserved for small children or cute animals.  You're not sure if your teddy bear is evil or not. He makes you hide in a dark closet, and you have to hug the teddy to “light” up the area, and make it less scary. Except it doesn't work out like that. The voice acting and noises help to make a perfectly normal environment scarier than it should be, as if your character is isolated and alone in their world. And mother is a potential enemy. And teddy is either your last resort or your worst friend. I like the fact this game really plays on the feeling of a kid's active imagination. Monsters in the dark, sounds you don't recognise, everything being exaggerated out of proportion.I struggled to keep playing this game though I liked it. It's not a good game for those who suffer from video game motion sickness.Liked this review and want to read more of my reviews?

												A good horror game leaves the player feeling powerless in the face of something truly horrifying, so how much more powerless can you get than playing as a toddler? With amazing atmosphere and a true sense of dread throughout, Among the Sleep is an amazing horror experience that any fan of the genre should traverse.			"

												Among the Sleep is a good game. However, it is not for everyone. The game has good atmosphere, an intriguing story and is well put together. The only thing I want to complain about is the norwegian translation, which is irrelevant if you're not norwegian anyways. There is still a lot of dialog, both in the main game and dlc, that is not translated. This is mainly when the  mom is talking in the background, or the doll at the end of the dlc.  It's not that big of a deal, but it is something that annoyed me some what. The game is rather short, and I bought in on sale. If you really need a game that has great atmosphere and a story, its definitely worth the money, but if you're not that desperate, you should probably buy it at a sale.			"

												Definitely worth the buy if on sale. As many have said, the story is actually rather short. I find the psychology behind it, though, absolutely intriguing. Seeing the world and events thus following through the eyes of a child truly does pose new questions. Influence is a powerful thing. The message/purpose behind the game was indeed enlightening and such a great adventure, ending on a serious note of concern.If you are a fan of Amnesia, SOMA, or games of the like where you must explore a rich story in light of dark and mysterious atmospheres, I definitely would pick up a copy. Though with the campaign being so short, catching it on sale would be recommended:P Great game though! Definitely worth a playthrough or two simply from the imaginative perspective.			"

												It's a trippy game, where you play the subjective experience of a traumatized child. I like it a lot! Too bad my recorder stopped working during maybe the coolest part of the game, where you explore the very creepy house at night, scared of the dark and every sound, while looking for your mom. Anyway this is a small compilation of my first two hours of gameplay.

												One of the most unique game concepts to come along in recent years. Sure, it borrows heavily off games like Amnesia, but making the protagonist a toddler is definitely new territory. It's not particularly challenging except when it comes to avoiding enemies in certain areas. Also, the vantage point of crawling can make things confusing in dark areas and sometimes seems unclear about what direction to go in. Luckily, most of the levels are not too big. Plus, th ereveal in the end hits you right in the feels.Definitely recommend, although it's not a game that lends itself to repeated plays.			"

												Among the Sleep has great atmosphere, story, and suspense, as well as some interesting subtext about viewing the world through the eyes of a two year old. As story games go it is more of a short story than a novel, with five main levels - which I finished in around two hours - and not a lot of replay value once you've seen the ending. One of those games that I think you'll enjoy more the less you know going into it, but a lot of the best parts are given away in the trailer. Those minor caveats aside, I still enjoyed and recommend it.Also, while it says ""full controller support,"" it seems Xbox One controllers are currently not supported. After switching to a 360 controller it worked fine.			"

												I purchased this game on the 2K15 holiday sale. It looked well made, and the story seemed unique. Well, it was. The gameplay was truly terrifying. Loud and grainy sounds, bangs, screetches, mixed with running/hiding scenarios. It also had casual and interesting puzzle solving. In my opinion, the graphics were great. I did experience some stuttering, but it didn't occur enough to make the game unplayable. Finally, the story. I won't spoil anything, but I have never played an indie game with such an emotional story as this one. I was speechless.If you didn't see the check, I'll tell you.

												Absolutely the best indie/horror/adventure game I have played. Next to Amnesia, I should say. Not only terrifying, but you solve puzzles as a young child would. Since you are not so tall, (For being a child.) you have to move things around to climb, walk, and get past. You have the abilities as of a small child, which hold you back at doing things like you would in most horror games.Which makes this game all the more realistic.Though I did encounter a few problems, which I shall list:- When the ""infinte"" drawer goes through the first hole, it hits the box and then gets stuck inside the wall. Making it so it can't move. (Which has been fixed now. Thankfully! ^.^ )- When I tried to go back to another chapter, the game would crash and I would have to keep trying until It did it without problems.- The game sometimes froze in the menu. In-game, however, I had no issues whatsoever.- At one point, during the part with the second Merry go round, I picked up the bird staue, and it doesnt move. I had to restart from the last checkpoint, which was quite a ways back.Other than the listed bugs I found, the game is absolutely perfect. Because of the bugs, I give it a 9/10.			"

												I found this game called ""Among the sleep"" on sale for 3,75. Anyway thie game is really fun and creepy but not hide under your covers scary. You are a small baby who turns two at the start of the game. You find out your mothers gone. Which will send you on a quest to find her through the strangest of places. You have you trust worthy companion Teddy who will keep you save and provide light where no light can be found. The camara angle was lowered to the height of the baby to show how vaulnable and inferior he is to the objects around him. The baby will also sometimes fall as his feable legs cant support the weight of the baby,so you can also crawl which is faster. This game is menecing and has a vexing story but yet again I would not say really scary.Drawbacks-The game is very short not worth the money of 15 bucks unless you really,really want it. The story will get boring if played again (no alternative ending).7 out of 10 Loved it!			"

Among The SleepThis review was last edited when I had completed the gameShort ReviewA decent horror adventure game that built up a good atmosphere and was at times genuinely frightening. It's ""unique"" slant was that you play through the eyes of a toddler making the perspective and movement very different to usual.Long ReviewYou play as a toddler that has to wander through your dreams, rendered in 3D, looking for four memories that will allow you a way out. You are accompanied of your travels by your teddy who offers advice and can cast light if hugged. You traverse the adventure in a fairly linear fashion, with a few of puzzles to solve, but nothing too difficult, and some monsters to avoid but death is a minor inconvenience in this game as you are restart at the last save and there are frequent background saves made throughout the adventure.The initial section is played whilst you are awake and allows you to get the gist of the controls and understand the mechanics of the gameplay.The are another four levels to make your way through, each taking around 30 minutes to an hour to complete. Each level has its own theme and all of them are hauntingly rendered. It is worth noting the ending is very good too.I can't see any replay value in the game unless you want the achievementsProsGenuinely frightening at timesVery atmosphericThe perspective of seeing things from a child's eyes, much closer to ground level that you would normally experienced worked for meConsBecame a bit grindy at times when I kept going over the same ground again and again to spot a clue I'd missed.The scariness dwindled once the same scene was repeated several timesMarks Out Of 55) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away freeWhere I got the game fromI bought this game from  Humble Bundle [www.humblebundle.com]Platform Played OnIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse & Steelseries MERC keyboard.

												Short, fairly simple 1st person adventure game with the gimmick that you are a toddler.  Kinda vague ending, not sure if my interpretation of what happens is correct (although the prologue chapter, which I played last, kinda confirms).  Sort of a baby's first Amnesia: TDD (pun somewhat intended).  Worth an afternoon, probably much more intense in VR if that's an option (and it seems like it should be).			"

The fact that there's zero replayability only pushes the knife further.Wait for it to go on sale for under $10. Just because this was a kickstarter project doesn't make it an excuse to make you pay this much.EDIT: It's $15 now, but it's still very little content for the asking price.			"

												Toddler Simulator 2014. Quite outdated graphics, but the story is quite unique. You are playing a 2 year old Max Payne without guns and bullet time. Seriously, if a 2 year old could climb like this, making your house child-safe would cost a whole new set of furniture that is not even invented yet. Anyhow, it's quite short, it took me 2 nights to see the ending scene. If you have a kid yourself, I definitly recommend to buy it - there are lot of emotions being transported and you might want to reflect on it a bit (not included in the download). Still, you might want to wait for it being on sale. If you are not a parent, you might rather want to spend your money on another a-broken's-man-payback-shooter-story again - not saying that's a bad thing.			"

This review contains a couple of mere spoilers. Among the Sleep has a very impressive affect on the player. It shows the great idea that only a genius could think of - using the perspective of a baby. Throughout this baby perspective, we can clearly notice that the baby has worries over many things like their mother's scream. At the beginning of the game, the character's mother goes to answer the door that had just had the doorbell ring. The mother then screams which queues the music and visual effects to give a dramatic effect. This happens to show that the baby feels stressed and panicked as though the mother is giving a distress call - an in-danger tone. I find this is a very creative idea and the creator really understands how emotion is built up in a game. After seeing the monster, I have a slight lust of disappointment, for as soon as a monster is shown in a game, that ruins the horror element of a build up. No studios are able to create a monster that is more horrifying that what we, as consumers, create in our head from mysterious build-ups, such as lighting effects and creaky floorboards. As soon as a monster is shown in a game, it automatically drops some tension and makes the player less scared of the monster. This game has lost the horrific momentum by showing the monster, and the monster doesn't look very scary, but I guess there are limits as to how scary you can make a monster look. And to be quite straight... what is a monster? A monster is a horrific creature or person that is created IN OUT HEADS by dramatic effects and noises. Making a monster be shown in a game really doesn't make it a monster anymore. The teddy bear's voice acting and sounds are very good. The sound effects successfully create tension and the teddy bear successfully sounds like a Paedophile - I mean a nice friend.  In addition, the animations of movement in the game are very smooth, however are a little slow and... the opposite of slick. Whatever that word is. As far as I can judge on the game mechanics, they are quite simple and not all that amazing. Animations for the things the character uses are very simple and could be improved through more time in development. I do believe this game has a really good story line, really good twists and successfully shows the in-depth perspective of a baby in every-day situations. Among the Sleep shows a definite prime example of what a baby would think about as they go to sleep on a dark, windy night. It shows how the baby is petrified and shows how simple things are over-exaggerated in the baby's mind, such as a wardrobe. Overall, I think this game really is worth the play and if you don't play this game, you'd be missing out on a lot of interesting perspective. "

												[NO SPOILERS]For the love of god, do not spend $20 on this game.Visuals (8/10)Sound (6/10)Gameplay (4/10)Storyline (5/10)Replay value (none)This one belongs in the horror genre as much as Goat Simulator. You get a few shock scares, but all in all it's a puzzle game with a dark setting. The terror vibe wears out about 30 mins in and never comes back. I'll admit that the idea of the main character being a 2-year old with their teddy interested me enough to buy the game and although I enjoyed some parts, I regret buying Among the Sleep.One play-through is only between 2-3 hours; waaay too short for the price. The graphics lag a bit in certain areas but it's not too bad. The redeeming factor of this game are the visuals. Very well-done, except for the mom's face. Sounds are kind of repetitive, but nothing to get real mad about.What I did get mad about was the fact that I paid $20 for a 3 hour game that doesn't get you on the edge of your seat. I was disappointed with this title, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. How sad :(------[SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT]-----The play time is about 2-3 hours depending on how much you run/walk. Initially it's more intuitive to walk than run because you don't know what the game is all about. After about 30 minutes you realize there's no real backlash to being caught by the monster and you run through everything. This is where the game lost me.First of all, it reveal what the monster looks like waaaay too early. In fact, they shouldn't have ever done that considering the short play time. after it's revealed you lose all sense of this game being the least bit frightening. Aside from a few instances where you actually have to hide from the monster to avoid the harsh penalty [sarcasm] of starting almost exactly where you were caught with no progress rewind, there's no real 'horror-value'. There is only 1 event where you have to consider not just plowing through the map. Bottles on top of blocks that summon the monster if they fall? Brilliant, I love it! Showing every bit of what happens during that scene in your teaser trailer? Moronic.The end scene has a bit of redeming factors in that we're taken for a loop to find out our once loving mother is actually an abusive alcoholic stuggling with the idea of continuing on as a single parent. Lovely. That, combined with the recent dismemberment of best friend Teddy, we've basically witnessed the making of a potential psychopath. Maybe the sequel will have us mass murdering 1st graders! The possibilities are endless.Buy this game if you have money to burn.			"

												Unfortunalely I think that the alpha provided a far better overall experience than this game did, which was really disappointing. It is adequate with a few sub-par and above-par moments, but overall I wouldn't recommend it, which is a real shame.I'd have had absolutely no problem with the length of the game if it was executed really really well, but as it stands, it is adequate. A game so short should either leave me wanting more or have me satisfied, not have me want less.			"

												Honestly, Among the Sleep is captivating on many levels. I personally love horror games and while this game definitely had its moments of jump scare, it was nothing like other games in the genre (Amnesia or Outlast just to name a few), but considering the powerful story they tell perhaps its good they aren't like the others. The subtle way the writers work in real adult issues in the eyes of a 2 year old is impressive, as well as scary. The story reaches a depth that I sometimes don't see in a game with 60 hours worth of campaign, and deserves a lot of credit for it. The game takes you through a fantastic story that leaves you exposed and vulnerable. Definitely a great Indie story in a mild horror game.PROLOGUE:The prologue is a short add on to clear up part of the story that a lot of people might not have picked up on in the original game alone. Neither of your parents are perfect.			"

												As much as I wanted to like this, I found myself wishing for the end of the game and given that it's a short game anyway, that's not so good.  Whilst there are some well done / clever moments and the designer did a great job of making the change of perspective into something that was a little overwhelming and scary, the experience was more of a walking (crawling?) simulator with a rather overblown story.  For a horror, it was more creepy than scary and the 'monsters' were very much more of an irritant that something to fear.  This was partly due to the poor AI presenting very little challenge, but also grinding visual and audio effects that made me want to go brew a cuppa whilst I waited for them to pass.Similarly, puzzles were unchallenging - pretty much 'pull this to free this' and 'move this then jump on it', wrapped up in fetch quests.  Not that other horror games don't do unchallenging, but Among the Sleep isn't distracting you with the anticipation of terrifying things happening.  There are plenty of pretty bits, some very nice alice moments and the aforementioned change of perspective, but it's just not enough.  Not at fifteen quid a go.			"

												First off, I want to say that I kind of feel bad giving this game a thumbs down for its review. I wish there was a more dynamic grading scale than yes/no.That being said, my biggest complaint is that this game essentially puts all of its eggs in one basket. The one point in which this game really excels is its visual effects. This game does an amazing job of not only providing a creepy horror environment, but it also really gives you a feeling of how an imaginative child may picture the world around him. Especially a child with a morbid imagination. It may not be as perturbing as Silent Hill's blood, rust and isolating fog, but the abyss surrounding the playground and the overgrown nature of the library really helps give the player a feeling of uncertainty and vulnerability. In other games the abyss would be viewed as ""I guess they put an invisible wall there, 'cause the objective's over that way."" but this game is in a unique position to utilize the idea of object permanence; even if the comparison wasn't intentional.Unfortunately, while I could feasibly recommend playing the game simply for the visual experience, the gameplay and storyline are not on the same level of expertise. The gameplay is not really challenging at all. There's no real danger of being seen or anything just as long as you crawl under something. Even if it's a doorway or a table almost as tall as the monster pursuing the player. I had plenty of times where I was standing in a cupboard, inches away from a pursuing monster who, simply, stood in the doorway until he just...disappeared. As immersive as the environment was, it almost got less interesting once the monsters started showing up...As far as the plot is concerned, the whole game pretty much all builds up to the opening of the sealed portal at the end of the game. There's no real plot advancement outside of progressing from one level to the next until right before the door is opened and the (plot twist?) ending is revealed. It...felt like it was SUPPOSED to be a plot twist, but with the child's drawings littering each level it's not too hard to figure out exactly what's happening. [I'll omit mention of the less obvious hints mentioned in later levels for potential spoiler reasons...although idk if it's worth not spoiling given how telegraphed the ending was.]Overall, my main reason for down voting this game comes down to the price. If it wasn't $20, I would still recommend a purchase for the sake of getting to immerse yourself in the environment (if you're the type of person who can appreciate that stuff). $5 is definitely a reasonable price for this game, but given the lackluster story and...(I apologise in advance) gameplay that will count you AMONG THE SLEEP (ha HAAAAA! Zing!) I'd have to admit that most people would probably find purchasing this game for $20 to be rather disappointing.			"

												I had a lot of hopes for this game, but ultimately I came up short.  The game chooses to move into the surreal very quickly, which I think squanders a lot of the potential for the premise.  Additionally there isn't much in the way of world-building to create suspense and tension, and there are a number of execution issues that prevent the game from ever being scary.  I very much felt like I was simply going through the motions by the end of the game, and as a fan of horror games I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												If you're into horror, this is a good AND original example of the genre.You are a little kid, quickly you are lost in strange worlds, searching for your mom... searching for lost memories.Someone, something is stalking you. Attacking you. You are scared. You must avoid it. You must hide from it.The more you progress in the game, the more you understand the story and its message: the end is pretty, pretty neat.Maybe it's a bit short, count nearly 2 hours to beat the main game. There is a free dlc too. Anyway nice work devs.Now I'm about to try the free dlc, I think it will be good too, I'll edit this evaluation if I have something else to add later.Edit: DLC was fine too, only problem is that if you can't move/look around when using keyboard+mouse verify that the game didn't checked the ""use joystick"" box in options.

												I'm a big horror game fanboy with Frictional games being my favorite studio to produce them. Among the Sleep is a testiment to good gameplay design and level design. Dreamy level design is always so interesting to me as I found myself just enjoying the environment and ""taking it all in"". I don't feel like this game is bad because it is short.  I even didn't see the ending coming, I was too caught up in the moment to see the bigger picture. Now I completely reccomend this to any horror game lover... at a lower price. I was satistfied with the product I recived only because I know DLC is on the way. (I hope more than one). However 20 bucks for an hour at best of gameplay is kinda scary and I know it will turn some people off. I even completed this a couple more times I enjoyed it so much, I can't wait to get a rift and try it out.TL:DR 10/10 floating jackets really coated me in fear.			"

												Among the Sleep (AtS) is an excellent first-person adventure that allows you to play through the eyes of a two year old child. The game is beautiful with great sounds and is clever in execution. Regarded as an Indie title, Krillbite Studios should be proud of the level of polish, detail and thought that was put into creating such a unique game. The only drawback is the price given the game's length and replayability. Still, this title is a must for fans of virtual exploration. It should be noted that the free prologue DLC is unlocked through the in-game menu.			"

It gave me a chance to relax a bit before the real scares happened.  Yes, the price for this game sucks beyond belief but I definitely don't regret buying it.  I really enjoy the story and seeing what's going on with this poor little 2 year old child.  Overall, yes i would definitely recommend this game! (:			"

												There is nothing scarier than being a toddler who's looking for their mum, while crawling through creepy environments that have something wicked lurking in every shadow.It is not often that I find a horror game worthy to be standing tall beside great titles such as Amnesia and Slender, but Among the Sleep is definitely one of those horror games. While the game clearly reveals its Indie roots by having a playtime value of about two hours, depending on how much of a scaredy cat you are, it's dripping with a great concoction of creepy visuals, haunting sounds and eerie music. It has done what many so called horror titles of this day and age fail to do; frighten me. Among the Sleep shines in making you feel like the fragile little child you control, and it's just enough to make your skin crawl as you struggle to open doors and find elaborate ways to climb on top of a drawer.Check it out when you've got the time and cash! This game is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of horror that has the potential to make you soil your pants.			"

												“A child shouldn’t have to go through this.”Wise words from a teddy bear. They’re also spot-on for the situation Among the Sleep’s two year-old protagonist finds himself in, as he’s forced to endure a number of horrors that are both imagined and very real in one of the most original — and refreshing — horror games I’ve played in some time.Among the Sleep is a must-play for any fan of the genre, so long as you can overlook its handful of technical annoyances — almost all of which can be easily remedied with a patch — and immerse yourself in this game’s beautifully realized world.Head on over to Bloody Disgusting for the full review: http://bdisgusting.com/1mSIdpE "

												When I was very young and prone to getting seperated from my parents in department stores I would later have nightmares about hiding in the center of the circular clothing racks, peeking out from under heavy wool coats and suits while monsters sought my tender flesh in the darkness.This is just one of the intense emotional experiences of this game which is painted from every spectrum of emotional palette you can imagine: from the rainbow joy of discovery and exploration as you search for your mother to the black depths of terror and loneliness.This game is not only a masterpiece of survival horror but a poignant piece of storytelling at the same time.  It terrifies on a completely psychological level with a perfect counterpoint of harmonious safety and aesthetically amazing exploration as you get closer to your mother and the end of the tale.This is one of the most intense five hours I've ever spent on a game title and everyone should experience this game no matter what genre of games you are into.

But I had bought it, so I was ready to give this one a try, and thank god I did!!!The game's graphics don't get better, but the story and gameplay makes it that I didn't really care about this. Because the gameplay is cool, no weird or difficult ways to move, just really smooth. Then the puzzles, they are not that hard (if you have imagination ; ) haha) but it's the atmosphere that really makes this a good game! As a composer, music makes or breaks my game experience, and the soundtrack was awesome!!! The sound FX (with subwoofer of course) are thrilling! But I'll try to not spoil your experience by giving to much info here :pThere are 2 things that have to be said, in one of the levels was a bug. But after a restart of this level the bug was gone. And since this game really gets my juices flowing I didn't mind playing it twice! The other one is that it's simply to short!! :p I finisihed this one in one afternoon. But tonight, when it's dark and spooky I'll replay the entire game! So there you go, great game, really worth buying! I'll be waiting for the next one!

												This is what indie gaming is all about IMHO - Experimenting, and art! Yes it is tragically short, yes it is simplistic and fairly linear.  However this means the intensity of the experience is never diluted.  You can relax and know that you will beat this game within 3-4 hours tops.  You will relax and just let the experience wash over you. I treat this game as an interactive movie of sorts, and find it's bite size scope perfect.  The price makes it all the more attractive. This game HAS to be experienced to be appreciated.  No this isn't a bloody, gore fest like Outlast.  No it's not a zombie hunting game.  It is still horrifying in the extreme... When you reach the end you will understand.  This game reminds me a great deal of the Pencil and Paper RPG ""Little Fears"" where players take on the role of children in their early teens or younger (all the way to toddlers like this), in a survival horror environment of just this side of reality supernatural happenings.  I give this game 5 stars, I would totally crap my Diapers again.  Oh, and if you try this game... give the bear an extra hard squeeze for me... By the end of the game I wished I still had me teddy...  "

I will give it merit to be something horror that is also different. For what it sets out to do it do extremely well for an indie game. You play a toddler who live through a horrific time, and all is done with very good production values and design. Control, graphiqs and especially the soundwork ( can't stress this one enough ) are all top notch. A very charismatic experience that deserves to be had. Those who read my reviews know i don't often thumbs up indie games because they often are terrible, but this is not the case here.It's not worth the price of 22$ but if you get it in a sale for 3-4 or even 5$ it will be worth the price.

												Great game. But way too short.Graphics are fine. Could be a little better. But it's still nice to look at.Sound is alright. Some cute sounds here and there. And the atmosphere sounds are done fairly decently.Story is an interesting take on horrors. It's very simple though. Nothing fancy. Kind of leaves you with some questions.Gameplay itself is simple but fun. Though very very easy.But the killer of this game is the price and it's extremely short storyline. You can finish this within an hour to two hours with ease. There is no challenge and the scares are well... not so scary. They are quite simple and predictable. Nothing fancy. So chances are if you're used to horrors, you won't really get much of a scare out of this. The only thing I had was a few jump scares. But there was very little suspense for me.There is not really any replayability either on this. The game had far more potential to really be a powerful game with a deep story, proper scares and indepth gameplay. But sadly this did not happen.But if the game is on sale, buy it if you're looking for a simple short and sweet take on a horror. If I were to rate this out of 10, I'd give it a 5/10.			"

Sometimes too scary, Lighting issues.So yeah. All in all, the Play2Win Aspect pays off, the ending is cool. I got it cuz its fun so yeah! Bye now! "

												One of the most touching, fun and realistic horror game i've ever played. If you're afraid of jumpscares this game is for you. It hasn't got jumpscares and is able to give you the chills. The graphics are really great and the puzzles are making you think. It has the most touching ending i've seen among the horror games. A must play. I almost cried at the end...			"

												Although i do think that the game is a bit short for the price of the game, i truely enjoyed the game. It was thrilling. The kind of game that you would rather not play after the sun goes down because it just is too creepy. It makes you use your head without being too frustrating and the few characters that are in it are so interesting! I truely loved playing the game and not only was it an enjoyable game to play, the storyline is VERY very good. The ending will make you sit back in your chair and go ""wow"". If you have a few extra bucks to spend, I'd definitely say yes yes and yes			"

												Wow, this game was pretty amazing. One of the main reasons I got it was because of the fact that you played as a toddler, which was something I've never seen before in a game. And the other, well, because I'm an indie/horror enthusiast, so this looked really promising.The atmoshpere and level design are extremely creepy and dark, almost Tim Burton-esque. Every level was heavily detailed and as such helped me feel very immersed. What I like about it is that it is subtle, like Amnesia - nothing is really too forceful with trying to shove terror down your throat, instead it just eases it down nice and slowly, making sure you suffer every last bit. I really underestimated the game's horror factor, because it has moments where it's right up there with Outlast in making me bleed out sweat.The gameplay is pretty good; it captures the movements of a toddler very well. Walking upright, you waddle around like you're drunk, and you can also crawl on the floor, which is actually a lot faster. You can run while you are upright, but you risk the chance of tumbling down to the ground, so I never really did that. One thing I really found annoying was the teddy bear as your light source, because he obstructed a lot of my view towards the ground, which made it very difficult at times to be able to see objects, or where I was heading. Not to mention, he does not provide a very good radius of light, although perhaps maybe that is a problem with how I set my gamma, not sure.Well anyway, yeah, epic game, but the only problem is, it was too short! :C But oh well. I still do strongly recommend you get this if you want horror similar to Amnesia and with a bit of a psychological feel to it.			"

												★★★☆☆ - ""Worth a try, but only on a discount"" PROS:- Unique, first time I can remember crawliing around like a baby in a game.- The game has an unnerving atmosphere and can make you jump.- Well designed, I really liked the environments and their colours.CONS:- Short, 2 hours of gameplay.- Whilst the stories imaginative it leaves very little to savour.- Gameplay is very limited, once you get direction your just on a bit of a rollercoaster.VERDICT?Wont earn any credit for its gameplay but I still enjoyed it due to its fresh idea and immersive atmosphere.

												Among the sleep isn't your standard issue blood, guts and gore horror but still delivers unease and goosebumps with the psychological horror that it is plus the story line.Atmospheric, chilling, beautiful and wonderfully unique, I have never played a game quite like among the sleep. This game was more chilling than scary, though there were a few well placed scripted scares that had me jumping. For me it was the tension and building atmosphere which had me both hooked and creeped out. Beautiful artwork and the story when it all comes together is very deep. The only con I have with this game is how short it is, but then again with the subject matter I can understand why they kept it this short.			"

												This is a really well made game with a very touching story or uhm upsetting I guess, although I don't want to spoil it for anyone. You'll see that the story is actually quite dark if you make it through to the end and do the prologue. Just so you know.I loved the game play and that the main characters were not so typical of the horror genre. This is a horror type game, but it feels so unique and so special in a ""different from the norm"" sort of way. I recall certain levels being a pain to navigate, and the prologue collection items not saving properly, but asides from that I don't have very many complaints. Very good and well made game that is quite a bit of fun.			"

												This was the first horror game I ever played. The idea of actually having to take control in a stressful and creepy situation was just too much for me, hence I loved watching others play but never really did myself.Among the Sleep is the perfect game for those who, not unlike myself, are new to horror games and don't really know what to expect. It's scary and creepy with just the right amount of cute and adorable and a great plot to keep you going.However, it is way too short and expensive for what it currently offers, and considering the way it ended (brilliant ending by the way), I can't imagine what any DLC's could possibly add to the story.

												I bought this game during a sale and do not regret it. The atmosphere: water dripping, creaking of the floor, glass breaking, knockings at the door, faint yelling, muffled noises behind the walls, with Teddy whispering advice along the way…every bit of it thoroughly creeped me out. Brilliant sound design. I do not recall any typical jump scares, just a dreadfully bleak (yet beautiful and creative) environment and storyline.If you're on the fence, give the demo a try and decide from there.			"

												I found this to be an OK game. Concept of being a toddler was new and interesting. The rest was mostly old news. The scare factor comes mostly from 2 things for most of the game: loud random bg noise, giving the impression you are not alone; and scripted jumpscares. While I thoroughly enjoyed the 1st factor, the 2nd one became boring really fast, to the point where I wouldn’t feel threatened at all. The addition of enemies (which felt mostly scripted too) solved that issue in a way, at least for me.First off: SAVING MECHANICS LIE TO YOU. You see all those dandy “saving” notifications in the bottom right corner? Yes, they are saving checkpoints. For when you *die*. If you close the game mid chapter and reload, you’re forced to repeat the whole chapter. It isn’t fun, especially on longer chapters where you might want to take a break, and where the checkpoint system makes it look like you’ll be dropped where you left off.Graphics were ok. Some strange clipping if you actually pay attention but nothing too major. You can use the demo to check them for yourself, I barely noticed a difference.NPCs push you out of the way (which is awkward when the main NPC is so small). Detection for the “climb up” command is really awkward in the last chapter where you have to walk into slightly higher places, not tall enough to be climbable, but I was unable to simply walk towards the 5cm higher place and get on it. That whole chapter had weird collision to think of it. I couldn’t get under furniture that I could get under in previous chapters.Sound was nice and scary. A bit overdone, sometimes?There wasn’t much to the story but then again you’re a toddler, your life isn’t expected to be super complicated anyway. It made sense in the end, wasn’t terrible or anything, but also isn’t going to stick with me.Overall it was interesting. Not one of my favourite games, probably won’t go back to it after getting the achievements. Would still recommend checking out.			"

												Among the Sleep is both beautiful and tragic at the same time. The story unfolds in such a way that it leaves room for your imagination to run wild as you explore creatively designed areas, solve fun interactive puzzles, and hide from the monsters under your bed.I was very impressed with the controls and the detail put into the game, from the cute pajamas right down to the stitching in the rug that you crawl across. Tons of items are intractable and it is surprisingly easy to lose yourself in simple things like stacking blocks or piling toys into chests.The monsters in the game are unique and tie very well in to the story – no spoilers, you need to play to the end! There are several moments in the game where the monsters can come after you, but if you are patient and hide well then they can be avoided to some extent. My overall score for the game: 10/10. I really enjoyed this game, I even came back and played it again for the achievements and the prologue. The story is incredibly touching and will leave you with some pretty heavy emotions by the time you reach the end. Among the Sleep is a gem, don’t miss out on this one! "

												Okay, okay. For all those kids out there that think it's one or two hours of gameplay, get real. Why do you even play games, if you are in such a rush to finish them? Think of this as a great film... I got four to five hours out of it. Yes, 20 is a bit much... but if I am lucky, the Dlc will be free. (Right.) Anyway, to those of you that think this is going to change the way you play. NOOOOOOO! The story is genius, to me at least. You won't understand how brilliant it is if you are just a kid. This is aimed at adults and if you have children or grew up in a bad home, it will make sense. To everybody else, you'll be wondering why you never get to kill anybody. Grow up, then come back to this. This game really is brilliant and should be played by anybody who has children. It is not perfect, not even close, but it does tell a very important story that is sad, scary and beautiful. I know not a lot of people are willing to admit when a game spooks them or makes them feel uneasy, yet I will tell you this, I was spooked out by a part in this more than any other game I have ever played. Now, this is best played with headphones on in the dark. A lot of reviews spoiled some of the most intense moments, so dont read too much into the story. The graphics are nothing special, but they do the job and the enviroments are nice to look at. I also found the creature to be well designed. The puzzles are far too easy and end up being things that just slow you down more than test your wits. Still, the story and atmosphere are amazing. The real let down is the price since this game is very short and doesn't bring anything new to the table. If you catch it on offer, it is a must own.			"

												Among the Sleep was a very interesting and unique horror game. The gameplay style is similar to Amnesia. However, this is not a violent/gore-infused game since it clearly involves a toddler (and ripping a toddler apart would be kind of weird). It is a very short game, one that took me about 3 hours to complete (and I take my time sweet with these types of games). However, this game is definitely worth your time. Even though there is no gore and violence, Among the Sleep definitely captures the essence and perspective of what it is like to be a defenseless toddler and have a wild imagination. The storyline is something that many people can directly relate to and it is a sad reality that many individuals go through/have gone through (I chose not to say anything further in order not to spoil anything). This game's spookiness will surprise you! P.S.: Although I thoroughly recommend this game, I suggest you wait until it goes on sale. I feel that $20 may be too steep for the amount of game time that one gets.			"

												The most obvious complaint you'll get is that the game is too short. You could speed run in an hour or so, or take some time to enjoy the ambience.  Monument Valley (mobile game) is the same kind of beast; short but very enjoyable.To be honest the 3-d models come across a bit unpolished (specifically the mother), but once you are 1/3 of the way through you don't notice anymore because you are too distracted by the SUPURB audio.  Seriously this game's audio is on par if not better than Outlast in keeping you nervous about what's about to happen (wear headphones). Puzzle elements aren't too difficult and I feel like it was designed in the same spirit of Super Meat Boy in how it introduces a mechanic and then expands on it, slowly guiding you as needed until you understand all the options at your disposal.There are some jump scares sure, good ones in fact, and it's not excessive and the times where you are hiding from [REDACTED] are suspenseful.  The ending was good simply for the fact that they didn't take the easy way out with the story. You may think you have it figured out as you go along looking at drawings thrown about but it's not quite what it seems.I was a kickstarter backer, and I don't regret it, seeing how you can spend $20 on a few pizzas this is very much worth the price, and there has been DLC announced which I believe will be free.I'd give it a 7/10			"

Among the Sleep caught my attention by its promise of an emersive I rarely play horror games as I am a little bit of a wimp when it comes to being scared.  However, Among the Sleep caught my attention with its promise of an immersive world and a new perspective.  Both of which it delivered very well.  I started the game expecting to be scared out of my mind, but this game was very mild on the horror spectrum.  There was a small hand full of times that my heart raced and I jumped a little.  Very reminiscent of my childhood days when I remember being afraid to walk around the house in the dark because my imagination had already created all of the worst possible things that could be waiting to grab me.The biggest complaint I read in reviews was that the game was too short.  And really it was, however I also don’t think it should have been much longer.  The puzzles were relatively simple.  I got lost a couple of times in areas that seemed a little circular and the right direction was hard to decipher.  Otherwise the game moved at a steady pace.I’m glad I played this game and would recommend it to anyone looking for something to occupy a few hours of their time.  Seeing the world from the height of a 2 year old gave a fresh perspective and I believe the development and design of the game was very well done.   "

												a treat for any horror fan with a great original storyline you play as a 2 year old that you believe has a pretty normal life but when you go to sleep you wake up to your crib turned over and you start getting scared as you hear your mom's voice that sounds concerning and you cannot find her anywhere you look around and start hearing muffled screams throughout the hallways in your home, you then find your teddy that you just recently met in the washing machine telling you something is wrong we must find your mother things start turning into a world of the childs mind twisted by confusion while you start finding clues to where your mother is throughout this adventure. This game is extremly well done dealing with the element of psycological horror and survival as you go around avoiding monters and realizing various events about the childs life you did not even realize. This game took the darkest turns and made me believe i was that child trying to escape all these horrors that are trying to hurt me it was truly well made and well done with the sound effects, jump scares and monsters. i do recommend this game for any horror video game ethusiest and anyone that enjoys a good storyline that makes you question a lot of what is going on but in a great way, worth the time and worth the play. Well done krillbite studios. :)			"

												It’s hard to know how big an effect a parent’s actions can have on children, until certain mannerisms start to materialise in that child’s behaviour. In Among the Sleep, you’ll be confronted by such scenes that might bring a tear to the eye of parents who play through. I’m not a parent myself, but at the end I couldn’t help staring at the screen in bewilderment of what I had just played through. Read more in our Among the Sleep review below.Having just finished watching the film “Room”, I was reminded just how much an adult’s behaviour can impact the lives of their children. Among the Sleep touches on quite a lot of issues that parents face, but more importantly, it takes you on a two-year old toddlers journey through a world of imagination that depicts just how different a child’s perception of their surroundings is.There is so much about Among the Sleep’s story that I’d love to talk about, but unfortunately that would involve spoiling the majority of the game. I’m going to do my best to touch upon certain aspects without potentially ruining the experience of those who are yet to play it.Happy BirthdayThe beginning of Among the Sleep starts with the toddling protagonist downing a glass of drink. Because of the way you are first seeing the world through the rounded walls of a drinking glass, my first impression was that I might be witnessing a birth scene. But as I moved my mouse around, more and more of the world became visible. Eventually I was left looking at the beaming face of the toddler’s mother. It was the two-year old’s birthday and the mother was preparing a cake.As you wait for the cake to be presented to you, you’re given the opportunity to look around the kitchen, and even play with an abacus. Finally mother comes back with the cake and cuts a slice for mister toddler to eat. Unfortunately, before we got to sink our teeth into this tasty looking cake, we were interrupted by a knock at the door of the toddler’s house.Here’s where the strangeness begins. Distortion lines start to appear around everything and the sound becomes muted. A growing feeling of unease pierces the atmosphere. Just as you’re starting to think you’ve fallen into a scene from Paranormal Activity, the distortion dissipates when you hear the mother shout “NO!”, and slam the door.Back she comes with a present in her hands and a face conveniently disguised with a big smile. But before you’re allowed to open it, she picks you up and takes you and the present upstairs. You get placed in a playpen and the present is set down upon a chest of drawers. When the mother leaves the room, you gain control of the toddler.The usual ‘WASD’ keys control your movement while the mouse is used to look around. Also, ‘left-click’ allows you to interact with objects. Obviously toddlers aren’t known for their jumping prowess, so instead of jump, the ‘space-bar’ allows you climb onto platforms such as chairs and open drawers. Holding ‘shift’ lets you sprint for a short period of time, but instead of being presented with a stamina gauge, you’ll simply fall over when you can no longer keep up the pace. The ‘control’ key drops you to the floor and allows you to crawl through narrow nooks and crannies.Eventually you come across Teddy. A loveable soft toy who accompanies you on your adventure. In the toddler’s mind, Teddy can talk, and informs you that by pressing ‘F’ to cuddle him, you’ll feel safer. What he really means is that he’ll light up and allow you to see in really dark places. To be honest, I was constantly pressing ‘F’ because it gets quite creepy in the dark… Not only is Teddy a provider of light, but he also acts as a guide to the toddler.Playing AroundThe gameplay in Among the Sleep mainly consists of solving puzzles. Each puzzle rewards you with a memory that’s required for progressing to the next area of the game. The puzzles are relatively simple and won’t require a lot of thinking to solve, but the journey involved in solving each puzzle takes you through some incredibly imaginative environments; from dark, creepy playgrounds, to mazes of bookshelves haunted by a tall, crazy-haired, lurching monster.Speaking of monsters, you’re not going to find as many of them out in the dark as you believed you would as a child. However, in later areas of the game, the tall monsters will appear more frequently. If they catch you, you’ll be in trouble and have to start again from a previous checkpoint. Thankfully the checkpoints come around often, and you won’t be replaying certain parts of puzzles over and over.Among the Sleep incorporates a great physics engine that allows you to open drawers, cupboards, fridges and interact with pretty much anything you can see. Some puzzles and achievements require you to pick up certain items and throw them. This gives things an extra injection of realism and also lengthens the overall gameplay experience.An extra little incentive when playing Among the Sleep are the many toddler-like drawings scattered around each area. The drawings depict some scenes we can only imagine are events the toddler has lived through.All throughout Among the Sleep, you’ll be followed by a feeling of unease. Teddy will whisper to you that things look dangerous and you should be careful. Creepy sounds and crescendos in the music add a feeling of panic to your journey, and when you first encounter the creepy, tall, crazy-haired monster, you’ll be looking over your shoulder every time you hear something out of the ordinary.Aesthetic CharmFrom the moment you are taken upstairs and witness the introduction credits apparate before your eyes in the form of glowing lights, you can tell that you’re in for a visual treat. The graphics have a cartoony feel to them, resembling something you might see in a Pixar film. Everything in the real world is drawn with such bright, vivid colours. Each colour stands out the way you’d imagine a toddler to see them. In contrast, the imaginary world is dark, full of shadows and incorporates creepy distorted shapes to the overall design of things.Playing as a toddler, you would expect their movement to be quite wobbly and Krillbite Studios certainly deliver in terms of wobbliness. It definitely injects an extra bit of realism to the character you are playing. Otherwise it might just feel like you’re playing as any FPS character in an overgrown world.The soundtrack is eery and coats everything with an unnerving sheen. Sounds and effects raise goosebumps on your skin, especially when the monsters commence their pursuit of your tiny form.Final ThoughtsAmong the Sleep is truly a masterpiece and tells a story we’re all too familiar with. This could be confronting to some, but the way it plays out through the eyes and imagination of a toddler, portrays it in a different light. Those of you who aren’t parents might stop and reflect on the adventure you’ve just played through. Parents might shed a tear or go and give an extra hug to their children.The entire game is so smooth to play, and although it only lasts for around three hours, you’ll feel like those three hours just flew by. Krillbite Studios have added Steam achievements to the game, so there’s a bit of replayability in terms of collecting everything and unlocking each achievement.If you’re looking for a game that relies more on telling a rich story rather than throwing you deep into an action-packed shootout, Among the Sleep will not disappoint. It’s story will leave you speechless but you won’t be able to help yourself from wanting more.Read the full review[gamereviewsau.com] "

												It's a nice short and atmospheric game. Not worth 30 quid but if you're a horror fan, you can't go wrong with it when it's on sale. The environments are creepy and the sound design is top-notch (although I can't figure out why the baby himself/herself sound like a monster themselves sometimes). There's isn't much in the way of puzzle solving or anything besides moving objects and pushing stuff around. Graphics look gorgeous. The lighting is superb.Be wary, though. There are clipping bugs galore; so don't be surprised if you get stuck on the environment occasionally and can't move. I had to restart a couple of levels because I got stuck in the ground and wound up where the game apparently didn't want me to be. Gameplay mechanics are pretty easy and I'm sure your non-gamer significant other can enjoy it as much as you do. Can't say it had much in the way of surprises or the story was that special but it did keep me interested throughout the 3-or-so hour experience. Sometimes I felt the developers had the atmosphere and story down but couldn't really come up with any new ideas for gameplay. As I said earlier, if you find this on sale and you're into horror and toddling simulation, you'll get your bang out of Among the Sleep.			"

												This game was funded entirely on the promise that it would be developed from the ground-up for VR. But the developers recently announced that they were dropping VR development while keeping the money of all of the people who backed Among the Sleep on the promise of a VR-centric game. And their excuse? They don't want to disable the obnoxious head bobbing and forced camera movements they decided to build into game against all VR best practices, because those irritating ""features"" are their ""creative vision"" the vision.Developer Krillbite are thieves, liars, frauds, and self-important prima donnas who have cheated the many backers and customers who backed or bought this game solely on the grounds of promised VR support.Don't buy this trash, and don't buy any of Krillbite's future products. They are unscrupulous criminals.			"

												Among the Sleep is an amazing horror game. First of all, I really loved the idea of the first person view of a toddler, the point of view of a baby makes it unique. Then there are the sounds. Oh... the sounds, I hated them but I loved them. They are the first thing you will feel amazed by them, you will notice that every single object has its own recorded sound.I got scared whenever I touched one of the 1000 interactive objects. Also, the vocals of the mother and ""Teddy"" were I also really liked the ending, where most of the game gets explained (why is there a ""monster"" chasing you, why is there this ""specific object"" everywhere in the game?)The atmosphere is simply amazing.On the other side, I found it a bit short, I played (and recorded/uploaded) the game for about 3 hours until I reached the end. But thats it, everything else was astonishingLong story short - The game was awesome. I would give it an 8.5/10I really do recommend it to everyone who has a stong heart c:			"

												Let me tell you that I am one of those people who enjoyes surrealism art. This game reminds me of surrealism art with a fantasy twist to it. Even though it is a horror game, I find it extremely beautiful, especially when you reach the playhouse (that's all I'm going to say about that, I don't want to spoil it). Gorgeous surrealism in my opinion. The graphics aren't extraordinary like the Assassins Creed games, but it's different in the beauty that it offers. I started playing it and couldn't stop.			"

												This will say I've played over two hours. It was less than that for me. There was a part I got stuck on for a little while and an AFK that lasted at least 20 minutes. Among the Sleep is as short as people are saying it is. I hate having to make a huge chunk of my review about money and length, but it feels necessary. It's hard to say if this game is or is not worth $20. That price for roughly an hour and a half, more or less, seems somewhat unfair. The fantastic imagery, atmosphere, and story (though, I caught on way, way earlier than I was supposed to and I think most players will, too), and the amount of love you can tell was put into this is actually worth $20. I find myself telling friends to wait for a sale, though. I'm not sure I'm pleased with paying the full price, even if the work put into this is probably deserving of it. I do recommend this game. It's creative, unique, and very cool. It does have its flaws, and unlike many gamers on here, I don't often excuse a lot just because the developer is indie. I do think the positives heavily outweigh the negatives, however. I wish there were more ways to interact with items. There was quite a bit of graphics tearing and floors disappearing. There was no real challenge and I would have had more fun if the puzzles were designed to make me have to think even a little. I can't really say if the length is a negative, it's as long as they felt the story should be. I'm indifferent towards the length itself, keeping price out of it. I like that they littered the levels with drawings by the child and other little things that hinted at what was going on in reality, but there was way too much that gave it all away immediately. It makes sense but essentially ended up leaving me without any suspense. That's okay with me, though. It came together wonderfully at the end.This is one of those games where it's all about the journey. I like that sort of thing. If you don't, I wouldn't recommend it to you.It has creepy elements and while you can call it horror, it isn't a frightening game. Unless you scare easily, don't expect to have a nightmarish experience. I love how they illustrated the perspective and imagination of a child, it was brilliant and unlike anything else I've ever played. It was definitely a terrifying and emotional experience for our two year old.Among the Sleep is worth playing, what you're comfortable paying for it will have to be up to you.			"

												Among the Sleep is a First Person horror/puzzle game in where we play as a toddler trying to find his mother in a dark and twisted world. We start off in our birthday party, eat some cake with our mom and are given a terrifying teddy bear as a gift. The bear teaches us the basics of the game such as picking stuff up and climbing but you may be half expecting it to murder you at any given moment. Surprisingly that creepy as sin stuffed bear turns out to be your best friend throughout this ordeal and doubles as a flashlight whenever you hug it. The voice actor that plays the teddy bear has a very calm and soothing voice which ironically enough adds to the creepiness of it.Everything is all well and normal until you go to sleep and have your crib flipped over by an invisible entity. From there on out the world turns pretty twisted and has no sense of coherency sort of like a dream as the ways the areas connect to each other make no sense. Not much will make sense actually as the story is quite cryptic and you will have to piece it together yourself. As strange as the world is the level design is linear and well thought out so you should never find yourself lost. Most of the story is also told through the environment so there is a reason to pay attention to your surroundings other than the possibility of death. A large portion of your time will be solving very simple puzzles to be able to progress to the next area but there are a few stealth sections where you must hide and avoid monsters. These are definitely the low points of the game as it can be hard to indicate when the monster is near until you catch a glimpse but by then you will be killed. They just hold you up in the air and show a game over screen so don't expect violent baby executions buying this. Another problem with having to avoid the monsters is that your fat baby legs are nowhere near agile enough to move to cover quickly. As mentioned before these sections are few and far between so it doesn't really have much of an impact to the experience.When you are standing you will be able to run shortly before falling down and reverting back to your crawling stance. Crawling allows you to fit into tiny locations and is much faster than walking but you are unable to hug the teddy bear for light and since you can also run when standing there is little reason to crawl. You can also climb on objects to reach places. An example being pulling up a chair and climbing it to reach a door knob. You can also pick up objects and throw them but throwing doesn't really become a factor until much later on. The baby is surprisingly strong considering how hard he throws objects and is able to move chairs without a problem.I'd imagine you are not considering purchasing this game for the cool physics or the puzzles but for the horror. Among the Sleep pulls it off pretty well and being a toddler really helps as everything in the world seems big and scary. This isn't really the kind of game that will throw jump-scares at you around every corner. Jump-scares are rare for the most part and the game instead relies heavily on subtle psychological horror such as dimly lit rooms, objects falling and distant noises. One thing that I found separated it from most horror games is the lack of blood, gore or violence. It is definitely a breath of fresh air and shows you can make an unnerving experience without resorting to gross out tactics.The audio in Among the Sleep really amplifies the horror. It does a very good job at making you paranoid through use of sudden thumps, braking glass and just tense ambient music. Without such good sound effects and ambiance the game would have been much less effective at horror. Environments are unique and have the advantage of really making you feel like a small defenseless toddler in a over-sized world. Graphics are pretty good as well and I found it impressive how environments went from breathtaking to horrifying in some areas. Levels don't actually interconnect in any real way other than you sliding down a rusty pipe into a new location but it does end up adding to the surreal nature of it all.Overall this is a pretty good horror title. It does lack in gameplay and the puzzles are so easy that they will not offer any challenge and may feel like they are there just to give you something to do. Though considering the game is only two hours you will likely finish the game before boredom or repetition sets in. The horror does stay unpredictable throughout and they do a really good job at sparingly using the monsters to hunt you. Among the Sleep doesn't feel like a glorified game of hide and seek like other modern horror titles, instead it feels like a very personal experience through the warped mind of a toddler. It really does feel like a walking simulator with puzzles thrown in to slow you down but if you are fine with that there is a truly memorable and unique experience here that will remain in your mind long after you beat it.

												Among the Sleep is one of those games that really makes me wish Steam had a better rating system than ""yes"" or ""no.""It's good and there's a lot to like about the short time you'll spend in this world, but there's also an aftertaste of ""it could have been better"" that lingers as the credits roll. The game design and atmosphere are what really make this a recommended game. I really liked that the controls actually bring life to the idea that you're playing as an infant. Run too long and you fall into a crawl.... the bobbled, bow legged walk. These are all great details that helped immerse me into the world. I actually had an unnerving sense of nostalgia when crawling between coats and dresses in the endless expanses of closets. Remember how big closets used to seem when hiding in them?I guess my biggest dissapointment was that due to the short amount of time and focus on the game itself, that I really wish I was able to care more about the characters. Maybe that plays into being an infant and not picking up on these things, but it felt like an afterthought. Obviously, Teddy is the only character you really have the chance to connect with and he always felt so artificial that it gave me that ""uncanny valley"" uneasiness rather than the feeling of comfort he was supposed to provide the player. Regardless, this was a well crafted experience and I can't find a reason to tell anyone not to play it. The price tag is pretty steep at the moment. In the end, I always equate it to ""was the experience worth the price of admission"" which is completely subjected to my own opinion. In this case, not for me. It's a game I enjoyed, but I won't likely bring it up in conversations or think about it too much after my playthrough. I am excited to see what the developers do in the future.			"

												The idea this game brings up is all too familiar to me, as I have a junior brother and there were times I regret when I treated him bad. From the child's perspective, you see the picture in irrational colors, but it's the truth and it's core to what would actually happen to the one's soul. We all did our mistakes and it's quite hard to get yourself together but in any case, it's not a child who should suffer from that. A child should not have to go through this...			"

												This game is wonderful and has a very powerful message at the end. If you like scary games but not too scary this is the game for you. The  gameplay is very simple and the graphics very well done, there are many jump scares but thankfully your character is a small child so you can hide very easily. I wont give away the story but I will say you are a two year old with your teddy for most of us we can relate which gives the game a bit more edge. You get absorbed into the game and you are no longer sitting in your favorite gaming chair but a two year old again with your teddy. Enjoy the scares.			"

												Among the Sleep is a decent action-adventure title that will appeal to anyone who wants a good scare. Perhaps it is because you are playing as a toddler that the horror adds a depth that most titles like this are missing, but it is genuinely terrifying at times. The ending itself is something that you should not miss as it holds a gravitas that will resonate with you and stay with you for some time. It is rather short, being able to get through the entire game in about two or three hours, but it’s worth the experience to play through at least once.http://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/among-the-sleep-review/ "

												This is the first horror game I have played, so I don't have that many experience with horror games. But the unique concept that this game has to offer made me curious and decided to play it. Normally in a game, we're given the abilities to survive against the antagonist of the game. But in this game, as a two year old, we don't have the capability to at least fight back against the antagonists. Without it, we can only do what two year olds can do to survive, run and hide. We don't have a sense of control of the antagonists. An interesting plot twist is waiting at the end of this unique experience. This kind of unique concept has a lot of potentials to explore..			"

												I just finished the game, let my emotional reaction fade away, and now I gotta say I love it. There are a few glitches still, and my game crashed making me replay the last chapter, but I didn't mind so much other than having to get through a few scary moments again. Keep in mind I do not normally play horror games, I'm extremely skittish and jump scares always tend to get me. I thought the game was a good level of overall eerieness without being so scary I couldn't play. It's not going to scare horror veterans, but the story is more important in my eyes. The ending had me scared for the adorable little protagonist in more ways than one.As far as length it's a short game. Took me about 4 hours including redoing that last chapter. Any more though would've been padding, as the game told it's story quite well in the time taken. There's not a ton of replay value as the emotional reaction is never the same as the first time, but I know a few people I'll be suggesting this too. I did not see the ending coming. I had a similar idea to what happened, but was a bit off. The sound design was pretty good throughout, although if I play again I'll probably adjust the levels so some of the noises are a bit obnoxious after too long. I'm looking forward to seeing more from this company, and have no regrets with getting this game.			"

												I'll let others review the scary aspect of this game. I wanna focus on the toddler simulation aspect.Holy cow. I wish there was a way to just have a toddler simulator based on these mechanics. After I played through the actual storyline I went back and started over again and just played around in the playroom and was blown away by the attention to physics. Drag a stool across the wooden floor, it slides okay. Push it across carpet and you're in for a struggle. You can't lift a pillow above your head but you can toss an inflatable ball a few feet.You can pick things up, put them down, open and close things, climb and even fall. There's no health bar so spills don't really matter. You wobble when you walk and make appropriate sounds as you move around. And it's interesting to see the world from the perspective of one so small (again). In all I would love to see more done with just the simulator side of things. It would be a riot to run around the house and interact with the environment without having to worry about the 'bad guys' getting you. After a long hard week of adulting, sometimes I don't want my gaming to give me puzzles or enemies to deal with. I just want to unwind. but I'm not into the farming or app-type games. This is just my style! I'd love to see more walking simulators like this.That said, the spooky aspect to this game and the storyline are both awesome. Sometimes though I couldn't help wondering if -I- was the monster. Something about all the crawling through vents and bookcases and scurrying under beds...			"

												An absolutely oustanding game. Keep in mind that the game is actually very short. You can beat it in 3 to 4 hours in one sitting if you're aiming to, so you'll want to weigh that against whatever the game's current price.First let me say a few frank things about this game. These aren't complaints or criticisms. Just saying these things to adjust your expectations in case you are expecting the wrong thing from the screenshots/trailer/description. Firstly, the game is not really what you would call a horror game. It definitely has a distinctive ""strange and eerie"" quality to it that makes for an incredible atmosphere, but you're not going to be screaming or falling out of your chair or biting your nails. Secondly, the game does not present very many threats. There are VERY few situations where you are in any real danger. The result of these two things is that Among The Sleep adds up to be a fairly casual experience. So let me be frank about that. HOWEVER. Although ""casual"" is often used in a pejorative sense, it is not at all a bad thing here.This game is most recommended to players who, above all else, prize things like exploration, atmosphere, a sense of wonder, and outstanding visual style / art direction.Playing the game is more like an adventure game. It's slow-paced exploration with periodic object puzzles. The core gameplay principles are very comparable to games like Penumbra or Amnesia: you can freely manipulate doors, drawers, and most light objects. You can crawl inside closets to hide, and since you are a small child in this game, you can even hide inside of very small cupboards, under beds, and other small places. Unlike Penumbra/Amnesia, you rarely encounter dangerous creatures. When you DO encounter them, it's basically the same idea: run to the nearest hiding place and wait until it goes away. If you are looking for some kind of deep stealth gameplay, you won't find it here.That being said, despite my love of HP Lovecraft, I always found the Penumbra/Amnesia settings to be sort of bland. Among The Sleep however is a visual feast to behold. I found myself not wanting to stop playing the game just so I could LOOK AT IT some more. It's not that the game has better graphics than The Witcher 3 or something. It's more about what the game does with spacing, composition, lighting, contrast, and various other little artistic nuances. Among The Sleep is like a delicious cake for your eyeballs.The game also goes to an interesting place with the story, making it something more than just a fantasy. While I mostly consider this a plus, it is also one of those ""reveals"" that you see coming a hundred miles away. Perceptive players will see where this story is going before they even leave the first area. No doubt the devs intended foreshadowing, but the foreshadowing comes on a bit strong. ;-)Note that there is a free DLC level you can acquire after completing the base game. You can get it by going to chapter select and looking for the ""unlock prologue"" option. The DLC level is decent in gameplay terms, but it lacks the eerie and magical feeling of the base game on account of having you explore just a regular house instead of strange and eerie landscapes. The fantastic art of the base game is the most notable thing missing from the DLC, but it's a decent enough level otherwise.Using my own scale below, I'm putting the game at a 5. I honestly really want to give it a 6, but I'm dialing it back to 5 on account of it being a little on the short side. 7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game that is definitely worth checking out—especially if discounted.4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.

PC performance was good.Cons:  Short,  took me about 3 hours and I explored everywhere.  Some bugginess towards the end, I had to restart a chapter due to a glitch.  I suppose thats to be expected on version 1.0 of a kickstarted indie game though.			"

												The demo was amazing, however the gameplay of the finished version barely expands on what the demo showed. What gameplay there was (about 1 1/2 hours) was really fun, and had a few interesting mechanics, however there were several bugs that ruined the gameplay a bit. The character developement of Teddy was a little sloppy in the way that he's introduced, but over the course of the game, he becomes a lovable character.Things I liked:The plot progression was really well done, and it had an interesting twist at the end.The limitations of movement accurately represented what it would be like as a small child.The bear-flashlight (Awwh!).The non-violent terrifying monster and hide sequences.The plot twist at the end.Things I didn't like:The extremely short gameplay.The multiple bugs that ruined gameplay a bit.The high cost for such little gameplay.The somewhat repetitive ambience.Overall, the game is a really fun experience, but not worth $20. The different sections each have their own unique ambiences and creepy layouts, and usually make you not want to leave any hidey-hole that you find. The gameplay is really short, and leaves you feeling like you bought an incomplete game. Teddy is a lovable character and a useful flashlight, and the movement is realistic, but the combination of bugs and short gameplay ruined the experience a little bit. If this game is ever $8 or lower, then it would definitely be worth the purchase!			"

												Short, sweet, chilling, sometimes mortifying and thought provoking once you figure out whats really going on. A genius look at making a scary game that isnt conforming to the standard jump scare shock horror, yes the game can be completed in a few hours easily but the story itself is a pleasant reminder that the real monsters are all too human. I really hope these guys create another and much longer game using the same unique approach to storytelling.Play the demo if you want to see how this plays, if you dont enjoy the demo you wont enjoy the game, buy the game when its on sale or not, either way the game definately got onto my must own list for its originality, perhaps not the most replayable of games however. As a side note...spelling words with the letter blocks seems to be popular with everyone :)And dont forget to hug your teddybear.			"

												Game horor yang cukup bagus, dimana kita bermain sebagai anak kecil 2-3 tahun menjelajahi mimpi ditemanin boneka teddy.Gameplay sangat baik bisa berinteraksi dengan benda2 sekitar, dan ada crosshair ditengah, graphicnya mendukung dengan effect2 kejutan dipadu dengan sound effect yang sangat baik membuat bulu kuduk berdiri sepanjang permainan dibuatnya. Dan cukup ringan dimainkan di laptop middle end.Perasaan seram sekali hanya diawal 15-20 menit pertama, kemudian sudah mulai terbiasa hanya saja sound effectnya membuat kaget sepanjang permainan. Dan 2 map ada hantu yang merupakan sisi buruk dari orang tua (menurut saya) menghantui mimpi dan kita hanya bisa berlari maksimal sebagai balita dan bersembunyi dibawah lemari atau meja so creepy.Sayangnya untuk puzzle-nya hanya memindahkan kursi, menggeser laci, dan melempar benda. Dan kalau gagal sembunyi atau lari dari hantu, maka hantu tidak muncul lagi setelah kita continue games.Tips bermain : mainkan dimalam hari jam 10 malam keatas, sendirian, dengan kondisi cahaya redup dan menggunakan headphone, barulah game ini sangat terasa baik.Cukup baik untuk menambah koleksi library steam dengan harga yang tepat jika dapat dibundle atau pas diskonPenilaian saya : 58/100Gameplay 75Graphic 75Sound 100AI 25Tingkat kesulitan 25Alur Cerita 50			"

												Bought this game a couple days ago hoping for something a little more original than what I got.Gameplay is slow starting off and never really develops over time... It just hits a peak and then you find yourself finishing the game. I seriously wonder why this wasn't free. It really had nothing to offer other than a metaphoric story. (One of which I've seen countless times and done a hell of a lot better than this)Overall, I would consider skipping this unless you want to pay for it and get a quick, non threatening, FPS horror game with nothing in it other than a couple of tense moments.

The technical execution is flawed (animations could be better, weird sound glitches sometimes, framerate can also dip), but the art direction and colors are really pretty, especially given it runs on Unity.The adventure is a definitely on the short side (a little over 2h30), but it is very nice nonetheless.

												It's a very simplistic puzzle game with a few jumpscares and some chasing sequences. I found myself jumping into the water out of boredom just to hear the sound of crunching bones (from what I assume was some water monster eating me), BEGGING for something to kill me to relieve the tedium of collecting items, using them to open a door, and continuing, while the ambience and lighting tried to convince me I was in some kind of danger, then 80% of the time it was just smoke and mirrors and I was completely aware of it.I was SUPER amused by all the little details of being a baby. The cooing, the bear, and the pause screen is adorable - he holds his hands up and covers his eyes, like a kid would do when trying to hide from scary monsters - but all charm aside, I would NOT have bought this game knowing how short it is (for 20 dollars, no less) if I hadn't been suckered into thinking this was a bona fide horror game. It's a glorified puzzle game with some creepy theming, but Amnesia was both much more challenging and much more terrifying. This game borrows a lot from well-established series and just feels kind of cheap, and you can beat it in about an hour or two.To be frank, there were some very creepy moments. When I was being chased by the darkness monsters, I felt like they were clearly gaining on me faster than I could crawl, so there was a nice helpless element to it like I expected to get snatched up RIGHT as I was about to make it to a a safe place. There are also ambiguous crayon drawings, which is usually a cliche in a horror game - children drawing crude depictions of murder or creepy ladies with long, black hair - but in this context it was pretty chilling on occasion. At one point I saw what looked like a tall dark figure holding up a stick-figure infant above its' open jaws, about to devour it. It's rare for anyone to address the murder of children/babies in games, so that's a unique theme that gives it that extra ""Ugh, ♥♥♥♥ that"" feeling.Very ambient, very creepy, very short, very dull, even once the enemies show up. Wait for a sale, until then the LetsPlays will be just as scary. Out of 100%, it's probably a 68% or so. Nothing fresh or revolutionary beyond being about a baby, and the puzzles get really stale.

												I really wanted to like this game but after about 45 minutes it became clear that it was hobbled by the age of its protagonist. For the same reason that you never see horrible things happening to kids on television (the image is withheld, harm is implied by lead up or aftermath) you realize that nothing will ever really harm your character in this game. I don't have a problem with this conceit since I have no desire to see these kinds of things but the result here is that there is nothing at stake in the game. The puzzles are weak, the atmosphere defanged, the engine aged and visually outdated.			"

												Among the Sleep is a game that is supposed to show world from a baby's perspective. Story starts by you finishing your glass of drink and your mother coming to feed you cake since it's your birthday. Soon you get brought upstairs where after a bit of fun, you get to be put to sleep. This is where the game starts from.. The game is a horror game with stealth sections in it and it utilizes fps perspective, so you can crawl+run and climb. You also also interact with the world by using your mouse,ála Amnesia. After the intro, the game kinda forgets what it's concept was (world from a baby's perspective). Because the game turns into some kinda Amnesia meets Silent Hill and thus, to me it feels like a missed opportunity. Because you start visiting weird dark worlds, hearing voices and seeing monsters, it really doesn't have anything anymore to do with world of babies. Once the game really starts, it feels like I'm playing some mod for Amnesia because the environments are suddenly set on entirely different era. Positives  Athmosphere Soundworld Visual effects quality Controls feel fairly solid Negatives  Missed opportunity on the concept Forced stealth sections Linear gameworlds Very short game lenghtGame is really short because it's only 2hrs long and due to this, it's not something that can be recommended for the base price of 14,99€. I paid 9,99€ for this and feel kinda ripped off..			"

												A fantastic First person  journey of horror that starts at your childhood. After eating some cake and getting your teddy bear present, you are on your way to a journey you'll never forget, A magical journey of Horror and wonder.The games made me hold my breath at some points  and I usually don't get scared, the game did a great job on this becuase of the sound and environment which really brings immersion me to the game. The Graphics are pretty good and the game was should be played on the occulus rift to bring in more immersion. With a bit of puzzles here and there for you to solve and make your way to reach the next memories, you'll appreciate this game for the art and life lesson behind this game if you enjoy these types of games. HOWEVERThe game was really short, like 1 hour to beat or 1 and a half hour.  The puzzles were way too easy and predictable nothing too innovative or witty except the one with the sheep platform. Along with the steep price for its value that might make some players wait for a price drop, if you do purchase this game enjoy the art make sure you play it in the dark with headsets on!+First Person Horror+Phenominal Immersion+Great sounds+Good graphics+Good story+Its a real piece of art-Easy puzzles-The length  (1 hour to 1 and a half hour)- The price of the game for its time - No replaybility except to experience the trippy ride again.

Without spoiling it, it seemed to just drop off and leave me hanging. I definitely wish there was more to the game, but from what there was I would give it a 7/10.			"

												This game was nice at first, you were a baby, free of worries. Playing with your talking bear, then BOOM!! Mom is gone! Where'd she go? Is she downstairs? Under the couch? Near the scary walking tree thing? Nope, she's DRUNK! This game's ending made me want to cut myself and write terrible poetry. 8/10 Not long enough.			"

												An A+ frightening and unforgetable experience! Full of creative physics puzzles this game kept me engaged from start to finish. Playing from the persepctive of a baby certainly added to the fear factor. It adds a unique twist to the gameplay experience not seen anywhere else which makes the threats in game credible (especially the sounds and being stalked). Seeing things from a low-angle POV was a thrill. The artwork is hauntingly surealist and does well to create a spooky atmosphere that'll keep you on edge. The characters are memorable and you really connect with them because the story works to create emotional bonds with them in ways you've probably not seen before in-game. The story is well-crafted and stays with you well after you've finished, a thoughtful experience. As a big horror fan I can honestly say this game is in my Top 10 Scariest games of all time because it takes the familiar and turns it into a fun-filled nightmare. I can see myself coming back to this for Halloween for some more good scares. Great work and thanks for the amazing experience! :)			"

												Despite (literally) crawling through this game, stopping to admire the art direction, slowing down to analyze the rather ingenious creative decisions by the Krillbite team, and simply standing frozen in terror on one end of a hallway, I blazed through this whole game in less than 4 hours, and it seems that the length is something that people have been rather disappointed about.Well, I'm going to share my opinion with you, and go on record to say that the length of this game... is... PERFECT. Krillbite doesn't beat around the bush, trying to draw out the gameplay with collectibles, and almost unattainable achievements, or the like. Instead, It focuses on its story, and sticks to it, allowing the player to truly immerse themselves in the unique scenario. There are sometimes lulls in the feeling of insecurity that you'll get while playing, but even in the calmer moments (with perhaps the exception of the VERY start of the game) there is never a moment failing to build tension.As a horror game alone, this title is very good, but it seemed like much more than that. The main draw of ""Among the Sleep"" is, of course, your character; that of a two year old child. Fear for a two year old and fear for an adult are two completely separate things, so when I say this game is more than just a game, I view it as an incredibly realistic look in to the child psyche. As I played through, I would have very vivid moments recollecting childhood fears. Things that are now commonplace were once terrifying! In a way, ""Among the Sleep"" brought back very VERY distant memories for me that I hadn't touched in ages. In one particular example, I had to put down my controller for a minute and just stare at the screen. Somehow, the creators had managed to build the scene before me as an almost perfect mimic of a recurring nightmare I would have as a small child. I'm not ashamed to say I stared at it for minutes before being able to proceed! In fact, the only thing I feel after beating this game is impressed.This game is surely going to be more personal for some than others, but it is a must have for lovers of the horror genre, and an interesting experiment even for those who don't normally find a good time in such things. Some people will say that the $20 price tag is too steep, but hey... support the independence! Right? Do that and Krillbite will surely be able to make more amazing titles for us in the future!""Among the Sleep""'s story is one that will draw you in and make you want to finish, and therein lies its greatest strength.

The reason I also say no is because they spent way to much time on this game, and there's so many bugs in it I had to redo the ending 2 times. The price isn't right for the game it should be $10 or $15. The game was way to short and I'm hoping for some DLCs. Examples for DLCs (Child support takes you away, or your mother comes back).			"

												Ok, I will admit, I put off picking this game up because other reviews mentioned it as being short.   Maybe it is if you play it strait through.  However, I will say that this dark ""American McGee's Alice in wonderland-esk"" game is quite well made and a very nice distraction if you love stories that take place in brooding nightmarish environments.  It definately made me jump a few times, and kept me on the edge of my seat.  There's a little puzzle solving, but nothing too challenging, and even some sneaking/avoidance similar to some of my favorite games like Outlast and Amnisia.  I reccomend this mostly for the mood and story in some very strange nightmarish environments.			"

												Spoiler alert...I recommend this game if you want a short but meaningful experience about alcoholism in the home and its relationship with child neglect.  You can rush this game, as nothing can hurt you and its easy to continue and go the other way after you get caught.  You can hide under tables or in cupboards but it best to just move forward without hesistation.  Don't walk off high ledges or into water and you will continue quickly.  The steam achievements are great to get a perfect game with only 4 to achieve:  Knock over the pins in the first room, find the xylophone in the woods playground, find the bad music box in the cupboards area and complete the game to get the final award.  Don't forget to play the prologue (a prequel): yes the ending is in the snow under a tree and it will seem like you got ripped off (if you were the toddler).			"

The story is well done, the sounds are well done. You play a helpless baby that has to hide away from a scary being. Overall this game is truly amazing.

They did come out with a free dlc which i think i enjoyed more then the main story for some reason lol but that only adds 30-45 minutes of playtime.If your thinking about getting it i would wait until theres a sale but other then that i would definitely recommend it. I think everyone who loves these kind of games should experience it. If you want to check out the free dlc here is some gameplay of it!

Among the Sleep is an atmospheric horror game with a unique perspective: you play as a toddler.Krillbite did a great job immersing the player in this role - everything is huge, with a slightly skewed perspective; crawling is faster than walking, and you still trip easily while walking or running; your hands and adorably pajama-clad feet are constantly visible as you climb the furniture or balance precariously on a narrow path.The environments are well-crafted - a surreal mix of mundane, dramatic, and imaginatively fantastic.I spent between 4 and 5 hours exploring the main story and the prologue, and would invite you to do the same.I nominated this for the ""I'm Not Crying, There's Something in My Eye"" Steam Award 2016.

												You carry around a teddy bear that you can hug :)Among the Sleep is a well polished indie horror game which has an interesting concept. You are a two year old toddler and the world you see is from the perspective of a child. A lot of ordinary items and rooms seem much more scary and the developers have nailed it. The graphics are decent but feel sometimes unoptimized. Gameplay is nice and and the game does not sail on cliches. The story is very good and rather than leaving you scared it draws it all nicely together in the end. Personally, the length of the game didn't bother me because the experience was intense.Graphics 7/10Story 10/10Gameplay 8/10Concept 8/10 "

Peli oli enemmänkin tarina jossa mentiin alueita läpi, piirroksia ja muita asioita tutkien, kuin että olisi piileskelty monstereilta ja ratkottu ongelmia. Miinuksena pelin lyhyys ja pulmatehtävien helppous.			"

												Among the Sleep is a first-person, atmospheric horror adventure game for the perspective of a 2-year old child. Everything is huge. Crawling and staggered walking are integral to how you move around. Your childlike imagination is incredibly active. Norwegian developer, Krillbite Studio, have done an amazing job at placing you in the onesie of a toddler and then subsequently placing you in a night where everything is going bump.Among the Sleep uses a whole arsenal of horror techniques to keep you sweating and on the edge of your seat. As I mentioned, it is an atmospheric horror game. A dark house on a stormy night full of creaks, with the faint noise of a plate breaking or muffled voices can be terrifying. Especially at first when you’re wandering through the house as doors creak open behind you, the sound of heavy footsteps echo throughout the house, and there are shadows framing what I assumed at the time were burly, axe-wielding convicts. I would advise playing the game slightly brighter than recommended setting. Not because I’m a coward, but more because the recommended gamma setting was too dark and I couldn’t actually see what I was doing. Though the game does provides a solution to this. There is a “Hug Teddy” button which causes Teddy to light up, softly illuminating the darkness around you.While I’m generally not a huge fan of horror games due to being a bit flighty and preferring games that empower. But I still enjoyed the horror in Among the Sleep academically. Having you play a toddler was an interesting game elements that I’ve never seen it before and thoroughly enjoyed. The game might seem steep in price for a 5-6 hour game, but you pay more for a 2 hour movie, and a lot more for games that that far less unique and well-thought out.For full review, visithttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/07/11/among-the-sleep/ "

Also note: There is head bobbing, if you are easily nauseated, be sure to take breaks a plenty. I haven't seen any way to turn this off.

												Disclaimer: I had fun playing this game, so this is why I put Thumbs up (Recommend) But I'd put a ''meh'' thumbs for the rest.The game is really short (about 2 hours) and the ending is... really disapointing. I won't spoil anything, but I expected more than the cliché it delivered.You are a 2 year old child, and it feels charming. The game, in itself is gorgeous I believe. The controls are simple and ok and I just love the Teddy. But the game is a bit ''too simple'' and too easy. The only part I had a hard time with is finding the last exit after running around an hour (I was really tired, so it's not even the game's fault).This is clearly meant to be a game that you see the world from the eye and the mind of a child and I get that the world he sees is not really the world as it is.The real con is... The game is not scary... in any way. It's not scary as an experience (I didn't felt helpless), it's not jumpscary (yes, there are monsters... 2 times) it's not freaky. I mean, there should've been emphasis on the child's feeling and how it changes his perception of the world, and no emphasis on the child's body. We get it... he's small and can't climb a lot of things. I want to know how he/she feels (I am still not sure about the sex of the infant) not how it moves... we pretty much all know how a baby moves. A child sees his furniture big: MAKE IT BIG! Don't make it real size, make it like the baby sees it!Also, the Teddy, while being cute, puts too much emphasis on the ''It's dark here, I don't like it'' and... nothing happens.The ''puzzles'' are too simple (yes I know, it reflects the child's capabilities... but as a player I would've like to be challenge in a new way like ''What would a baby do in that situation''. Not... ''Oh... there is 6 holes here... there 6 owls to find... I am not sure what i am supose to do''So I would kind of recommend it, because it is fun... and that the adventures worth the game. But... THE PRICE! This game isn't worth 19.99$. There is no exploration per se (the only places you ''explore'' are to find ''keys'' to put in ''switches'') and the rest are just narrow spaces that you go from point A to point B.The overall design is great though. The music is awesome, the visuals are great and the sounds are also great. The word ''Atmospheric'' really pin point the game, as it surrounds you with beautifulness.But the story... and the gameplay are a bit disapointing. Not BAD, disapointing! It could've been more (Well, every game could bee more, but I mean, as this game in itself, it could've been more)Finish it! (Completionist Ranking)			"

												At first I didn't really see what all the fuss was about. I didn't find the game scary at all. Even when the harmless enemy character started appearing, it felt more like a half-hearted haunted house ride.However, about halfway through the game, the enemy character starts being able to attack you, and that's when things got really scary. So scary in fact, that I had to play the song Spanish Flea in the background to lighten up the mood so I could get through it.At points it can be difficult to figure out where to go, but otherwise it's a very creepy and atmospheric game.

I really enjoyed the adventure/roleplay experience, even if it was only a few hours to complete this game. The story driven narrative really captured me.If you enjoy the experience of an adventure/roleplay game then I suggest you buy  this game, but be warned its only a short ride! I recommend you buy this on sale.			"

												This game was rather short, but a very pleasant experience. Worth getting friends to play it together in the dark at night. It has a good story and the theme is fun. A bit different than other horror games since it puts you in the body of a baby and how he perceives the world. Anyways worth getting especially on sale and I believe they added some free DLC that I have yet to try, but the base game was good.			"

												This game gave me some surreal feelings of those times when I was a child, had a nightmare, and woke up to no one else in the house and scared the bejeezus out of me. How the real world and its traumas were conceptualized and distorted into this sort of nightmare scenario was very compelling and clever. The general controls, abilities, and movement felt well designed and contributed to the world feeling tangible. I found the areas in the game quite enveloping and endearing in their creepy fashion. The game is quite short, even with the included DLC, and the monsters are a bit bothersome more than scary. All in all, I really enjoyed this peculiar perspective for a horror game and would recommend a playthrough (although at a discounted price.)			"

												If I could give this two thumbs up, I would. This game is amazing and beautifully done. It’s a really short game, which should be around 3 hours but my gameplay is longer because I was in and out and I got lost in the forest. Then went back to get an achievement. The story is well done, the sounds are well done. You play a helpless baby that has to hide away from a scary being. Overall this game is truly amazing. I have one more thing to do which is play the prologue. I highly recommend this game to anyone!  "

												So let me start out by saying i love this game i was so excited the day it came out.Its a really good playthrough with some twist and turns.Its just really short. They did come out with a free dlc which i think i enjoyed more then the main story for some reason lol but that only adds 30-45 minutes of playtime.If your thinking about getting it i would wait until theres a sale but other then that i would definitely recommend it. I think everyone who loves these kind of games should experience it. If you want to check out the free dlc here is some gameplay of it!

												Among the Sleep is really something. It's such a unique game and a fresh and new take into horror - something original that hasn't been done before. The story and game are really short, but the story-telling is incredible and beautiful and so well done.You play the protagonist role of a 2 year old toddler, you're movement is slow and sluggish, you can't travel anywhere too fast or you'll fall over, but crawling around is great because you're used to that! You can interact with the world around you by pushing buttons, picking things up, turning them around and looking at them and doing other things as you explore the world around you and develop. However, this is where the story telling begins. You experience the story in such a parculiar yet fascinating perspective of the young and still developing mind of this 2 year old. So things aren't as they seem, things are confusing and odd, but a key piece of detail I love the developers for is simple yet so effective.The world around you is new and scary. There's not a great deal I can tell you without spoiling the game and I don't intend to as it is an experience that is satisfying to indulge into.  Is this game worth buying? Yes, but be sure to pick it up on a sale as it is REALLY short. You can get through the game and its DLC in a matter of a couple of hours, but don't let that put you off, it is a truly interesting and amazing game that almost brought a tear to my eye when I understood the story behind it.

												You carry around a teddy bear that you can hug :)Among the Sleep is a well polished indie horror game which has an interesting concept. You are a two year old toddler and the world you see is from the perspective of a child. A lot of ordinary items and rooms seem much more scary and the developers have nailed it. The graphics are decent but feel sometimes unoptimized. Gameplay is nice and and the game does not sail on cliches. The story is very good and rather than leaving you scared it draws it all nicely together in the end. Personally, the length of the game didn't bother me because the experience was intense.Graphics 7/10Story 10/10Gameplay 8/10Concept 8/10 "

												Spoiler alert...I recommend this game if you want a short but meaningful experience about alcoholism in the home and its relationship with child neglect.  You can rush this game, as nothing can hurt you and its easy to continue and go the other way after you get caught.  You can hide under tables or in cupboards but it best to just move forward without hesistation.  Don't walk off high ledges or into water and you will continue quickly.  The steam achievements are great to get a perfect game with only 4 to achieve:  Knock over the pins in the first room, find the xylophone in the woods playground, find the bad music box in the cupboards area and complete the game to get the final award.  Don't forget to play the prologue (a prequel): yes the ending is in the snow under a tree and it will seem like you got ripped off (if you were the toddler).			"

However, there is more story in 20 minutes of gameplay of Among the Sleep than there is in 7 hours of many other bigger title horror games. It's fantastic, I absolutely reccomend.			"

												This game is great for people who like horror games without a lot of blood or gore. Great storyline, and a very interesting concept! Very creepy.The only problem I have with this game is the enormous amount of lag on laptops. My laptop literally could not run it, and I had to switch to a PC instead, which improved it, but there was still a bit of lag here and there. The lag is the only thing that stops me from giving this game a 10/10.So, overall, its a great game with an awesome concept and storyline, but the lag takes away from the experience a bit. I would wait until a sale on steam, because right now, I don't think that it is worth $20. I'd give it about a 7/10. "

												This was an extremely enjoyable game, and in the end, I had feelings of being deprived and longing. The game is very short, but in the end you are almost thankful but for all of the good reasons. You get to see the story conclude on subject matter that for a while, only seem like speculation. The topic that the game is focused around is very real and very few times do we actually get to experience something similar to that from a child's perspective. Caught in conflict such as these, the child always remains the silent victim. Even with the unfortunate circumstances surrounding the situation, the child continue to push forward to rescue and save his mother (a touching story).  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good scare, is a big fan of great and touching story line, and can give it the 3-4 hours to play through the main story and intro.  All should play through the main game prior to taking on the DLC for maximum enjoyment.			"

												I really liked this game! I have played it thru twice... and also played the DLC and played that too.  This game has suspense and some scary moments, but not so bad you can deal with it.  I think for the price, it is a nice game to play. It has an odd back story which you would never ever expect!!  Its kind of a sad back story, that may hit home for some and bring back some rough memories.  I think its an amazing storyline...  and I think the second time i played it, everything made even more sense to me.I give it thumbs up... and think its a good bargin and a good buy.  My teenager LOVES this game, and it scared the heck out of him!  He did not play the game, but just sat beside me and cringed and jumped and shreeked!  He was terrified of the monster comingPlaying this at night, in the dark with the volume up really makes it more exciting.			"

												Amazing. This is pretty unique.  Great for horror concept - it drags you back into that dark scary night-time of your childhood.  Like Amnesia, play for the story, less than playing to win.  Unlike Amnesia, I stayed scared after I 'died' the first time.  Your teddy is creepy and suspect to begin with, despite the fact that your character loves him. I don't know if that was intentional.   I'd say it was too short, but between the funding it probably got, and the story itself, I'd say it's more than acceptable.			"

												Ok, I will admit, I put off picking this game up because other reviews mentioned it as being short.   Maybe it is if you play it strait through.  However, I will say that this dark ""American McGee's Alice in wonderland-esk"" game is quite well made and a very nice distraction if you love stories that take place in brooding nightmarish environments.  It definately made me jump a few times, and kept me on the edge of my seat.  There's a little puzzle solving, but nothing too challenging, and even some sneaking/avoidance similar to some of my favorite games like Outlast and Amnisia.  I reccomend this mostly for the mood and story in some very strange nightmarish environments.			"

												Among the Sleep is a horror game from the perspective of a baby. I really wish I could say I liked it more. I mean, your walking animation is just adorable, with your little star pajamas and clenched fists waving around full of infant determination. Sprinting is walking on all fours, which is also clever.Other than that, there's not much to the game. How could there be? The game can be finished in about two hours, including the prequel free DLC and even then it doesn’t have much to show for those two hours. The boogeyman can barely catch you, except when he's scripted to show up on your tail. There are no mechanics except some very light climbing and block pushing. It's baby's first puzzle game, which is odd, since it seemed to be a game with a child, not a game for a child. By the end, the game does have some interesting elements with adult themes that a baby couldn't understand, but it's not much to go on. Seeing normal things from a very low perspective also make some mundane things very menacing, but there's not much more to that either. The game is set in a well-realised, but a bit trite nightmare otherworld that almost every other horror game has been putting out since Silent Hill.Among the Sleep is okay, but I would not recommend it to anyone but a diehard horror fan that wants to try everything.

During the (only) 3 hours it takes you to play through the game in its entirety you will find yourself bored, not scared and wondering if you payed far too much for a game with far too little scares or fun (I personally believe I did). In all honesty the only person I would reccomend this game to is someone whos never played a horror game before. It simply just doesnt compare to the horror game greats of the last 15 years.

												Cool premise but clumsy execution is what lets down Among the Sleep in the long run. That said the atmosphere and settings are pretty solid, its just too bad that the gameplay elements are very shallow. And it doesn't help either that the games puzzle elements are very basic and i would be impressed if anyone even remotely familiar with games would get stuck in any of them.Sound design is decent, ambient noises being the best of them while the music can be very haunting. The dialogues and voice acting is serviceable but nothing really stands out. The strong suits of Among the Sleep's core game elements are definitely the different set pieces and the atmosphere.The story was actually really interesting, i don't think i have ever played a game that tried to tackle this sort of subject. Which i found really refreshing, and actually made it all worth while for me.I took me one and a half hour to finish roughly, and to be honest there is nothing really worth going back for. Once you have experience the story, there is nothing drawing you back for a second time through.I'm not sure if i should recommend it or not. It's by no means a ""bad"" game at all, but it's not a really good game either. I guess i could say its bordering on mediocrity. If you are a fan of Amnesia, Outlast and the plethora of other survival horror games that's out there now, Among the Sleep won't really fill those shoes. It's not particularly scary nor is is very engaging. But of course that is all subjective and differs from person to person.Bottom line, Among the Sleep does have an interesting story with a subject matter that doesn't come around very often. So for that reason alone i would actually recommend the game alone. But i would suggest you wait for a price reduction. "

Most of these areas are actually quite and small, and there isn't really much to look at most of the time, but there are elements of puzzle-solving and hiding which flesh out the game a bit.  The controls are very well designed, and suit the xbox 360 controller very well.I look forward to anything else the devs come up with, and will recommend this game to anyone, especially if it can be had in a sale.

A bit different than other horror games since it puts you in the body of a baby and how he perceives the world. Anyways worth getting especially on sale and I believe they added some free DLC that I have yet to try, but the base game was good.			"

												This game gave me some surreal feelings of those times when I was a child, had a nightmare, and woke up to no one else in the house and scared the bejeezus out of me. How the real world and its traumas were conceptualized and distorted into this sort of nightmare scenario was very compelling and clever. The general controls, abilities, and movement felt well designed and contributed to the world feeling tangible. I found the areas in the game quite enveloping and endearing in their creepy fashion. The game is quite short, even with the included DLC, and the monsters are a bit bothersome more than scary. All in all, I really enjoyed this peculiar perspective for a horror game and would recommend a playthrough (although at a discounted price.)			"

												Great game, fun to play, full of atmospheric horror, and interesting premise and elements of puzzle solving and exploration.It is a short game, with little replay value but definitely worth playing.What wasn't obvious to me is the game isn't 'set in the house' of the trailer, most of the game is in outdoor, and dark twisted environments.  Most of these areas are actually quite and small, and there isn't really much to look at most of the time, but there are elements of puzzle-solving and hiding which flesh out the game a bit.  The controls are very well designed, and suit the xbox 360 controller very well.I look forward to anything else the devs come up with, and will recommend this game to anyone, especially if it can be had in a sale.

Among the sleep is beautiful ""horror""(more like thriller) game with excellent and teaching plot. U are playing the game as a small kid in the age it can't even speak. Everything looks scary and huge to our character that makes this game something fresh and really enjoyable to play in that perspective.Pros:+Beautiful graphics+Excellent atmosphere+Original content+It releases primal fear (lol)+Really touchable plot with the messageCons:-Short game (2,5-3 hours)Honestly it's the only Con i can find in this game.

The atmosphere keeps up throughout the game, and the visuals and themes are very nice.A lot of people have been complaining about the length of the game being too short, if you're one to measure the value of a game as being how long you actually spend playing it then don't buy the game, or at least wait until there's a sale to pick it up.If on the other hand you measure the value of the game by how it makes you feel playing it and the experiences that you take away, then let me just finish by saying that this game is one hell of an experience to play.

												So let me start out by saying i love this game i was so excited the day it came out.Its a really good playthrough with some twist and turns.Its just really short. They did come out with a free dlc which i think i enjoyed more then the main story for some reason lol but that only adds 30-45 minutes of playtime.If your thinking about getting it i would wait until theres a sale but other then that i would definitely recommend it. I think everyone who loves these kind of games should experience it. If you want to check out the free dlc here is some gameplay of it!

			The game is incredibly short and once while playing the crawl button bugged out. However this game is incredibly dark, possibly the darkest game I have ever played so far.

												So here's what I felt about the story and atmosphere of this game in particular hopefully without spoiling anything:At first it didn't make too much sense and I felt as if it were just going to throw me, a two year old man, into a dark helpless environment where everything was out to kill me. However it only did part of that. The atmosphere was very well constructed to resemble what a two year old could possibly be taking in if it were scared of something. Everything that was around me that I would look to for direction and expected to be able to read was surprisingly to me, not in English. It was symbols and characters that made me think that it was the doing of aliens. However, looking back on it after completing the game, and realizing the message of the game, it wasn't in English because I was just a two year old. That struck me as interesting. Another thing on the topic of me being scared ♥♥♥♥less looking to the environment for direction is that there were drawings. In all the little nooks and cranny's that I would crawl to to hide from whatever I thought was chasing me had a little drawing of what a child would interpret towards whatever the ♥♥♥♥ was going down. That was another thing that I was impressed with. Now, when it comes to scary♥♥♥♥♥♥ I do not like to be a part of it. Sure I'll watch it, but ♥♥♥♥ everything about participating in it and leading the charge. But this game really got me hooked. I was a little sad but relieved that it was so short, but I feel like they timed everything just perfectly. And the noises... ♥♥♥♥ those noises. But back to the point here. The game didn't focus on jump-scaring a ♥♥♥♥♥, but instead it focused on timing events just right to where the smallest mistake you make would scare the junk out of you. It really made you pay attention to what you were doing, where you were crawling/walking/bumping into, and why you were seeing the things you were. Unlike Amnesia, it really plays with more emotions than just fear. It gives you that feeling of ""Why"" rather than ""Okay, that just happened"" forcing you to investigate and become more interested in what happens rather than making you feel like you have to just escape from what happened. Also, as Halo has proven, if you can see your feet it's a good game. You can see your feet. On that note, your character acts as a 2 year old would if it was scared. (Constantly playing with it's belly button, making little squeeking noises, hugging your bear for security, etc) As the story progresses,♥♥♥♥♥♥naturally gets more freaky, but starts to foreshadow into what you ultimately discover at the end. I can't really go further into it without spoiling, but its really just a fantastic game. I hated the feels the whole way through in a good way, but I just couldn't get enough of it. I had to know, and when I found out, it was a wrecking ball of awesome. The key to this game is immersion. Without it, you're wasting your time. I recommend this game to any player who enjoys a good story. You will not be disappointed.TL;DR: Among the Sleep = bigger man-tears boner than The Notebook could ever dream to present.			"

												As others have stated, Among the Sleep is a short game, but a rather enjoyable one. For those thrill seekers looking for nightmares and psychological scarring, this isn't the game for you, but if you can put yourself in the mindframe of a toddler, it has some good 'jump scare' moments. Overall I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 rating. I'd like to see a sequel made, perhaps even when the child is another year or two older and the challenges are a bit more difficult. There is potential for a series of games that one can grow with, if the creators can stay true to the original style of game play, but advance with each storyline.			"

That's how much I enjoyed it! But for a game that can be beaten in one or two sittings, it's a masterpiece. I fully recommend it to all who enjoy majorly creepy (and slightly twisted) games. 10/10 would crawl again.			"

												A creative, if short, experience for those looking for a new horror fix.GAMEPLAY: Mostly consists of exploring environments and solving fairly simple physics-based puzzles (think Penumbra/Amnesia), with the odd stealth/hiding section to avoid enemies. It's not groundbreaking, but this game does some cool things, adapting the gameplay mechanics to fit its subject matter. Given that you play as a toddler, you crawl faster than you can run, and you can fall down if you run for too long. However, crawling can limit your perception of the environment somewhat, and just ""feels"" strange. It adds an interesting dimension to the gameplay. Furthermore, rather than just giving you a flashlight, your source of light comes from cuddling your teddy bear. Sure, the effect is mostly the same (albeit with a more limited radius) but it's creative and serves to immerse the player.GRAPHICS: Looks pretty good. There's a nice contrast between bright coloured objects in dark environments, and the lighting adds to the environments by bathing them in an eerie glow. ENVIRONMENTS: Surreal, they seem like dark fairytales and nightmares, but with a lighthearted twist at once. They're not overbearingly scary, but rather, serve to make the player feel lost in a dream. Perhaps their most interesting attribute is that everything is ""big"" (sometimes disproportionately so), reflecting the youth of the protagonist. On the downside, they're sparsely decorated at times and there isn't a whole lot to explore along the fairly linear paths.AUDIO: Good sound effects all around, and the music is ambient and serves it pretty well. The highlight is definitely Roger L. Jackson as Teddy (of American McGee's Alice fame) whose distinctive voice lends its warmth and sense of curiosity to the story. Some creepy sound effects punctuate the generally quiet of the game, with one enemy noise in particular being pretty jarring.ENEMIES: There aren't many (only two from what I recall) but they're pretty eerie and are the impetus for the stealth sections. They continue the theme of childlike wonder, being large and overbearing. One seems like a creature from a fairy tale, with another looking like something a child would see in the shadows at night from everyday objects. HORROR: This is the department that the game falls a bit short in. I don't think this game was going for Amnesia-style horror here, but it still isn't particularly scary. For me, it was quite tense at the beginning, but I found that it wore off unless I knew there were monsters present.STORY: Without giving away anything, it pulls a few punches and is very good. The ending is quite impactful, and I was quite surprised at the direction it took.VALUE: It's a pretty short game, so I'd recommend getting it on sale.			"

												I'm pretty impressed with this horror game. While the short length might be off-putting for some, I think the game is exactly as long as it should be; lengthening this sort of game would produce fluff, and I dislike fluff more than a short game.  Among the Sleep is well executed in terms of mechanics, tone, and narrative.  The story is better than I gave it credit for when I started playing, and it is told well through the environment and character design.   **minor spoilers**While the mechanics are simple, there are design choices worth noting.  For one, the option to crawl or walk is done in an interesting way; the player can't grab things or clutch the teddy bear for light while he crawls, but he moves faster, has a lower profile, and is not prone to falling.  I felt much more comfortable and ""safer"" while crawling.  Walking is clearly made the riskier choice, but  the player has to do it regularly in order to progress.  The player is faced with a similar delima with holding the teddy bear.  It sheds some light, but the toddler can't interact with objects while he holds the bear.  I thought  the developers made some very good choices with even the limitted mechanics options.  The player had to consistantly perform actions outside of a toddler's comfort zone (and mine; I would have liked to crawl  the whole game) in order to continue processing what was happening to him.The environmental design (visual and sound) is wonderful, sets a consistant tone, and is meaningful.  Look at the screen shots and trailer.  Enough said.  I won't say much about the character design except that when I first saw it, I hid under the bed for like two minutes (in game, of course...).I won't spoil much about the story either, but it is great to see more video games using things like themes, motifs, mechanics, symbolism, and subtlty to tell a story rather than strictly dialogue/text.  I thought all of the ""words"" in the game being random squiggles was a very cute yet alienating detail.Overall, this is one of the most well-executed games I've played recently.  There are a few parts that drag a bit toward the beginning, but the game as a whole is worth the slow parts.  Movement, opening drawers, and throwing objects is cumbersome at times, but, well, you're playing as a baby.  It kind of comes with the territory.Fans of horror and story-centric games would probably enjoy this.			"

												Cool premise but clumsy execution is what lets down Among the Sleep in the long run. That said the atmosphere and settings are pretty solid, its just too bad that the gameplay elements are very shallow. And it doesn't help either that the games puzzle elements are very basic and i would be impressed if anyone even remotely familiar with games would get stuck in any of them.Sound design is decent, ambient noises being the best of them while the music can be very haunting. The dialogues and voice acting is serviceable but nothing really stands out. The strong suits of Among the Sleep's core game elements are definitely the different set pieces and the atmosphere.The story was actually really interesting, i don't think i have ever played a game that tried to tackle this sort of subject. Which i found really refreshing, and actually made it all worth while for me.I took me one and a half hour to finish roughly, and to be honest there is nothing really worth going back for. Once you have experience the story, there is nothing drawing you back for a second time through.I'm not sure if i should recommend it or not. It's by no means a ""bad"" game at all, but it's not a really good game either. I guess i could say its bordering on mediocrity. If you are a fan of Amnesia, Outlast and the plethora of other survival horror games that's out there now, Among the Sleep won't really fill those shoes. It's not particularly scary nor is is very engaging. But of course that is all subjective and differs from person to person.Bottom line, Among the Sleep does have an interesting story with a subject matter that doesn't come around very often. So for that reason alone i would actually recommend the game alone. But i would suggest you wait for a price reduction. "

												Among the Sleep is a psychological adventure game where you are put in the shoes (so to speak) of a toddler while he tries to find her missing mother during nighttime with the help of his fellow, rather talkative teddy bear companion.You navigate the various environments of the game from the very eyes of the toddler: you are mainly tasked to overcome various obstacles along your path (by either crowling, climbing or rarely use some items you collected and put in an inventory) and advance further through the chapters. You can also hug Teddy to illuminate your surrondings (even if, sadly, this feature isn't brought up as much as one would expect).While many believe this is a full-fledged horror game, Among the Sleep is more interested into make you see how disturbing reality can be when saw from a toddler's point of view and how it twists everything it touches. Therefore, don't expect any jump scare or chases: the game is very tense and will sometime try to screw with you, but that's pretty much about it.The graphics are stylized enough, with their strongest suit being the peculiar and warped level design. The same cannot be said for other models in the game, but they don't tend to stand out that much.If you love that kind of games that can offer you an unique and ""artistic"" experience without being that keen on a superb gameplay, Among the Sleep could be yet another game to add to your Steam library			"

During the (only) 3 hours it takes you to play through the game in its entirety you will find yourself bored, not scared and wondering if you payed far too much for a game with far too little scares or fun (I personally believe I did). In all honesty the only person I would reccomend this game to is someone whos never played a horror game before. It simply just doesnt compare to the horror game greats of the last 15 years.

												The developers promised Oculus support on release, they are still promising it but only after working out their console deal... really... this is not a developer worth supporting. They promised the moon to score a quick buck and then ran with your money. I am very disappointed that a developer would take so very much money from VR supporters and then first work to re-write their game for consoles before implementing that support... it is disgusting and dishonest. Also everyone who backed this on Kickstarter solely because of its Oculus claim and those who purchased it on steam because it lists VR in its description should file a class action lawsuit against Krillbite Studio for not delivering on your investment. There need to be consequences for this kind of deception.			"

												Among the Sleep is a horror game from the perspective of a baby. I really wish I could say I liked it more. I mean, your walking animation is just adorable, with your little star pajamas and clenched fists waving around full of infant determination. Sprinting is walking on all fours, which is also clever.Other than that, there's not much to the game. How could there be? The game can be finished in about two hours, including the prequel free DLC and even then it doesn’t have much to show for those two hours. The boogeyman can barely catch you, except when he's scripted to show up on your tail. There are no mechanics except some very light climbing and block pushing. It's baby's first puzzle game, which is odd, since it seemed to be a game with a child, not a game for a child. By the end, the game does have some interesting elements with adult themes that a baby couldn't understand, but it's not much to go on. Seeing normal things from a very low perspective also make some mundane things very menacing, but there's not much more to that either. The game is set in a well-realised, but a bit trite nightmare otherworld that almost every other horror game has been putting out since Silent Hill.Among the Sleep is okay, but I would not recommend it to anyone but a diehard horror fan that wants to try everything.

So scary in fact, that I had to play the song Spanish Flea in the background to lighten up the mood so I could get through it.At points it can be difficult to figure out where to go, but otherwise it's a very creepy and atmospheric game.

												So here's what I felt about the story and atmosphere of this game in particular hopefully without spoiling anything:At first it didn't make too much sense and I felt as if it were just going to throw me, a two year old man, into a dark helpless environment where everything was out to kill me. However it only did part of that. The atmosphere was very well constructed to resemble what a two year old could possibly be taking in if it were scared of something. Everything that was around me that I would look to for direction and expected to be able to read was surprisingly to me, not in English. It was symbols and characters that made me think that it was the doing of aliens. However, looking back on it after completing the game, and realizing the message of the game, it wasn't in English because I was just a two year old. That struck me as interesting. Another thing on the topic of me being scared ♥♥♥♥less looking to the environment for direction is that there were drawings. In all the little nooks and cranny's that I would crawl to to hide from whatever I thought was chasing me had a little drawing of what a child would interpret towards whatever the ♥♥♥♥ was going down. That was another thing that I was impressed with. Now, when it comes to scary♥♥♥♥♥♥ I do not like to be a part of it. Sure I'll watch it, but ♥♥♥♥ everything about participating in it and leading the charge. But this game really got me hooked. I was a little sad but relieved that it was so short, but I feel like they timed everything just perfectly. And the noises... ♥♥♥♥ those noises. But back to the point here. The game didn't focus on jump-scaring a ♥♥♥♥♥, but instead it focused on timing events just right to where the smallest mistake you make would scare the junk out of you. It really made you pay attention to what you were doing, where you were crawling/walking/bumping into, and why you were seeing the things you were. Unlike Amnesia, it really plays with more emotions than just fear. It gives you that feeling of ""Why"" rather than ""Okay, that just happened"" forcing you to investigate and become more interested in what happens rather than making you feel like you have to just escape from what happened. Also, as Halo has proven, if you can see your feet it's a good game. You can see your feet. On that note, your character acts as a 2 year old would if it was scared. (Constantly playing with it's belly button, making little squeeking noises, hugging your bear for security, etc) As the story progresses,♥♥♥♥♥♥naturally gets more freaky, but starts to foreshadow into what you ultimately discover at the end. I can't really go further into it without spoiling, but its really just a fantastic game. I hated the feels the whole way through in a good way, but I just couldn't get enough of it. I had to know, and when I found out, it was a wrecking ball of awesome. The key to this game is immersion. Without it, you're wasting your time. I recommend this game to any player who enjoys a good story. You will not be disappointed.TL;DR: Among the Sleep = bigger man-tears boner than The Notebook could ever dream to present.			"

												This game is short, but the adventure it takes you on is very enjoyable. You will take this entire trip as a crawling, stumbling 2 year old who is tossed into a land that is both beautiful and freightening.Anyone that enjoys a good scare and a decent story should give this game a chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed with it.Also be sure to check out the DLC that is included for free.			"

												Amazing game.  Don't expect a fast paced, action game, but one that takes time to build a beautiful, and frightening, environment.  The sound design is second to none, and easily the creepiest part of this game.  Just an amazing play.  Sorry I was so late to the party on this one.			"

												Disclaimer: I had fun playing this game, so this is why I put Thumbs up (Recommend) But I'd put a ''meh'' thumbs for the rest.The game is really short (about 2 hours) and the ending is... really disapointing. I won't spoil anything, but I expected more than the cliché it delivered.You are a 2 year old child, and it feels charming. The game, in itself is gorgeous I believe. The controls are simple and ok and I just love the Teddy. But the game is a bit ''too simple'' and too easy. The only part I had a hard time with is finding the last exit after running around an hour (I was really tired, so it's not even the game's fault).This is clearly meant to be a game that you see the world from the eye and the mind of a child and I get that the world he sees is not really the world as it is.The real con is... The game is not scary... in any way. It's not scary as an experience (I didn't felt helpless), it's not jumpscary (yes, there are monsters... 2 times) it's not freaky. I mean, there should've been emphasis on the child's feeling and how it changes his perception of the world, and no emphasis on the child's body. We get it... he's small and can't climb a lot of things. I want to know how he/she feels (I am still not sure about the sex of the infant) not how it moves... we pretty much all know how a baby moves. A child sees his furniture big: MAKE IT BIG! Don't make it real size, make it like the baby sees it!Also, the Teddy, while being cute, puts too much emphasis on the ''It's dark here, I don't like it'' and... nothing happens.The ''puzzles'' are too simple (yes I know, it reflects the child's capabilities... but as a player I would've like to be challenge in a new way like ''What would a baby do in that situation''. Not... ''Oh... there is 6 holes here... there 6 owls to find... I am not sure what i am supose to do''So I would kind of recommend it, because it is fun... and that the adventures worth the game. But... THE PRICE! This game isn't worth 19.99$. There is no exploration per se (the only places you ''explore'' are to find ''keys'' to put in ''switches'') and the rest are just narrow spaces that you go from point A to point B.The overall design is great though. The music is awesome, the visuals are great and the sounds are also great. The word ''Atmospheric'' really pin point the game, as it surrounds you with beautifulness.But the story... and the gameplay are a bit disapointing. Not BAD, disapointing! It could've been more (Well, every game could bee more, but I mean, as this game in itself, it could've been more)Finish it! (Completionist Ranking)			"

												As others have stated, Among the Sleep is a short game, but a rather enjoyable one. For those thrill seekers looking for nightmares and psychological scarring, this isn't the game for you, but if you can put yourself in the mindframe of a toddler, it has some good 'jump scare' moments. Overall I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 rating. I'd like to see a sequel made, perhaps even when the child is another year or two older and the challenges are a bit more difficult. There is potential for a series of games that one can grow with, if the creators can stay true to the original style of game play, but advance with each storyline.			"

												Among the Sleep is an interesting idea in storytelling, done in such a way that you truly feel for the mission of the main character; however, I had some minor issues with it.(As i haven't played it in a good deal of time, prior to this review, I'll keep this brief):CONS: - Can be confusing; had a few issues finding where to go, or what I was looking for, due to the odd layout of a few stages- Protagonist sure can do a lot for a child... kind of hurts immersion, but only if you're picky, like I am.PROS: - Nice visuals and atmosphere- Brilliant concept- Lots of heart and dedication went into this game, and it shows.So, if you are looking for a fairly casual, yet still captivating in it's own right kind of game, then pick up Among the Sleep.You won't be disappointed.Recommended, but on sale is always best :)			"

												I really liked Among the Sleep. They did a good job with putting the player in the role of a 2 year old and seeing the world through his eyes. The game isn't really scary. It does have tense moments, though. It's dark, disorienting and sometimes confusing...like how the world can seem to little kids at night. This is a fantasy game set in the world of the kids projections of his surroundings as he tries to find his mom. There was one part in the beginning that really creeped me out. The kid is seemingly all alone in his room, but a man's voice is clearly heard giggling from somewhere nearby, unseen, like a psycho murderous clown waiting to leap out and murder the kid. I'll say no more about that! The puzzles of the game were really easy to figure out, but this was a really fun and interesting world to explore. The art direction is fantastic. The atmosphere of the game is really well done. The game is only a few hours long. I'm a busy guy and I appreciate that I was able to start and finish it in one night. The only part that actually seemed like padding is the added DLC that is essentially a side story that was only slightly related to the main game. Still, it was nice to have that extra little bit to play when the game was done. I suggest playing this one in the dark with head phones, and turning the brightness down. Among the Sleep is solid and an easy recommendation.			"

Among The Sleep is a stellar little interactive adventure with some light horror elements and some good-looking surreal imagery. You play as a toddler of unspecified gender who wakes up one night to find his mother and his trusty teddy bear missing. You have to navigate the intricacies of the dream world, solving puzzles, finding keys, and avoiding a horrible monster that's totally not meant to be symbolic of anything, honest.It's really short; I wouldn't recommend buying it at the current price, but at a price drop, it's definitely a pleasant interactive experience and the light horor elements are done really well. It's also very similar to Amnesia and other games in that genre, so if you're not into the whole First Person Horror Adventure thing, I'd probably give this pass.If you played Amnesia, and felt it would be better if you were 4 feet shorter and had a best friend Teddy Bear, Among The Sleep is for you.

												Are you searching for a rather unique type of horror experience? Has your thirst for psychological torment this year not been quenched yet? Do you crave to relive old childhood nightmares? Then Among The Sleep might be for you...This delightfully terrifying experience grants gamers the opportunity to explore a creepy Silent Hill-esque world of terror through the eyes of a toddler. That premise alone should capture anyone's curiosity. For what does a helpless baby represent the most? Exactly... Helplessness. You are no soldier, no athletic investigator - just a baby in the land of giants. One that can barely walk on two feet. You don't get to see that type of scenario every day. But what can be said about the game itself?Both music and sounds, arguably the most important parts of any horror game, do not disappoint. You'll often be looking over your shoulder to check whether that ominous noise in the distance was really just part of the ambiance or instead a sinister monster stalking you. Among The Sleep definitely plays it's cards well, and spends a good quarter of it's length on excellent build-up to the main events. Especially the first big area, a forested house located within a foggy swamp, managed to freak me out again and again. I'd not want to return there anytime soon, that's for sure.In terms of gameplay you'll be collecting stuff in order to access new places. A lot of stuff. Perhaps too much stuff? Eh, it didn't bother me in all honesty. The environments are beautifully designed, and keep things interesting enough to overshadow the simplistic puzzles. I swear to god though... That evil forest. Or the playground before it. The atmosphere oozes greatness around every corner. You'll never know what to expect next. Better grow used to being all alone, for your only ""companion"" happens to be a teddy bear - one who also serves as a sort of light source if hugged tightly. How charming. Well, you take what you can get as a toddler. Flashlights ain't cheap!HOWEVER... Among The Sleep unfortunately isn't perfect. The second half of it, in my opinion, happens to be much weaker than the first, which feels as if the developers spent most of their budget on it, only to run out of significant ideas later on. This is quite a shame indeed. And it doesn't stop there. The game is also a rather short experience. Two - three hours, maybe four if you take it slow, are what most players will probably get out of it. And that length is somewhat disappointing, considering that you need to pay 20 bucks for it. Even the story, despite feeling intriguing at points, ultimately fails to outweigh these negatives. After reaching the end, you'll be left with that bothersome ""is it over already?"" feeling in your gut. Such wasted potential.In conclusion, I'd say that you should give Among The Sleep a try. I greatly enjoyed my time with it, despite some flaws along the way. And chances are you will as well. But it might be wise to wait for a price drop. Chances are you'd probably feel a little cheated to pay 20 bucks for a game that only last two hours if you play through it in a fast-paced manner.TL;DR: Good horror. Starts out strong, leaves a little to be desired in the second half. Overall too short for 20 bucks.FINAL VERDICT: 7 / 10			"

												A very unique take on FPS horror, the first 30-45 minutes along were worth buying the game. Its difficult to maintain the same tension of the early portions of the game, but the developers sensed this and introduced some puzzle dynamics. In a way I wanted the early tension to continue, but the level design and ""encounters"" in the later game were very worth it and I loved the ending. Its very short, but it took me a while to beat it because I only played 30 minutes to an hour at a time before being worn out (in a good way). Very worth the money.			"

It is however quite short.The gameplay is quite similar to the Amnesia series, where in you are given an objective to complete but there is a monster lurking, and your only options is to go unnoticed.  Since this game has you you playing as a 2 year old child in a suburban household, rather than a student of the occult in a victorian era castle the subject matter is lighter, but only slightly.  It would seem that a child imagination is a powerful thing, and that left alone in a dark house with a very real threat lurking things can get dark quickly. It is however quite short.  I was able to get through all of the story and the free DLC in ~4 hours. Definitely wait for a sale for this, < $10 seems more appropriate. "

												Perhaps scarier than outlast. The Atmosphere of the game is where it exells. The games about a child coping with his parents break up and the psychological effects its having on him.If your someone who likes the get alot of time for there money then wait for a sale, becuse its a pretty short game (about as long as a movie). But i definitly recommend this game. Im personaly glad it wasent a longer game I feel it might of stretched the emotions in the game thin.			"

												You're a baby!  I mean, in the GAME ""Among the Sleep"" you play as a baby.  I real life, you may or may not actually be a baby.  I don't know.The game, just so you know, only took me about two and half hours to complete.  I'm assuming that's because most babies have the attention span of a squirrel that got one too many jolts from a taser.  I don't speak from experience.  Honest.Where was I?  My attention wavered ...So it's baby's birthday, and Mom gives the little bxxxxxd cake loaded with LSD (I'm assuming, 'cause the game goes totally bxxxxxt later), and a broken 3rd-rate pirate knock-off of Teddy Ruxpin.  I was disappointed, 'cause I was kinda hoping he'd be vulgar like the bear from Ted.  Bummer.So baby goes exploring and has some adventures, and he finds all these crayon drawings somebody drew (maybe his Mom.  I mean, she IS the one that dosed his cake with LSD).And if you bother to look at the sxxxxy drawings, they kinda tell a story ... if you're into that.  Story's not very clear, 'cause whoever crayoned those pictures can't draw for sxxt.Anyway, as baby crawls and stumbles around his increasingly twisted and psychedelic home, he starts getting stalked by a monster.  The monster is really scary, so I don't know why baby wasn't screaming hysterically and leaving sxxt-trails everywhere (like I woulda been, had I been in that situation), but I suppose maybe there were downers in the cake too, so baby's fine.  Hides under stuff.  Spies.Eventually you reach the end, and it's poignant and sxxt.It's a beautiful game.  It's an original idea.  Never played a baby before.  Story's cool ... what I understood of it from those awful crayonings.  But it's two and half hours long.They coulda done a lot more with it.  I hope they have some dlc ... ""Among the sleep ... with knives"" or something.			"

												Best horror game I've ever played!Great storyline, kept me guessing right til the end, stunning visuals (I liked how blocky and colourful it was despite still being creepy as hell), non repetitive - much rather complete this in the 3 hours it took me than 6 hours with repetitive gameplay - and most importantly for a horror: scary enough to make me scream/hide but not scary enough to stop me wanting to play.The only criticism would be that I would often struggle to trigger the 'climb' action, but this is a relatively small problem.9.5/10			"

												Probably the only game where protagonist is a toddler in pajamas and your sidekick is a teddy bear. I'm not kidding...The game is unique, no doubt about that, especially with a dark story with really creepy atmosphere. Lighting, poor lighting, shadows, noises and music play a huge role in it. Especially in aspect where I totally love the game but if someone asked me what I like about it, I wouldn't really be able to tell what that is. I mean, imagine Alien:Isolation, but where you are a toddler. Total mind♥♥♥♥. It seems like Alien:Isolation devs kinda got inspiration from this game...The game is incredibly short (a bit over 3 hours including DLC gameplay), so much that despite liking it, I'm unsure if I could justify 20 € on it. 10 € yes, at any time. But 20, sorry it's just way too short despite everything. So, when there will be a -50% deal on Steam, grab it as it's the most unforgettable experience you'll ever have. But if you want to support developers fully, just buy it. It's really good.			"

												Unusual little horror game with some creepy moments and fairly dark subject matter. I enjoyed the added dimensions of playing as a child and found it really interesting way to show a different perspective and add to the atmosphere. As a toddler you are much more vulnrable than most protagonists and the childish viewpoint and items  juxtapose the eerier elements of the game nicely. I managed 2 playthroughs and all achievements in 10 hours played and might argue that it is a little short to buy at full price but certainly worth buying if you catch it on sale.			"

												I loved the concept of Among the Sleep.  How many games have you play through the eyes of a toddler? This is certainly the only one I am aware of.  I can give bonus points for originality here and in a horror title no less, which is no easy thing to do these days.  Among the Sleep does a terrific job at immersing you into the world because of its engrossing atmosphere and ambiance. I will admit I was pretty spooked at certain points.  The mechanics are reminiscent of Frictional Games' Amnesia and Penumbra titles; you can interact with items in the world but there is zero puzzle solving that you will find in the aforementioned games.  It is more so a matter of finding and interacting with objects that help you progress through the game. You cannot fight the few enemies encountered, instead, you must avoid them at all costs and make your way past them.  This characteristic of horror games I have found is either absolutely loved or hated typically.  I personally enjoy it because it puts the player in a helpless state and gives you all the more reason to be scared.  This is, after all, the effect all horror games should invoke.  But there are those who are annoyed or frustrated by this and I can understand that.Among the Sleep unfortunately suffers from a few issues however.  My biggest problem with it is the technical issues I have experienced.  The amount of stuttering I encountered was surprisingly bothersome.  Considering the very short length of the game (anywhere between 1 and 4 hours depending on your playstyle and if you are hunting for achievements), you would have expected it to be significantly more polished.  The stuttering and major fps drops are distracting and certainly take away from game's immersion.  I could have 150 fps for a moment then suddenly it drops just below 60 and it is awfully noticeable.  My rig also is running on an 6600k, gtx 980, and 16 gb of ram, way above the game's recommended requirements.The last but smaller problem I had with the game is the save system.  Throughout each chapter, as you play, the game will notify you that it's saving which is all well and good if you die because you will restart from your last save point.  Unfortunately though, if you quit a chapter mid game, you will have to start that chapter from the very beginning.  Not a huge deal given its short length but misleading because when you see the game autosaving, you assume you can just quit and return at the moment of the auto save, not the case here.All this aside, Among the Sleep is a unique experience and is definitely worth adding to your library.  I would suggest waiting for a nice sale to pick it up though.			"

												Another in the long line of indie horror games that never gets going, has an interesting concept that's quickly abandoned with left-field developments, all filled out with a clichéd and predictable plot.For the horror aspect, well it's best to say: even I wasn't scared by this game. I don't play many horror games, I'm easily scared by their shenanigans, but this one never really tried. It was certainly unsettling, but that's only down to you and how long it takes you to realise you can run around and make as much noise as you like when no demons come out to get you.The concept seemed to be that you're roaming a hunted house or being attacked by demons, but with the killer twist that you're just a baby. This concept is explored for all of 20 minutes, after which you enter alternate worlds (the classic MC Escher-inspired linear platforming, toddler style). It doesn't help that you'll likely guess the ending and major plot points in the first 10 minutes. The characters say or do a couple of things at the start which appear to be hinting and foreshadowing, only for it to turn out they were just saying random crap you shouldn't have analysed.This feels like a 3-hour concept video or game a developer would show publishers to get them to invest and publish a hypothetical full game. It's tempting to recommend this just for the potential it has even though it never used it. Instead it's another game that's best right at the start, then they go ""I guess we better put some generic gameplay crap in there so it's a game"" and it's done.			"

												I really like this game a lot--it's short, sad, and sweet. What makes it unique is the perspective; it's a first person perspective horror game where you play as a 2-year-old toddler. The game really makes you see the world through the imagination and fears of a little child. The visual design of the game succeeds in making benign everyday objects look menacing when in the dark. Is that some sort of monster standing there watching you? Or is it simply a coat on a coat rack with some boots sticking out the bottom of it? Even your own toys can sometimes seem unsettling. I liked how, whenever you see written text in the game, like in an open book, for example, it looks like gibberish, since your character can't read. Sound effects are used effectively at the right times to evoke a sense of dread and fear.In my opinion, the star of the show here is Teddy, your imaginary friend teddy bear who seems alive and who is with you you traverse the dark, avoiding a monster and looking for your missing mother. Teddy is an ambiguous character; cute n' creepy. Is he there to help you or is he not to be trusted? He is well voice-acted, but there are long sections of the game where you almost forget he is with you because he doesn't have much to say. I realize this is under the pretense that you both have to be quite so as not to alert the monster to your presence, but I just feel like Teddy could have been used more in some of the middle sections of the game.I'm not going lie, this game can really get you into the mindset of a small child and I did find myself weeping after the climax and at the end. The game can be scary, but there's no blood and guts or anything. But be aware that the game delves into issues that kids shouldn't have to face, but sometimes do. The evidence to me that this game successfully told a story with some emotional impact was the fact that it gave me the feels even though I had a pretty stable and happy childhood.			"

												This game will impress you. And it will shock you. At first it may seem like a mindless fun little creepy game, but it's not. The story has a true depth to it, one you wouldn't expect. It's an horror game that manages to be real and believable - even relatable for some people with a particular infancy - and that's what makes it truly scary. Something that very few games of this genre have been able to achieve. Given its short duration, about 2-3 hours, some may prefer to grab it on sale for best value.But, by all means, this is a little gem that is certainly worth to add to your collection!			"

												Beautiful, unique, and allegorical, Among the Sleep is a masterpiece of the horror genre.While it probably doesn't have enough jumpscares to satisfy your average horror junkie, this game is absolutely packed with terrifying psychological horror, radiant surrealist imagery, and immersive atmospheres, as well as a tragic story.Reminiscent of Yume Nikki (another game very worth checking out), I found both its dreamy visual style and abstract method of storytelling very impressive. I will say, it was quite short--in fact, I finished it in one night--but it was still every bit worth its pricetag. I would not hesitate to give this game a 10/10.			"

												This game was, in all, pretty nice.I'm not a real connoisseur of horror games, but this was a good kind of pseudo-horror that doesn't cram so many jumpscares down your throat that you have multiple heart attacks in one sitting. I did, however, find myself craving something more in the ""scare factor"" of this game, I find it more of a puzzle game at heart, with some big monsters that you hardly ever see. There's a lot of ambience, and a few forced encounters, but I didn't fail once in the entire game(Okay, so I fell of a cliff, but that doesn't count).I thought the map design and the mechanics were exquisite, crawling up stuff and using chairs to reach doorknobs added a new factor that made the game more intimate(keys and pressure plates are so old), but in all, it was far too short.With all of the crowd-sourced funding and open map design, I think this should have been a $9.99-$14.99 game because there is no replay value, once you solve the puzzle, there's no other way to spend time. Hopefully, Krillbite will have FREE DLC for the game(Like adding chapter 5 maybe), or some more achievements, or an alternate path through the game, or anything...That all aside, I suggest people get this game; but wait for a sale or a mark down in price.

												Among the Sleep takes the horror of helplessness a step further by putting the player in the footie pajamas of a small child. The first person camera wobbles and drags on the ground to simulate the perspective of a child that hasn't quite mastered walking yet, but somehow I still found myself trying to translate the distorted reality the child was seeing instead of living it. The unraveling of that mystery is engaging and I was always left wondering. I didn't manage to sort through it all until everything was properly revealed. But other mediums are just as good if not better at keeping the audience guessing. What games do so well, and what Among the Sleep did not succeed at, is dropping the player in a situation and asking how would they react. As the game itself is as simple to play as it is short, the understanding born of that process never has a chance to come about. Shortness isn't a bad thing though. The game doesn't wear out its welcome and it doesn't take more than it gives. It does have an interesting story to tell, and tells it well, just not better than a movie might.			"

Expereincing Silent Hill as a toddler.""That is Among the Sleep in a nutshell; Silent Hill 2 except the main character is a baby. The game can be finished in a handful of hours, but it's a surprisingly effective horror game, and the pictures and symbolism scattered throughout tells a sad story about both the kid and the monster that stalks him thoughtout the nightmarish landscapes.I highly recommend this game for fans of psychological horror.

There are instances where you are pursued by entities of whatever kind, which did put the stress on and panic as a good scare type game should. If you're looking for something that's more of an adventure than a scare, definitely check this out. It does have it's scare moments though.			"

												Holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥balls. And all of that first sentence is stars immediately. This game is absolutely incredible. If only sheerly for the perspective not only in gameplay, but in narration...Just like the more well known FNAF, there's a lot of stuff hiding in plain sight that reveals some history and the going ons that lead to what's happening right now. Although this time you're not a security guard and they aren't animatronics. You're a very very young toddler of 2, and your life is depicted in drawings. Crude ones, as you'd suspect. As you make your way through hell and back you get tidbits of information that lead suspicions to reality. Soon enough, you live that reality.Some say the imagination of a child is the strongest. Perhaps that is true, as is depicted in this game. What is real and what isn't real doesn't matter any more. You're 2. The world is a big scary place and you're... You, in comparison. Tiny. Dfenseless. Horrified.I found my self mesmerized, comforted, calmed... Then was thrust head first into hell. With incredibly atmospheric gameplay and stunning music this game had me balls deep before the ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial ended. Sucking me in quicker than a whirl pool. Before I knew it the world was like I said, big, terrifying... And I'm all alone... Well, not entirely. Teddy comes  along to aid you but ultimately does nothing other than exposition and plot driving through the stuff that can't be explained so well with out actually telling the player.Teddy tags along and acts mainly as your flashlight. And my god was it comforting to have some ♥♥♥♥ing light. Keep the gama down, play in the dark, keep the sound a little high.It can be rather hard to see and actually explore with the gama too low and too high it ruins the experience. Finding the right balance of both lighting and sound is a bit tricky at first but once done the game is that much more amazing.Its a bit hard to find places to hide when you can't see though, and you can't use Teddy's flashlight ability when crawling and you can't run when using him. You have to stand and meander, which makes it even more stressful when running from the pants fillingly terrifying monsters chasing you. Don't forget, this game is incredibly immersive. If you get immersed, you'd be filling your pants too.The game is a cocktail of smooth relaxing and haunting moments of serenity while momma hums for you, or a music box alludes to peace. Then you get to a puzzle. The puzzles in this game are exceptionally well done as they force the player to explore places they may not have explored. Although it can cause backtracking and a bit of confusion. The game looks, sounds, and feels great though so meandering through the dark, in the dark, scared out of your mind can't be all that bad. After, and sometimes durring, puzzles there's sections of horror. Your little tiny baby legs take you in and out of the gates of hell over and over as the nightmares of the real world /are/ your real world. Constantly being stalked by gargantuant shadowy beings that are seemingly always 3 steps behind you. Always on your heels. Always around the corner.The screen gets a weird loopy filter and its Amnesia all over again. ""Runrunrunrunrun! OOOH FUUUUH-UUCK!"" Sometimes escaping is easy, sometimes not so much as you bump your baby head into the upper part of a hidey hole and get eaten by a hellish nightmare.If you liked Amnesia but want something a little different, this is the game for you. Had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ childhood? Want to relive the terror of said childhood? This is the game for you. New to horror? Want to try horror? This is the game for you. Want a cream pie on the outside, but on the inside its the heart of Chtulu? This is the game for you.Pros: Stunning atmospheric gameplay elements and music creating instant immersion. Simple control scheme that's easy to get used to. Pulse pounding horror as you run for your godamn life. Kinda casual. Best when played alone in your room with all the lights off. And no wall pressed against your back... Don't worry, daddy's comin'. Just don't look over your shoulder.Cons: Climbing and general mantling is a bit wonk and a bit hard to get used to. Perfect lighting is hard to balance because some areas are just so damn dark, which makes hiding a little tedious at times. Maybe a little too forgiving as each death starts you 15 feet from where you died with all of your previous inputs, that means everything- including enviornmental changes, still in play. Some puzzles are a little too ambiguous with what they want out of you. The answer is sitting right in front of your face, but that's the problem. Its sometimes a little too obvious. Sometimes a little too hidden. Either way it was an absolutely incredible game. If you have the money laying around I would suggest picking it up and giving it a go.

												Loved this game!! I never knew being a 2 yr old was so scary, I loved every minute of it. The boogeyman is real according to this game and it really gave you the sense of fear when walking around. This game doesn't take long and it really makes you miss our little teddy bears when we were young. The gameplay was amazing, the puzzles were fun and easy. This was an awesome game, there is nothing I can say bad about it. Loved it to the end!!			"

You wouldn't want to miss it!I rate it 9/10 the game was really fun i just knock of a point be use of the length. The ending of this game is an ending that will make you cry it is actaully really sad. But it all makes sence so hopefully you can understand the ending. I dont know how many people will understand the ending but i did and its really sad. :( . But its a great game i love it. definitely buy it if you got an extra 20$			"

												 Among the Sleep is unlike anyother horror game I have ever played.  You really do feel like a baby. You're small slow, and completely defenseless in big forbodding world. Now... I am a horror veteran and this game admittedly managed to creep me out and put me on edge. I had to pause and tell myself ""do it you big baby do it!"" XD  I love some of the creative visusals in the game. Some places like your home look warm and welcomeing (at first) and other places like the playground look slightly surreal. The sound design is great espcially with headphones. I grew fond of Teddy and his friendly face. A baby and his teddy added a bit of charm and warmth to the other wise dark surroundings.  I have just few gripes with the game. WAY TOO SHORT. I am slow with puzzles, and I take my sweet time exploring. Yet I clocked in at 3 hours. Also while the ending did have twist that I didn't see coming the last chapter is rather anticlimatic.  Not that the ending is bad. I actually liked it. It just could have used a bit more oomph and though. Despite my two problems I really enjoyed this game. However... for being only 3 hours it's a bit hard to justify the price right now. Hopefully we will get some great DLC soon!			"

												Vulnerability is a long forgotten element in what made video gaming horror such a powerful thing.  But Among The Sleep has gone to great lengths not to forget this. It casts you into the role of a toddler, turns out the lights, and asks you to explore the shadows.  Vulnerability is effortlessly achieved when the character you control can barely walk on its own. Wobbling along on uncertain feet leads your first person view to bobble from side to side as you advance. Keep it up for too long, and you’ll fall onto your hands and knees where you’ll crawl instead at a much brisker pace. Tilt your view enough to see yourself, and you glance tiny grasping hands, and a body clad in a dark blue onesie with a star and moon print. Pause the game, and the static options menu is brought up only after the infant has covered their eyes with their little hands. It’s occasionally adorable. It’s always, always nerve-racking. There’s something out there in the dark -- how are you supposed to fend it off?Full review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12295/miscellaneous/among-the-sleep/review.html "

												Among The Sleep manages to be both scary and original. No cheap jump scares here. The story is actually very interesting and the gameplay is original and new. Playing from a toddler's point of view is definitely an interesting experience not seen before. Unfortunately, the game is very lacking in the length department and there is no replayability whatsoever since it's a linear experience. The asking price is too high compared to the game's length so I highly recommend waiting for a sale. Still, I recommend getting this game for its uniqueness and originality. Very Good!  7.5/10			"

												I bought this game shortly after spotting a post by someone who stated that they were extremely moved by this game and could personally relate to it as they were currently going through similar circumstances. Not realizing that this game 'could' be based on a true story I decided to give it a gander.Let me first start off with saying that if you are able to relate to the things this kid goes through, then I feel extremely sorry for you, knowing that your just a couple of steps away from blending in with the Addams family. I would also like to state that I will try my hardest not to ruin any surprises in this game as the game has very 'little' to 'no' replay-ability value.After playing most games I ask myself, 'Am i a better person now for having played it?', more often than not the answer is 'no!' In fact some times its even 'I am worse for having played it'. Not so with this game. In fact I left the game having a better appreciation for certain things than when I entered into it. Here's the beauty of the game and where the game shines. Basically your paying for the experience you get from having played this game and it's concept of making you view life from another perspective, that being said ... a 2 yr old.Here's where I began to appreciate things more. I began to appreciate how dangerous life is for a 2 yr old, a small puddle is something I can potentially drown in and a drawer in the kitchen is a ladder I can use to get to that toaster which could easily burn my face off.That being said, the main enemy in the game is a handful of monsters and the main one being a cross breed between a clump of seaweed, a Triffid and a stick of Broccoli drawn by Timothy Burton. The game has nothing to do with the supernatural, however you do know that with the need of avoiding monsters and finding memories, something must be wrong somewhere.The biggest downfall to the game is the controls, they were hardly precise and often felt awkward. For instance the hand icon to show you could interact with an object often appeared even if you were not close enough to 'really' interact with it and the designated controls on a controller for walk or crawl are the same ones needed to rotate handles. Hence instead of rotating you often would spend five minutes not being able to make up your mind if you wanted to walk or crawl on a handle. Granted you can customize controls, but i'm lazy and my idea of going outside is to turn on supermario 64 and get my character to look up into the nice blue sky. Also with the monsters always snapping at your baby feet, every millisecond reaction counts and if an icon appears to say you can interact with something, but you really can't because your not close enough, well it just heightens a players frustration level as they're spine begins to tickle the tonsils of the 'satanic evil brocolli'.There are a couple of ways to avoid the monsters. 1) Hide under beds or in confined cupboards 2) Hug teddy so hard you snap it's neck 3) Soil your pants and hopefully the smell will send the monster away. Unfortunately options like lay a couple proximity mines down are not in the game.The developers have really gone into quite extensive detail with the game which often gets missed by the players. For instance the mother has a pale skin impression on one of her fingers where a wedding ring would have been. All the books and covers in the game seem to have Japanese writing on them, this is because to a 2 yr old everything would look Japanese would it not?I would also like to point out that the developers have a 'credit fetish'. Seriously! The longest credits I have ever seen in a game. After the game finished I felt sorry and took my mum out to lunch, when we got back the credits were still rolling. The best part is, I later discovered that those credits were just a prequel to the real credits. After finishing the game you get to play some DLC and then treated to even more credits. Seriously the credits are so long that even the seasons change and winter steps in.The game will take you 5 hrs at the max. Most of that will be spent watching credits. There are very few games in the market which force you to think in the shoes of someone else and maybe we need more games like this so that we become more conscientious, tolerant and sympathetic . I really do recommend the game, it's worth the experience, but that experience is not worth $20.00 which is the normal price. Wait for it to go on sale. By the way my mum tried to make me eat broccoli soup once and it did feel a lot like what was going on in the swamp in this game. So yes you could say it's based on a true story...Addams family here I come!			"

												If you're a fan of horror games this is worth playing.  You play as a 2 yr old and venture through a dream world, or should I say nightmare world.  The game starts out a little slow and seems more like a ""baby simulator"" but shortly after things pick up it gets creepy!  This horror adventure game does have its scares and environmental chill but it's not the scariest game out there.  In my opinion it's perfect for those who are trying to ease into the horror genre or just don't want anything too extreme.  But this game shouldn't be dismissed.  Like the other best horror games you can't fight the thing chasing you, all you can do is run and hide.  With a first person view and dark environments Among the Sleep gives you a feeling of being a child all alone.  There are items to find on you're way and places to hide.  If you want a creepy adventure this game is a must.Pros:+Graphics (not the best but still very good)+First-person view+Scares and environment+Not boringCons:-Sometimes climbing is finicky-The game is a bit short-The ending was anticlimactic			"

The toddler movement mechanics were a nice touch as well; I kept getting frustrated when I would run and fall down, but it wasn't frustration at the game... it was the frustration of walking around as a cumbersome 2 year old.There were only a few drawbacks.

												Among the Sleep is a freshly distinct title to the PC gaming franchise, which leads up to why I give it its 9 points.For an indie game, it's is almost one of the best of its kind. One thing being the good 3D graphics, despite the texture quality being a little bit on the low side, losing its 1 point. The game play keeps you on the edge of your seat as a baby having to deal with its mom disappearing due to a metaphorical storyline, making you ponder about all the possibilities. Leading to a climactic ending to which no one could have expected! The puzzles may be simplistic, but only adds to the realism that the main protagonist's mind is still developing as a young baby. Can't say that the game itself is very long, but it's a game you can play over and over and not get tired of the grim storyline and climactic events.			"

												Among the Sleep Review -NO SPOILERS!-(except for the part about the footie pajamas)Among the Sleep is a unique game that is played in the innocent eyes of a young child. I enjoyed this game - not only because of the horror element, which was very well done - but also because it told a valuable and emotional story with only a few words. In the minds of toddlers, many things and situations that happen in their lives sometimes don’t make sense. This game did a great job “translating” what was really happening into something that a toddler would see and understand. Moreover, it was absolutely terrifying. Many things make this game unique and different from most other first person games. First of all, the only way to transport yourself is toddling or crawling-which can make running away from certain death quite tense at times. Second, you play only two feet from the ground making everything around huge and curious. Third, you can see your body if you look down! You’re not a floating head bobbing around! Also, the baby footie pajamas are very nice. There will never be a dull moment when this incredible game is played and it may or may not make one speechless for a few days. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a clean and eerie game that has good morals and lessons to be learned - including not making a single noise. There is one thing all must know when playing this: don’t break a bottle. "

												8'110 backers. $248'358 pledged out of $200'000 goal. Delayed 5 months.All of that for 119 minutes of not even actual gameplay, since Steam counted the time I spent in the settings.Among The Sleep is a huge disapointment.

												Among the Sleep proves that even indie devs are capable of hyping up a two hour walking simulation with poor sound and barely any scares. Perhaps you all saw that Kickstarter video where it seemed like a stealth game with high amounts of interactivity in its environment with a dense sense of climbable objects and places to hide? Well, guess what. It's not. In fact, nothing is particularly done well here. Any ""horror"" done in this game consists of only 10 mins of game time hiding from a swamp monster and a coat. Which was all done better in Penumbra and Amnesia anyway. Because even IN THIS GAME any sense of challenge flies out the window when you even the game over screen and are sent RIGHT BACK to a checkpoint with all progress still in. As in any items you got or objects moved etc. are still in the same place. There's no real puzzles. Not a single moment that sticks out. Everything was already done BETTER in other horror games. Even the innovation of being a two year old child falls flat on its face with terrible execution.The sound effects are particularly dreadful. The quality ranges from well done to something from a DOS game. You'll get random whistle noises that cut off abruptly. Monster sound effects that sound like they came out of a really bad TMNT cartoon, bottles that sound like bell chimes, and even no sound effects at all! REALLY! You can drop soap and you won't even hear a single thud!As far as the story goes. It's the bare ♥♥♥♥ing minimum for being ""subtle"". A child is being taken away from a drunk parent? It's not like this was easily foreshadowed by the swamp monster 30 minutes in the game. The characters never develop. The incredibly forgettable teddy bear doesn't have a personality. Yet the game tries its hardest to make you FEEL bad for him later. Which you won't feel anything at all because he was merely around to babysit the player and destroy whatever atmosphere the game had.The visuals are pretty nice I guess. Each section in the game has its own sense of aesthetics and the scale of being a two year old toddler is well replicated.			"

												It's a game that demands that you put your head and heart in the game. If you play it with the head and heart of an adult, the smoke and mirrors will not fool you. It demands that you role-play it and if you do, it rewards you with a great sureal and eerie nightmare. It reminds a bit of Pan's Labryinth. If there is one issue I have with the game, it's that the ending could have escalated the drama a bit. It's not that much that is needed, just some extra dialogue to end at a higher note.			"

												If there were a neutral rating... I'd be on the fence between it and positive.  4 out of 5 as it were.First, I love the concept.  The crawling vs toddling mechanic worked very well.  And the first part of the game (the bit you see in the demo) before you (minor spoiler) leave the house is creepy as (smurf).  The end bit is also, creepy on an amazing scale.  Unfortunately, once you leave the house for the more fantastical areas outside...  it looses a lot of the creep factor.  I think the lessened familiarity lessenes the horror effect.  At least it did for me.    So, awesome beginning and end... less impressive middle bit.  (Though it was still good.)  Sadly, the middle bit is the larger portion of the game so...I do put in a recomendation for this.  (With minor reservations.)			"

												Firstly Among the Sleep will hit home to parents as you are looking through a childs eyes. I have three children and this game is amazingly well done. The graphics are again well done along with the atmosphere. Everything about this particular game is going to set Krillbyte studios onto a great path and i hope they continue the awesome work.If you have an oculus rift i suggest playing with it first even though the resolution would not be as great. Trust me that experience is so rewarding in of it self on a first playthrough. Sadly i do not have the Rift just yet and I wish i did now for this game. I can justifly easly the 20 price tag. I do not want to give much in the way of the story but you will need to think a little in this game as you see certain elements spring up. Im only a few hours in and already have my own theory as to what is going on in the game though i hope im terribly wrong.I cannot recommend this game enough. This is art and although a horror game, its amazing so far and  one I fully intend to finish no matter what!			"

												So I just finished Among the Sleep, and I have to say it's one of the best explorational games I've ever played. To call it a horror is up to the player. Since there's a flowing narrative and not many survival elements, I think calling it a psychological drama would be more fitting.When I came into the game I was pleasantly surprised at how much detail had gone into the world (after my controls decided to work), and really enjoyed the cartoonish art style. The character models could have been better but that's a minor nitpick.Something else I noticed was the lack of deep sentiment in the early stages, and felt somewhat let down. However upon completing the game I realised what this all amassed to and why it seemed so by-the-books. I won't spoil anything but the moments leading up to the game's incredible ending are genuinely enthralling and some of the best I've ever experienced in gaming.I think the game's ~2 hour length is perfect, as it allows for an incredibly streamlined experience. None of the game feels like filler. I am however disappointed at the slightly disgusting price of £15. Yes, it is an incredible experience, but for 2 hours of gameplay I would never pay more than maybe £8. Of course I made an exception for this as I've been waiting a long time for its release.In conclusion, if you're looking for a PewDiePie-esque jumpscare fest then I really couldn't recommend this game to you. This game's horror comes from its subject matter and subtlely disturbing imagery. If you're a big fan of explorational games (Dear Esther, Amnesia: AMFP) then I highly recommend it, although I'd wait for a steam sale if I were you.Graphics: 8/10 (Incredible art style let down by occasional bugs and performance issues)Sound: 7/10 (Fittingly cheesy voice acting, and good ambient effects, however playing through I can see they missed a few solid opportunities for a good audio scare)Gameplay: 9/10 (If you like explorational games then this is basically flawless as far as walking around goes. If you don't, its minimalistic mechanics may leave you bored)Overall: 8/10			"

												Among the Sleep is an indie horror game that  was originally released as a demo way back in 2012 or so,and then got an official release on Steam in 2014(this version).I tried it out since it looked really cool after seeing a lot of other people play it,and I can say I will never regret playing it :)The plot: You play as a 2 year old toddler,with a teddy bear as a birthday present(and as a light source in the game).  You have to go around finding these items called""memories"",uncovering the truth about your mother in the process.The gameplay is really interesting because instead of taking the POV of a normal horror protagonist(say,an adult or teen),it takes place in the POV of a 2 year old toddler.You get a teddy bear as flashlight in the game,which helps with some low-light sections throughout.The characters are pretty good,the mother especially because of the creepy things you find out about her(just what tho I won't spoil)The voice acting is well done as well.The horror aspects of the game are VERY well done,and managed to scare me more than once(keeping in mind I tend to be brave when playing horror games).The game is kind of buggy,but that hardly takes away from the value of the game. The game doesn't take too long to complete on your first playthrough(it should take you 2-4 hours or so on average),but everything that's good about the game makes up for that for the most part.9.5/10 from me :)			"

												No spoilers to follow:I have a difficult time recommending this game.  I will break it down into the things it does well and things it missed this mark on.Pros:The gameplay design is great.  You are faster while crawling, but are also at certain disadvantages for doing so.The design of the environments is also well done which includes sound design!  The locations felt important and palpable.Cons:I have to mention length first.  It takes under three hours to beat, and while that alone does not make me hesitant to recommend the game, it does not help.The story is full of foreshadowing which is good, but does so in a way that makes everything incredibly predictable.  The story  exists only to allow for the game to take place.The scariness of the game is incredibly subjective, but I did not feel scared with the exception of one area of the game.  I will not spoil what makes me say this because that would ruin the fear that this game attempts to make you feel.  If you are observant, you will not be scared.I played this game without an Occulus Rift which may be part of my lack of enthusiasm, but it does seem more like a tech demo for this device in its length and environments.  When the price drops on it, it may be worth it.  Twenty dollars seems high for a couple hours of scenery.  I also want to point out that the demo includes the best portion of the game since it occurs before the supernatural/dreamy location.  While some may appreciate the supernatural areas more so (and I agree that it allows for the game to become less predictable as it deviates from reality), I felt that it loses a large part of the empathy required to feel fear.

												    It's a good game, despite my not recommeding it, but $15 USD for a 2 hour experience is a little steep. I beat the entire game in about two hours, and that's with getting lost twice. If you can get it on sale, I would highly recommend it, as the story is worth experiencing. Don't ruin this one by watching a Let's Play.    It does a good job being suspenceful, but after the first 20 or so minutes, I didn't really feel any danger anymore, and all those sound effects just started to give me a headache. By the time I finally saw the enemy walk past my hiding spot, I lost all suspense. Once I started to peice together the narritive, I spent the latter part of the game more sad than afraid, which I guess is what the developers were aiming for.   Screeching and jumpscares aside, the puzzles were actually pretty entertaining, albeit easy. Your biggest problem is going to be seeing where you're going. Like I mentioned previously, I got lost twice because of how pitch black the game gets at times. The game gives you a teddy bear that casts a little illumination, but it blocks half the screen, and completely obscures it if you happen to look down.   All things considered, the game is absolutely brilliant, but the price tag is what keeps me from recommending it.			"

												I found the experience more agitating than fun. There's not a lot to really put you over the edge while playing. It's not very scary, the challenge is dry, nothing really surprises you. You're supposed to be an infant yet find yourself solving detailed puzzles from their point of view. The plot twist is predictable and over-stated. I suppose the deal-breaker for me is the plot. I don't want to spoil anything, but I found the premise pivoting between being uncomfortable and tiresome while everything spins around it within the game.I got it on sale, took me an hour and ten minutes to complete. It's already been uninstalled and I wont be returning to it ever again.			"

Who am I kidding, most of you weirdos on steam are already severely troubled, perhaps playing this game can help you relate?It wasn't as ooky spooky as Amnesia or the Penumbra series, but it definitely seems to have been inspired by them. Still, a short story and a few handfuls of jump scares and simple puzzles makes the game a fun experience and a new concept, though not terribly memorable beyond that.			"

The demo and the trailers led me to believe it would be more like ""Slender the eight pages"" but really it was more like a quick game. I was even excited about using my oculus rift for a game finally. I played about 20 minutes on oculus took a quick break and came back deciding ""Well I'm only 20 minutes in on oculus and I'm getting a headache from it, so I'll play a little without the oculus."" played for a little while longer and beat it :\    Maybe $5.99 would be a good price for this, mayyybe even $10 but I feel a bit ripped off.

												This game is a little disappointing. From some let's play footage or trailers you might think it's ""Amnesia"" meets ""Rugrats.""  It's unfortunately not. Calling this a horror game is... generous. Atmospheric to be sure, but a horror game it is not. And it's a damn shame too, as there are plenty of elements that would have made this a perfect mixture of scary and creative.Elements such as pulling out shelves and chairs to reach destinations or hide; a teddy bear that glows to comfort you, but lures monsters; or a running mechanic that makes you trip because you are only 2 years old. Hells yeah I'm all about it.However, this is all meaningless as you will have a total of 2, maybe 3, encounters with a monster. It's mostly you just crawling around with a light source you'll rarely need, finding treasure and looking at beautiful environments. The developers look like they put a lot of effort into the maps, and it looks like they had more planned for the game play with plenty of places to hide.  Unfortunately, most are a pointless decoration.Also, I saw the story coming a mile away. Maybe that's the point? But crawling around Manor de Grand Mariner to find out your mom is a turd burglar wasn't all that impressive to me.At the end of the day you get a 2 hour, semi-pretentious, game that's overpriced at $20 dollars. 6/10 worth a buy if you buy it on sale.

												Well, that was one short game, a easy 100% for the hunters amongst you!! As for the game im not overly impressed, the first half to me seemed boring and not scary at all............ the second half did improve somewhat, introducing the monster and little puzzles to complete. It reminded me of Slender although not as scary and not as gd imo. If you like horror games and its going cheap then by all means pick this up, otherwise id leave it alone. 5.5-6/10			"

												You want to experience a story from the perspective of a child who is going to need years and years of therapy? Who am I kidding, most of you weirdos on steam are already severely troubled, perhaps playing this game can help you relate?It wasn't as ooky spooky as Amnesia or the Penumbra series, but it definitely seems to have been inspired by them. Still, a short story and a few handfuls of jump scares and simple puzzles makes the game a fun experience and a new concept, though not terribly memorable beyond that.			"

												I would say buy it if it's on sale. It's only about three hours long so I don't feel like it's worth twenty bucks, but the graphic are good, the sounds and music work well, and the mechanics are good. Controls are smooth, and it's definitely unique. I don't know if I would classify it as ""horror"" but it does have some tension. And I've never seen a video game about this before--I think it has a lot of value as an artistic depiction of the horrors some children experience. I won't give any further spoilers.			"

The teddy bear actually talks, to the child alone. I thought at first that this was some kind of possessed toy or something but the game disappointed me.

It's short, takes about 2 or 3 hours to finish (and that's good, because it does not get repetitive).The story is very interesting and captvating, and it can have different interpretations (seems to be a thing in nordic games/movies?) . The art and graphics are good for an indie, but nothing so big. Oh, and the games is not difficult at all, no challenge.  "

												Can't say I didn't like this game, but can't say I liked it either. The game is just way too short to give you any solid impression or expirience as a game, but still the main idea behind the game is revealed properly. I would compare it to good short films you can see here and there. So if you are looking for gameplay and long story - better go buy some other game. But if you see this game on sale, it can be a good short entertainment for one evening.			"

If not All,You can play this game with the xbox controller.About the game.You are playing as a baby that is able to crawl and walk. This baby as probaly the most strongest legs on the world because i was falling off from tables/drawers from a decent height and he didn't even get a single scratch! Your best friend is a teddy, who gives light. (So basically a glow in the dark teddy bear) What i really like about the game aswell is that you have to move an object (like drawers or doors) Into the direction like they should be opening, so if u have to push them to the right, you have to control your buttons into the right direction, same goes rotating valve, You have to rotate valves my moving the control into that direction(so making circles)I have to say that this horror ""childish"" game is very well done :DI like the atmosphere and the shadow effects in the game.There are collectables.The camera angles are nicely done when being moved by someone.The game does try to scare you with big giant jackets/coats.This baby is also probaly the most smartest baby on the planet.however the animations are sometimes weird.THE GAME IS QUITE SHORT.Other things.Teddy is sometimes very quiet, even on some locations that he should be talking.This baby will probaly be ""superman"" later.This is the strongest baby too.

It's too short, and the gameplay stops innovating in its second half. It stopped being scaryOn the flip side, the visuals are nice, and the story it eventually reveals was sad and touching.

												I played for over 3 hours so far and I don't see it ending during the following hour. If someone is running forward like a fool he has only himself to blame if the game ended 'too soon' for him.I love how the game eased on players after some time (I even started whining that it's not Amnesia-scary anymore) just to go after the player after soon enough. Made me swollow my prior words :) If you like horror and 'outside-the-box' games, buy it!What can I add after finishing the game? Around the half I started getting afraid that it would turn into yet another 'collect 3 puzzles to unlock all 3 passages and off you go' kind of game. Fortunately I was wrong. It eased on that to focus on psyche later on. All in all a great thrill ride! It took me over 5 hours to finish the game (without getting lost).The only cons I've found are poor quality assets from time to time. Sub-par models and textures in the outdoor levels, some missing sounds (from interactive objects) and terribly looped sounds (washing machine). Lack of positional audio (binaural, HRTF etc.) is also a downside.Graphics: 8/10Audio: 7/10Overall: 8.5/10Prologue DLC comments:This is obviously meant as a small update. Also, the in the following notes I'm unable to distinguish vs improvements made in the DLC itself and improvements to the entire game introduced with the updates released after I've finished the original game.+ better music, MUCH more dark and tense+ new reaction of the toddler to danger+ it seemed to me that textures quality were better than in the original game- there's little of challenge- the gameplay feels a bit like a mini-game rather than a short story-driven gameplay			"

I then bought it for 17,99 and for that price it really wasn't worth it.good points:-added content-nice visual style-first 10-20 minutes are absolutely greatbad points:-not scary in the slightest-repetative gameplay-hefty pricetag-motion blur makes you want to puke-character is slow and keeps falling down (I know we are talking about a toddler, but when you're running away, and you get caught because he fell down, it really is annoying).I played it again for the achievements and it was less frustating the second time, but still not what I had expected before release.

												I'll say it now, this game is great. I enjoyed every single bit of it I played, all 84 minutes of the game were fantastic ones that caught me running/hiding and racing through the perfectly shaped levels.The biggest downfall is that it was only 84 minutes. I waited for this game for so long, and it's a shame to see that the habit of hyped games being terrible in one way or another is not changing. I would recommend this game for as much as £5. Anything more and I'd say content-wise you're being ripped off.EDIT: I'm glad I booted up this game for the 5 minutes worth of content that the DLC prologue gave me.

												It's a decent game. It's got a pretty nice and whimsical atmosphere. Having a toddler as a protagonist is a fresh idea for a horror game. So why the thumbs down?Among the Sleep starts out in a creepy way, but in the end it's not really that scary apart from one or two jump scares. There's hardly any challenge and hardly anything to hide from. Honestly, the scariest thing in this game is probably the baby itself. The story tries to wrap everything up into a profound twist, but I thought that the result was lame and prententious. The game has potential, but it just feels bland and repetitive. There aren't any real puzzles either, unless knocking down a bottle from a shelf constitutes as a puzzle. The most fun I had was arranging alphabet toy blocks into obscene words...			"

												It is the second worst game ever made so dont even think about to buy it. the only game which is worse than this is ""The Graveyard"" and only because it isnt a game at all..The first level of this game works fine it takes around 5 minutes then you are in level 2. I have a gamebug which spawns me outside of the body of my character and it doesnt trigger the door to open. i scripted it and was finally back in my character but it also doesnt trigger the video or the door to open means i cannot continue. i scripted again to overjump this level and same bug happens in level 3 again. for me i was done with it on this point. Am i the developer?seems like to play it you have to make the game working by yourself. 20 $ for 1 level around 5 minutes and the rest isnt working and its not even early access. until this bugs arent fixed i cannot recommend it..there is nothing i could recommend. apart from that i was one of the kickstarter supporters and i didnt even get the game. i saw it on steam released and remembered that i purchased it over 1 Year ago then i had to write 2 Emails to the developers and finally i got my gamekey..this all for 2 $ cheaper like it is right now? It is all in all a really bad deal  "

												EDIT: I endured the lag through the last chapter only to be met with a short an disappointing ending. The game was incredibly short (2 hours tops if you don't have the lag), levels laughably easy, and there is no consiquences if you were to fail (I jumped off a ledge and 'died' simply to see what would happen... big surprise. Nothing). It is still bizarre why I lag only on chapter four whereas any other part of the game plays smoothly and on high res graphics. This game simply isn't the horror experiance you think it is.  I'm sticking with my 2/10 rating. Though the concept held so much potential and the graphics not being too shabby; the bugs/lags, disappointing gameplay is what really killed it for me. If you happen to have the $20 to blow and an hour or two to spare, then this is the game for you. Otherwise, just go watch Pewdiepie play it.~The Proxie Kid			"

												It was an interesting game.  It was quite a bit shorter than I thought it would be. I only spent 3 hours on it, completing the game and acquiring all of the achievements.  At first I didn't think I could do anything wrong in the game and would just be able to walk through it, but that changed after a little bit.  The ending is kind of interesting, but I don't know if it would be worth it to pay much for a 3 hour game.			"

												I purchased this game in January 2015 because the store page said ""VR Support"". The game did not actually have VR Support, this was ""in development"". So I waited. On Sept 22, 2015 VR Support was cancelled. Four days later the store page still says VR Support.This is like advertising a game to work on PC and Mac, buying it and finding out it doesn't actually work on PC yet. But it's coming... so you wait... then PC support is cancelled... too late to return it to Steam so you end up with a useless game.If you advertise VR on the store page the game should already be VR. I'm sure some people will enjoy the game but I'll never know beyond the 7 minutes I tried to get VR to work.			"

												[MILD SPOILERS]Great ideas executed fairly poorly. The first 20 minutes are really good and drew me into the game completely. The intro with your mother, the teddy and the lead-in to the wardrobe world were great.However, finicky climbing, not being sure if I can fit under things and ultimately not really being able to decipher the rules of the scares make the game a bit of a trudge. It gets really repetitive, even in the short period of time you actually have with the game. The story unfolds itself well and you end up having a good sense of what it has been trying to convey to you, but ends by just slapping you with it, just in case you hadn't figured it out on your own yet.It started you off with something great and ultimately goes nowhere with it. The DLC is very much the same, it gives you something really interesting, gets repetitive and goes nowhere.I wouldn't recommend this at its base price, it's far too short for that. Pick it up on sale if you're curious or give it a miss completely, I'm pretty indifferent to the game.			"

												If you enjoy stories where the plot isn't spoon fed to you, then this can be a great game. It's interesting to draw parelles and understand what the meaning of everything in the game is. As you play you can see how a toddler might see his world in the way that this one does. Things that aren't really dangerous can seem very scary to a child not old enough to understand what's what.That said, the game is short, but maybe that's for the better. The gameplay itself does not stand on its own apart from the story, and I found it to start becoming tedious towards the end. I got the game (and others) for $5 from Humble Bundle, and I think it was well worth that purchase, though I don't think I'd want to pay much more than that. All in all, a good way to burn 2 or 3 hours in a lazy afternoon.			"

												I have to say this by far one of the most scariest games i have ever played of all time, it has suspense and terror along with making players getting on the edge of their seat but not only that it puts the players through a sad time of a childs life where the mother and father are fighting over the childs custody and the dream basically disguises it as a journey through the sons mind. In reality it shows the mother has lost custody over the child and that father has won. In otherwords this is an outstanding game. So i do hope more DLC Will come to it.			"

												Update: I did a second playthrough for the new achievements they added, to find 10 drawings in each level of the game including the prologue. They made a few changes since I last played it in 2014.The changes I only noticed was at the finale so they'll be in a spoiler tag.The voices during the finale spoken by the mother under the spotlights were unaudioable, I couldn't make out her words in hearing as the caption would suggest. Same goes for the, assuming, father that greets the child. Eventually his voice become difficult to hear. Not sure if it's a hardware issue, a glitch, or the game itself as my computer wasn't able to handle Among the Sleep very well but decent enough to play at least.Half way Review. (2 hours)Some say this is short and overhyped... I'd say ""When is this going to be over?! And where is my mommy!?""Seriously, in a body of a helpless 2 year old, looking for his mother, wondering through a child's imagination nightmare, you begin to wonder what is around that corner, behind the door, or through the window. It may become clear what the creatures represent, but still has you wondering what is happening next.Finished Review. (4 hours)Again I ask, to those saying it's short, how can you possibly make it longer? While it may feel that it should've been longer, it really couldn't.This is a game I waited since the demo. I loved the demo. I wish I could've helped with the KS campaign, but couldn't risk sending any funds due to job unsecurity. That's my only regret about this game, not being a backer.Getting this game as a gift, and playing through it... worth the wait. Absolutely worth the wait. I refused to see any playthroughs of this game until after I played it. And I'm glad I did.The sense of danger and paranoia as a toddler, looking for his mother and the memories. You may think you know what's about, but you may be wrong.Spoilers from here.DLC Review (+ <1 hour)Now I'm a bit more confused with the story, the father was abusive to the mother, in turn the mother become child abusive and a drunk, and the child went into foster care or back to the father? While this does explain what happened between the two parents to be seperated in the first place... it makes the main game story confusing for me... was there something I missed?-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												Potential spoilers and plenty of opinions following the first paragraph.An incredible concept that just did not pan out. The visuals are decent, the sounds are genuinely incredible but the gameplay and story just aren't there. Gameplay is very typical for a first person horror-adventure game, in line with the recent first person horror-adventure games Amnesia and Outlast. You walk, you run, you crouch (excuse me, crawl), you hide and you pick up objects as needed. The hiding mechanic isn't necessary for a majority of the game. Nothing new except in this scenario you're an infant. I do not recommend this game at $19.99 at all. I paid much less and still would not recommend the game just generally unless you're really convinced you'll like it.The game is never really scary and most of the time I felt as if the antagonist was actually helping by conveniently guiding me through opening doors, creating footsteps, etc. The fact that you are an infant did not change anything for me unfortunately. This could be due to the fact that the game is in first person and I didn't feel immersed. I don't think first person works well for this type of game... you're playing a predefined character that is not developed in any way. In Halo, you get Master Chief, a very memorable character built through dialogue and cutscenes. In Skyrim, you're roleplaying a character that is not predefined by the story but by the player. This idea doesn't hold up for every game but doesn't help with this one.Another problem I had was that I often missed what was going on during visual moments. I had no idea things went flying in the kitchen, I feel like I missed things when the lightning flashed in the house. I would just hear these sound cues and look around and not see anything. I guess I was playing wrong during these moments.The story begins holding your hand in the first few minutes and continues to pull you closer like a protective parent. Just to make sure you completely understand the story, we're going to treat you like a child and keep you completely aware of what you're doing and what is going on at all times. There's no thrill or mystery and if you understand what's going on very early in the game it's hard to be fearful of anything to come.I did not enjoy this game.			"

												If I was going to recommend this game to anyone, it would be to a two year old who has grasped the basic concept of mouse + keyboard controls. This game is incredibly short, it took me 1 1/2 half hours and for that time I felt that there was so much potential that wasn't being properly utilized. Never did I feel threatened or challenged only mildly disappointed with how mediocre the monsters looked and behaved. For example, one spotted me and as I dashed towards a small hole to hide in, it came charging up behind me, caught up to me and did...nothing. This happened a second time when a trenchcoat with beady eyes swooped down at me, then sort of floated there vibrating before disappearing. The best part of Among the Sleep is the concept and the scariest part is revealed at the beginning when your mother looks at you with what some of us would call a face and others would call terror.

												Unique concept for the game, kind of destroyed by somewhat frustrating gameplay. You're a 2 years old kid looking for your mother in a creepy, empty house. Sounds interesting? It is, besides few things that hinder the gameplay for me. Your best way of moving around is crawling. You can't do anything in this position (using your bear as a flashlight, interact with the most important objects in the game) and if you want to get up it takes like a full second to animation to let you move again. You can't run too far, because you're a baby, so you end up tripping and crawling after 2 meters anyway. The game is too dark, so you cant see♥♥♥♥♥♥ unless you activate your bear as a flashlight. This is helpful but you're moving two times slower (a common snail is Usain Bolt compared to you in this regard). The biggest nail to the coffin though is that it's just another corridor game. The puzzles are boring, controls are responding with slight delay, the overall experience is just not that worthwhile.It's not the worst game ever, but I can't recommend it with clear conscience.

I get tired of walking (and crawling) around trying to find where the next key is. For someone like me who is directionally impaired it gets really annoying. The entire time I'm playing this my brain is like ""Can we please stop now. This is boring. I'm tired of pushing the directional pad trying to figure out where to go.""I quit at the part where if you spend too much time trying to figure out where to go a monster jumps out and kills you. I'm just like NOOOO! Stop killing me and just let me get the Hell out of here so I can finish this stupid game!I hear it has a great ending but I may never get that far. I just can't take it. The gameplay is just too awful and boring.And the story is not great. It's just slightly more sophisticated than Super Mario Bros. The only difference is instead of trying to save a princess, you're trying to find out what happened to your mother. It's an exploration game with surreal landscapes that has little to no story.  Just an objective and an ending.			"

												Wonderful sound design and good use of lighting. There are many little touches that make this a good experience. The child's drawing representing each area and scene work well. IF you're paying attention and analyze the game, you will most likely figure out the outcome to a degree. I thought the full reveal at the end was quite powerful. It's good to see games tackling bigger subject matter as this does. You really get a view of a complex situation from the view of small child. The game only has about 2 hours of gameplay, at this price-point it probably should have been longer.

(with one full repeat of a level)est time to beat runing through it without freaking out over the noises in first 2 levels...20- 40 minutesbut not something im gona sit down to do cause theres no real replay value (unless you count the numerous hidden collectables that i could not find an in game tally system for)had a lot of fun for the short time it lasted but im gona say: No, i do not recomend this game due to being so short i could beat it faster then a match of league of legends and its priced at $15. i would legitimatly be raging right now if i did not grab it in a bundle package			"

												I was pretty disappointed by Among the Sleep. Given the reviews and recommendations I expected a solid, story-driven first-person puzzle game a la Master Reboot. It is a fist-person puzzle game, but there's no story and it's just not good.Even though I finished the game in two hours it felt slow. Moving is slow, getting around the world is slow. The controls and interface are clunky, and the viewport is at a weird, warped angle, which just makes things feel worse. Even on extreme settings the graphics are sub-par. And the puzzles themselves are nothing to write home about.This game is an experiment whose success hinges on all of its aspects coming together to form a unique, interesting experience. But despite the contrived situation and player persona, it is neither interesting nor unique. The game doesn't bring anything new to the table.What's there feels like a quickly slapped together tech demo for a game, not something polished or completed....and the achievements are broken on Linux.

This game sets you in control of a child that gets a birthday present. Befor you know it you are tossed into an unsafe shadow representation of the real world. The story telling leads you to beleave one thing but there is more to this title.

												This is a really great game.  However, this is more of an ""experience"" game (Dear Esther/Gone Home) than it is a survival horror.  So that means it's short and easy.  But that shouldn't be what you dwell on.  You should focus on the fact that you're playing as a 2 year old, searching for your mother with your teddy bear at your side.  You hide from the Boogeyman and solve easy, simplistic puzzles (don't expect puzzles a toddler couldn't solve).  Game length is an average of 2 hours but it's a 2 hour experience that I thoroughly enjoyed.			"

												The only thing keeping this game from a perfect score is the length... it IS a short game with nothing to invite the player to try again. No diverging paths, or unlockable items. But it is exactly the way that ATS gets away from video game conventions that makes you love it. You wouldn't think a game with no violence and a toddler for a protagonist could scare you, but I found myself sitting on the cliche edge-of-my-seat both playing and watching. Pricey for the limited run length, but well worth the money for me. My roommates and I had a blast, laughing at each other and screaming at turns, and I have paid many times this price for games that didn't manage to do HALF that.  A solid 8 out of 10 that could've been a ten at about twice the length. Worth a run through, and making me eager to see what else the creators come up with.			"

												Before I review this game I have to be honest...I LOVE playing horror games and really enjoy the feeling of being put in a situation where the only thing you can really do is hide with no way to fight back. I would be so daring to even say that I have become slightly immune to some of the horror games out there.Now that being said, I have played both the demo and finished the full game with much enjoyment. The scary atmosphere of the game is new and exciting and I love the concept that the game brings with it. To be honest though I did not find it as scary as other people seem to mention it being, but the story is FANTASTIC.I was completely emerged and loved absolutely every minute of the game including the way the story won't stop your brain from trying to interpret what the ""true"" meaning is behind the story.Unfortunately that feeling of exitement only lasted about 80min until the point where I had beaten the entire game.So do I think it is a great game? Yes I do.Do I think it is worth the 18 euro I paid for it? No I do not.All in all I think it is a game that SHOULD be played but you should wait til it is on sale...			"

												First of all I would like to say, if you ever see this game on sale, pick it up, no question.Among the sleep is one of those games, comparable to journey, where the actual gameplay tends to step aside for the atmosphere and the meaning of the game. Though this game is a ""horror"" game, it dosen't feel too much like one, mostly puzzles and an errie enviroment to boot. On top of that the game is quite easy, you could probably go through it without dying once (which I could say on your first playthrough would be quite hard to do, as juding what places you are and aren't allowed to drop to are a bit odd). Mostly what you'll be doing in this is solving several easy puzzles and once in a while hiding from a monster that only appears in a few parts of the game, which I would have to say is my biggest complaint. Many people talk about the length of the game, but to me, the game felt as long as it needed to be (besides the kinda abrupt ending that felt like it was a tad lazy). One thing I will say though, is keeping in mind that the game is easy, you should explore the levels, look at the drawings. The levels have all these extra areas to explore, not to artificially add to the length, but to discover and add to the game. Overall the game is great, if you see it on a sale, pick it up no question. If you are looking for a game that is going to hit your feels and stick with you for a while after, and don't mind the $20 USD price tag, this might be what you're looking for.			"

												Among the Sleep is short, but sweet. It's an interesting experience, absolutely dripping with atmosphere. Playing as a toddler in a scary world, and knowing you're defenseless, is a very eye-opening and unique experience. All of this is brought together to tell an interesting and troubling story from the eyes of someone who doesn't understand the world.I'm not typically a fan of horror games, but this one just seemed so unique that I had to Kickstart it, and the final product does not disappoint.A few warnings to make sure you know what you're buying:1. Among the Sleep is really short - you can finish it and get 100% achievements in less than three hours, and it doesn't have any replay value unless you want to revisit the exact same experience months or years down the road.2. I ran into a few bugs in my short time with the game (version 1.01). Most of these were small graphical glitches that almost added to the surreal experience, but one actually prevented me from progressing. I spent twenty minutes or so trying to figure out how I was supposed to move forward before finally looking it up and seeing that I had encountered a bug. There is an in-game option to go to the last checkpoint, which I was able to use to fix this while only replaying about three minutes of the game, so it wasn't too bad, but the game is still in an early stage where you might hit a problem now and again.3. I've seen at least one person in the forum complain that this brought up bad memories from their childhood. Presumably the subject matter advertised for the game should be enough to let you know if this will be a problem. It's a horror game where you play as a two year old, so keep that in mind if you have childhood trauma that could resurface.			"

												Oh my... I just finished the game. The ending had me in shock like wow. My heart was broken. Anyways, this is such a beautiful game, the graphics werw wonderful and the sound was so ominous and amazing. It starts out as just creepy but after about an hour it gets so scary. I actually yelled in fear a few times lol. When you get far into the game you will understand i had PURE anxiety until it ended and i was so relieved. TIPS *NEVER turn around after you get a little far in the game... someone or should i say something may be there to greet you ;)* STAYYY away from water!!, DONT jump into dark pits you just die lolol. I have to say Among the sleep is one of the most interesting games i have played.  I think its so cool to be playing from a babies point of view and seeing through his eyes. You learn how children see things from their POV and how everything affects them. You start off in the kitchen,, then get sent to your bedroom and thats when it gets pretty crazy. Its creepy for an hour but just wait it gets insane after that. The graphics are awesome and when you travel around and discover new places its really trippy & cool. I think i would give this game a 9/10. I think its worth the buy but i would wait till its on sale just because its so short i beat it in 3 hours. But i have to say this game is really creepy and its alot of fun. Overall great game and i totally reccomend.			"

												This is an amazing game. If you are looking for a game that scares the crap out of you, this is not it. It does have some good moments, but overall, you can play this game through in one sitting with zero ""death"" screens if you are careful. It has an excellent atmosphere, and the graphics are decent for what it is. As a parent, this game got to me a little more than it would most people, but that comes with the territory. I picked this game up for a few keys, and I am very glad I did. Not sure about that $20 price tag, but hopefully they add some more content later. Maybe another sequence all together.

												The game was simply not scary to me.  That's the only reason I don't reccomend this game.  I bought it because I thought it was going to scare the pants off me but it didn't really.  The atmosphere was really cool though, seeing the  world from the point of view of a toddler.  There were no real gameplay mechanics besides walking.  The story is put together through drawings that you find scribbled on the walls and in the end, it all makes sense.  If it goes on sale, buy it, if it still interests you, buy it.  I don't hate this game I just don't reccomend it.			"

You start out with a happy begining were your mother is making a cake for your birthday, but that night crud starts to happen. Your taken to your room and put in your vrib to go to sleep but there is somthing in the shadows, and it isnt here to make sure you liked your cake.

												If you've thoroughly enjoyed games like Amnesia or Slender or any other survival horror game, then I'm sure you'll appreciate Among the Sleep. However, what sets this game apart from the others (for me at least) is the story and perspective of a child. I won't ruin it for you with spoilers and others have summarized the story already, but the ending reminded me of an M. Night Shayamalan plot twist. A nice bonus is the ease of getting 100% completion of the achievements.Although I did really enjoy this game, I would not recommend paying full price for it. I finished the game with all collectables and achievements in under 3.5 hours, and that's after replaying a chapter or two. There is very minimal exploration besides the drawings and the game is extremely linear.Oh, and why is the prologue at the end of the game!?			"

												the game was deffintely advertised as better than it actually is. in the actual game the monster is so easy to avoid taht all fear of it leaves and if you play through a second time and already know the ending they practically shove it in ur face the whole game and make fun of u the whole time for how obvious they are making it. all in all not that great it was an interesting concept but a flawed execution of it and as for the dlc. didnt add much to it other than a ""prologue"" or if thats what they wanna call it. only plus to the dlc is that the monster can actually hurt you and you have to hide from it where as not once but mutliple times in the game itself the monster walked right through me when i was under a table or chair and didnt get hurt or anything.

												OVERALL: Fantastic gameplay and performance, but ridiculously short for what its worth.Very scary and very fun. It's incredibly immersive and terrifying. At the very beginning, it's strangely euphoric being a child, as you can be carried around the house and your teddy bear talks to you.I would've easily given this game a good recommendation, but I completed it in less than 150 minutes. $15 is $10 too high for a game with barely enough hours of story/playtime and absolutely no replayability. I bought it on sale for $5.99 (60% off) and because I managed to complete it in one short sitting, I almost wish I would have kept my money.			"

												Among the Sleep is short, but sweet. It's an interesting experience, absolutely dripping with atmosphere. Playing as a toddler in a scary world, and knowing you're defenseless, is a very eye-opening and unique experience. All of this is brought together to tell an interesting and troubling story from the eyes of someone who doesn't understand the world.I'm not typically a fan of horror games, but this one just seemed so unique that I had to Kickstart it, and the final product does not disappoint.A few warnings to make sure you know what you're buying:1. Among the Sleep is really short - you can finish it and get 100% achievements in less than three hours, and it doesn't have any replay value unless you want to revisit the exact same experience months or years down the road.2. I ran into a few bugs in my short time with the game (version 1.01). Most of these were small graphical glitches that almost added to the surreal experience, but one actually prevented me from progressing. I spent twenty minutes or so trying to figure out how I was supposed to move forward before finally looking it up and seeing that I had encountered a bug. There is an in-game option to go to the last checkpoint, which I was able to use to fix this while only replaying about three minutes of the game, so it wasn't too bad, but the game is still in an early stage where you might hit a problem now and again.3. I've seen at least one person in the forum complain that this brought up bad memories from their childhood. Presumably the subject matter advertised for the game should be enough to let you know if this will be a problem. It's a horror game where you play as a two year old, so keep that in mind if you have childhood trauma that could resurface.			"

												The game was simply not scary to me.  That's the only reason I don't reccomend this game.  I bought it because I thought it was going to scare the pants off me but it didn't really.  The atmosphere was really cool though, seeing the  world from the point of view of a toddler.  There were no real gameplay mechanics besides walking.  The story is put together through drawings that you find scribbled on the walls and in the end, it all makes sense.  If it goes on sale, buy it, if it still interests you, buy it.  I don't hate this game I just don't reccomend it.			"

												This is an interesting game about a small child wandering through surreal dreams to cope with the depressing problems going on in the child's life. An interesting journey through the psychi of an innocent infant's mind. with an interesting story, good graphics, creepy atmospheres, and some scary monsters, makes this game a must buy. I give it an 8.5 out of 10 it was short and the end felt a bit rushed otherwise it would have been perfect! but this game is worth your dollar.			"

												This is an amazing game. If you are looking for a game that scares the crap out of you, this is not it. It does have some good moments, but overall, you can play this game through in one sitting with zero ""death"" screens if you are careful. It has an excellent atmosphere, and the graphics are decent for what it is. As a parent, this game got to me a little more than it would most people, but that comes with the territory. I picked this game up for a few keys, and I am very glad I did. Not sure about that $20 price tag, but hopefully they add some more content later. Maybe another sequence all together. I would definitely play it.7/10			"

												First of all I would like to say, if you ever see this game on sale, pick it up, no question.Among the sleep is one of those games, comparable to journey, where the actual gameplay tends to step aside for the atmosphere and the meaning of the game. Though this game is a ""horror"" game, it dosen't feel too much like one, mostly puzzles and an errie enviroment to boot. On top of that the game is quite easy, you could probably go through it without dying once (which I could say on your first playthrough would be quite hard to do, as juding what places you are and aren't allowed to drop to are a bit odd). Mostly what you'll be doing in this is solving several easy puzzles and once in a while hiding from a monster that only appears in a few parts of the game, which I would have to say is my biggest complaint. Many people talk about the length of the game, but to me, the game felt as long as it needed to be (besides the kinda abrupt ending that felt like it was a tad lazy). One thing I will say though, is keeping in mind that the game is easy, you should explore the levels, look at the drawings. The levels have all these extra areas to explore, not to artificially add to the length, but to discover and add to the game. Overall the game is great, if you see it on a sale, pick it up no question. If you are looking for a game that is going to hit your feels and stick with you for a while after, and don't mind the $20 USD price tag, this might be what you're looking for.			"

												The ordinary world can seem fantastic and frightening through the eyes of a child. In Among The Sleep, you take the role of a toddler awakened in the night by strange occurances, and you must explore the world, solving puzzles and avoiding what lurks in the darkness to get to the bottom of these phenomena.Among the Sleep, with its somewhat short story (it should take less than three hours to get through the game from beginning to end), should appeal to casual gamers. However, even hard-core gamers can get a thrill from its atmosphere.			"

												It's not a bad game. It's got some suspense. It's definitely not a horror title. It's short...even with the DLC, about 2-3 hours at most. The ""story"" isn't really resolved, but you can pretty much guess what has happened and what will happen. To be honest, the game mechanics are rather weak. I wouldn't really call this a great game, rather a nice, different, refreshing idea with which you can pass very little time. No replayability. It's got cool graphics style etc. I would only buy it for a steeper discount...the original asking price is unfortunately WAY too much...For 20 bucks I can get a lot more game. I bought it for 66% off...that's still too high for this game, if you ask me.			"

												Among the Sleep, in my opinon, was a great game; Depending on the person you are your either going to like it or hate it. The game was short i beat it in about an hour and a half. Also the game wasnt necessarally ""scary"" it was more suspensful. Unlike most games this isnt a direct jumpscare game except maybe once. The game is suspensful because everything happens on a pattern. If you figure it out you know whats coming. For example: level three when I bumped into a bottle I knew it was time to go. That is the unsettling feel that I found great in this game. One thing in this game that may be a huge factor for people not liking it is the prolouge. Its kind of streched out a little mre than it needs to be but the developers made up for it with the strong symblic ending.Storyline:10/10Gameplay:7/10Controls:6/10(the doors can be annoying sometimes trying to open)Reccomendation: Buy during sale.

												     Among the Sleep is a amazing horror game but can seperate itself from other horror games through the fact that you take the role of a toddler. You start out with a happy begining were your mother is making a cake for your birthday, but that night crud starts to happen. Your taken to your room and put in your vrib to go to sleep but there is somthing in the shadows, and it isnt here to make sure you liked your cake. I do like this game as its heart-racing and story-immersive, and truley terrifying.			"

												Can't say much about the story without spoiling anything. You play as a child who has issues for logical reasons and you play to find out why. Length of play is short, so the situations you encounter are memorable and don't get boring. The feels from the ending may or may not affect you more than others. Beware if you've had a crappy infanthood and actually remember it... lol. Now onto technical stuff... Graphics are pretty good. Optimization is okay. Runs fine on Ultra settings and VSync at 30fps. It's worth a playthrough, definitely.			"

												SPOILERS FOLLOWthe atmosphere in this game is top notch. amazing sound track, visuals, and puzzles that all inspire feelings of suspense and terror. A frightening and compelling nightmare world, made all the moreso by the fact that you play a two year old child. that said, I felt like the twist in the end wasn't well realized. I was sure that things were going a certain way because, in my view, the entire game was setting you up to believe in a certain scenario. when it turned out otherwise it didn't have the impact it could have, because there is exactly zero foreshadowing in the beginning of the game. all of the foreshadowing portends the scenario I thought was going to take place, but didn't. frankly sometimes I think games nowadays try to shoe horn these twists in because it's the thing to do, but (and I felt this a little with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter) it would have been just as good if not better if played straight.Some gameplay quibbles include how damn difficult it is to turn anything with the mouse.

												Pros:The game captures very well the feeling of being a little child.The story fitted very well to the theme of the game.Cons:Not scary at all. Puzzles were basically just finding shiny little objects from a room or a place. No thinking needed when solving them. It featured also a lot of walking.  When you see a monster, screen becomes way way too blurry and messy, so that it gives you just nausea. If that was an attempt to express the fear that the child was feeling, that was just annoying and didn't serve its purpose. Way too short.Conclusion: Overall very interesting concept that could have been way better. Only thing I'm happy about is that i bought it for 3,74€.			"

Way too short.Conclusion: Overall very interesting concept that could have been way better. Only thing I'm happy about is that i bought it for 3,74€.			"

												Great game and brilliant storyline when you figure it out, the players own fear makes the game terrifying. I am a chicken, I couldn't even get through 5 minutes of Amnesia but this game is great because its so different and seeing everything from a baby's point of view makes it so awesome. I got caught at one stage and I actually screamed out loud because everything was so quiet and still and full of shadows and then it was right there behind me with nowhere for me to hide.			"

												A heavily atmospheric and dream-like game from the unusual perspective of a toddler. The elements of saturated colors, artistically created environments, and lush soundtrack are well harmonized for a unique experience. If you're tired of stereotypical horror games, this is something fresh.PROS* The visual design is striking. The bright colors and dark shadows play over strangely distorted landscapes. The child's perspective makes even common objects like swings or coats huge and menacing. This is a visual experience that will not soon be forgotten.* The atmosphere is enhanced by the soundscape. There are bumps in the night, rumbling drones, and a haunting melody being hummed far off.* Without spoiling anything, the subject matter is interesting and well paced.* The voice acting of the teddy bear is another high point, being playful and surreal without becoming corny.* This is a very imaginative experience. It felt like reading a storybook, in a similar vein as the movie The Babadook.CONS* The game is extremely linear. It almost felt like a straight line going through each area.* When the monsters are introduced, it detracts greatly from the experience for me. The nightmarish environment lets your imagination run wild, so when the game becomes a hide-and-seek horror trope, the experience suffers.* The monsters become constant by the end. Less really would have been more, both for scares and for letting the environment keep the spotlight.* There's no story. There is a *situation* which you come to understand throughout the game. I feel that if the game developers were going to tackle this subject, there really should have been more depth given to both the ""villain"" and to the situation. Instead, the treatment feels shallow and even insensitive.			"

												[Updated with a positive review now I can actually finish the game]I feel I can now recommend this game. Whilst it's a little clunky and can be beaten in just a couple of hours, it more than makes up for that by sheer force of concept.If the idea has been tried before then I haven't seen it. A horror game told from the point of view of a 2-year old. Genius! They find things scary that we don't, and so you end up in a world which heavily blurs the line between reality and imagination. Ever thought innocent objects made scary shadows in the middle of the night? Well, here they do!The level design is very well crafted and you rarely find yourself wandering round in circles looking for something to do. It's a little linear in places, but you feel more like you're being guided in the right direction rather than simply being on rails.However, it's taken six months since release for me to be able to actually play the game as it's been absolutely infested with bugs. One showstopping glitch made it impossible for me to even complete the first chapter, hence the negative review I originally posted here. I still have minor bugs including achievements not working, but at least the game is now completable for me. If it works for you, it's a fascinating original game. Try the demo first to see if it works for you. As one of the original Kickstarter backers it's made me wary about pledging towards the developer's next project though...			"

												Among the Sleep is a prime example of why horror is my favorite video game genre. The story is great, the monster encounters are exciting, unbearably tense, and are actually challenging unlike Amnesia The Dark Descent. Above all, Among the Sleep is incredibly creative and, despite its dark atmosphere, is very sentimental and succeeds in making the player feel like a little kid again.PROLOGUE DLC REVIEW:Among the Sleep comes with free DLC, which is a prologue which adds about an hour of gameplay mean to be played after the main campaign. Prologue is a skillfully designed addition to Among the Sleep and makes itself stand out from the campaign in several ways:- A chilling winter atmosphere, which is refreshingly different - Improved puzzles which require more thought to solve than what was seen in the campaign - Thoroughly creepy dolls to collect Prologue also expands upon the campaign's story, although since it's a prequel there is sadly no Teddy to keep you company. Prologue is actually very similar to Penumbra: Requiem, a mission pack/sequel to Penumbra: Black Plague. In Requiem there are no monsters to encounter, only environmental hazards and puzzles to solve. Prologue's only fault is that is pointlessly throws in a new monster which is a complete joke and takes the player out of their immersion. Considering that is all Prologue does wrong and the many other things it does right, it is a great bit of free DLC. Give it a go if you've played the campaign.			"

You play as young child, who crawls and walks. The story out line is pretty good. I'm not going to spoil it for you but, if you want to revist those scarey Rugrats episodes now, here's you chance!

												In addition to poor controller implementation, which is OK as it's fine with keyboard/mouse, Among the Sleep doesn't auto save despite plainly displaying ""saving"". Developers claim implementing an auto save would be a, get this, ""huge task"". Guess all the tens of thousands of other titles that have a proper save mechanic are up to this ""huge task"". Also odd since the game itself is quite good, nice visuals and mechanics, good atmosphere, excellent voice acting. Ruined by sheer ineptitude. What a shame. Avoid unless you can commit to completing it in one sitting and don't mind the developers disrespecting your time.			"

												If you've thoroughly enjoyed games like Amnesia or Slender or any other survival horror game, then I'm sure you'll appreciate Among the Sleep. However, what sets this game apart from the others (for me at least) is the story and perspective of a child. I won't ruin it for you with spoilers and others have summarized the story already, but the ending reminded me of an M. Night Shayamalan plot twist. A nice bonus is the ease of getting 100% completion of the achievements.Although I did really enjoy this game, I would not recommend paying full price for it. I finished the game with all collectables and achievements in under 3.5 hours, and that's after replaying a chapter or two. There is very minimal exploration besides the drawings and the game is extremely linear.Oh, and why is the prologue at the end of the game!?			"

												Great game and a different suspenseful story. Among the Sleep was on my Favorite Playlist for a long time, but only bout an year ago i got the chance to actually play it. The game faced some harsh criticism cause by some unknown reason players were facing a bug in Chapter 4 that didn't allow them to continue the game, i myself was one of them but gladly they fixed it and it runs smoothly now. Only bad thing about this game is that is a short one. Story could be more explanatory and complete to make up for the pretty good engine the game runs in. Prequel also went on exactly the same way. Nonetheless, a must in your Library. Hope Krillbite make a sequel soon.			"

Please note that this is an in depth review and whilst I have tried to not give any spoilers to the game, reading this review in it's entirety might give some of it away. If you do not wish for your playthrough to be spoiled at all, you may want to skip to the bottom once you've read the ""Brief Synopsis"" section.Brief Synopsis: Among the Sleep is a fairly short 1st person, on rails game. You play the part of an unnamed toddler who is accompanied by his best friend. While this game is on rails, it does allow to explore the game world quite a bit. The game is simple to play, yet provides a bit of a challenge by the way of puzzles and interactive items. The store page has horror as one of the tags for this game. I would categorise it along the lines of being ""heart pounding inducing"". There is no blood, no guts, no real violence, but it's still enough to get the heart rate up. Long Review: *The following may contain slight spoilers. Skip to the bottom if you don't want anything about the game spoiled for you*Story: In Among the Sleep, you play as a small toddler who wakes up in the middle of the night. Accompanied only by a teddy bear, you must brave the monster filled darkness to find the source of True Comfort - your mother. Graphics: The game is in 3D first person view and (I believe) is Oculus Rift supported (though you don't need it in order to play). The in world graphics have been beautifully rendered, with a lot of the items you find throughout the game interactable, allowing you to pick up, throw, push, and pull almost everything in the game. Well, everything that a one year old would be able to handle that is. Music/Sounds: Another huge plus for this game is its haunting music and sound effects. They're really well done, to the point where I cringed every time I accidentally broke glass objects while exploring the world. Length: Among the Sleep is not very long at all. Saying that, the plot is done so well that it doesn't need to be long. Indeed, my opinion is if the game was any longer, it would actually be to the games detriment. You don't always need a game to last for hours on end. Often, short and sweet drives the point of the story home more than long and drawn out ever could.Replayability: Unless you want to go for 100% achievements or want to speed run the game after leisurely playing it through the first time, there really isn't any replayability to this game. Overall, Among the Sleep is a short game with a really deep story. I highly recommend this game for that alone. The superb graphics and unforgetable music are just icing on cake, really.  "

												All i can say is, that you should watch a walkthrough on Youtube instead of spending money on this game. Because it's bad? No, that isn't the problem. The problem is that Among the Sleep is a walking simulator, it is impossible to fail, there is no challenge and like his overhyped sister Gone Home, it takes 19,99€ for not even one evening of enternainment. I spend 2,3 hours on this game, with 2 pee breaks included, so you can't hardly justify the pricing for this ""game""			"

It really felt like the developers wanted you to play this game in VR cuz that deffinately would have added to it. Next the visuals were pretty shotty. I dont have the best computer, but things were clipping in and out of each other all the time. This made the game hard to get into. On the brighter side the atmosphere is great. The story is good too. Dispite issuses I had with the gameplay I found myself drawn to finish the story. Unlike a lot of other horror games where you have to go around and read everything in order to get the plot, this game doesnt do that. It does a good job with visual clues to help you figure everything out; building to the final reveal. The last negative would be the play time. I finished the game in just under four hours which was a little shorter than it should have been. There are a few collectables hidden thoughout the game to go back and look for, but seeing as how they arnt anything but incohesive crayon drawings there is no real reason. Conclusion: at five bucks on sale it is hard to say no, but unless you can get this thing to work with a VR headset I say you might want to look around a bit more first			"

												EDIT: OK, so i finished the game, and i can say with confidence, this is one of the worst games i have ever played in my entire life. The atmosphere is awful, the sound design is so dull, water splashing, thuds, even the plates falling on the ground dont sound good. There is 0% chance of failing, no rewards for exploring, EVERY puzzle is retard level easy, no replayability, couple of texture issues here and there and i dont want to ruin the ending for everyone but man... what a joke rofl. Keep away lads. 2/10. >I Immediately regrey my decision.Original review:I guess it meets the minimum requirements for a ""Scary Game"", mediocre scares here and there, not neccesarily hard or as engaging as i hoped it would be. Best thing about the game is probably just throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥everywhere and making a mess. If it's on sale give it a go, the asking price is abit too high.			"

												A decently short, horror & puzzle game. It's roughly a 2 1/2 hour journey.There is no combat, only running and hiding from the scary things that lurk around the darkness. Your goal is to find your mother who is somewhere in your house, then out of no where you go on a crazy adventure with your teddy bear and he doesn't mess around, he got you going to all sorts of crazy places to collect important things. (I think it's drugs).Anywho, great game and I recommend it. The atmosphere is much better than a lot of higher budget horror games these days. "

												The saving system is broken. It says it saves the game, but the next time I log inn i have to replay the whole chapter.Shame though, the game was really cool. It had its bugs, but noone of them ruined the experience. The mood in the game was great.It was cool playing as a toddler, they seem to have grasped the world from a toddlers view pretty good.			"

												This is a good game but it is far far too short for the asking price. I would expect to pay 5 bucks for this. You can master the game in little more than an hour and the puzzles are too simple to be much of a challenge. I will say that it has great atmosphere and gave me some real chills at one point but I can't recommend it as a purchase.			"

												Interesting concept, spooky for sure but the save system is dreadful and gives you a false sense of security.I was 2/3 of a way through a level and had to stop part way through the 3rd part. I THOUGHT given the constant ""Saving"" messages it had actually saved my position, so I quit the game to make dinner for my family and started to play again a couple of hours later to find I was right back at the beginning of the level; all progress through that level was lost.Right now I have absolutely zero inclination to continue playing the game.

												Among the sleep is a first person adventure, horror game where you must find out what is happening in your world with your trusty side kick, which is a teddy bear. The game puts you down a path where you feel helpless in changing the way its going, and makes you feel like a victim. So much is said in the review and depending on what type of person or life you personally have lived will decide how well you enjoy this game. I myself was not impressed with the game nor the pace of the story and how it was presented to you.

												As horror games go, with this one I am unimpressed. Decent atmosphere but overall dull material.Pros:1. Good atmosphere with great visuals and sound effects2.

Just wasn't interactive enough3. Not creepy enough for the horror genre4. (Now this is just nitpicking) The 2-year old in the game does not reflect a real-life 2-year old.When you find a horror game ""not creepy enough"" it's kind of hard to recommend it. If there was a fun mechanic about it or a really cool storyline then maybe this could be overlooked. However, that is not the case here with Among the Sleep. Overall, the material felt dull and underwhelming. If they were to make a new game along the lines of the free DLC, the Prologue, then I could probably get on the ""recommended"" wagon. There are better horror experiences to be had elsewhere. Quite a disappointment, this one!			"

												Bought it on sale, but honestly it wasn't really worth the time or money I spent. Not scary at all, not creepy at all and they used no method to force the player to actually care about what happens. You basically just run around just to fall down and crawl and then stand up again all the time. Hardly any game mechanics to speak of, it's just one of those games you can play in around two hours, but if you could actually walk without falling down all the time and move a bit smoother, it would take around 30minutes to run through this game(yeah, I know it's meant to be like this, you're a baby after all, just putting it out there that it's short with almost no content). I like to look around and find items or funny things, but there is hardly anything of that either, just a few childrens paintings to pick up. Extremely easy, not even once did I have to stop and think ""what should I do to proceed?"", everything was obvious and you just picked up everything you needed on the way forward. The only good thing is that I didn't notice any real bugs, it flows on fairly well. But no real story to speak of whatsoever.If you're really, really, really, REALLY bored and can get this on a sale and you have nothing else to do whatsoever, give this a try and it might help you burn 2-3 hours. I guess it gives what it says it does, you're a baby with super problem solving powers(for a toddler) crawling through a house while seeing illusions created by an infants mind, and I guess it could be considered somewhat creepy, but it's not scary in any way, every time a monster showed up I just ignored it and went on my merry way, when the monsters finally started chasing after you, everything you had to do was hide under a table or something, and usually you didn't even have to care even then as you could just crawl to your goal without minding the ""monster"", as it hardly aimed at you anyway, while disappearing in just a few seconds. I respect the idea of this game, but I just found it really boring in the end, there is absolutely nothing to keep you hooked and care what happens, as there is really nothing much that happens anyway, way too linear, you just walk through everything and solve a few ridiculously simple puzzles that are so obvious that a toddler could realize what to do instantly. Do yourself a favour and find something else to play, please, anything is better than this, read a book, watch a movie, play another game, this is absolutely not worth your money nor your time, unless you're into linear games with a screwed up atmosphere and no story where you just mindlessly charge through. Even if you get it for free, just play something else and let this game rot in your library, it's way slower than it should have been with the content given, just a waste of time. I have a feeling that most of the people that upvoted this is either one of those people that are ""neutral"" and thinks it's neither good nor extremely bad and therefore went for thumbs up, or the guys that are total pansies and get scared when they hear cracking in their house, or the people that upvoted it for being ""acceptable for the price"" or maybe those that didn't like it but thought that it was better than some other games. If this was a free game, I might upvote it due to similar reasons, but even 1 dollar/euro is too much for this.			"

												Only lasts ~2 hours, feel of playing as a two year old vanishes instantly after the initial stage and what's left is a subpar first person ""horror"" where there's an actual threat only 2 times IIRC. Might be entertaining if it's your first attempt at the genre, otherwise avoid.			"

												So I finished the game and I have to say, although it wasn't as scary as I was expecting, it was creepy enough to give me a few chills.  I loved seeing the world through a childs eyes and the little details were really cool, like the ""spooky world"" was just the baby's imagination interacting with the house, the key on the baby stairs gate for example, everything was significant to building up a story of this child, the drawings of sad child and grumpy monster etc.I loved the level with the bottles all over the place that could fall and break, you really got a feeling of panic that how angry mummy would be if you made even the slightest noise etc, at least that's the impression I got.It was also really refreshing to have this sad situation where for once it isn't the stereotype drunken father routine, I really liked that.One thing though I would liked to have seen better use off was Teddy.  Although he serves as a kind of ""flash light"" mechanic, you can literally play through the entire game having never used him if you want to.  It would have been really cool if there was some sort of ""upset"" meter or something that would have you needing to cuddle him to stop the baby from crying or something and attracting the ""monster""  it would also have been good that if after an encounter when the screen goes all crazy because you're scared that you need to cuddle teddy to reset that.  Basically I just felt that teddy wasn't used enough which is a shame.The game should have been longer for the price asked... I paid £8.99 and that was with a 40% discount, and while I don't feel that I have been ripped off, I certainly wish the game was a good bit longer... I kind of feel that we were only really starting to encounter threats when the game started to come to an end.Would very much like to see more of this, hopefully some additional content will come from dlc or a sequel, but either way I would recommend to give this a try.  It's a fresh take on the horror fps genre and it's cute scary and funI'd give Among the sleep 7/10 lossing a little score for its price to duration ratio.			"

												This is a strange title. First off, the asking price (20$) is entirely too high. As a group, we tried twice to get into this, and just couldn't. Its an interesting idea, but in the end it can be boiled down to basically a walking simulator where you 'find the key' and 'find the door' deal.Pros:+Fresh idea+Makes you feel like a small child+Graphics are decentCons:-Waaayyyyy too high of an asking price-The game takes some seriously weird turns. I thought the whole game took place in the house, but it doesn't. You go down like this garbage shoot and enter another world, which is really strange, and I didn't like it.-Basis of the gameplay is too simple. You basically just walk through the levels trying to open doors and trigger events. Its not terrible - its just bland and has been done a million times before. At this point (and for this price) I would have liked to see some novelty. Something fresh.-While the graphics are nice, there is some parts that odd. Maybe they were done because you are a small child, but I don't think so. Like as an example, you walk by a couch that is entirely too big in comparison to the rest of the room (lamp, coffee table, etc.). It just felt flawed. Or shoes that seemed too big. If it was for the child experience, fine, but I don't think that is the case.I would definately pass on this one. There are other similiar games that are better (and far cheaper). I paid 10 bucks and have buyers remorse.			"

			This is an neat little horror game that's been out for a while now, but it was suggested to me to play through it. In this episodes... stuff gets weird fast!		

This is a 'First Person' Horror game and the atmosphere generated is so good, it will make you're skin crawl with terror and adventure. Compared to a lot of these cheap looking 'shovel them out quick' horror games popping up everywhere, in comparison this feels like a AAA game. Yes, you will be afraid, and yes you will be very afraid. I have to admit I jumped a lot.... and that was during the day... I can't imagine playing this in the dead of night....... Superb game!			"

												I've only recorded two episode for ATS, only one has been posted to YouTube, but I will say that this game is extremely creepy! I know the bear is supposed to be my friend but the intro sequence combined with his dialog feels like the begging of a CSI episode where you get tricked into the closet with the stranger because ""it's safe"". That aside, once you get through the beginning part of the game it takes an Alice in Wonderland twist that I definitely didn't see coming but surprisingly works. I look forward to playing the rest of the game and seeing how the story plays out!

												Unlike other horror games, this one has a deep storyline, and will keep you playing until you finish this game. And unlike other games, you play as a 2 year old baby. Well, you won't be able to tell from reality now. ;) Good night.			"

												-Well Paced-Well Executed-Amazingly variable and creative gameplay-Uses everything in moderation-New and refreshing-GoodThis game is none of these things. Don't buy it unless you like repetitive puzzles combined with equally repetitive game mechanics numbers 1-5:1.) Crawling2.) Pulling out drawers to reach high places3.) pulling out various stools and chairs to reach high places4.) Collecting X number of items5.) Half baked stealthSpooky collectathon with a good plot but not worth the time or money. 4 out of 10 would never be among the sleep again.			"

 ""Among the Sleep? More like ""Among the Trash!""  ~Oscar Wilde Among the Trash Is where this game belongs. It's an interesting concept, but the story has a dumb, predictable twist, and the game is so full of bugs and glitches that it's hard to even get immersed. It's possible the developers may have patched it since I last played it, but is it too much to ask that your two hour walking simulator at least works properly on release?Let me paint you a picture: There's a game with three characters, and a monster. There are several clues that the monster is supposed to be a metaphor for someone, so logically it'd have to be one of the characters. Is it:A: The protagonistB: The character that never leaves the protagonist's sideorC: A character who is absent for 95% of the gameHmm, I wonder who will be revealed to be secretly a terrible human being in the shoehorned in twist ending?It's another ""great idea ruined by hack writers"" scenario. I'm disappointed. Oh well, into the trash it goes.

												A nice ol'e 20 buck 2 hour experiance. The first hour of which seems unscary and just plain unclear. Not until the last half do you actually get a taste of much more horror and can make you stand on the edge of your seat and looking twice behind you and around every corner. The atmosphere was beutiful to say the least and the gameplay mechanics were awesome. The plot ends up very rewarding and sums up very nice.Pros:Beutiful AtmosphereAwesome physics and interactionWalking patters and sounds really match an infantsCrystal clear sound which really adds to the gameGreat plot which will make you wanting more (in a good way)Geniunly scary moments in later moments of the gameCons:Hefty 20 buck priceShort 2-3 hour gameplayBoring startOverall: 8/10			"

												Interesting premise - greatly underperforming -  worth maybe 25% of current full priceAtmosphere: 6/10Gameplay: 3/10Story: 4/10Content/Price: 4/10Graphics: 4/10Being very different from conventional mystery/scary backgrounds, the setting of this game was catching my attention. Sadly, the game remains an empty shell, lacking variety/difficulty/surprise, and therefore is barely able to excite. Thus, I don't recommend buying this game for the current full price of 15/20/20  £/€/$. If anyone, people who are interested in the setting should wait for a HumbeBundle deal and try their luck.Just some of my impressions:- the atmosphere is OK but remains severely behind the full potential of the premise- the few scary moments aren't really scary and seem very artificial (and the ""shock"" effect is really ugly)- the story can be summed up in a sentence and is nothing special. Nonetheless, towards the end I found myself thinking ""OK I'd like to know what happened now"", but the ending is rather disappointing- game mechanics seem promising in the beginning but soon slide into tedium - very short play-through time of ~2,5h with no replay value whatsoever- experienced a few glitches, clipping and texture errors			"

												It is sort of like a survival horror game, even though half of the game is just horror and no survival part (unless you fall into the void). It looks beautiful and it is worked out quite well, except for one major flaw: The game wipes your progress in a level completely when you quit the game. Within the levels you have checkpoints and the game pretends to ""auto save"", but this is just as long as you do not stop playing it. It will simply punish you for stopping. Given the fact that the game has only about 5 levels it basically wipes up to 20% of your progress.			"

												Among The Sleep is an atmospheric, puzzling game that plays like a horror game but is technically an atmosphere test in disguise. Finally a studio that creates horror that decided to take a frickin' break from all the blood, gore and overexcessive monster designs. Now we have a monster that is completely black, hides in shadows, and each form of it rumored to be the child's parents. I'd favor to talk about each aspect of the game and what it does well.THE STORY: 60% 6/10To be honest I didn't like the story, because it didn't make any sense. Also it was too abbrieviated and ended way too fast. It would be nice to have a couple more levels according to the little video at the end of the ATS demo. Those in my opinion looked way nicer and refined. Also if you were to add the missing levels as DLC I would screech, that would be nice. So basically the story is you are a two year old child who goes to sleep one night only to be awoken by some noises and a supposed paranormal being. It is only until you  find out your mother is missing  and see the first monster you know things are wrong. You take your teddy bear and venture through three stages *Five technically throughout the entire game*. It's... a nice concept but as I said. It doesn't make sense and it's too brief. At least explain in the game how this happened!THE LEVEL DESIGN: 100% (Solid 10/10)The level design is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! I seriously love every single part of it and it's entirety. It kept my one, colorful eye on the screen and it's like a replacement for the story. The story is low brow but the graphics are the highlight of this game. Every single level is amazing and beautiful. It's odd how something so spooky can be such eye candy at the same time. The level design even reminded me of myself since when I was younger I had odd, strange dreams from time to time that resembled this game, and after I saw Among The Sleep's level design I flipped my♥♥♥♥♥♥and went totally crazy over this game. I'm even working on a game similiar to this that will be created on Unity, *Fun fact, Among The Sleep was also made on Unity*THE CHARACTERS 90% (9/10)Now there aren't many characters in Among The Sleep. *If you don't count the monsters, I'm not counting them since they've got no personalities and just want to capture you*, pretty much we have the child themself, the child's mother, Teddy, and the supposed father of the child which we can get traces of in the introduction of the mother in the first chapter. I'll talk about the mother first. The mother is the supposed main antagonist (due to her connection with the odd tree monster in the fourth act) By the end she seems to be a redeemed villain and still loves the main protagonist. Now we should talk about Teddy. He is one of the main protagonist alongside the child and he helps them manuever through the nightmarish parts of his dreams. The ending which involved Teddy is very creative and I love his character.CONCLUSION:Among The Sleep is a great horror game to play at night due to the buildup and spook the game brings. I recommend this game, it gets a 9/10!Have a nice day.			"

												I was so excited for this game. Been looking forward to it for a long time. It was a somewhat fun game, but not too scary and I managed to beat it in about 2 hours...

												It had pretty game assets, but all game play elements were lacking.  If there is a puzzle to solve look for a drawer to pull out. Done problem solved.  Accidentally attract the attention of the monster hide near a pulled out drawer and it won't figure out how to grab you.  The game felt like it wanted to be a platforming, physics based, hide and seek horror simulator puzzle game but fell well short in all parts.  This was not scary.  I do have to say though I really like the 4 different mushroom models. That's is all.			"

It looks as if the little kid in the game is actually the newborn gaming company they have :) They had to leave the safety of their homes, quit jobs and go through unknown scary places so they can finish this little game. This game is like a movie. You buy the ticket and sit for 2-3 hours till the end. And it delivers lots of shivers, lots of amazing moments, lots of pleasure. Unique. Totally worth it.

IntroAmong The Sleep is a first person horror adventure Indie game developed and published by Krillbite Studios for PC, MAC, Linux and PS4. Krillbite Studios is a Norwegian games Developer who has received over $300,000 Euro or ($500,000 USD) in total donations from The Norwegian Film Institute and from crowd funding..Was their money well spent..StoryIn this adventure you play as a 2 year old child on his birthday, when a stranger knocks on the door… to give you a present. the identity of this person is hidden from the player.Shortly after this event your mum decides its time for you to play with your new gift, the teddy bear, so she takes you upstairs.While going upstairs, the game is quick to kick in the creepy factor by making a wall of darkness follow you as the developer overlays there intro into this section.I won’t tell you anything else beyond this point as it will ruin it for you.Although I wouldn’t call Among the Sleep a horror game but it is still incredibly creepy and presents horror in a new light, more on that shortly.This is essentially the prologue and basic knowledge about Among The Sleep, but it doesn’t really give you to much because I don’t want to give the story away. Any more story elements I lay out for you will completely destroy the story for you.GameplayThe gameplay consists of basic aspects such as crawling, running, object throwing and simple puzzles.The walking animation is by far the best thing in this game :)All jokes aside, the gameplay is simple yet fun and this is probably one of the first horror games with a defenceless protagonist that actually makes sense…. GraphicsThe visuals in Among the Sleep were impressive for an indie game running on the Unity engine, unlike most Unity based games there wasn’t any motion blur that was over powering me while I played, this feature can get quite annoying so Im glad they opted out of that idea.There was one instance in the game were an object I needed to collect for progression didn’t actually fall down after hitting it sooo in order to continue I had to use a no clip console command to get it…Later the game crashed and luckily they had a checkpoint before as when the game reloaded I was able to collect the object correctly.Other than a few bugs here and there the game looked amazing and it really did feel like I was actually in this house, which for me made the experience that much more enjoyable.Sound DesignThe sound design in this game played an extremely important part, with ambient sound alone adding yet another layer of creepy to the environment which helped pull off a horror type experience.Some sounds that would appear to be scare sounds, weren’t scary at all but seemed placed there to keep you on your toes which I thought was a neat inclusion.Rather than trying to scare you constantly throughout the game, Krillbite decided to ease you into scares which if you havnt seen part 5 of my playthrough I would strongly recommend you go watch that, to get a real understanding as to what I am referring to.P.S. I nearly flew out of my chairVerdictAlthough there was a decent amount objects clipping through walls here and there… the core game didn’t get effected by this and the creepiness of this game grasped me in and made me want to understand what was going on in this world.Which for a horror game is a great step up from the rest… and well you’re a 2 year old with a talking teddy what more can you ask for.Bugs and issues aside, Among the Sleep was a solid indie game developed by Krillbite Studios and seeing as this is their first game… they didn’t do a whole lot wrong.That is why Among the Sleep gets an 8/10.

												Star: **Summary: It's very short (3:30 hours) for the cost (~£15). First 30 minutes were promising then the game changes location and goes downhill.Gameplay: It's a good idea exploring the normal world as a toddler: scary and atmospheric. But, once you enter the fantasy world, all that is lost.Tech: Did not work on my desktop Linux manchine. Very poor performance on my Linux laptop. Also, about 30% of the game had a bug where a bloom filter would whiteout the screen.			"

Walking around as a two year old is meh after 2.5 hours worth of game play.  Since steam thinks thumbs up or down seems rational I can only thumbs down. But from a % point of view I give it 55/100. Graphics are well done. Game play lost 45% since game play represents gaming.  "

The games atmosphere, puzzles, and length are suited for people of that age.People in this world who try to come off as being ""deep"" will automatically give this game a positive review. These are the same people who will downvote this review.Not scary in the slightest, whats scary is the fact that they charge more than $0.99 for this piece of crap.Among the Sleep? More like Among the Sh*t....games on steam.Edit: THEY ARE CHARGING $19.99 for this game!?!?!? Completed this game in its entirety in 1 hour 30 minutes.

Awesome that they took the perspective of a two year old and incorporated it into a horror game and suspenseful atmosphere, but once you leave the house and it unravels into a 'find the object to open a door' game, the small pleasures of being able to crawl, climb and snuggle a teddy bear loses its charm.

												This is a wonderfully creepy game. Simple but well done models and rendering are eerily enhanced with unsettling and some times disturbing music and sound effects. It is strange how safe you can feel holding your virtual teddy bear in the unknown worlds you explore. The story really comes together at the end and the journey was worth it. Short, casual gameplay / puzzle solving / hide from monsters style. 10/10. I did frequently get motion sickness and had to step away several times.			"

												I really, really wanted to like Among the Sleep. I mean, I kickstarted it, so clearly I was behind the idea.However, while I tried really hard to get myself into the mindset of this as an immersively spooky experience, it just kept drawing me out of the immersion by being buggy, repetetive, tedious, and did I mention buggy? Like... REALLY buggy.I finally, when it became clear that I was stuck at a point where the bugginess of the game was going to force me to have to replay a section for something like the fifth time, I just couldn't face another minute of it; The thought of relaunching the game was like a knot of bile rising in my gorge.First big complaint other than bugginess: No reasonable save function. I keep hearing developers make the same mistake over and over, saying that they know having a well-implemented save function is important to people and they always concur except their game is the one special snowflake where there is a compelling reason to not allow the player to arbitrarily save. You know what? No. There is never a good reason for that. Most of us have lives. The save points in this game are sometimes very far apart in time, and very tedious to get to. If you have to go get six McGuffins in a given region, the game will only save if you get all six and then find the exit to the next region. If you happen to be very busy or get interrupted frequently? I hope you like getting those first five McGuffins OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER again. Aside from that, this is a game that depends on you cutting it a lot of slack in return for a spooky atmosphere, and the tedium of the game kept pulling me out of that spooky atmosphere, whereupon all the things I'd been sort of forgiving -- sound effects that made no sense, terrible physics, terrible UI design, horrible movement mechanics, a lighting system that turns itself off at the drop of a hat so you're forced to re-enable it again ang again, instant-kill bad guys that can't always be avoided, bugs, etc. -- became hugely grating rather than things I could wave away. Ultimately, you can only forgive so much. This is a game I really wanted to love, but like that member of the family that just goes too far, there came a point where I had to just cut and run.			"

												The story is really solid and compelling, the pacing basically perfect, and the tension/horror is top notch. The environments are fairly linear but for the most part you don't really feel it - they're desined to make you think you're not really on a set path, and it works. Everything is designed to make you feel helpless and a little confused (just like real children ;) ). The only detraction is some of the physics can be a bit iffy, so it breaks the awesome atmosphere and immersion of the game. Between 2-4 hours of gameplay (depending on exploration and how tricky you find 1 or 2 of the puzzles). It was worth the price on sale ($15) for me, ymmv.			"

I saw a few people complain that this game was too short. But again, the reasons listed above made up for it. Either way, you'd see that this is a game that shouldn't be made extremely long anyway. If it was made long, it would ruin it and then people would complain that it was too ''dragged on''Basically, if you like a good story line, good graphics, and an ending you won't expect, buy this game.

Regardless, while the game was way too short, it was a good worthy buy, just dont expect a lot of gameplay.*SPOILER ALERT*Story? I understand you are looking for your mom, but it frustrates me that the game doesnt reallt explain the ending all that well. Also the game felt like it was just too short!

												The game was over just as I thought it would start. The opening sequence was well made. That was the best part of this game.Maybe 1-2 hours of gameplay. No replayability, not much in terms of horror. Useless lean-function. No puzzles other than picking up things and using them 10 seconds later in really obvious places, or climbing on top of things. If their target audience is 5-years old I imagine it could be a scary and adequately challenging game. To anyone else, it is a borefest. Follow the linear path through the various areas and try not to be bothered by all the reused props in the environments. Easily dodge the few poorly made antagonists. Yawn as nothing scary happens. Finish the game. Uninstall and never play again.NOT worth 20 eur. Go see a movie with a friend instead. More fun per second per money in that. Godzilla was pretty good.			"

I had to restart a few times cuz of objects not doing what they were suppost to but it was no big deal. Has some great scares. It only took me 2 hours to beat the game, and thats with exsploring and taking my time. But worth the buy!			"

												Ever since backing the game last May I was very excited to play it. I have to say, after playing I can say it's an ok game. VERY SHORT (beware if you're looking to spend $17.99 on something a little more fleshed out), minor bugs such as bugging through the floor in the very beginning if you open the bottom drawer and then try to crawl under the chest of drawers. It had a great atmosphere and thought provoking story. Perfect budget title. I'm glad I helped back it because these developers did a great job with the game. Just wish it was a little more polished and had some replay value.			"

												*Spoiler FreeI have completed the game twice once to play the game and a second to get the achievements. The first time I played it took me several hours to complete, I played from about 11pm till 5 or 6 am and it was scary in the dark headphones on. For that the game is good really good. But the second playthrough was less than an hour to speed run the game at least it felt like hour a rushed hour. I played the test build and that definitely got me hyped up for the game, they changed a lot since alpha for the better. It portrays a brilliant message and is worth playing just for that. I still plan to play a third time but I don't see myself playing anymore than that. I'd not worth the cost wait for a sale. With the generous steam sales putting the cost down I'd say its worth a play but not at full price unless they release loads of free DLC it is too expensive for the short play time. All in all good game supports VR for those using Oculus Rift or other VR machines. I'd also say it needs more achivements, I like achivements and the more the better.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. The controls are tight, the music and ambient sound never let up, and the visuals really capture the feel of a world from a small child's perspective. And the story, without giving anything away, will disturb you and might even make you think.The controls feel very similar to Amnesia, at least in the sense of how you interact with the world. Opening doors and turning valves, picking up objects to throw, rotate, or carry, and using the bear as a flashlight will all feel very familiar to players that have braved the halls of Castle Brennenburg.The audio, in all its forms, is unrelenting. Even the lack of audio at times will fill you with such a sense of impending dread that you will slowly and cautiously navigate the surrounding. And sometimes even the slightest 'bang' or 'crash' will send you scurrying towards any safe haven, for fear of something coming up behind you.The visuals have such a grasp of a child's imagination it is uncanny. Words are as scribbles, sense a child cannot comprehend them, and drawings litter the worlds, as if a tiny person is giving you clues that you can easily understand without a spoken or written language. And the literal perspective of everything towering over you really draw on the feeling of helplessness in an unknown place, with only your teddy bear as comfort.Overall, this is a delightful horror gem. There is no reason to only catch it on a sale, for fear of it being underwhelming. If you enjoy horror games with thought, puzzles, and huge atmosphere, then 'Among the Sleep' is an absolute must have.			"

Though this game wasn't as scary as I wanted it to be, This game had it's times where it is down right terrifying! Saddly, this game was also very short. However, they mannaged to fit a lot in one level. The fear factor was high in certain parts, and I'm going to be completly honest, I nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥myself in some parts.

												For modern horror games these days it's not about superstrong enemies but about unarmed and vulnerable players trying to survive in an oppressive and potentialy lethal situation. Among The Sleep takes this approach to a new and original level. You play as two year old child on the night of your birthday in what turns out to be a far more disturbing game than the cute intro scenes suggest. As a defenseless toddler wondering around a dark house, you have good incentive to stay out of harms way. But that's not the most uncomfortable thing about this. It's the familiarity of the situation. Aliens in spaceships and zombies in castles are scary, sure, but at least they're fictional stories that non of us have had to go through in real life. In this game though we have. We've all been toddlers, and we all know what it's like to be scared of dark rooms and the unfamiliar (which is most stuff at that time). As well as the halucination-like imaginations. It takes you right back to those early memories.You are accompanied through most of this by a talking Teddy that can light up and even walk around at times. He's no fighter though.When I first started playing it I thought it was going to be a ghost story along the lines of Poltergeist or Paranormal Activity. Overturned cot, strange sounds, doors opening by themselves, flickering TV and lightning. But the game takes a much stranger turn as the normal but dark house at night gives way to earie and disturbing Tim Burton-ish dreamscapes. The puzzles that need solving are simple enough. You are meant to be a two year old after all. But creeping around these strange yet weirdly familiar places trying to find the pieces is not.I soon realised it's no ghost story, but a journey through dreams, memories and metaphores. But lurking among this childs imaginative world is somthing real, right now and threatening. It's up to you to find out what it is.It's a relatively short game, but if you're looking for a game that gives you a fresh and emotionaly intense experience, it's well worth getting.			"

												So I am not a huge survival horror guy, I prefer co-op games.  When I first saw among the sleep I admit I was skeptical, but I have kids.  Because I have kids I never really undestood what it was like to be in an environment that was bigger than me, the concept behind it was beyond me.  So I figured I would try it out.  Now, in DOOM you get a gun, in the MULTITUDES OF SLENDER GAMES you can run fast and whip out your flashlight and feel some sort of security, but in this game....  You a baby, a 2 year old lovable little munchin who wants nothing more than to just be a baby.  Then the weird stuff starts to happen...  I had goosebumps the whole time while I looked for my mommy...  I havent made it very far in but I am in love with this game.  I realistically see 1 playthrough out of it for myself but, in any case it is very addictive and the story behind it seems pretty good... I'm 2...  I went to sleep, I woke up, I'm scared.... Wheres my mom....  If you dont like to commit to the price, just download the demo...  It's worth a shot.			"

												The horror feeling was nicely done, not only from a toddler's perspective was it scary. The blurry screen and the shaking and wow the sounds was really haunting. It was really well done.Of course since the game is basically you playing a two-year old there is of course a limit to what you can do. It's not an all-out horror story, it's a little kid being scared and altohugh with imagination one can think of quite some scary things, it had to be as close to realistic as possible, which I lvoed and it totally achieved.I loved every level, how the details for example the particular objects scattered throughout an eare, hinted at something that was going on in the real life, but it was invading the toddler's dreams. Also they did an excellent job on giving you a false sense of security/safety in the beginning.Anyway, it was a joy to play. A simple yet invigorating to play through and excellent work on showing how real life things can affect everyone. Loved the twist and loved Teddy! So if you like horror games but are a bit of a scarecat or if you're simply looking for a quick enjoyable experience to pass the time, definitely try this one. It's got it all.			"

												Among the Sleep is not your typical horror game. It is a bit short, but not as short as the 1 hour playtime that I've seen others give. I'd say it's a solid 2-3 hour game, a little more if you explore the environment (which you should). It's got a beautiful, touching story that reveals itself gradually. The environments you travel through are varied and very rich, with minimal texture reusing, which is unusual and refreshing in an indie game. The atmosphere is perfect and creepy, but not chock full of jump scares. The first parts of the game will lull you into a false sense of security. To say anything more would be a spoiler.There's no incentive to replay unless you missed a Steam achievement, and this game isn't really made for replays because the story will have been revealed. However, I think the first experience was solid enough and unique enough to stand on its own. I got it for $15.99 and thought it was well worth the price because it seems much higher quality than other indie games and I am very interested to see what else the developers can do. I highly recommend it!			"

												First of all, it's a good game with a great atmosphere. But it has definite flaws. It's a very linear game, with nothing to explore and no replay value. I was rushing it from beginning to the end. It relies too much on the ""symbolic"" of the world (think Silent Hill), but in a way which is too obvious and ruins the suspens. I knew the ending of the game in the first minutes of gameplay : a very cliché ending, ideological and pathetic, which almost made me dislike this game.But all in all, it has a slight feeling of fear and eeriness, with an original game design, which compensate.

												Great, terrifying game. From a design perspective, choosing to make the main character a baby is brilliant. It's like the hopless feeling you get when playing Amnesia, but dramatically increased. Speaking of Amnesia, the gameplay will be very familiar to veterans. Walk around (sometimes crawl), move things, pick things up. Pieces of the story are subtly told through childish drawings found in various locations. It's enough to be able to accurately predict what's really going on, yet it isn't stated plainly, giving you a sense of accomplishment. The jump scares were usually done on my own accord, like making the baby breathe harder after running, or knocking something over. The ambience, as well as the creeping fear that something unstoppable is following you, sets the stage for you to scare yourself. And then, when you laugh at yourself, something intentionally terrifying happens, and you go change your underwear.For those that care, the graphics are decent. Average to low poly models, relatively low resolution textures, but they get the job done. They are readable enough that you can tell a key from a doorknob, which is all it really needs. You won't have much time to focus on the scenery, or if you do, adjusting your view will make you realize that something was focusing back at you.			"

												Stunningly ShortI heard about this title and Dreadout at about the same time. Of the two I am more satisfied with Among the Sleep, mainly because it is actually finished, however, it is about as long as the unfinished Dreadout. That's not to say there's anything wrong with the game there definitely could have been a little bit more, but since you do play as a baby I believe that any more would have been difficult to incorporate with a sense of realism still being kept, although it is clearly a fantasy. However I reccomend this game mostly for it's story, there isn't a lot of dialogue but you start to realize as you play what is happening and it is honestly pretty ♥♥♥♥ing deep. $20 is somewhat reasonable but I'd wait for another sale.

												I don't typically play horror games, let alone finish them, but this was one that I had completed. It's short, unsettling, and the weird stuff that you see along the way all makes sense in the end. Set pieces that are seen throughout the game are used thoughtfully and lead the player to ask questions. It's also interesting because of the obvious thing: you're playing from the perspective of a two year old child. I'd personally say that this is worth buying, because I felt that every penny of my purchase was made worthwhile.			"

The game keeps you on edge, and provides clever hints to the story, and doesn't need flashing arrows to tell you which way to go. You'll feel like a child again playing the game, everything is big, and the sounds in dark corridors bring back memories.Among the Sleep gets a solid 8/10 in my book. I encountered only one bug, and I didn't have to restart much in order to get past it (It was my own error).			"

												In Among the Sleep, by Krillbite Studio, you will take on the role of a 2 year old child who just had his birthday. You are eating cake in the arms of your mom when there is a knock at the door. This is followed by an argument, and then your mom coming back in with a present. You then fast forward to around bedtime/nap time, I'm not really sure which. It is then that the game takes on a nightmarish overlay.The visual look of this game felt like it fit with the character being a 2 year old. I'm not saying that it was rainbows and puppies, but there were those softer colors, even when everything was dark. The levels of this game were beyond creepy, especially for me because I have an almost 2 year old, so I could see myself in his shoes. There is a slight terror to knowing that something bad could happen right out of the corner of your eye. The levels span from a deserted play ground, a library in a forest, small sections of your house, and more. There are villains that creep around as well. All I have to say is you are going to need to hide from them, or you will suffer a restart of the section you are in. I also really enjoyed the companion, the teddy bear that helped me along. All I had to do was hug it and he would produce a little bit of light that would help me see through the darkness.The sounds in this game are extremely creepy. Once again it was doubley so because I have a young son, and hearing those noises creep around in a dark area would scare the pants off me at that age. I also think the voice acting in this game was spot on. I could see the roles of the mother and the teddy bear in the voices given.The controls of the game are your usual configuration with WASD, shift to run, ctrl to crawl or get up, space to climb, and the mouse to control the camera and interact with objects.Though this game wasn't as long as I would have hoped, it definitely had enough there to keep me on my toes, and hoping that nothing was going to get me around the next corner. There is just something about this game that awakened long gone fears of my childhood, and the fear of what is in the dark. In this respect the developers did a great job. To be honest I can't really think of anything I found clunky or missing from this game. I will tell you this, the twist is a hell of one, and I'm not going to tell you what it is because you need to play this game to find out, but when the game ends everything kind of makes better sense.There were definitely puzzle aspects to this game, most of the time it was moving objects so that you could get to a different location, but there were a couple of times where the developers threw in a mechanism just for a small section of the game that changed things up a little. A couple examples of this would be throwing objects to knock something off a shelf, or collecting a specific type of object so that you could weigh down the end of something so you could get to the other side. I'm not saying that this was a bad thing, but I would have liked to see a little bit more of these mechanics, to do them once and then seeming to throw them away made me feel like they were afterthoughts in the game creation process.So lets get down to the part that most of you want to know, and that is should you play this game. The answer is yes, you should play this game, and you should play it in the dark, at night, and pray that no one sneaks up behind you while you are playing. This game gets an 8.9 out of 10.			"

												This is probably the first Survival Horror game that hit me on a psychological level. Delivering you into the body of a two year old child, you must navigate the dark and disturbing world of a troubled mind and uncover the mysterious dissappearence of your mother. Alongside you a teddy bear named ""Teddy"" aids you in your journey often keeping you comfort when you need it. The game sets up an interesting premise but falls short at making you feel more vulnerable as a child as opposed to any other horror game. The true feat here is how large and menacing the environments are and the illusion that every object in the game world is either falling on you or trying to pull you in. Quite often in places you dont want to go. That combined with the chilling ambient sound make for a very unnerving atmosphere. The story is well written and completely out of left field. Please buy if you consider yourself a fan of this genre.			"

												This game really immerses you into a nightmare. With a crisp soundtrack and a colourful visuals, you feel like you're in a constant state of horror. SPOILER:The plot of the game was very unclear to me at first, but I suppose they meant to do that for the ending sums everything up in about a minute. Coming to the understanding that the mother herself is the actual antagonist and a drunk, you find that it was your father who was at the door and that he is the boy's safe-haven. The father is the one who gifts the teddy bear to you, and once you realize that, you see why there is a heavy emotional bond between the bear and the boy.There's a deep moral message to this game, and it makes you think rather than just play a game.

												The storyline within the game itself is unexpected and imaginative. The events that unfolded were not expected for this game- completely different from what I had expected. That being said, playing through it by myself in a somewhat dark room with high definition surround sound- there were moments where I was definitely freaked out. I'd recommend this game to any casual gamer, or someone who doesn't want to devote a lot of time to a game, but enjoys the horror genre nonetheless. It may seem kidish or even childish at some points, but the overall plot is much more than to be anticipated. Enjoy!			"

												This game is like no other that I've played.I'm not usually one for horror games, but the aspect of being a child looking for his mother in a horrific enviorment intrigued me. I just beat the game a few moments ago, and all I can say is 'Wow'.  At first, Teddy came off as super creepy, but as the game progressed, I was thankful to have his company. The ending of this game was probably the main point for me. The emotion that I felt while completing the Final Chapter was intense.This game is a must play. Even if you dont like jump scares, the end will make everything worthwhile.			"

However, there has been said to be some free DLC in the works...I enjoy it. It is a very very good game that just simply isnt long enough.7/10when DLC comes will be 9/10			"

												'Among the Sleep' is an indie first-person horror adventure game on Steam, about the thirtieth to come out since Amnesia: The Dark Descent became wildly popular and everyone started pumping out crappy copycats like half-bred mutts at a puppy mill. Regardless of how tired I am of seeing 'of Horror' or 'Lovecraft' or 'Dark' being added on to a bunch of half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥titles, Among the Sleep caught my eye as a birthday game release and after reading the concept, decided to take a chance on it.The game's protagonist is a two-year old boy living with his single mother, and apart from thudding heartbeats and occasional toddleresque grunts of fear or exertion it's no surprise that the main character follows the Gordon Freeman camp of protagonist dialogue. This makes perfect sense, given little Gordy's age, but in order to give voice to the character's emotions and the player's observations, a birthday-gift Teddy bear takes on the Alyx Vance role as vocal sidekick, though whether he's 'magic' or just an imagined sidekick is left up to the player.It might not be immediately appealing to read that the main character is a toddler. It sounds gimmicky and hard to pull off, and I'm sure it was. But Krillbite Studios took the challenge seriously; the mechanics, story, and aesthetic all embrace this concept wholly and do it well.The gameplay matches the controls and concept; most of your challenges involve simple scavenger hunting, or moving objects around to climb on to reach other areas. This doesn't really get boring, because the game isn't very long. There are some wheel-crankings and such, but the puzzles are simple to work out and it's clear that Krillbite are more interested in seeing you enjoy the aesthetic and atmosphere than they want to stump you with a real brain-teaser. I mean for God's sake, you're a two-year-old; the puzzles aren't going to throw you for a serious loop. The environments are haphazard and nutty without being confusing or messy; the nighttime dreamscapes of an infant made playable. The art style itself isn't groundbreaking or super high-def, but they're clearly creating workable, playable, surreal environments that avoid the clutter-crap-style that some other horror indies I've played attain (cough, Anna).The triumph of Among the Sleep's style is that the environments start feeling consistently tense and foreboding because of how close and immense they feel in comparison to you. Again, they're really embracing the concept of little Gordy being a small, frightened child alone in a large, frightening world. The wooded areas feel like a 3-D rendition of Limbo with the level of character helplessness you'd expect to find while playing Slender.Among the Sleep is a horror game that offers a new twist on the gameplay and does it well from every angle. It has a pretty short playtime but also never drags on. The story ends pretty abruptly and the little details and hints are never made entirely clear, but the game ends with a pretty big emotional punch to the gut.			"

If you want to fight things or want blood and gore in your horror this probably won't be for you, but damned if they don't prove that the sound of a plate breaking can be scarier than a walking corpse if it's done right.

This game is no exception. My short registred game time is due to the fact that I can't play it.And since that is my platform I can't do anything but not recommend this game. Please, developers of the world: When you publish a game for a platform, bother to at least *try* and see if it works on the platforms you are supposed to support.Having a compile menu in your devtool with ""Linux"" as an output option is *not* enough.

												Loved this game! You could get around 3 hours of play if you really stretched it out, but expect around 2. They are planning a free DLC in the future though. This game isn't that super scary.. It is more of a pshycological horror. Great sound design makes it seem as if something is going to get you, but nothing actually does for about the first half of the game. ""Hiding"" in this game is different than in Amnesia and other games of the sort. The atmosphere is really what makes the game what it is, the surroundings are creepy and make you wonder what is actually happening. The ending really brings it all together. I'd give it about a 7/10.			"

												This one is a little difficult for me to go with a YES or NO. Some points I want to make.I've been seeing this compared to Outlast & Amnesia. Cut it out. The similarities end with it being ""horror"" genre, and the only option you have when facing trouble is run or hide. Positives ++Eerie scenery. (what kinda got me to check it out,it looked at first that it would have an American McGee's Wonderland feel)+Loved the visuals+Cool soundtrack.+Plenty noises and things that would terrify a toddler, amped up to make it spooky.+Pretty imaginative. Remember back on  the things that scared you as a child... well, yea, a lot of that. Negatives --Far too short. I even spent some time exploring the levels. Soaking in the scenery. Managed to finish around 2 hours. -Took awhile for me to learn any repercussions in the game. The Teddy would suggest being quiet, and I just would go about my business. Even chased a monster down in the woods before it disappeared trying to see if anything would happen. Wasn't until it caught me later near the end of the game, that I learned the monster does infact interact with you. -Very simplistic puzzles. (which I get it, you're a baby.)- How you're expecting the story to end, it pretty much does.-Just wasn't really ever that scared. I think knowing that I was a child, and that harm to a child in any game is pretty much taboo... I felt basically invincible the entire time. (at one point in time, to sate my curiosity, I did drown myself. lol. but just the thought that no real danger would come to me, created a ""Star power"" mentality.)Side notes-Lots of foreshadowing. Pay attention to things said earlier on, drawings on paper and chalked on the walls. You'll know where the story is heading. If you ever saw the 1995 movie, Tales from the Hood, the similarity between the two makes it very hard to not see the metaphor the game implies.But, it was very cool for an indie game. However in my opinion, 19.99 is sorta steep for what is offered with this game. If you can get it on sale, do it. I am looking forward to see what the developers come up with the future.			"

												*Spoiler FreeI have completed the game twice once to play the game and a second to get the achievements. The first time I played it took me several hours to complete, I played from about 11pm till 5 or 6 am and it was scary in the dark headphones on. For that the game is good really good. But the second playthrough was less than an hour to speed run the game at least it felt like hour a rushed hour. I played the test build and that definitely got me hyped up for the game, they changed a lot since alpha for the better. It portrays a brilliant message and is worth playing just for that. I still plan to play a third time but I don't see myself playing anymore than that. I'd not worth the cost wait for a sale. With the generous steam sales putting the cost down I'd say its worth a play but not at full price unless they release loads of free DLC it is too expensive for the short play time. All in all good game supports VR for those using Oculus Rift or other VR machines. I'd also say it needs more achivements, I like achivements and the more the better.			"

												Absolute garbage. More VIDUEGUMES IS ART ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. No challenge is presented at any point in the game. The walking/running/crawling mechanic only serves to make the game slightly longer since it takes longer to get from point A to point B. The bear is the only character in the game and does nothing except explain obvious things to you. The art assets range from poor to mediocre.Wish I could get a refund. Stupid norweigans.			"

												I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that Among the Sleep is perhaps creepier than the original Amnesia to myself.Why?Well we've all been there.  Seeing a place in the daytime only to return during the nocturnal hour and see that what was once a bright and cheery place is now something dark and twisted.  Shadows creep along walls that once held happy portraits and floorboards creeking now signify the arrival of another eldritch horror coming to drag us off to hell.Among the Sleep captures this feeling and does it very well.But I can't just say good things, no I have two complaints.  1. The game is horrifically short.  How short?  I beat it in about two hours.  Was it a good two hours?  You bet your♥♥♥♥♥  2. The ending...well the ending is pretty easy to figure out.  I won't spoil anything but when you start to notice some of the clutter laying about it starts to stand out.  Though I didn't figure it out until the third act because until then I thought it was something else entirely.			"

												Short, but sweet, this is almost your typical first person horror game, except there's a twist: you're a toddler. The gameplay mainly revolves around a ""find the thing"" mechanic that has you crawling, walking, pushing, and pulling your way across several locales while occasionaly avoiding some manner of big bad. In this respect the game is most similar to Slender in many respects although with a definite focus on surreal visuals that coupled with the distorted perspective of a small child create a much more atmospheric experience. While the game has more bark than bite in the horror department and the story (such as it is) doesn't so much unfold as fall into your lap toward the end, Among the Sleep is quality experience. Though the $20 price for less than 3 hours of non-repetition warranting gameplay is a bit steep, I'd still recommend checking this title out, though you may want to wait for a 50% off sale.			"

												To clear the air I by no mean think this  game is by any strech of the imagination is bad. I was so excited to see this title. I myself hate playing scary games and rather watch so I took the leap with this one. The atomosphere is the games strongest selling point. Everything about this made me want more and now has me intruiged on what this studio will bring to the table. On the sad side this game lacks length, but was said to be short so no complaints. It pained me to not be able to go through more creepy hall ways and crawling on my hands with my teddy. The last thing I can say that brings the game down is the lack of threat. Sure the noises and heart beats had me sitting in the corners for a few mins making sure nothing was after me, but after a while they were just noises. Although when the threat was chasing me it had me freaking out. Pick this up when it goes on sale for 20% off if you can wait.			"

												Pros: A lot of attention has been placed on the backstory to this game, and there a plenty of little clues to what is going on. The developers seemed to have a fairly good understanding of how children think as well, and it paints a picture of abuse pretty well.It is pretty artistically done, as well.Cons: It is relatively short. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, in that it took about as long as it needed for the story, but can be a downstide for anyone expecting a lot of play out of this game. Since it is story focussed, any replays are mostly going to be to pick up things you missed the first time.I would have appreciated more information on the father in the backstory. Still, pay attention when you do here what is presumably his voice at the end, because it's pretty familiar.This game does 'have feels'. I was actually fairly angry on the behalf of the child in the game by the end, as well as sad to see the whole situation. I'd recommend picking it up, but likely when it's on sale, as I feel the normal price would be a bit much for the amount of gameplay you get.			"

												I have to admit, I was a bit worried about grabbing this game and giving it a go with the reviews all over the board. I am typically not a  huge fan of horror games or really anything that tries to toy with my emotions *GAWD DAMNIT IM FRAGILE OK!* Anyways after a disappointingly short two and a half hours of play I can say that as a game, it was beautiful. Should it have been longer, YES, was it scary, no, not really but I was expecting it to be. What this game does is goes beyond its peers of its genere and immerses you in the body and mind of a child with a teddy companion. You explore a world from their perspective and are left with a storyline involving a serious issue that is often lurking in the shadows.			"

												Tough call on this game. From a gameplay standpoint, it is short as others have mentioned, I would say zero replay value unless you wait a couple of years and come back to it. I didn't experience any bug issues at all but I know that can vary from machine to machine.  I didn't find it terribly scary once I got used to the music and sound fx, I think I died twice through the whole game and didn't find it very challenging.That said I think this is probably psychologically the most messed up game I've ever played.  I had a good idea where the plot was going early on but still found it disturbing. I think it was a really good concept that could have been so much more.			"

												At first glance, the game seems a little pricey for the hours logged. But, one thing that is worth noting is that the game has very little down time. The pacing is good and the game alterantes primarily between suspence and intensity. Had it been longer, it would have worn out its charm. And had it been less expensive... Well, everyone has to make a living, and I'm sure a lot of work went the game. It's very polished and the visuals and sound are fantastic, so I don't feel ripped off. The two hours (ish... I left it paused for a little while) I got from the game were as fulfilling as any ""full length"" game, just condensed. I think a lot of people expect more out of games in terms of value, but that doesn't always seem fair. Considering how much you end up paying to see a movie at the theater, or for a a few rounds of drinks at a bar, this game starts to look like a pretty good deal. Overall, no matter how much you think you're getting ripped off, chances are good that a video game is still the best value in terms of hours per dollars spent.			"

Because you are, as you travel through this demented dimension of memories and scary figures, you have no idea what's going to happen or how you'll escape the big scary demons that appear every now and then. I'm only maybe half way through the game but dang, it's a great horror game for those gutsy enough to try it out. And even for those who aren't, it's a REALLY fun creepy game to play with friends. 9/10 - IGN: it was okay.			"

												Assuming the role of a todder on their second birthday, players of Among the Sleep go on a dark, atmospheric journey that expertly plays on childhood fears and anxieties to create an immersive, if uneven, experience. After being put to bed by their mother, the player interacts with their new birthday present: Teddy the teddy bear. Teddy guides the player out of the bright, warm bedroom and into a dark, forbidding world. Stuck in this world away from their mother, the player must explore the dark environments and solve puzzles to recieve items which represent fond memories of their mother. The player explores the world by slowly walking through the environments or by crawling, which is much faster. The player is able to climb over obstacles and interact with many objects in the world. In dark areas, the player can hold Teddy tight, making the toddler feel more confident and lighting the way. The design is minimalistic and encourages the player to immerse themselves in the toddler's world. The environments are distorted perceptions of a normal household. The dark tone makes things appear more menacing than they would normally, adding to the tense atmosphere. In several environments, a dark presence hunts the player, forcing them to hide. The gameplay in these sections feel similar to Slender: The Arrivial but requires the player to hide, rather than run away, adding to the tension.Among the Sleep is short but still feels repetitive toward the end. The final section is satisfying enough to warrant a playthrough and the game as a whole delievers a well crafted psychological experience.			"

												Baby's first horror game! Most horror games put you in the shoes of an at least somewhat competent ""hero"", some even give you weapons. Among The Sleep is not one of those games. Here you're put into the blue jammies of a 2-year-old scared and confused little kid. The perspective alone makes a world of difference. Everything is more scary when you can't quite orientate yourself, tables become insurmountable objects and hallways become mile-long catacombs. There's also the fact that as a toddler you're weak, literally, so moving things becomes slow and difficult. And with your short legs outrunning danger becomes nigh impossible. I could go on a while as to why being a baby is scary stuff... And this game executes the experience very well. Coupled with a nebulous but interesting story, awesome visuals and terrifying design on everything. Yeah, it's a success. My only complaint is that it could've been a little bit longer.			"

												First of all, it's a good game with a great atmosphere. But it has definite flaws. It's a very linear game, with nothing to explore and no replay value. I was rushing it from beginning to the end. It relies too much on the ""symbolic"" of the world (think Silent Hill), but in a way which is too obvious and ruins the suspens. I knew the ending of the game in the first minutes of gameplay : a very cliché ending, ideological and pathetic, which almost made me dislike this game.But all in all, it has a slight feeling of fear and eeriness, with an original game design, which compensate.

												Fantastic game, especially considering it was made by indie developers. Most of the animations were spot-on, which is more than you can say about a lot of games, especially modern AAA games. I only encountered one glitch in the entire game but it wasn't game-breaking.This is an absolute must for 1st-person horror game lovers who love to let themselves get immersed in a story that pieces itself together as you go along. It is short but I don't think that counts against it; it's short but sweet and doesn't overstay its welcome. I would say this is a $10-$15 game rather than $20 but that doesn't at all mean I regret buying it. It's rare to find a horror game of this caliber, in that it's a game that uses pure atmosphere, sounds, and tension to scare you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rather than Five-Nights-At-Freddy's-jump-scare-bonanza-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t			"

												A great take on the horror genre, using the imagination of an infant to portray very real horrors of everyday life. While not exactly♥♥♥♥♥♥your-pants scary (although some may disagree!) it is definitely creepy and has some pretty unsettling moments, with top notch atmosphere and sound design to boot.			"

												I'm actually a sissy when it comes to horror games - especially if they are in 1st person.However, the overall concept of the game caught me and after some while fearing, that I just couldn't get through the game, I snatched it using a humble bundle and tried.The game is just great. The main theme is the fear and awkwardness, children have in a world they don't fully understand. They tend to ""interpret"" things they see, so that they somehow make sense in their eyes. And that's what the game's doing. If you would be a grownup character, you wouldn't find any of the events in ""Among the Sleep"" terrifying, but through the eyes of a toddler, even a simple flash can be horrifying. And that's what the game really does well: It puts you in an atmosphere and plays with the surroundings, the size of the main character and its large amount of fantasy.So the creeps don't come from blood-dripping corpses or something like that. It comes from sounds, voices, height, eerie shadows, lonelyness and helplessness.The sound is aiding this pretty well and the overall sound composition is fitting in any minute.I, too, have to say, that the game is pretty short considering it's usual price. But after about 2,5h of creeps, I was kinda happy to really finish the game and get on with more milder themes. ;-)I highly recommend this game to people, that like to get some good shivers now and then, but don't actually want to be creeped out. Horror-Pros might find this game not so creepy, but may find the concept rather interesting.I hope, that's not the last game we see from Krillbyte.			"

												Great game! Very unique take on perspective in the horror genre playing as a 2 year old. Certainly not the scariest game, but great atmosphere, fun playthrough (albeit short), and I personally really apreciated the story (I cried at the end). I don't normally write reviews, but this game stuck with me and I felt compelled to provide some feedback. Compared to other games, it is really short for the price of the game... but I enjoyed it more than many movies where I have paid more money for less time spent. Definitely pick it up if it's on sale and you like a creepy, surreal atmosphere in games.			"

												I was very impressed with this game. I got it for $4.99 during the summer sale and it was well worth the 5 or so hours i spent beating it. Its a short game, it could be beaten in 2 hours if you just cruised through, i was genuinly scared many times throughout the game and having a nearly 2 year old myself i think i was a little more on edge about the dangers the child faced and how a child may percieve things they dont understand. I defintely gave my daughter a big hug when it was over lol pros:-never a dull moment as the game is short so nothing is repetative.-unique world design.-lots of scary moments that had the hairs on my arm standing up.-puzzles werent so hard i had to google any tips, but not so easy it was boring.-didnt run into any bugs throughout the entire game.cons:-the game is a little too short, seems like they could have added a few more sections.-some parts of the game were a little too dark, i tried adjusting the light settings but it didnt help much.-only 4 achievements available, i realize its a short game but as basic as the 4 they had were, they could have done 6 or so more to give me an excuse to do a second or 3rd play through.

You can enjoy unique areas and puzzles as you make an attempt to find your mother, and the controls are easy to adapt to if you're not used to playing games. The only issue I have with the game is that I love it so much that it feels too short.			"

												Wow, just wow. I finished the game about an hour ago, but i just can't get the ending out of my head. Not only was it scary as all hell, the atmosphere often left the hairs on the back of my neck standing tall. I can only imagine how scary the world could be as a toddler, but the devs did a damn good job trying.Not to mention, this hit so close to home for me, growing up in a torn family, there were many horrors in my adolescents, and I'm not ashamed that the ending left me in tears, I could sympathise so much with the character on the screen...I fully recommend, the only negative I could find was it's brevity, though the ending pulled everything together so well, i can't knock it for that.

Summary 7.9/10A purely story-driven adventure that has no other direction but forward, but a good pace and experience in general leaves you satisfiedThe Good:- Great scares- Good use of tactics and required ""know-how""- Cute, but bat-sh*t crazy- Dark and Eery, while also being justified- Sense of justice and acomplishment in the end- Strong connection with protagonist (At least for me.)- Great use of ambient soundThe Bad:- Expensive for so little time I put into it and completed it- Abysmal voice acting- Disappointing ending, although conclusive- Repetitious- Sudden cuts in audio and poor blending- Constant clipping, and extremely obviousConclusionAmong the Sleep is a lot like an Italian dessert. Its absurdly small, it's a poor decision, expensive and somewhat unhealthy in structure, but overall tasty and satisfying. If you loved Slender, play this. If the theme itself interests you, go for it. If you are looking for a long-lasting meal with dessert at the end, find another. It's good, but nothing I'd ever probably order again.			"

												Very original take on the horror genre. As a toddler, the world seems much bigger and intimidating then it actually is.Sadly, this also extends to the 'monster' that stalks you through the levels. Even though the static and loud noises are somewhat disturbing the first couple of times, it's really easy to hide from it so this wears off rather fast.Still, great atmosphere, a well-thought story that leaves a couple of blanks for us to fill in for ourselves, and certainly a recommendation for people that enjoy horror games without all the blood and gore.

												I bought this at the discounted price for Halloween, and it was damn worth it.  I'm someone who enjoys being scared, and this definitely did the trick.  It was eerie, and the vulnerability of being a 2 year old child is definitely felt by the player.  The largeness of the world is intimidating, and the creepy figure lurking in the darkness definitely has its own surprising moments.  If it wouldn't have been on sale, I probably wouldn't have gotten it, because it's only about 3 hours of gameplay and I'm not sure it has very much replayability, but, on sale, it was definitely worth the $7.

												It's a very atmospheric and a nice experience. The ending twist is a decent plot twist, although if you pay attention to your surroundings it is not that shocking of a reveal :) Some really nice art direction on some of the environments. I liked it very much, and audio desing is fittingly creepy. This type of abstract horror is much more effective than jumpscares. The negative is the horrendous performance and general clunkyness of the game code. Framerate is erratic, jumping around even VSynced, stream loading of environments are bad, and certain areas have some bugs making the framerate flicker from 57-60-62-60 all the time even when synced causing major stuttering and general unsmoothness. Some bugs as well. Does not trap the mouse in fullscreen, so on a multimonitor setup the mouse will sometimes exit the game when you click it (annoying when chased by monster guy and trying to hide). Some inventory bugs, also some graphical issues on light sources. But the stuttering is the worst i've seen in a while. Something is generally really wrong in certain areas of the game and it break an otherwise masteful immersion. I still recommend the game though, as it is a very atmospheric experience and you will love the detail of the environments  "

												Among the Sleep really surprised me!  It was much scarier than I anticipated and I found the story to be intelligently weaved into the gameplay.  The setting, the atmosphere, the controls – all of it fits together perfectly to achieve the mythical “Immersive” factor that so many games fall short of. Typical scare tactics are utilized to keep you in suspense; but there is also a more personalized fear that comes from being able to connect your own childhood fears to the obstacles that the child must overcome.  Entertainment value aside, Among the Sleep affords you the opportunity to face some of those latent fears from early development and gives parents a better perspective of what their child may be suffering through.

												Pros 'n Cons:+Very atmospheric, puts you constantly on edge, even if nothing is actually nearby (which most of the time, nothing is).+Great sound design, so much work went into creating the soundscape for this game, there's pretty much always something going on in that arena. MUST be played with headphones. +Creative premise, though I'm sure it won't be for long (on steam, nothing ever remains original for long, I'm lookin' at you, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DayZ clones).+Neat monster design (though I wish I'd have been able to get a better look at the second one at some point, you get plenty of chances to see the first one, the second one you only kind of see its bottom half).-Definitely too short for something that costs $20. If you're thinking that the story can't possibly be over once you've collected all 4 memories, you are totally wrong, because it is, barring an epilogue scene (which I didn't see coming, though I knew there was going to be SOME kind of twist ending).-Has a very slow ramp up for such a short game. While the atmosphere is incredibly thick, it takes until about 1/2 of the way through the game before you are in any actual danger (IE, there's a roaming monster chasing you that will game over you if it touches you).-Only one real threat, and while it's terrifying, I'd have liked for there to be more. I believe technically the second monster CAN kill you, but I never had this happen because I've played Amnesia and know how to hide properly. -Did I mention it's short? Oh my God it's so short. Seriously though, wait until this thing is on sale for $5, buy it then, play it once (it'll only take a few hours), uninstall it, and never think about it again, but it's totally worth a playthrough. I hope to see more from this team in the future.			"

												A game that is far better at visual storytelling than scaring. All aspects of the story are fully supported by the excellent use of imagery and hints are everywhere. The environment you crawl around looks both scary and appropriately colorful. The sound effects, editing, and mixing are varied, unknown, mysterious, and evoke paranoia. But when it finally comes to actually scaring, almost nothing happens. The creepy sounds can be ignored and dismissed, as the game will rarely follow up on them with consequences in the gameplay. More often than not, the fear is not followed up on and the game presents little to no threats to the player. And even when there are threats, the game is too easy for you to fail to avoid them. With so much going for it, at the end of the day this game fails to scare.			"

Personally I don't have VR yet, but sure, it takes away.Not as bad as I expected. Is a good idea with not so good execution. It has a bit linear start but iterates a bit (over the same mechanics) at the end of the game. Sound is one of the best parts of the game. Maybe is a game to play one time.Among the Sleep is a game more oriented for casual players, a bit weak at horror, good at pacing and with the right length to avoid being too repetitive. If you like stealth + horror and something more mature...of course...Alien Isolation and Outlast.Teddy rules! :')			"

												A very interesting take on the horror genre of games. You play as a 2 year old on his birthday. Your mom gives you a teddy bear who begins talking to you. You wake up to see your teddy bear being dragged off and your mom is missing. You then proceed with basically what I would call nightmere realms trying to find out where your mom went to. At the end of each level you collect items relating to your mom allowing you to unlock the next level. I would reccomend this to any horror lovers. The atmosphere makes you feel uneasy and like you are being watched. The music adds to the ambiance of the game. The puzzles range from easy to hair ripping out hard but overall a fun time to be had. I give it 5 creepy teddy bears out of 5.			"

It's occasionally cute, most of the time creepy as hell, fresh, original, creative, and the story will surprise you.			"

												While it may be short (around 3 hours in length), ""Among the Sleep"" offers an intriguing story with a very thoughtful presentation. The environments are imaginative, and while linear, they offer just enough puzzle solving to stay interesting. The challenges are akin to ""Amnesia"", where you solve puzzles while avoiding a monster. The monster is presented well. You never get a good glimpse of it, and the reveal at the end is gut wrenching. If you're looking for a good puzzle game with a deeper meaning behind it, play this, though know that it won't take too much of your time, for better or worse.			"

It's nowhere near as scary as most other horror games, and I'd say it's a nice place to start for anyone who wants to try games like Amnesia and Outlast, but doesn't have the guts to take on those as a first glance into the horror genre. Here you have a fantastic albeit short game with a terrific story that lets you play as a baby (!) + A free DLC was just released so it's even more worth the money now! "

												Among the Sleep is an incredible look into the roots of all horror, drawing heavily on much of the ideas postulated within Sigmund Freud's ""The Uncanny"" while exploring the world of trauma and fear through the eyes of a toddler.  It is a chilling experience, filled with excellent sound effects and exceptionally creative settings.  The game has a simple, but compelling story that the player is encouraged to experience with new eyes.  The controlls aren't perfect--I did get stuck on a few tree roots here and there--but overall, they suffice to bring the player a deep, memorable experience with very few hiccups.  It took me an hour and a half to play this game all the way through, but let me tell you, it was a briliant trip.  I would wait for it to go on sale, since $20 does seema bit steep, but if you can catch it for a decent price, grab this gem.  It can easily outdo any horror flick.8/10, due to the short length and sparse control hiccups.			"

												I just finished my first play through. It took a couple of months to finish because I played a few minutes at a time, but it took me about an hour to finish the game.I loved the experience. I'm a mom of a 2-year-old, which is why I bought the game in the first place. The story is heartbreaking and most of what's creepy about this comes from the fact that this is a neglected child. Can't get much worse than that :(That said, I'm not an expert on child psychology, but it's funny, and I say this as a mom, how accurate the game is when it comes to being a toddler. They do climb on chairs and drawers and do dangerous things without considering what could go wrong. The mechanics are totally plausible.It's very clear that the world and the events are how a very young, abused child sees them: distorted. This is also why the game is so scary, you kinda go through the house looking for your mommy but at the same time know that if you make a mistake (e.g. break a bottle), you'll regret it. Fear of someone you love is just terrible, especially if you're so vulnerable, and this game does a great job of getting you in that state of mind. This game has a great story and it makes you think about childhood, especially as a parent!			"

												DISCLAIMER: Obviously, reviewing horror / thriller games is tricky at best since fear is subjective; some find FNAF terrifying, others don't. For the record, I am a horror game veteran with games such as Silent Hill 1 & 2, Resident Evil 2 & 3, and a ton of indie horror games under my belt. So it is entirely possible that my tolerance for terror is forming a bias on opinion.TLDR:+ Brilliant atmosphere, pretty much spot-on+ Great environment design, cohesive and consistent with the theme+ Decent Audio Design, even if the ambience sfx is a tad over-recycled- Horror? What horror?- Tone and atmosphere is very jarring, changing dramatically as game goes on- Gameplay is very textbook, and is altogether unchallengingREVIEW:Forget those shadowy nightmares, that teddy is 10 times scarier than anything else this game will throw at you.I really, REALLY wanted to like Among The Sleep. I'm always on the lookout for innovative ideas, and the concept of a horror game through the eyes of a 2 year old was certainly intriguing. The story, without going into spoilers, is essentially that of a toddler who awakes in the middle of the night, and upon hearing noises downstairs decides to go investigate and look for mummy. Controls are the standard First-Person control scheme, with the nice added touch of crawling for increased movement speed as opposed to walking.Personally, I think the level design is where the game does really well; the environment is designed to be really up-scaled and large, and it does a great job of portraying a toddler's perspective of the world. Chairs are giant obstacles that take effort to climb onto, fridges feel like a giant white pillar, and getting from point A to B is an arduous task. The atmosphere is unnerving and subtly sinister, reminding me of the foreboding and evil vibe I got from Dead Space or Alien: Isolation. Lighting is sparse, casting shadows on everything, and at one point a flash of lightning made a tree seem like a monster. A nice touch showing the power of a child's imagination. All this combined gives us a first hour of feeling really tiny and vulnerable, exactly how a horror game should do. I was nervous, I was jumpy, and I was really looking forward to how the rest of the game would play out.And then, well... the game kinda gave up trying.I had assumed the suburbian home environment I saw in trailers and screenshots would continue throughout the game, and since it was up-scaled to be so large this would have been entirely possible. But for some reason, the the game turns into the Adventures of Alice In Wonderland opening with a literal tumbling down the rabbit hole. We start seeing the atmosphere's creepiness being traded in for whimsy and wonderment, and any sense of danger just drops out of the game with an audible thud. It occasionally tries to remind us of its spooky ways with whispers, moody lighting and the occasional shadow, but by the third act I was so comfortable and complacent with the game that I just lost interest.I will give a tentative thumbs-up for the story (still spoiler-free), which is intriguing enough that I may play more of the game just to see its conclusion. But again, the fact that I lost all interest points to an indication that the opening hook for the mystery was not strong enough for me to keep me invested. Most horror games either keep you engaged via mystery (Silent Hill, Amnesia) or survival (Resident Evil, Dead Space). Since Among The Sleep isn't about a baby struggling in post-apocalyptia, it has to rely on mystery. Which, unfortunately, isn't very mystifying; it's rather predictable and overall feels kinda cliche. But like I said, it is intriguing enough that I'm willing to play more in the future. And since most horror games aren't actually that complex in the story department anyway, I'm willing to let this aspect of the game go unpunished.Gameplay-wise there's not much to talk about. It's a very standard exploration puzzler à la Amnesia. You find a locked door /  staircase / see-saw, so you collect X keys to open said obstacle. It's not challenging, it's merely time-consuming, and the puzzles involved in getting the keys are mildly difficult at best, downright trivial at worst. This wouldn't be so bad if the story was interesting enough to carry the game on its own, and turn the game into more story-focus rather than gameplay-focus. However, as established previously the game isn't exactly strong in the story department, so Among The Sleep falls down on both fronts.Apparently there is also a persistent enemy within the game that hunts you down in each level, but if there was I didn't encounter it. I didn't even realise there was an enemy, which is a failure of design if you ask me. You want a persistent, omni-present monster to hunt the players down and scare them? Great! So make sure the player is aware of the enemy's presence at most / all times. You can't have an oppressive, nemesis-type antagonist if it's so passive in its oppression.Overall, I can't recommend Among The Sleep. I really WANT to, since it's such an fresh concept. It's also visually interesting, the level / audio design is pretty great, and the initial atmosphere is damn-near perfect. But the writing and gameplay design let it down for things to remain engaging, especially for a horror game. I would recommend this game when on a discount, but otherwise it's just not worth the regular asking price.			"

												I'm extremely fond of indie horror titles in general, having seen the old classics turn slowly into action titles (Resident Evil comes to mind) and as an original oculus rift kickstarter backer I watched this one with keen interest.All I can say is: wow.True horror makes you feel vulnerable, it doesn't give you any way to fight back, it makes things hopeless - and what better way to do that than to put you into the fears of childhood. This game really pulls that off well, a formal analysis would find lots of little psychological tricks used to generate an intense atmosphere and I heavily recommend playing with headphones on and the lights off.If you have one, the oculus rift is a must, but there is one annoying issue: it didn't work on Linux. This is something that should be fairly simple to fix, and may just be a problem with my setup (i'm using SteamOS inside a docker container), but it still annoyed me as setting up the rendering view for the rift should be a fairly trivial task to do cross-platform.That said, it's still got plenty of atmosphere played on a normal LCD monitor in a dark room, the whole game reminds me of the otherworld in Silent Hill, but far creepier due to the vulnerability it induces.If you enjoy horror, just get it.

												Distinctive and surreal, overall a very well put together game. Just finished my second playthrough of it and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time.With a unique interaction style in the world, as an infant you must go through battling real life objects/puzzles and those of a small childs imagination. The deeper you fall into this dream land the more unhinged your perception becomes. Simple rooms or areas become scary labyrinths of the unknown. Although this isn't the point of the game, the story is infact quite sad with a somewhat reassuring ending.I don't want to talk about it to much, you'll just have to play it to see what I mean.			"

												This is an excellent, short, little horror game. Playing as a child is perfect starting point as you are so helpless and vulnerable, you can either walk slowly or crawl but you cannot see too far when crawling. The atmosphere is what makes this game so good. It starts off with a very creepy oppressive atmosphere where you never know what dangers are lurking. Then just when you are thinking it is only a sinister atmosphere and there are no actual threats you catch a glimpse of enemies. There are no really cheap jump scares but lots of menacing corner of the screen glimpses of things and when you do first get caught by the enemy it is terrifying. So this manages to maintain the atmosphere throughout that game where you are never sure if you are in danger or not. My only complaint is that some of the camera movements when climbing made me a little nauseous.			"

												Absolutely amazing game! The story is completely original compared to others in the genre. The atmosphere is unique and imaginative, and the characters believable and scarily relatable in some sense. I highly recommend this game. It is a little on the short side but if you catch it on sale I definatly recommend it!!!!!!! 4.5/5 stars (I docked half a star for the game length and lack of achievments)			"

												This is such a great game. It's a bit short for sure because I was able to beat the game in about three and a half hours including the dlc but, overall a nice game. I got spooked at points and curious about the story in others. Overall a good game and would rate 9/10. This is also a good choice for a halloween game since it can be beat in a few hours and you can pick up the controls easily. 2spooky4me			"

												I bought this at the discounted price for Halloween, and it was damn worth it.  I'm someone who enjoys being scared, and this definitely did the trick.  It was eerie, and the vulnerability of being a 2 year old child is definitely felt by the player.  The largeness of the world is intimidating, and the creepy figure lurking in the darkness definitely has its own surprising moments.  If it wouldn't have been on sale, I probably wouldn't have gotten it, because it's only about 3 hours of gameplay and I'm not sure it has very much replayability, but, on sale, it was definitely worth the $7.

												""Amongst the Sleep"" is a surprisingly good little survival horror game that invokes your primal fears by placing you in the body of a small toddler that can barely walk upright. What may seem amusing at first quickly becomes outright scary as the child's unique perception of reality turns seemingly mundane objects and locations (such as a closet or a playground) into pure nightmare fuel. Even when the twist at the end of the story reveals the toddler's terrors to be relatively normal from an adult's point of view, the anxiety and uneasiness you will experience throughout the game will not simply fade away, as it merely replaces the imaginative fear with a real one.Unfortunately, the enjoyment you can get from this game is drastically limited by it's very short length, with a walkthrough taking little more than roughly two hours. It is perhaps something to be expected from a game that evolved from a student project, but still, by the time the credits roll you may feel extremely disappointed and longing for more. For what little it's worth, the game still manages to scare the hell out of you for these two hours.			"

												Quick Summary:Great storyGreat artwork & level designA Little shortIf you are looking for a good story with some interesting game play this is for you. It keeps you on the edge of your seat as you try to find out what's really going on in the story. You can tell by the art & level design that there was a lot of thought and effort put into this game. The locations are interesting and fit perfectly with the view point as the young child.I haven't played the DLC yet, but I would say it was a bit shorter then I expected.  I don't think that takes away from anything, but it is worth noting if you are looking for quantity.If you like story driven games that aren't too difficult this would be a great game to add to your library.

												I really enjoyed this game, it had an atmosphere that brought back my own childlike fear. The game is also very sad, and I really felt so bad for the child, who's name is not given. The con of this game are the clunky controls which actually adds to the horror aspect, and brought back memories of silent hill 2. And like sh this game combines horror with actual issues that people go through, and speaking as someone who went through emotional and physical abuse as a child, this game really strikes a chord with me. I highly recommend this game for anyone who really immerses themselves into story lines and atmospheres . I highly recommend playing the prologue as well for a complete gaming experience.			"

												Everybody has had bad experiences throughout their childhood and in a very young stage your imagination plays a very big role in the scares you experience as a child. This game made me relive some of those experiences through the scary locations that where marvelously integrated in the game. Eventough you play a todler the movement is well-thougth-out and your dissabilty of not being able to move around like you normally would, creates a challege and makes it more enjoyable. Also the soud was pretty amazing and really made the difference. And even though it was a single player game, your companion Teddy made it feel like you were not alone. The way you interact with your Teddy and the benefit you have from his company made it sort of realistic. After I finished the game I was so sucked into the story line I wanted to remain a todler. The story line is great and even a child could understand it. However I would have liked more detail from the story line. Luckily the prologue showed some more detail about the story surrounding you. The game was short but worth the money (steam summer sale). I would have liked it to be longer but that probably would bring the story out of balance. I would like more dlc's (free or paid).			"

												In Among the Sleep you play as a VERY strong (as in strength) and agile two-year-old.  The game plays more as an ""adventure narrative"" and focuses primarily on fetching ""memories"" and solving very simple puzzles.  Although, I do recommend this game to people who like ""narrative story games"" there is not much else to it. I did notice that it was tagged with ""horror theme"" and was a little confused. It definitely has some spooky parts, but  I wouldn't label it as horror. PROS: Pretty visuals and a cool sidekick Teddy bear that helps you along the adventure. CONS: A VERY short story that leaves the fun, supernatural themes and ends with what feels like an after-school-special plot line. I was a little disappointed with the plot twist.			"

												10/10 Artworks looks stunning, presentation is excellent, perfect length for a game like this. Exceeded expectations, I love that they don't spell anything out for you, figuring out the story for yourself is part of it. The gameplay is simple and perfect. Most noticably, the game isn't arduous and long, it can be completed in 3-4 hours, which is perfect because even in horror games like amnesia or outlast, I find that after I've been playing it for too long, or if I have to return to it later in order to complete it, it drops me out of the experience and by the end of the game I'm sprinting with wreckless abandon and my sense of immersion drops. Not to mention there aren't any extended puzzles or stealth sequences that halt your progression. Additionally I'd like to point out that this isn't exactly a horror game as much as it is a scary psychological adventure, and it absolutely nails it.			"

There are very few games that deal with the same themes that Among the Sleep does, and I have to tip my hat to its originality in an otherwise very generic genre.  I got the game for $6, and I believe that that is what the game should really be priced at as it only lasts a few hours.  That is the one complaint I had with the game.Other than that, the developers did an awesome job with this one. "

Regardless, while the game was way too short, it was a good worthy buy, just dont expect a lot of gameplay.*SPOILER ALERT*Story? I understand you are looking for your mom, but it frustrates me that the game doesnt reallt explain the ending all that well. Also the game felt like it was just too short! I was never cauight by any monsters, and only had to hide from one once the entire time. What were the monsters? His imagination? *SPOILER ALERT END* "

												   This game is short. It FEELS very short. It pulls you into its creepy and perfectly executed atmosphere, but that feeling of knowing you are close to the end really saps your joy from the journey when it arrives so quickly.      The terrified and overly imaginative perspective of an infant is perfect. You must cling to your teddy bear for comfort (A source of light) and every scene in the game seems like it takes place in one's imagination.    I've played 4 1/2 hours and it's hard to want to go back to it since it feels so linear. However, I'll ride a short roller coaster over and over if it is still fun. I love the feel of the game because it's unique it still felt unique even after playing games like Amnesia and Penumbra. The story and symbolism is what makes me want to play through it multiple times.    ""Mind-F"" and ""Jaw-dropper"" of an ending and intense scares throughout make this game amazing.

Stop reading reviews and get this game.I finished this game without any tutorial within a couple of hours, so i guess it could be cheaper, but it was so worth it. The story is great, the sound effects are pristine and the script/voice acting is actually good, not cheesey (I'm looking at you final fantasy 10)So, as I said, BUY THE FREAKING GAME!!!!!(Just saying; I have nothing against final fantasy)			"

												Disappointing.The first level is great. Your own house from the perspective of a two year, together with the storyline they've gone for is a great premise for a horror game.Unfortunately, you leave your house pretty quickly and stay out until just before the end of the game. Everything that was good about the idea disappears and the game falls flat. The puzzles are mediocre and the horror is underwhelming.			"

												A stunningly beutifully designed game, with an overall dream feel to it, with mostly realistic but quirky and childish art style. The game was horrifying at times, but mostly it just gave me the chills, with it's eerie music and nightmare scenarios. A very touching and pretty sad tale, with a great message, if you manage to read a bit between the lines, since it's a bit on the metaphoric side. I loved this game, but it's far too short, and by that I mean really, really short. I managed to complete it in a measly two hours, and that, sadly is the biggest flaw of this game, considering the price. I recommend this game, but get it on a Steam sale, otherwise it's a bit too expensive, considering the hours of gameplay you get out of it.			"

 A game to make your blood run cold This game for me, was absolutely terrifying, and anyone who says it isn't I think may not have fully emmersed themselves in the creepy and quite frankly dark story -  and it is a very dark theme , which may be an emotional trigger for some.   Theme of Alcoholism and suggested child abuse and dissociation coping mechanisms during a parental feud and divorce  I like this style of game because of the atmospheric horror style, which echoes some of the elements of ""Silent Hill"" puzzle solving, and the paranormal and psychological aspect from F.E.A.R. This game is not for those who are prone to panick attacks, as I myself found out the hard way. However if you are the sort of person who gets a kick out of the adrenaline while being terrified, then I thoroughly recommend this game to you. It is beautiful and horrific all at the same time.

												I was recommended this game a short while ago and decided that I would give it a try.I picked this up at the full price, so one thing I will say is that while I thoroughly enjoyed my experience playing this, I don't feel as though it is worth the fairly hefty pricetag for a short indie game.One of the first things that I enjoyed about this title was the voice acting - it fits in perfectly and really helps to set the characters. I was really impressed with the art style and the overall atmosphere of the game genuinely had me spooked at times without having to rely on the trope of jump scares aplenty.I will not include spoilers but the ending was just right. It was touching, a little surprising and rounded the game off very well. I just wish that it had come a little later as I expected to get more than 2 hours worth of gameplay for £14.99.I have recommended it to my friends, but I would say to wait for the sales. While I love supporting cretaive indie developers and unique and interesting new games, I don't feel that it was worth the full price but it is certainly a game I thoroughly enjoyed and will not soon forget.

Even though I KNOW that in real life I'm a  grown MAN when I take the role of the main charcter whose a baby I feel truly helpless, I have nothing to help me combat the monsters that lurk in the darkness, and I know that no one is coming to rescue me. At certain points in the game I was truly scared, and my heart was racing a mile a minute as I waddled to safety beneath beds, chairs or whatever else I could hide behind.

												Score: 8/10Price/Value: $10 Time: 2 hours*Spoilers Ahead* Among the Sleep turned out to be a wonderful surprise. You play as a wee two year old toddler navigating a world which appears nightmarish to your infant eyes. Many people will be reminded immediately of the Penumbra series when it comes to world interaction (chests, drawers, opening doors, object manipulation). Artistically, this game is lovely to look at. Coats, boots and everyday objects are made out to be creatures in the dark or stylized into the creatures themselves. The baby's room is well done and being able to look down and see your tiny self fidgeting like a child might actually do in reality is a neat little thing to include. The mother looks fantastic and the lighting sets the mood for the rather dark and sad story they are telling.This is where we get into spoilers. The gist of the story is that the creatures from your nightmares are actually your mother and, from what I am guessing, either your father or some form of social services worker. As you might have guessed from that last sentence, your mother is losing you. The symbolism that is put forth in the child's drawings scattered around the level was an interesting inclusion to go along with the theme of child abuse, alcoholism and misunderstanding that children have when these things happen really sealed this up into a gem. Seeing your mother in the floor of the kitchen, your bear in one hand and wine glass in the other weeping left me cold inside at the end. Realising that the witch in the well from your children's story is your mother and her alcoholism struck a chord and is relatable I'm sure to many people growing up from all walks of life. This is easily a gem and worth it at any price. Not really a horror title as I thought it might be more-so, but actually something much deeper and more meaningful.			"

												The monster only appears a handful of times, and it usually disappears immediately after if the player finds a hiding spot in time. The interaction with the monster is very limited, and so it's not that significant an element in the game. It doesn't stalk the player, and there's no real cat-and-mouse interplay. As long as you keep aware of the nearest thing you can crawl under, then you won't have to fear much for your safety.If the developers had come up with an actual need for hugging the teddy bear, and if they had expanded upon the evasion of the monster, then there could have been a lot more gratification and strategy in the gameplay. If the monster was a bit smarter and more persistent and methodical in its search for the child, then the teddy could have been used to calm the child to prevent it from crying and giving away his position. Or something like that.The $20 asking price for this game might be a bit steep for the limited playtime and lack of any real scares. But if you can pick it up on a Steam sale (as I did), then the novelty makes it worth a few hours of your time. It's story is shaky in the middle act, but the conclusion is very human, very blunt, and terrifyingly real, in a way that goes far beyond the childish terror that any imaginary closet monster can create.Full review on my personal blog:http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2014/08/22/Among-the-Sleep-game-review.aspx "

												The idea is very original, IF you like a game that can give you a few chills (but nothing extraordinary) and that takes you to a world as seen by a toddler (a world that by the way resembles a bit ""the fade"" of the Dragon Age series), THEN this is the game for you. The only drawbacks is that there would be, in my opinion, so many ways to improve the experience about this game, such as greater interaction with the teddy bear, or just simple things such as when you are hunt down by something have the teddy bear say something like ""let's run away"" or stuff like that...If you find it with a great rebate (50%) then I suggest buying it, at full price it's not probably worth your money.

												Among the sleep had a creepy feel throughout the game that will keep you on your toes when playing. Viewing the world from a childs view adds a scary feeling to the simplest of events that happen in this game. Darting through small gaps to escape from the 'monsters' anticipating whether they had gone added suspense making you take the game slow. the only problem i have with this game is the lack of game play there is, this game lasted me about 5 hours of gameplay with about a hour was walking round aimlessly finding my objective, this game needed more play for the pounds you pay for it. The concept of the game is brilliant and has more room for games like it or even a sequal it just need to have more game time and possibly a little less buggy, fell through the floor a couple of times. Overall 7/10 good strong game with brilliant ideas and potential.			"

												I recommend this game becuase it tells a sad story that is based on real life. It does it in a relatively short but well paced game - it doesn't feel to short, nor too long (about 3h). There's no stretch padding, and it doesn't feel rushed. The game is definitely story focused, so don't come expecting a ton of mind bending puzzles or complex routines, the challenge level is very low.The story is set against simple but powerful music, sounds and visuals, and the unusual perspective of the player (a baby) works well for a unique gameplay experience and for the theme of the game. Soundwise, if you don't play with headphones or a decent surround sound then you're probably missing out.Horror wise, I found it reasonably scary - but it's not just cheap jumpscares, it ties very well with the narrative. As the game reaches an end, you'll realise that the scariness is rather childish... and even more horrible.All in all, Among the Sleep is a good story game that uses interactivity to rise above what you would experience with a film or novel of the same nature.

												Long story short: Get it on sale at < $10. It's good.I was following the crowd-funding campaign and development of this game somewhat close and was super excited after playing the Alpha that was released.The game definitely does not disappoint when it comes to presentation: Killbrite ♥♥♥♥ing kills it when it comes to atmosphere. I was completely immersed most of the time and I noticed my mouth was agape a lot. The art style is qwerky by design seeing as how it's through the lens of a toddler and the sections where fear alters the environment is really awesome.The sound design of this game is super on point. All the little creaks and cracks in the environment as well as the occasional loud breathing of the protagonist kept me on edge even when there was no perceivable threat. Hearing the mother character humming a lullaby when you were near the end of your objective was assuring but the somber melody is super creepy at the same time.Where this game falls somewhat short is in the actual gameplay. The puzzles are so laughably easily, a baby can do them......*crickets*...whatever. Anyway, most of the game is classic horror: Try a door >♥♥♥♥♥♥s locked > look for key > traverse level looking for key > get key > open door > move on to next level. The perspective is somewhat unique in that you're a tiny babby ♥♥♥♥♥-his-pants so you have to find creative ways to traverse an environment, which largely includes moving chairs to climb them to open doors or opening drawers to climb them.My biggest gripe with the game is actually the length. I beat it in 2 hours and I'm ♥♥♥♥ing dog♥♥♥♥♥♥at video games. A good player can prolly beat it in an hour or less. Which is why you should get it for less than $10 and you won't be disappointed.Or don't, whatever. ♥♥♥♥ you.			"

Summary 7.9/10A purely story-driven adventure that has no other direction but forward, but a good pace and experience in general leaves you satisfiedThe Good:- Great scares- Good use of tactics and required ""know-how""- Cute, but bat-sh*t crazy- Dark and Eery, while also being justified- Sense of justice and acomplishment in the end- Strong connection with protagonist (At least for me.)- Great use of ambient soundThe Bad:- Expensive for so little time I put into it and completed it- Abysmal voice acting- Disappointing ending, although conclusive- Repetitious- Sudden cuts in audio and poor blending- Constant clipping, and extremely obviousConclusionAmong the Sleep is a lot like an Italian dessert. Its absurdly small, it's a poor decision, expensive and somewhat unhealthy in structure, but overall tasty and satisfying. If you loved Slender, play this. If the theme itself interests you, go for it. If you are looking for a long-lasting meal with dessert at the end, find another. It's good, but nothing I'd ever probably order again.			"

												This is an excellent, short, little horror game. Playing as a child is perfect starting point as you are so helpless and vulnerable, you can either walk slowly or crawl but you cannot see too far when crawling. The atmosphere is what makes this game so good. It starts off with a very creepy oppressive atmosphere where you never know what dangers are lurking. Then just when you are thinking it is only a sinister atmosphere and there are no actual threats you catch a glimpse of enemies. There are no really cheap jump scares but lots of menacing corner of the screen glimpses of things and when you do first get caught by the enemy it is terrifying. So this manages to maintain the atmosphere throughout that game where you are never sure if you are in danger or not. My only complaint is that some of the camera movements when climbing made me a little nauseous.			"

												I bought this at the discounted price for Halloween, and it was damn worth it.  I'm someone who enjoys being scared, and this definitely did the trick.  It was eerie, and the vulnerability of being a 2 year old child is definitely felt by the player.  The largeness of the world is intimidating, and the creepy figure lurking in the darkness definitely has its own surprising moments.  If it wouldn't have been on sale, I probably wouldn't have gotten it, because it's only about 3 hours of gameplay and I'm not sure it has very much replayability, but, on sale, it was definitely worth the $7.

												Survival Horror games these days enjoy making you helpless prey to their lurking horrors. They give you no weapons, and no health, you scurry like a mouse chased by a cat. How can they make you more helpless?... by making you a two year old.			"

												Among the Sleep is a different sort of horror game in that it utilizes jump scares, creepy ambiance, and heartpumping adrenaline spikes rather than outright gory, bloody, horror. It's whimsically odd in aspects that are reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, and creepy in aspects that closely resemble that of Slender/Amnesia. It's fun to play, might even get you a few times with some scares, and is completely worth it.This game surprised me in more ways than I expected. I was consistently trying to figure out the plot and whenever I thought I had it, it would change on me. The bear for one is somewhat creepy on it's own, and when you first begin to meet and interact with Teddy it feels very reminsicent of Chucky. As the game plays forward however, Teddy is your best friend in the entire world, as you navigate through a world that feels like the ""Other Mother"" built it (Coraline reference!). There's simple puzzles to complete to progress as you go, but they aren't mind-numbingly simple, some of them take a few minutes to put together.The story itself gives a fresh new way of looking at this kind of situation through a child's perspective. You're playing as a two year old child, and your objective is to rescue your mother from this nightmarish, topsy-turvey, alternate version of your own world. The ambiance is amazing, and the graphics are impeccable. It can get truly terrifying.I bought this game on a daily deal for 66% off. Among the Sleep isn't a very long game, it's only roughly 3 hrs of playthrough, so I feel better about paying 6$ vs 20$ to be honest. It's gamepad compatable, and if you're using a pc with Windows it goes without saying that it's recommended you use an Xbox 360 controller.It's fun, short, but not so sweet! If you can swing it, pick up Among the Sleep and play it, it's worth it.			"

												This is a beautiful game, with haunting visuals and implications.   Don't forget to go to ""Chapter Select"" and play the prologue when you're done!The game is rather short (which isn't bad for this genre).  The entire playthrough might take you 2-3 hours, but you will be intrigued, scared, and thrilled almost the entire time.  It's definately worth playing, but paying full price might be too much for some folks.  I got my copy on sale for 7 dollars, and I was NOT disappointed!			"

Non-Violent HorrorOverall a great game. There's hints strewn throughout the game foreshadowing the climax, but I didn't even begin to have a clear picture of what was going on until about 70% of the way through. The game does a good job providing a tense atmosphere while maintaining the child-like wonder and imagination of the world around you. I got it on sale for ~$7, and for that price it's a very solid buy.			"

												People searching for horror games shouldn't buy or play this one.But if you want an atmospheric tense adventure game with excellent graphics developed by a nordic indie studio, then this game is worth a try.  I did read a many negative reviews on Steam, and most of them are there from hardcore horror fans. If they didn't expect to be super scared from this game, just feel the tension from time to time, the negative review wouldn't be there.Has support for VR, probably gonna improve your experience with 1000%It's also short, so I would recommend buying it in a sale.

												Among the Sleep is an excellent game, especially for people who don't like horror games in general. The terror is more the kind that you let yourself sink into - sliding into the small hiding places that only you, as a toddler, can fit inside; rushing to climb on top of small boxes to save yourself from a fairy-tale monster; exploring the nooks and crannies of the dreamscapes you find yourself inside; feeling the discomfiture of a world that isn't quite right.The game is only a couple hours long and the story unfolds at a leisurely pace across it, but the world has a lot of very interesting details if you look for them, the simple puzzles do a good job of building tension, and the level design does a very good job of leading your forward and keeping you on edge. I definitely recommend it.			"

												I've always been a fan of indie games, particularly indie horror games. I went into Among the Sleep with minimal information, I just saw that you played as a infant, and I knew I had to have it. The adventure that followed starting from 12 to around 3 in the morning some might say was shortlived, however I loved every bit of it. The atmosphere, symbolism, and thought that this game provokes stemming from the question of what is real and what is imagination from the point of a two year old was comparable in complexity to the ending of Bioshock Infinite. I also find it comparable to movies such as American Psycho and Donnie Darko in the same way. Not everyone will have the same interpretation, although I have heard very good ones in the forums. If you expect from this game cheap jumps scares or award winning graphics or action, look somewhere else. This game is more of an allegory within a haunting art form, and I will fondly remember those nearly three hours I spent on this game, as  I will also remember what I took away.			"

												Wow. That was just...I dunno. It's 70% wow and 30% meh for me. I'm not really an expert in horror games since this is the first of the genre that I've ever played but, I have to admit, I was kind of disappointed because I had expected more . I had expected there to be some fighting or kicking♥♥♥♥♥ whichever you prefer, but there weren't any. I wanted there to be epic teddy bear transformations and bedroom weapons, but we can't all have what we want. There was a lot of hiding involved though and bottles. Boy, were there a lot of bottles. There were also jumpscares here and there, but they were okay. If you wanna know how scary it is, think of a really short rollercoaster ride. This game kind of struck me as a combination between Slender and the movie ""Mama"". You'll figure out why once you've tried it out. The graphics and sounds were nice enough, but the story was something else altogether. Mind you, it was great and different, but it was no fairytale. I was able to put two and two together during the first chapter, but I wasn't able to figure out the whole story until the very end, even if there were lots of clues laid out throughout the game. Overall, it was fun and well worth a try.  I don't know about the price though since it's kind of short. Maybe you can buy it when it goes on sale if you're hesitant about purchasing it.			"

												Among the Sleep takes players on a journey through a nightmarish dreamworld concieved by a toddler's imagination, and molded by the disturbing issues he faces in real life. The concept is certainly fresh, but does the game itself hold up under scrutiny?It's abundantly clear from the start that the developers of Among the Sleep have spent a lot of time carefully constructing the environments in this game. Many of the objects and locations are made up of very authentic-looking artifacts that you might see scattered around a toddler's room in real life. Some of them are used to frightening effect, such as removing the eyes from an otherwise adorable stuffed animal, or making the seemingly innocent drawings of a child take on a far more sinister meaning. All of these conscientious design choices come together quite effectively, and the atmosphere benefits greatly from it.One of the biggest concerns I had for this game was if it could deliver true horror. The kind of horror that slowly and carefully builds into a suffocating climax of fear. Thankfully, I was not dissapointed. The game doesn't pull any punches, and although it takes some time at the beginning to establish the story, the rest of the game is a non-stop, exhilariting tour into darkness. Well...for the most part. The puzzles in the game are never demanding, and they don't really increase in difficulty much. Most of them involve collecting specific items or keys, and taking them to the correct location, which is all too easy considering how linear the game is. It's almost a nitpick, considering how frequently the game excels at building tension and fear through its various assets, but I would have appreciated a bit more complexity and origniality when it came to the actual gameplay.At the end of the day, the biggest problem I had with this game was its length. Sure, its well-paced. It has great visuals, great voice-acting, great sound design...but if the game can be beaten in 2 hours or less, you're not getting much value for your money. I expect a little more content from a game thats list price is $20. Some might argue that all of that money is well-spent considering how much obvious love and effort was put into this game, and how amazing it turned out to be considering that it was created by a very small indie development team, but in my personal opinion, $20 is still too much to ask for such a short game, with so little replay value. If you can get it on sale though, Among the Sleep is a very solid horror experience. If you've enjoyed games like Amnesia or Outlast, Among the Sleep will deliver more of the same great storytelling, audio design, and horror you've come to expect from those games, albeit on a much smaller scale.7.5/10			"

												I wish there was a way to mark that I partially recommend this game. I loved the concept on paper and the events and atmosphere are extremely unsettling but the theme is just too on the nose for me. It's very clear what's going on from the outset and the reveal feels extremely biased without much explanation as to why things turned out as they have. Sure, you play a toddler, so technically speaking, the events in the game are outside your scope of understanding, but I think the devs should have considered their audience's level of awareness. That being said, it's still quite a ride albeit short (1.5-2 hours long.)			"

												I do not appreciate jump scare games without a story (i'm looking at you slender). However... this was drastically different, like in the anmesia games you had an interesting plotline, as well as a disturbing atmosphere. The graphics weren't wonderful, but granted it's an indie game that's not something you see too often. Most bugs have been fixed by now (there weren't too many to begin with). As expected by an indie game it's only about 2 hours of gameplay, and this begs the question. Is it worth the cost? I very much think that it is. It was an experience that I was able to enjoy, and i hope they make a soul succesor to it.8.25/10			"

												*PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW FOR FULL EXPLONATION*Wait for this game to go on sale and not just the10% off it is right now. 1st off the game starts out good and plays well, you can grab stuff and mess with it like Amnisia, the todler thing is cool but it soon feels like a crutch do to how slow you move. (Yes i understand your a toddler but i just wanted to move a little quicker.)Then again if you could move that quick the game would be over even sooner. AVE. playtime is about 3 hours, and for 20$ seems a little to short when i got that much out of daylight for less, although this game is much more frightining than daylight. Its not on the levvel of Outlast, and Amnisia but it will satify your horror craving, the game has great visual and sound design,     The graphichs are ok, quite good unity. The sounds are creepy and will have you looking over your sholder. NOW ALL THE BAD STUFF-3 hours long- You move to slow- Lack of StoryLack of story is the worst of all, there is no story at all until the last 10 min of the game and once you relize whats happening it is somwhat in my oppinion under whelming, it makes scence but it dosnt realy make me think, ""OH, what a great story"" plus the very end is not explaind at all leaving you questions of your fate.- game breaking bug Durring the last 10 min or so right as the story was actually coming  together a game breaking bug happend and sucked me out of the experiance. I wanderd around for 15 min befor restarting the game then it worked fine, but its things like that especially at the end of a game that are realy just sad.- lack of monsters, The monsters are only in the game for all of 30min of your 3 hour playthrough witch can realy kill the tesion the sound design creates.  The game is cool but cool isnt worth 20$. If you like horror games you will like this but just wait to spend your money till its on sale, or if you realy need an imediat horror fix buy The Forrest, it has more game for less the cost.			"

												In Among the Sleep, by Krillbite Studio, you will take on the role of a 2 year old child who just had his birthday. You are eating cake in the arms of your mom when there is a knock at the door. This is followed by an argument, and then your mom coming back in with a present. You then fast forward to around bedtime/nap time, I'm not really sure which. It is then that the game takes on a nightmarish overlay.The visual look of this game felt like it fit with the character being a 2 year old. I'm not saying that it was rainbows and puppies, but there were those softer colors, even when everything was dark. The levels of this game were beyond creepy, especially for me because I have an almost 2 year old, so I could see myself in his shoes. There is a slight terror to knowing that something bad could happen right out of the corner of your eye. The levels span from a deserted play ground, a library in a forest, small sections of your house, and more. There are villains that creep around as well. All I have to say is you are going to need to hide from them, or you will suffer a restart of the section you are in. I also really enjoyed the companion, the teddy bear that helped me along. All I had to do was hug it and he would produce a little bit of light that would help me see through the darkness.The sounds in this game are extremely creepy. Once again it was doubley so because I have a young son, and hearing those noises creep around in a dark area would scare the pants off me at that age. I also think the voice acting in this game was spot on. I could see the roles of the mother and the teddy bear in the voices given.The controls of the game are your usual configuration with WASD, shift to run, ctrl to crawl or get up, space to climb, and the mouse to control the camera and interact with objects.Though this game wasn't as long as I would have hoped, it definitely had enough there to keep me on my toes, and hoping that nothing was going to get me around the next corner. There is just something about this game that awakened long gone fears of my childhood, and the fear of what is in the dark. In this respect the developers did a great job. To be honest I can't really think of anything I found clunky or missing from this game. I will tell you this, the twist is a hell of one, and I'm not going to tell you what it is because you need to play this game to find out, but when the game ends everything kind of makes better sense.There were definitely puzzle aspects to this game, most of the time it was moving objects so that you could get to a different location, but there were a couple of times where the developers threw in a mechanism just for a small section of the game that changed things up a little. A couple examples of this would be throwing objects to knock something off a shelf, or collecting a specific type of object so that you could weigh down the end of something so you could get to the other side. I'm not saying that this was a bad thing, but I would have liked to see a little bit more of these mechanics, to do them once and then seeming to throw them away made me feel like they were afterthoughts in the game creation process.So lets get down to the part that most of you want to know, and that is should you play this game. The answer is yes, you should play this game, and you should play it in the dark, at night, and pray that no one sneaks up behind you while you are playing. This game gets an 8.9 out of 10.			"

												This is probably the first Survival Horror game that hit me on a psychological level. Delivering you into the body of a two year old child, you must navigate the dark and disturbing world of a troubled mind and uncover the mysterious dissappearence of your mother. Alongside you a teddy bear named ""Teddy"" aids you in your journey often keeping you comfort when you need it. The game sets up an interesting premise but falls short at making you feel more vulnerable as a child as opposed to any other horror game. The true feat here is how large and menacing the environments are and the illusion that every object in the game world is either falling on you or trying to pull you in. Quite often in places you dont want to go. That combined with the chilling ambient sound make for a very unnerving atmosphere. The story is well written and completely out of left field. Please buy if you consider yourself a fan of this genre.			"

												In Among the Sleep, by Krillbite Studio, you will take on the role of a 2 year old child who just had his birthday. You are eating cake in the arms of your mom when there is a knock at the door. This is followed by an argument, and then your mom coming back in with a present. You then fast forward to around bedtime/nap time, I'm not really sure which. It is then that the game takes on a nightmarish overlay.The visual look of this game felt like it fit with the character being a 2 year old. I'm not saying that it was rainbows and puppies, but there were those softer colors, even when everything was dark. The levels of this game were beyond creepy, especially for me because I have an almost 2 year old, so I could see myself in his shoes. There is a slight terror to knowing that something bad could happen right out of the corner of your eye. The levels span from a deserted play ground, a library in a forest, small sections of your house, and more. There are villains that creep around as well. All I have to say is you are going to need to hide from them, or you will suffer a restart of the section you are in. I also really enjoyed the companion, the teddy bear that helped me along. All I had to do was hug it and he would produce a little bit of light that would help me see through the darkness.The sounds in this game are extremely creepy. Once again it was doubley so because I have a young son, and hearing those noises creep around in a dark area would scare the pants off me at that age. I also think the voice acting in this game was spot on. I could see the roles of the mother and the teddy bear in the voices given.The controls of the game are your usual configuration with WASD, shift to run, ctrl to crawl or get up, space to climb, and the mouse to control the camera and interact with objects.Though this game wasn't as long as I would have hoped, it definitely had enough there to keep me on my toes, and hoping that nothing was going to get me around the next corner. There is just something about this game that awakened long gone fears of my childhood, and the fear of what is in the dark. In this respect the developers did a great job. To be honest I can't really think of anything I found clunky or missing from this game. I will tell you this, the twist is a hell of one, and I'm not going to tell you what it is because you need to play this game to find out, but when the game ends everything kind of makes better sense.There were definitely puzzle aspects to this game, most of the time it was moving objects so that you could get to a different location, but there were a couple of times where the developers threw in a mechanism just for a small section of the game that changed things up a little. A couple examples of this would be throwing objects to knock something off a shelf, or collecting a specific type of object so that you could weigh down the end of something so you could get to the other side. I'm not saying that this was a bad thing, but I would have liked to see a little bit more of these mechanics, to do them once and then seeming to throw them away made me feel like they were afterthoughts in the game creation process.So lets get down to the part that most of you want to know, and that is should you play this game. The answer is yes, you should play this game, and you should play it in the dark, at night, and pray that no one sneaks up behind you while you are playing. This game gets an 8.9 out of 10.			"

												Assuming the role of a todder on their second birthday, players of Among the Sleep go on a dark, atmospheric journey that expertly plays on childhood fears and anxieties to create an immersive, if uneven, experience. After being put to bed by their mother, the player interacts with their new birthday present: Teddy the teddy bear. Teddy guides the player out of the bright, warm bedroom and into a dark, forbidding world. Stuck in this world away from their mother, the player must explore the dark environments and solve puzzles to recieve items which represent fond memories of their mother. The player explores the world by slowly walking through the environments or by crawling, which is much faster. The player is able to climb over obstacles and interact with many objects in the world. In dark areas, the player can hold Teddy tight, making the toddler feel more confident and lighting the way. The design is minimalistic and encourages the player to immerse themselves in the toddler's world. The environments are distorted perceptions of a normal household. The dark tone makes things appear more menacing than they would normally, adding to the tense atmosphere. In several environments, a dark presence hunts the player, forcing them to hide. The gameplay in these sections feel similar to Slender: The Arrivial but requires the player to hide, rather than run away, adding to the tension.Among the Sleep is short but still feels repetitive toward the end. The final section is satisfying enough to warrant a playthrough and the game as a whole delievers a well crafted psychological experience.			"

												Among the Sleep is not your conventional AAA title, and as such, cannot really be judged against them. It is, however, excellent. The pacing, especially considering that this is a game that you can easily complete in one sitting, assuming your heart can take it, is absolutely spot on. The tutorial blends seemlessly with the flow of the game; while the level design is detailed and beautiful, and, while linear, doesn't feel restricting. The controls are simple, with no excessively complex button mappings to memorise, don't forget to lean around a corner or two though... The music is that perfect blend of atmospheric without being so attention grabbing that you stop feeling immersed. Lastly, the story, while simple, will definitely take you on a rollercoaster of emotion. There will be no spoilers here, but here are my four best bits of advice regarding Among the Sleep:1) Remember, all this is through the eyes of a child, let the game immerse you in such.2) Keep an eye out for the drawings scattered around, they'll not only help build the story, but may be key to your progression...3) Play it in a darkened room, headphones if you've got them (not necessary, but I played with just my speakers and succeeded in freaking myself out with the random noises in the empty flat around me).4) Get it! Play it! It's so completely worth it!Good hunting!- id_doomerFootnote: If your mouse doesn't work as a control interface, like mine didn't; it may mean that your joystick is plugged in, as Among the Sleep will default to using the joystick as an input source first. A rare situation in today's PC gaming world, I know, but toggle it off in the option menu and you'll be fine.			"

												The atmosphere of this game is great: rooms and open spaces are fully explorable and detailed, hints about the plot are scattered all over and it's interesting to reconstruct the story. The tension is build progressively, and the tutorial is surprisingly well integrated within the game. The little plot there is is ambiguous enough to leave room for interpretation, which I always like. The ending is great!What I do have an issue with is with the questionable saving system and the checkpoint placement (I was stuck after the game crashed & unable to proceed, had to restart the game over again).Also, the idea of having the player regulate the brightness of the screen is great... until you realize you can't see a thing. Don't go overboard with it :P			"

												Pros: A lot of attention has been placed on the backstory to this game, and there a plenty of little clues to what is going on. The developers seemed to have a fairly good understanding of how children think as well, and it paints a picture of abuse pretty well.It is pretty artistically done, as well.Cons: It is relatively short. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, in that it took about as long as it needed for the story, but can be a downstide for anyone expecting a lot of play out of this game. Since it is story focussed, any replays are mostly going to be to pick up things you missed the first time.I would have appreciated more information on the father in the backstory. Still, pay attention when you do here what is presumably his voice at the end, because it's pretty familiar.This game does 'have feels'. I was actually fairly angry on the behalf of the child in the game by the end, as well as sad to see the whole situation. I'd recommend picking it up, but likely when it's on sale, as I feel the normal price would be a bit much for the amount of gameplay you get.			"

												At first glance, the game seems a little pricey for the hours logged. But, one thing that is worth noting is that the game has very little down time. The pacing is good and the game alterantes primarily between suspence and intensity. Had it been longer, it would have worn out its charm. And had it been less expensive... Well, everyone has to make a living, and I'm sure a lot of work went the game. It's very polished and the visuals and sound are fantastic, so I don't feel ripped off. The two hours (ish... I left it paused for a little while) I got from the game were as fulfilling as any ""full length"" game, just condensed. I think a lot of people expect more out of games in terms of value, but that doesn't always seem fair. Considering how much you end up paying to see a movie at the theater, or for a a few rounds of drinks at a bar, this game starts to look like a pretty good deal. Overall, no matter how much you think you're getting ripped off, chances are good that a video game is still the best value in terms of hours per dollars spent.			"

												I had a lot of fun playing this. It was creepy and took some thinking without being super difficult. It starts out seeming like a straightforward game but actually carries a much deeper message to it, one that took some daring to put into a game. But an important perspective and story to get out there. Despite knowing how to do the puzzles I'd totally play this again to look at the symbolism and details I may have missed the first time through.			"

												Okay.This game looked adorable, even on the community hub. I'd seen screenshots and a couple spoilers, so I sort of knew what to expect. I assumed a good way through that the ""monster"" of the game would have an introductory sequence until I was told by someone else who'd played it that there wasn't. Ironically, I was in the area where it would first start showing up. There WAS an introductory sequence, though, and even though I was as confident as I was through the rest of the game up to that point, I cried worse than the baby.Closed the game, haven't played it since.

												I'm extremely fond of indie horror titles in general, having seen the old classics turn slowly into action titles (Resident Evil comes to mind) and as an original oculus rift kickstarter backer I watched this one with keen interest.All I can say is: wow.True horror makes you feel vulnerable, it doesn't give you any way to fight back, it makes things hopeless - and what better way to do that than to put you into the fears of childhood. This game really pulls that off well, a formal analysis would find lots of little psychological tricks used to generate an intense atmosphere and I heavily recommend playing with headphones on and the lights off.If you have one, the oculus rift is a must, but there is one annoying issue: it didn't work on Linux. This is something that should be fairly simple to fix, and may just be a problem with my setup (i'm using SteamOS inside a docker container), but it still annoyed me as setting up the rendering view for the rift should be a fairly trivial task to do cross-platform.That said, it's still got plenty of atmosphere played on a normal LCD monitor in a dark room, the whole game reminds me of the otherworld in Silent Hill, but far creepier due to the vulnerability it induces.If you enjoy horror, just get it.

												I am giving this a 9.I have not loved a lot of puzzle adventure games in the past. I find the controls a little finicky usually, and sometimes the puzzles are too involved just for the sake of ... I don't know showing they can? The toddler's perspective is so incredibly well done, and so immersive! When you stand up from crawling, they've captured this cute little loss of balance wobble - very life-like! And it doesn't happen everytime.For those who say it is not scary - I totally disagree! The atmosphere and the sinister/sad nature of the story make it terrifying. Yes, it is short. Whatever. It took me way longer than 3 hours, but I'm not an old hand at the types of puzzles and I was genuinely terrified and didn't want to leave the closet at some points.Among the Sleeps controls and mechanics are simple to work out. And they work incredibly smoothly. I love the game despite one or two bugs that made me look at walkthroughs where I thought I was stuck but it was just a question of reloading the checkpoint. These glitches do not happen to everyone, and there are plenty of checkpoints, so it's not a huge drama.I cried at the end.			"

I saw a few people complain that this game was too short. But again, the reasons listed above made up for it. Either way, you'd see that this is a game that shouldn't be made extremely long anyway.

												I very much liked the idea and concept of this game.  Turning a child's world into a horrific nightmare and making you actually FEEL like a child in which all you can do is run and hide from monsters?  Yes please!  The dynamic of a two year old works really well, making the world around you much bigger than if you were playing an adult.  The scenes are beautiful and creepy beyond belief, and the monsters are genuinely terrifying.  What I liked most in some cases was when you're running for the last little segment and you think to look behind you - and a monster would be right behind you.  Having gone undetected until then sure gives you a big jump and some desparation to escape.  It's very short, and I felt a little disappointed by that, but the rest of the game makes up for it - mainly the story.  This is a game where you can't do much at all, but that's to let the story be the sole mechanic of moving the game forward.  And I was quite impressed with the story and its twist at the end.  Definitely worth playing!			"

												I honestly recommend the game. I don't really do reviews, but I guess this will help others in deciding. At first I thought it wouldn't be scary, but as I progressed throughout the game I got really scared. If you're still deciding you may look at my videos on YouTube @ youtube.com/revrantnation "

												The storyline within the game itself is unexpected and imaginative. The events that unfolded were not expected for this game- completely different from what I had expected. That being said, playing through it by myself in a somewhat dark room with high definition surround sound- there were moments where I was definitely freaked out. I'd recommend this game to any casual gamer, or someone who doesn't want to devote a lot of time to a game, but enjoys the horror genre nonetheless. It may seem kidish or even childish at some points, but the overall plot is much more than to be anticipated. Enjoy!			"

												Short, slightly dark but ultimately rather poignant game about exploring and going through the story as a two year old.Not really a ""horror"" game but tense in some parts, some control issues (the open/close mechanic on keyboard is very finicky - I do have a controller but did not try it) and very short length (hour or two for the main story and 15 minutes or so for the Prologue DLC) may stand as obstacles for some people.That said, there are some neat ideas so if you can pick it up on a sale it's worth sinking a few hours in!

												It's a short game that's a bit too dark in places and very simple mechanically, but the atmosphere, the music and the story behind it make the game for the time investment.  This game makes a strong case for the idea of games as art, but with that said, some of the pieces could've been more dynamic (like the glass in the hallway) that would've helped connect more to the story.

												This is an odd game. Afterwards I think to myself, ""C'mon, I'm stupid for getting scared about this. I mean it's what a baby would be scared of, am I really at that level of wimpness?"" but the gameplay feels real. It's all something you think a baby would be able to do or think of. Like pushing chairs around to climb on them in order to open a door. Brilliant. It really utilizes the teddy bear. As a kid we all remember snuggling with our favorite stuffed animals when the lights go out and that fact is used very well in the game. Having Teddy there is far FAR more comforting than you would think. But not too comforting. It makes you feel secure, without taking away the edge and the fright. Recommended.			"

If you want to recall your childhood and how scary it can be, I definitely suggest this game for you.A short game but worth to play.			"

												Personally, I enjoyed this game. Overall, it has a good atmosphere and is great for anyone looking for a horror game. However, it isn't as scary as other games such as Amnesia. The mechanics work a little similar to Amnesia, such as how you open doors and interact with objects. The biggest problem is that the game is really short, so I would recommend waiting to see if the game goes on sale. There are some other minor problems that have to do with graphics and clipping, but they're things that would be expected of an indie developer. If I had to give the game a score out of 10, I would give it a 7 or so.			"

												A baby's first horror adventure; A rather intriguing idea which unfortunately is not explored in a wholly satisfying manner. You play as a baby whisked into a dark slumberland with your mother ominously gone missing. Dreaming up a way to find and save her only by walking, crawling and grabbing objects is the idea here. A bit of adventuring is required, then.I don't generally have a problem with games featuring very little actual gameplay if the story, environments or the general atmosphere are interesting enough. None of these elements are that compelling in Among the Sleep. The sound design is a strong point and manages to create a few heebie-jeebies, but for the most part it's just you toddling along in pitch-black corridors, bumping into furniture and other things in the night. There's not really that much to do, and the levels, while metaphorically rich, are a bit too abstract for their own good.Also I must have played a few too many horror games, since for me the most frightening figure of the whole game was the supremely unnerving walking and talking teddybear, who is actually supposed to be your friend and mentor. I think the way the game introduces him is done completely wrong, unless they were specifically aiming to present him/it as a suspicious character. Never trust the teddy.Anyhow, after a couple of hours of wandering in the dark doing the same things over and over again, the game ends. The story does not end up being a complete waste, but overall, I was hoping for a somewhat stronger finale. After all, the gameplay stuff in between start and finish wasn't that brilliant either. I feel like the game would work much better played with the Oculus Rift (for which it was clearly designed for), but as a traditional first-person horror quickie the game is just too mild. Too scary for actual children and not scary enough for adults, but worth a glance and not a total snoozefest.			"

												This game, man, where to start?I'll start with what I liked I guess. The art style, story, voice acting, sounds, level design, virtual reality compatability, and concept as a whole are all generally great. Its a very nice game to look at, even though I didn't play it at it max settings, it still looked great, I mean, there are plenty of games that look a hell of a lot better, but coupled with its art style it does look very good indeed. The sounds are also very well done, they add a real eery atmosphere to the already weird yet interesting environment, one that would suggest you and your Teddy Bear companion are never alone. The story is also fantastic, with a seemingly paranormal setting, the ending outcome of the story is obvious when you take into consideration the fact that you play as an infant child yet provides an answer to the puzzling chapters of the game. The voice acting, although there isn't much of it, is very well done. The voice acting of your Teddy Bear is perfect, as it conveys a nice friendly tone with a dash of authority and protection, similar to that of a brother and companion. The voice acting of your Mother brilliantly shows the things a mother experiences with their young children, and how a child may percieve her. I don't own an Oculus Rift myself, or anything that does a similar job, but, using one with this game would have been such a cool experience. Finally, the idea of taking the place of a child is indeed, clever, as its puts a complete twist on your perception of the world, as you see the events infront of you, and all you can think is that its some sort of paranormal ghost, or demon, yet come the end you mearly had to look at the world through a scared toddlers eyes.Now, the parts that I personally did not like. The length of the game, the optimization, and some of the balancing for the monsters. Honestly, when I finished I was a bit disappointed at the length of the playable story, from what I remember there was only 6 chapters, according to Steam, I've only played 2 hours of it, and I was afk for a decent amount of that, so I'd say it was an hour to an hour and 45 minutes or so depending on how well you solver puzzles, get past monsters etc. I also felt that the optimization of the game wasn't great, as I've played games with a lot more going on in them at a lot better framerate, not that my PC is in fact the knees of the bee, but this may be as simple as it being more suited to NVidia graphics rather than AMD (which I use). Finally, on one chapter, I felt like it was a little hard to escape past the monster, this may be my fault, but it did seem a little unbalanced due to the limited speed and defense the player has. Most of the things I have a problem with though, could be fixed with patches and DLC.Overall, I would heartily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle-horror games, as this one has a good blend of the two, as well as a well written story, terrifying set of monsters, eery setting and a very good sense of immersion. I'd give it a 7.9/10 and am very happy with the amount of I money paid for the game.			"

If you like creepy first person horror games that arn't all about shooting things and blowing things up then give this one a go.I did however; notice a couple of bugs but hopefuly they havn't fixed them yet. Theres no better way of lightening the creepy mood than watching the protagonist toddler spinning on its head and laughing whilst jammed half way down a watering well, even if it means you have to restart the level once or twice..

												Good storytelling but predictable and ruined by the bear.I wouldn't recommend this game except for the way it handled the storytelling.  Even though I figured out everything by the second painting, I felt it did a good job getting the whole feel across from a young child's perspective.The game isn't really scary, although it conveys the same sort of childhood 'spookiness' that a dark house and strange sounds bring.  That is it's greatest strength, conveying a nightmare from a child's perspective -- full of strange places and monsters.  This emersion is then quickly ruined by the addition of the damn teddy bear pulled out of some children's show who you HAVE to take with you and who ruins everything.It controlls well, looks good, and conveys a feeling of helplessness that a two-year old child would have along with the potential havoc and trouble a two-year old can get into.  At least, until the bear opens his stupid mouth again.I can't state this enough, but the bear ruins the whole experience by talking.  Listening to him suffer in the washing machine or trying to hang on to you is one thing; I hated him from the get-go but even I felt bad for him at those points.  If they cut out his dialogue and just left him emotion he would have been an excellent companion, but as implemented he screams ""HELLO YOU ARE IN A GAME WITH TALKING BEAR WHO POINTS OUT THE OBVIOUS"".The game is short, and it would have been a nice bit of art if everyone would learn to shut up.  As is, I think some people will enjoy it a lot and ultimately what it does well it does well enough that I can forgive the rest.  This game is NOT for you if:1. You are immune to childhood fears2. You want a long game (I've logged 3 hrs and that includes taking the time to write swears in blocks)3. You want a scary game (unless you are very vulnerable to childhood fears, in which case this is for you)4. You hate physics puzzlesThis game IS for you if:1. You are vulnerable to childhood fears and like being haunted by them.2. You enjoyed the demo (despite how badly the bear ruins the experirence)3. You like 'artistic' game experiences and an interactive way of telling a story.I'm personally in the middle, and would have recommended this stronger if the bear was mostly mute as well.			"

												The monster only appears a handful of times, and it usually disappears immediately after if the player finds a hiding spot in time. The interaction with the monster is very limited, and so it's not that significant an element in the game. It doesn't stalk the player, and there's no real cat-and-mouse interplay. As long as you keep aware of the nearest thing you can crawl under, then you won't have to fear much for your safety.If the developers had come up with an actual need for hugging the teddy bear, and if they had expanded upon the evasion of the monster, then there could have been a lot more gratification and strategy in the gameplay. If the monster was a bit smarter and more persistent and methodical in its search for the child, then the teddy could have been used to calm the child to prevent it from crying and giving away his position. Or something like that.The $20 asking price for this game might be a bit steep for the limited playtime and lack of any real scares. But if you can pick it up on a Steam sale (as I did), then the novelty makes it worth a few hours of your time. It's story is shaky in the middle act, but the conclusion is very human, very blunt, and terrifyingly real, in a way that goes far beyond the childish terror that any imaginary closet monster can create.Full review on my personal blog:http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2014/08/22/Among-the-Sleep-game-review.aspx "

												When it comes to horrors, this is pretty good. It has a great atmosphere, the sounds are incredibly creepy, and it's enemies... Oh, it's enemies. Let's start with the first ""monster"", he looks like a coat-rack with a coat and an umbrella (that's the idea), he isn't a threat but is involved with a jumpscare a few minutes in. Next is the swamp-tree lady. She looks like medusa with hair like branches and bright glowing eyes, she is more of a threat. Lastly is the Raincoat man. He looks like an egg with a raincoat, he doesn't pose much of a threat but is still creepy until you figure out a way to bypass him, then no problem.A special interesting thing is when you have finished the game, you'll find that the monsters are based on the mother. (not gonna spoil much.)The story I think is you 're playing a two-year-old living with a single mother whom has some problems, she becomes pretty abusive but does not give you to the father, it does not appear like this at the start but you'll figure it out, anyway you go on this nightmarish adventure looking for your mother after a darkness invades your house, you'll need to solve puzzles, throw objects, but most of all, survive the threats of the monsters.The ending, to me, is really powerful, (I don't wanna spoil) in tugged a heartstring in me, and hopefully it will for you.Overall I give a 9/10. It's chosen art style is nice and the models are great, but a small optimisation would be nice, but hey, it's no Slender: The Arrival. I'll say you'll enjoy this game with it's easy to earn achievements, and it's dark atmosphere!			"

												Pros: A lot of attention has been placed on the backstory to this game, and there a plenty of little clues to what is going on. The developers seemed to have a fairly good understanding of how children think as well, and it paints a picture of abuse pretty well.It is pretty artistically done, as well.Cons: It is relatively short. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, in that it took about as long as it needed for the story, but can be a downstide for anyone expecting a lot of play out of this game. Since it is story focussed, any replays are mostly going to be to pick up things you missed the first time.I would have appreciated more information on the father in the backstory. Still, pay attention when you do here what is presumably his voice at the end, because it's pretty familiar.This game does 'have feels'. I was actually fairly angry on the behalf of the child in the game by the end, as well as sad to see the whole situation. I'd recommend picking it up, but likely when it's on sale, as I feel the normal price would be a bit much for the amount of gameplay you get.			"

My only problems with the game is that there's not much of a replay value here and it is fairly short game. But overall, I loved the game n definitely would recommend this!			"

												This game is truly a work of art. The deep psychological meaning of what is actually going on is so well done and thought out, I could explain it all and it would take me a lot of long paragraphs to do so, however I don't want to make any spoilers.The scenes start out with happy colors, and I think graphically this game looks amazing. As the game prolongs the scenes get more dark, scary and eerie, (and also amazing looking) and the sense of being in danger heightens, which you actually also become. But even if that happens, you usually can continue right from where you left off, so it's not that big of a deal.If you like horror games then this is a must buy even if this game is not that long. The fact you play as a two year old is really refreshing and it is done very well.If you have finished this game and did not understand everything that exactly went on, please go to the wiki/look up information about it. It is truly amazing.			"

												This is an odd game. Afterwards I think to myself, ""C'mon, I'm stupid for getting scared about this. I mean it's what a baby would be scared of, am I really at that level of wimpness?"" but the gameplay feels real. It's all something you think a baby would be able to do or think of. Like pushing chairs around to climb on them in order to open a door. Brilliant. It really utilizes the teddy bear. As a kid we all remember snuggling with our favorite stuffed animals when the lights go out and that fact is used very well in the game. Having Teddy there is far FAR more comforting than you would think. But not too comforting. It makes you feel secure, without taking away the edge and the fright. Recommended.			"

I loved it, tense the whole way through. Yes it was short for the price but truthfully thank Merlin for that. If I heard that mothers creepy humming for a second longer I am pretty sure I would have thrown in the towel. "

												The concept of the game, playing a two year old child, is pretty nice. His adventure is amusing, but extremely short. To be honest, playing 2 hours and the game is already done is disappointing.Don't pay for it until it's at 1 or 2 dollars. The graphic and the atmosphere are nicely done. The story has is little twist that surprise the player, making the game more for adults. What I regret the most is the lack of imagination to extend the story and for  the end. Anyway, it was a good experience, but it doesn't worth 10$.			"

												""Amongst the Sleep"" is a surprisingly good little survival horror game that invokes your primal fears by placing you in the body of a small toddler that can barely walk upright. What may seem amusing at first quickly becomes outright scary as the child's unique perception of reality turns seemingly mundane objects and locations (such as a closet or a playground) into pure nightmare fuel. Even when the twist at the end of the story reveals the toddler's terrors to be relatively normal from an adult's point of view, the anxiety and uneasiness you will experience throughout the game will not simply fade away, as it merely replaces the imaginative fear with a real one.Unfortunately, the enjoyment you can get from this game is drastically limited by it's very short length, with a walkthrough taking little more than roughly two hours. It is perhaps something to be expected from a game that evolved from a student project, but still, by the time the credits roll you may feel extremely disappointed and longing for more. For what little it's worth, the game still manages to scare the hell out of you for these two hours.			"

												A freaking scary ride, but a short ride it was.I'm a big horror fan and i got to say this is one of the best scary games i've ever played. I acutally like it more then amnesia and slender.It has a good mix of platformering, puzzle solving and a whole lot of running like hell.Being a baby really adds to the game. You need to climb on chairs to reach doors and you often fall over while running because your still learning to walk. you can hide under shelfs and small spaces an adult could never fit to save your self.If your a horror fan and can get this game cheap its well worth it for 2 hours of scares.

												A stunningly beutifully designed game, with an overall dream feel to it, with mostly realistic but quirky and childish art style. The game was horrifying at times, but mostly it just gave me the chills, with it's eerie music and nightmare scenarios. A very touching and pretty sad tale, with a great message, if you manage to read a bit between the lines, since it's a bit on the metaphoric side. I loved this game, but it's far too short, and by that I mean really, really short. I managed to complete it in a measly two hours, and that, sadly is the biggest flaw of this game, considering the price. I recommend this game, but get it on a Steam sale, otherwise it's a bit too expensive, considering the hours of gameplay you get out of it.			"

 A game to make your blood run cold This game for me, was absolutely terrifying, and anyone who says it isn't I think may not have fully emmersed themselves in the creepy and quite frankly dark story -  and it is a very dark theme , which may be an emotional trigger for some.   Theme of Alcoholism and suggested child abuse and dissociation coping mechanisms during a parental feud and divorce  I like this style of game because of the atmospheric horror style, which echoes some of the elements of ""Silent Hill"" puzzle solving, and the paranormal and psychological aspect from F.E.A.R. This game is not for those who are prone to panick attacks, as I myself found out the hard way. However if you are the sort of person who gets a kick out of the adrenaline while being terrified, then I thoroughly recommend this game to you. It is beautiful and horrific all at the same time.

Though this game wasn't as scary as I wanted it to be, This game had it's times where it is down right terrifying! Saddly, this game was also very short. However, they mannaged to fit a lot in one level. The fear factor was high in certain parts, and I'm going to be completly honest, I nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥myself in some parts.

												Among the Sleep is not your typical horror game. It is a bit short, but not as short as the 1 hour playtime that I've seen others give. I'd say it's a solid 2-3 hour game, a little more if you explore the environment (which you should). It's got a beautiful, touching story that reveals itself gradually. The environments you travel through are varied and very rich, with minimal texture reusing, which is unusual and refreshing in an indie game. The atmosphere is perfect and creepy, but not chock full of jump scares. The first parts of the game will lull you into a false sense of security. To say anything more would be a spoiler.There's no incentive to replay unless you missed a Steam achievement, and this game isn't really made for replays because the story will have been revealed. However, I think the first experience was solid enough and unique enough to stand on its own. I got it for $15.99 and thought it was well worth the price because it seems much higher quality than other indie games and I am very interested to see what else the developers can do. I highly recommend it!			"

If you want to fight things or want blood and gore in your horror this probably won't be for you, but damned if they don't prove that the sound of a plate breaking can be scarier than a walking corpse if it's done right.

												Wow! How to put it in words. These people know how to make a game that even creeped me out (first one ever and I'm in love with the horror genre). There is obviously a LOT of research done in to the psychological aspect of this game and I am so impressed. Now to get down to reviewing: 3 hours of play from start to finish with small replayability, however there are currently 10 achievements to get and I will happily play many more hours of this to get them. I got it on sale because of the reviews I had read but I believe it is worth paying full priice for. Anytime I want to get creeped out I'll come back and play again.I fully recommend it to people who likelogical puzzles and tobe creeped out. A friend of mine couldn't get past the 2 chapter watching me play and wouldn't play it herself she got so scared. I on the other hand played it through in 2 sittings at 3am each time while my children were sleeping because this is not one to play in front of children.			"

I enjoyed the art style and graphics overall and the game is different to anything I have ever experienced before. It is a good concept and one that I would recommend to others. I did have a few technical issues, I had constant framerate drops and stutters and a few random crashes. With an i7 6800k, GTX 1080 SLI (disabled for this one) and 16 GB of fast RAM it was unexpected, it should run like butter but that was not the case. However it was not something that bothered me too much, I still had fun playing. The puzzles are too easy but the story and atmosphere made up for it. All in all I would give it a 7/10.			"

												Among the Sleep is a frightening, fairytale-like, original and surprisingly resonant game that reminds us what the world looks like through the eyes of a 2-year old child. It’s a bit short, over-priced and it doesn’t quite manage to live up to its great potential, but it is definitely worth playing, especially by fans of first-person survival horror adventure games.Full review: http://adventureadvocate.gr/gamereviews/item/among-the-sleep-3 "

												This is another survival/exploration horror game, but one in which you play as a two year old child. Somehow, this makes the whole thing that much more terrifying, even if the game itself isn't a pants-filler like Outlast. It's not just that you're defenseless and don't want to get eaten by some monstrosity, but you also don't want the little kid you're playing to get hurt either. It definitely adds to the fear.As others have said, the game is a bit short, although they recently added some free DLC, which helps round it out a bit. The design is interesting in that it actually feels like what a toddler might imagine based on the pieces he can put together from the world and events around him. It even reminded me of snippets that I can remember from when I was a little kid, from imaginary worlds to fragments of dreams.The mechanics are relatively simple and involve a fair amount of finding Tab A and getting it into Slot B before progressing. It's a common element in many games, and at least it isn't obstructive or overt here.The story is what got to me, though. I don't want to spoil anything, but pay attention to those crayon drawings you see littering the place and various recurring themes and objects. Some parts were fairly obvious, some were a bit of a surprise, but regardless, it was heartbreaking at points. Making the player a little kid brings out the sadness of many things.I definitely recommend picking this one up. If you're wary, grab the demo or wait for a sale. Parents playing this game might just find themselves giving their kids a big hug after playing.			"

												Pros: * Interesting concept.* When I bought it it was cheap.* Fairly well done.* Kind of like Amnesia: The Dark Descent crossed with Silent Hill 4:The Room.  Much less horror elements involved though.Cons:* Pretty obvious where the story was going.  Would've been nice if there was more subtley.  But then again I think I've come to realize that most ""scary"" type games go the same direction.* Short game			"

It made me feal as helpless as a child and made me scream twice wich I don't commanly do. This game is worth the money because it's cheaper and has a better plot than most movies. pros: master peice great attention to detail.cons: Price to timeoverall: buy this game for a breif and refreshing gameplay expeirence.

												TLDR: Buy on a sale but totally worth it. Great music, art, and story. A little short but the scare was lost to me about 60% of the way through the game so that might have been a good thing that the game was short. DLC was maybe 30 minutes at max and I went into every room. Would love them to make a simlar game just add more 'twists' and not give away the story so soon. "

												Very immersive game, that had me wanting to find out the ending.    I really am drawn more to the story based, adventure style games that engage your mind to work through puzzles and reword you with more clues/pieces of the story (i.e. not so much into the quick twitch nonstop shooting games), so understand the style of games you like and take that into account when reading this review.    This Indie game was really enjoyable,   I hesitate to call it a horror game, even though I feel it fits in that category, as it does not follow the normal tactics of most horror games.    I love the use of sounds to provide the tension without the need for gore.   Another new concept (at least for me) was playing as a very small child, which added to the tension of the game as it taps into our normal protective nature for children, and made me more concerned for the characters well being.    The idea to play as a small child was genius, as it opened up new obstacles and adventures (as well allows for the concept of the story) that I had not really experienced before (things like reaching a door knob became an adventure).   The game mechanics were good and provided interesting twists...such as being able to crawl faster than you can walk (as is fitting for a small child), and being able to run for short bursts, but falling down if you run too long (again...this felt very realistic).  Graphics were ok, with a few glitches here and there, but overall decent enough (especially considering the Indie nature of this game).     I truly enjoyed the game and the story that it told.   I talked about it to my wife and friends, and while I don't think I conveyed the full affect of the game to them (they did not seem as impressed as I was), just the fact that it had me talking about it is something not a lot of games do.I highly recommend you give this game a whirl if you are into this genre of game.

												I....LOVED...THIS...GAME..IT IS LIKE AMNESIA BUT BETTER! I love amnesia because of one thing...sanity meter, when you stand in the dark for too long you start seeing things, but you know there is going to be a monster when you are picking something up when you are allready in a convenient hiding spot and I am quite bothered by that...but in this game you have to find them but sometimes even the hiding spots scare you, and for that, I thank the creaters, I only have one problem, this game is victim to a lot of games I play these days:Length, This game was AMAZING but so little game time. but thats pretty much the only flaw, maybe they could fix that by letting people make costom stories like in amnesia, I just hope there will be another Among The Sleep where like  when you are in the dad's house the umbrella monster makes a return and it turns out to be a robber...or the mom comes to get you or something they can hammer out the details, they are the creators, thats what they are for.

												If you enjoy an immersive storyline, beautiful graphics, amazing music, and a horror aspect that blows the mind, you will fall in love with Among the Sleep. The telling of the story is from the eyes of an unnamed two year old, along with the stumbling, heavy breathing, and curiosity of a young child. The game itself isn't very long, and if you push through the story, you can be done in a matter of hours. However, should you take the time to explore the beautiful and haunting world of the game, you will not be sorry! It has amazing ambiance, scares that come few and far between but are beyond effective, and an ending that leaves you wanting more! I very highly reccomend this game to anyone. It is GREAT!			"

Elements could have been used in different fashion to bring more scare-factor or heighten the mood in some of the dryer parts. Atmosphere:   7/10Quite a bit of repeditiveness, but overall atmosphere of the game holds together. Graphics:        6/10Can't really complain given the style, but some of the models could have been proptioned better and polished. I personally had issues with lighting, and I had expected more graphically from this game since the demo release.Innovation:      2/10Really nothing new here to bring to the gaming world. Just another story to be told. Points for oculus rift inclusion. "

												I really enjoyed this game. At first I didn't know what to make of it, considering its from the perspective of a toddler and was leery about getting it on that merit alone however I am extremely glad I got over it. The unique perspective of the toddler really lends to the whole story portrayed throughout the game. (sorry no spoilers :) ) DLC really does expand upon the story and though it does leave a couple more questions in the mind for possible more DLC later on down the road, what it does add does make you pause and blink. I know I did. Pros:*Unique perspective of the toddler + eye level items ( makes you have to *THINK* to get around some obstacles you'd normally just walk up to and click, in other games) *Dispite being a first person camera perspective, the shaking/movement animations do *not* incite the usual motion sickness nausea that usually accompany's such ""realistic"" perspective in a game. I contribute this to this game being VR compatible and that it must have gotten play tested very well to look for such problems for VR users. (don't know how many games utilize this first person camera perspective and because the camera is going EVERYWHERE, its a game I cannot play in one sit thru. Among the Sheep, does *NOT* have this problem. Was able to play through it in one sitting with much enjoyment had.)*Ambience + level music lends more to the suspense/horror as you play. ( If I'm not mistaken some of the undertones are suppose to supposedly resonate with the player to highten this suspense. Probably mistaken but if your ears are keen or have heard those tones before that may influence mood, might make the same mistake in thinking the undertones are the same. *shrug*)*The drawings, pictures and monsters = story line goodness (try and see them all!). Especially if playing pretty much uninterrupted by RL things, the monsters (there's technically two if take into consideration the DLC) really lend to the feeling of dread and will probably have you either shock/startle when they appear, or hiding in a closet from a meer noise that might possibly somehow in a far flung galaxy be indication that the monster's coming to possibly eat you, or whatever it does when the screen turns black! ( dun dun Dun!)* Teddy Bear Companion. This little guy, how they put him throughout the game, there's always this nagging feeling, just by how he talks, what he asks of your character, if you should trust him. I think because of the way the companion was made and what it adds to the game, you do have that added layer that some games lack in creating attachment to sidekicks. *Graphics=Awesome. There's not much more to be said on that point, provided you have your settings at the optimum for your system and calibrated the gamma correctly to give that spooky look, you're gonna have a great time. Even the pieces of wood have breakpoints and lines, the detail on the items the toddler has to crawl over you can tell someone put a lot of work into those little points that really bring out the mental mind trip Alice in wonderland vibe. ( Makes you almost wonder what exactly was in that happy birthday baby bottle at the begining before the cake!  Ha.) ConsUnfortunately, with how much I *loved* playing this game. I did find two picky little Cons. * End Credits. Awesome to pay respect to all the backers from ever and always but it does make the credits uber long to sit through. Took me a good few times of pressing escape before being able to get out of the long list of credits. Sitting though the whole thing on the DLC, took enough time to get up, get a drink, go use the washroom and come back in enough time for it to still be going through the R names. LOL. Certainly there has to be an easier way on the main interface to give all the backers and such recognition than a long scroll screen where its hard to catch all their names, but again, like I said. ""that's me being picky."" * DLC is a little hard to find. At first I didn't realize it had downloaded DLC when I first booted up the game. If it wasn't for beating the game and deciding to go back and replay some chapters, I wouldn't know that the DLC is listed in the Chapter Selection, portion of the main menu and I may have missed out on playing some EPIC DLC. The extra story the DLC adds on, especially if you play it AFTER the main game, makes one sit back and go Dayuum. Overall this is a great game and I recommend it, especially if you have time to dedicate going through an entire playthru uninterrupted. Another time I tried playing it, and I constantly had to set it down and pick it back up again, really had not as many of the features pop out or strike me as the first time, when well, you've been playing it for hours and all that ambience has gotten to you. HA! :)  I really recommend playing the DLC after the Main game, for a different perspective on the game story. I played it both with DLC first, then main game, and also Main game with DLC after. Found doing it one way over the other, tends to lend itself to one verson of understanding the story while doing the other, makes one almost ponder a complete nother.  As to what I'm talking about! Play the game! can you note the difference I""m speakin' of? Lady			"

												Well, I am normally not one to take to horror games in any form and I am also not one to play ""ATMOSPHERIC"" type games in any capacity willingly. My wife saw this game on YouTube and said I should give it a go and so I did. What the hell man! This game is creepy as hell and kinda pulls on the heart strings a bit when you really get into it. The first time the ""MONSTER"" got me a whole lot more of the story started to make sense. I killed it AND the DLC in just over 2.5 hours but the experience is worth it. The game is short but the story I feel is too simple to take moch longer, not a lot mure depth can be had without reacing too far into uncharted territory. I say give this game the time it deserves and play it through in a single sitting, at least a good pair or headphones or a decent surround system and a decently large TV so you can relax and soak in the game. On a happy side note this game supports built in side by side stereo 3D. I played it in 2D but I will play it again to see how much creepier this game gets.			"

												Guess I just can't go away without reviewing this piece of work.   There is only one problem with this game: it's pretty much overpriced. Beating ""Among the Sleep"" in a slow pace took me 3 hours and it's pretty qiuck. So...the price is too high for that amount of gameplay.   On the other hand...This game is great, I liked graphics, I liked the voice-acting, I liked sound effects and I liked the story.   Not liked...I loved it! If you like games with deep meaning, which keeps you rethinking the ending again and again, well, I can recommend ""Among the Sleep"" for you.   Developers literally put you into the child's body and more important: they put you into his mind.   If you would like to imagine difficult childhood of 2-year old baby, his fears, his dreams, the way he looks at world...well, that would be something like ""Among the Sleep"".

It's more creepy than anything.Everyone says telling the story from the POV of a toddler is awesome and groudbreaking, but honestly I thought it was really disorienting.

The mechanics were very user-friendly, the level designs were pure eye-candy, and even though you can see the ending a mile away, it STILL hits you where you don't expect.  It's short enough that you can complete it in one or two sittings, but in no way is this game easy.  It makes you work for your reward and you feel immensely satisfied when you get it.  Also, you play as a toddler and it is possible for your character to die.			"

												I had seen a demo of this game played before I decided to buy it, and from even watching the demo I was already excited about this game. It's not often you get to play as a two year-old child running around the house escaping the ""monsters"" with a talking teddy bear.The point of this game is to avoid the ""monsters"" (spoiler-free review) in the dark while searching for objects attached to memories of your mother. You have your trusty light-up companion Teddy with you the whole way reminding you to keep quiet and be careful. The storyline is sad, so if you're easily phased, be warned. Overall, there weren't as many jump scares as I had anticipated, just a creepy atmosphere. But it's really a good game, and I'm looking forward to seeing more from this amazing company.			"

												The horror feeling was nicely done, not only from a toddler's perspective was it scary. The blurry screen and the shaking and wow the sounds was really haunting. It was really well done.Of course since the game is basically you playing a two-year old there is of course a limit to what you can do. It's not an all-out horror story, it's a little kid being scared and altohugh with imagination one can think of quite some scary things, it had to be as close to realistic as possible, which I lvoed and it totally achieved.I loved every level, how the details for example the particular objects scattered throughout an eare, hinted at something that was going on in the real life, but it was invading the toddler's dreams. Also they did an excellent job on giving you a false sense of security/safety in the beginning.Anyway, it was a joy to play. A simple yet invigorating to play through and excellent work on showing how real life things can affect everyone. Loved the twist and loved Teddy! So if you like horror games but are a bit of a scarecat or if you're simply looking for a quick enjoyable experience to pass the time, definitely try this one. It's got it all.			"

												I'm torn on this game, I really am. The atmosphere and story are very unique. It's also great to see a horror title from the perspective of a young child. Great little indie piece in the vein of The Path (More of a game, however). Should you buy it? This is where I'm torn. At full price I'm just not sure. It's VERY short. If you love indie games like this or are looking for a fun (yet short) jaunt through the eyes of a two year old, I'd get it. You just need to know what you're getting into.People who want legnth and replayability might look elsewhere. I'll update this after they release the DLC.TL;DR - Amazing atmosphere but VERY short.

I found myself very scared at times and in tears while playing this little 2 year old child who is exploring his world around him and trying to put together whats going on and how to make sense of it all.

												The story is really solid and compelling, the pacing basically perfect, and the tension/horror is top notch. The environments are fairly linear but for the most part you don't really feel it - they're desined to make you think you're not really on a set path, and it works. Everything is designed to make you feel helpless and a little confused (just like real children ;) ). The only detraction is some of the physics can be a bit iffy, so it breaks the awesome atmosphere and immersion of the game. Between 2-4 hours of gameplay (depending on exploration and how tricky you find 1 or 2 of the puzzles). It was worth the price on sale ($15) for me, ymmv.			"

												This isn't a game you play on a laptop while hanging out with friends.  This isn't a game you play while listening to your iTunes playlist in the middle of the afternoon.  This game can only be played late at night, in the dark, with the only sound coming from your computer speakers.  When you do, you will lose yourself in the mind of our main character, a two-year-old, as he tries to make sense of the intimidating world around him.What makes this a ""Horror"" game does not come from gratuitous amounts of gore, or the living dead popping up out of nowhere.  It comes simply from crawling around, taking in the sights and sounds as you try to determine if what you are experiencing is real, a nightmare, or something that adults take for granted that is unsettling/horrifying to a toddler.The game doesn't last long; it only lasts a couple of hours (free DLC on the way)!  But it isn't meant to be a game that occupies your bored mind for hours and hours of replay on end.  It's meant to be an experience, and it was.  I hope you decide to try this experience as well!

												This is probably the first Survival Horror game that hit me on a psychological level. Delivering you into the body of a two year old child, you must navigate the dark and disturbing world of a troubled mind and uncover the mysterious dissappearence of your mother. Alongside you a teddy bear named ""Teddy"" aids you in your journey often keeping you comfort when you need it. The game sets up an interesting premise but falls short at making you feel more vulnerable as a child as opposed to any other horror game. The true feat here is how large and menacing the environments are and the illusion that every object in the game world is either falling on you or trying to pull you in. Quite often in places you dont want to go. That combined with the chilling ambient sound make for a very unnerving atmosphere. The story is well written and completely out of left field. Please buy if you consider yourself a fan of this genre.			"

Saying that, what game is worth £15 when the experience is only 1-2 hours long...The first ten minutes were very imersive, after that it becomes a grind collecting 4 items, which completes the game.There are few encounters that generate any sense of threat and those encounters are short lived. It felt more like a fantasy adventure game.			"

												In Among the Sleep, by Krillbite Studio, you will take on the role of a 2 year old child who just had his birthday. You are eating cake in the arms of your mom when there is a knock at the door. This is followed by an argument, and then your mom coming back in with a present. You then fast forward to around bedtime/nap time, I'm not really sure which. It is then that the game takes on a nightmarish overlay.The visual look of this game felt like it fit with the character being a 2 year old. I'm not saying that it was rainbows and puppies, but there were those softer colors, even when everything was dark. The levels of this game were beyond creepy, especially for me because I have an almost 2 year old, so I could see myself in his shoes. There is a slight terror to knowing that something bad could happen right out of the corner of your eye. The levels span from a deserted play ground, a library in a forest, small sections of your house, and more. There are villains that creep around as well. All I have to say is you are going to need to hide from them, or you will suffer a restart of the section you are in. I also really enjoyed the companion, the teddy bear that helped me along. All I had to do was hug it and he would produce a little bit of light that would help me see through the darkness.The sounds in this game are extremely creepy. Once again it was doubley so because I have a young son, and hearing those noises creep around in a dark area would scare the pants off me at that age. I also think the voice acting in this game was spot on. I could see the roles of the mother and the teddy bear in the voices given.The controls of the game are your usual configuration with WASD, shift to run, ctrl to crawl or get up, space to climb, and the mouse to control the camera and interact with objects.Though this game wasn't as long as I would have hoped, it definitely had enough there to keep me on my toes, and hoping that nothing was going to get me around the next corner. There is just something about this game that awakened long gone fears of my childhood, and the fear of what is in the dark. In this respect the developers did a great job. To be honest I can't really think of anything I found clunky or missing from this game. I will tell you this, the twist is a hell of one, and I'm not going to tell you what it is because you need to play this game to find out, but when the game ends everything kind of makes better sense.There were definitely puzzle aspects to this game, most of the time it was moving objects so that you could get to a different location, but there were a couple of times where the developers threw in a mechanism just for a small section of the game that changed things up a little. A couple examples of this would be throwing objects to knock something off a shelf, or collecting a specific type of object so that you could weigh down the end of something so you could get to the other side. I'm not saying that this was a bad thing, but I would have liked to see a little bit more of these mechanics, to do them once and then seeming to throw them away made me feel like they were afterthoughts in the game creation process.So lets get down to the part that most of you want to know, and that is should you play this game. The answer is yes, you should play this game, and you should play it in the dark, at night, and pray that no one sneaks up behind you while you are playing. This game gets an 8.9 out of 10.			"

Even though I KNOW that in real life I'm a  grown MAN when I take the role of the main charcter whose a baby I feel truly helpless, I have nothing to help me combat the monsters that lurk in the darkness, and I know that no one is coming to rescue me.

												Let's get this out of the way right now, this is not a horror game.  This is an adventure game with some scary bits in it.  The more important part is that you understand the story and not that you♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself.  That being said, let's talk about the pros and cons. Pros  Good Graphics Sounds are very fitting and well recorded When it wants to get scary it does so very well Creative mechanics that make use of the player being a baby Interesting puzzles Surreal setting that's very weird in a good way Cons  Paper thin story that you can figure out by the 2nd chapter or less Kinda short for 20 bucks (havent played DLC yet) Some of the less interesting puzzles boil down to finding a thing to unlock another thing Game doesn't get scary until halfway throughIn short, it's an interesting game that, while scary in some parts, is more of an adventure game than a horror game.  It has a mediocre and forgettable story that could have been done better and seems like it was trying way too hard to be art.  It's still a good time though, but for 2 hours the price may be a little steep.  There is free DLC that I haven't played yet though, this is just a review on the original game.  I recommend that people go into Among the Sleep with an open mind and not expect something that's not there.Final Grade: 8.75/10			"

												At only 3 hours of gameplay (including the very short prologue DLC), some might consider Among the Sleep a poor investment for their gaming dollars.  To those, I ask, how much did you spend on your last trip to the movie theater, and after you watched it, did you find yourself thinking about the deeper meanings of it, or wanting to talk to others to explain how moving it was?That is this game.  Short, true, but longer than an average movie, and definitely far more engaging.  Among the Sleep manages to do more in those few levels than most big-budget franchise games have accomplished in their entire series.  Playing from the perspective of a toddler, from the difference in size, to the inability to jump, to the general sounds and movement styles, is the key element that makes this game different, but not what makes the game great.  The fascination that you see repeated over and over again in reviews comes from the subtle, yet powerful, story-behind-the-story.  Yes, you're a toddler, wandering around the house with a teddy bear.  But the real story lies behind the ""why.""Fans of horror games like Amnesia will enjoy this, while fans of action games will probably want to pass.			"

												This is a very beautiful game. Very creative. I would recommend it to anyone who's into twisted story lines with a hint of horror. I wouldn't say this game is extremely scary, but it did make me jump a few times. The story line alone should be enough for anyone to play it, but I don't want to spoil it at all. Go into this game blind, it's the best way for a fuller experience. It really did feel child-like and I felt that it gave a good helpless vibe the whole game.Pros: Nice graphics, awesome story line leaving a lot to the player to think about.Cons: Really short (probably beat it in less than two hours), a bit glitchy at times (I think I read that 32 bit computers have to use a console command to get to the last level).

												This game will turn you into a baby... Literally, and figuratively as the game plays you as a baby for the main protagonist who tries to find his mother in a dark, scary house and winds up going into an unknown world. Quite the scary game.. Again, it makes you a baby so expect some feelings of helplessness.			"

												This is an excellent, short, little horror game. Playing as a child is perfect starting point as you are so helpless and vulnerable, you can either walk slowly or crawl but you cannot see too far when crawling. The atmosphere is what makes this game so good. It starts off with a very creepy oppressive atmosphere where you never know what dangers are lurking. Then just when you are thinking it is only a sinister atmosphere and there are no actual threats you catch a glimpse of enemies. There are no really cheap jump scares but lots of menacing corner of the screen glimpses of things and when you do first get caught by the enemy it is terrifying. So this manages to maintain the atmosphere throughout that game where you are never sure if you are in danger or not. My only complaint is that some of the camera movements when climbing made me a little nauseous.			"

												I bought this at the discounted price for Halloween, and it was damn worth it.  I'm someone who enjoys being scared, and this definitely did the trick.  It was eerie, and the vulnerability of being a 2 year old child is definitely felt by the player.  The largeness of the world is intimidating, and the creepy figure lurking in the darkness definitely has its own surprising moments.  If it wouldn't have been on sale, I probably wouldn't have gotten it, because it's only about 3 hours of gameplay and I'm not sure it has very much replayability, but, on sale, it was definitely worth the $7.

Summary 7.9/10A purely story-driven adventure that has no other direction but forward, but a good pace and experience in general leaves you satisfiedThe Good:- Great scares- Good use of tactics and required ""know-how""- Cute, but bat-sh*t crazy- Dark and Eery, while also being justified- Sense of justice and acomplishment in the end- Strong connection with protagonist (At least for me.)- Great use of ambient soundThe Bad:- Expensive for so little time I put into it and completed it- Abysmal voice acting- Disappointing ending, although conclusive- Repetitious- Sudden cuts in audio and poor blending- Constant clipping, and extremely obviousConclusionAmong the Sleep is a lot like an Italian dessert. Its absurdly small, it's a poor decision, expensive and somewhat unhealthy in structure, but overall tasty and satisfying. If you loved Slender, play this. If the theme itself interests you, go for it. If you are looking for a long-lasting meal with dessert at the end, find another. It's good, but nothing I'd ever probably order again.			"

												Truly a great short horror game. I loved the detail paid with the child, the visual differances, the sounds, the little wobbles. About halfway through I figured out what was going on but I had to keep going. Even when I died I wanted to go back and see what else was in store. I played the DLC immediately after and it flowed really well, in reverse of course. It really was good about the quick scares and I loved the way the soundtrack kept throwing things in to mess with you. All in all if they added more to the story I would keep playing. I dont know that I would replay it as it stands the story is rather straight forward and Im the type to completly explore a map before I continue.			"

 A game to make your blood run cold This game for me, was absolutely terrifying, and anyone who says it isn't I think may not have fully emmersed themselves in the creepy and quite frankly dark story -  and it is a very dark theme , which may be an emotional trigger for some.   Theme of Alcoholism and suggested child abuse and dissociation coping mechanisms during a parental feud and divorce  I like this style of game because of the atmospheric horror style, which echoes some of the elements of ""Silent Hill"" puzzle solving, and the paranormal and psychological aspect from F.E.A.R. This game is not for those who are prone to panick attacks, as I myself found out the hard way. However if you are the sort of person who gets a kick out of the adrenaline while being terrified, then I thoroughly recommend this game to you. It is beautiful and horrific all at the same time.

												Long story short: Get it on sale at < $10. It's good.I was following the crowd-funding campaign and development of this game somewhat close and was super excited after playing the Alpha that was released.The game definitely does not disappoint when it comes to presentation: Killbrite ♥♥♥♥ing kills it when it comes to atmosphere. I was completely immersed most of the time and I noticed my mouth was agape a lot. The art style is qwerky by design seeing as how it's through the lens of a toddler and the sections where fear alters the environment is really awesome.The sound design of this game is super on point. All the little creaks and cracks in the environment as well as the occasional loud breathing of the protagonist kept me on edge even when there was no perceivable threat. Hearing the mother character humming a lullaby when you were near the end of your objective was assuring but the somber melody is super creepy at the same time.Where this game falls somewhat short is in the actual gameplay. The puzzles are so laughably easily, a baby can do them......*crickets*...whatever. Anyway, most of the game is classic horror: Try a door >♥♥♥♥♥♥s locked > look for key > traverse level looking for key > get key > open door > move on to next level. The perspective is somewhat unique in that you're a tiny babby ♥♥♥♥♥-his-pants so you have to find creative ways to traverse an environment, which largely includes moving chairs to climb them to open doors or opening drawers to climb them.My biggest gripe with the game is actually the length. I beat it in 2 hours and I'm ♥♥♥♥ing dog♥♥♥♥♥♥at video games. A good player can prolly beat it in an hour or less. Which is why you should get it for less than $10 and you won't be disappointed.Or don't, whatever. ♥♥♥♥ you.			"

												While the idea behind this game is interesting, I found it to be poorly executed. The story itself is interesting enough, if a little predictable. The overall atmosphere isn't bad either. The gameplay is where the game lost me. You spend 70% of the game trudging back and forth to collect keys/items to solve arbitrary puzzles that block the way forward. The puzzles are nothing more than fluff since there's no danger or real skill involved in solving them and it's literally just walking to one end of the room to collect an item and then walking back. Considering the game is already so short, taking these puzzles out would leave you with about 20 minutes of game. It took me a little more then 2 hours to complete the main game and DLC and most of the time was spent trundling back and forth trying to figure out which hidden corner I forgot to search to progress to the next area. The monster is barely ever a threat and the few times you actually have to run from it are over in just a few seconds. Overall, this might be worth playing if you pick it up in a bundle or on sale, but I'd be upset if I paid the full 20 bucks they're asking.			"

												I was pretty nervous during the introductory phase, then I NOPEd out pretty quick once the Groots actually started killing me. There's a reason I don't play a lot of horror games. But I watched the rest of it on youtube and I gotta say, this game is absolutely genius. So many things to love about it, in terms of both narrative and gameplay. If you've ever been reading and come across something profound and your reaction is ""yes! someone else said it!"", you'll have a lot of moments like that during this game if you think through the implications of what you're being shown.The horror comes in two flavors: gentle suggestion of a threat that causes you to scare yourself via the power of imagination, and actual Slender-esque sequences that will result in a game over. We get the former exclusively for about the first 2/3rds of the game, and it works extremely well although it might wear out it's welcome if the player decides that the game is all bark and no bite. However, after a seemingly arbitrary point you will start dying, and it will seem random and arbitary, which is of course jarring as hell once you're good and tired of the game being harmless. My only issue with this is that you aren't given any indication that this change has happened, and the advice on how to deal with it came 20 or 30 minutes ago. Basically just try not to make noise since that's what usually causes the Groots to spawn, and if they spawn anyway just run.All-around it's a genius game and I hope it gets some quality imitators. 10/10 would reccomend.

And the story, without giving anything away, will disturb you and might even make you think.The controls feel very similar to Amnesia, at least in the sense of how you interact with the world. Opening doors and turning valves, picking up objects to throw, rotate, or carry, and using the bear as a flashlight will all feel very familiar to players that have braved the halls of Castle Brennenburg.The audio, in all its forms, is unrelenting. Even the lack of audio at times will fill you with such a sense of impending dread that you will slowly and cautiously navigate the surrounding. And sometimes even the slightest 'bang' or 'crash' will send you scurrying towards any safe haven, for fear of something coming up behind you.The visuals have such a grasp of a child's imagination it is uncanny. Words are as scribbles, sense a child cannot comprehend them, and drawings litter the worlds, as if a tiny person is giving you clues that you can easily understand without a spoken or written language. And the literal perspective of everything towering over you really draw on the feeling of helplessness in an unknown place, with only your teddy bear as comfort.Overall, this is a delightful horror gem. There is no reason to only catch it on a sale, for fear of it being underwhelming. If you enjoy horror games with thought, puzzles, and huge atmosphere, then 'Among the Sleep' is an absolute must have.			"

												I just do not understand the plott of this game.  The story line is completely slacking and although there are two antagonists, I never once had a prioblem avoiding them.  In fact, I had no confrontation with the villians at all.  Too easy, and too dull.  But i must admit, the game has its scarey moments.			"

												Okay, so it took me 2 hours to beat the game. You could even beat it in 1 hour if you don't stop to look at every little thing like I did. I even died 2 times and had to reload from a checkpoint 3 times. So yeah, if you don't die, don't encounter bugs that force you to reload the checkpoint and don't stop to admire the scenery, you'll be able to beat the game in a little under 40 minutes. Dead serious. So the game is short, what else? It's buggy. Really buggy... In chapter 3 (I think, the water level), I pressed F when I was under a chair and suddenly, me legs are in the floor. I press F again and I am now falling through the map. In the next chapter where the drawer extends to no limits, that drawer for me was... like misplaced or something, because I saw it come out from the wall rather than the hole it's supposed to come out of, so I was forced to reload the checkpoint. Lots of times you can get stuck almost anywhere, but like 80% of the time, you can get out. I still recommend it though, as it is scary and it's a good story, though maybe not explained/told that well and some may miss the point (below, you can read how I interpreted the story, so if you don't want any spoilers, you can end here). Imagine... you're just a baby crawling on your tiny little legs and arms and you have to go through a nightmare-ish land with your teddy and there are monsters just lurking to kill you. Although I wish the game was longer...WARNING! SPOILERThat nightmare-ish land... it has to do with the child's mother. It feels like the kid is terrified of her and imagines her as those monsters and the locations we are in are drawn from the books he read and the house itself. So the game has some psychological stuff in it too, which is interesting.			"

												   This game is short. It FEELS very short. It pulls you into its creepy and perfectly executed atmosphere, but that feeling of knowing you are close to the end really saps your joy from the journey when it arrives so quickly.      The terrified and overly imaginative perspective of an infant is perfect. You must cling to your teddy bear for comfort (A source of light) and every scene in the game seems like it takes place in one's imagination.    I've played 4 1/2 hours and it's hard to want to go back to it since it feels so linear. However, I'll ride a short roller coaster over and over if it is still fun. I love the feel of the game because it's unique it still felt unique even after playing games like Amnesia and Penumbra. The story and symbolism is what makes me want to play through it multiple times.    ""Mind-F"" and ""Jaw-dropper"" of an ending and intense scares throughout make this game amazing. I screamed a lot and I had been thinking about this game for days after completing it			"

												Among the Sleep is a different sort of horror game in that it utilizes jump scares, creepy ambiance, and heartpumping adrenaline spikes rather than outright gory, bloody, horror. It's whimsically odd in aspects that are reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, and creepy in aspects that closely resemble that of Slender/Amnesia. It's fun to play, might even get you a few times with some scares, and is completely worth it.This game surprised me in more ways than I expected. I was consistently trying to figure out the plot and whenever I thought I had it, it would change on me. The bear for one is somewhat creepy on it's own, and when you first begin to meet and interact with Teddy it feels very reminsicent of Chucky. As the game plays forward however, Teddy is your best friend in the entire world, as you navigate through a world that feels like the ""Other Mother"" built it (Coraline reference!). There's simple puzzles to complete to progress as you go, but they aren't mind-numbingly simple, some of them take a few minutes to put together.The story itself gives a fresh new way of looking at this kind of situation through a child's perspective. You're playing as a two year old child, and your objective is to rescue your mother from this nightmarish, topsy-turvey, alternate version of your own world. The ambiance is amazing, and the graphics are impeccable. It can get truly terrifying.I bought this game on a daily deal for 66% off. Among the Sleep isn't a very long game, it's only roughly 3 hrs of playthrough, so I feel better about paying 6$ vs 20$ to be honest. It's gamepad compatable, and if you're using a pc with Windows it goes without saying that it's recommended you use an Xbox 360 controller.It's fun, short, but not so sweet! If you can swing it, pick up Among the Sleep and play it, it's worth it.			"

												I played this game because a very attractive Irishman recommended it to me. I played the demo, and it made me feel petrified. Apparently, I enjoyed that feelng because I ended up purchasing the full game.This a first-person♥♥♥♥♥♥your-pants game. You don't have any choice of character; you'll play as the infant you are. You will awkwardly stumble around the environment. So, that should feel pretty natural to you, you indoors-person.If you've been constipated, I recommend this game.If you're concerned that you aren't capable of feeling human emotions, such as fear, terror, fright, or petrification, I recommend that you play this game.If you are a robot, don't play this game. Do robot things. You don't have emotions. Move on until Skynet happens. "

												This is a very beautiful game. Very creative. I would recommend it to anyone who's into twisted story lines with a hint of horror. I wouldn't say this game is extremely scary, but it did make me jump a few times. The story line alone should be enough for anyone to play it, but I don't want to spoil it at all. Go into this game blind, it's the best way for a fuller experience. It really did feel child-like and I felt that it gave a good helpless vibe the whole game.Pros: Nice graphics, awesome story line leaving a lot to the player to think about.Cons: Really short (probably beat it in less than two hours), a bit glitchy at times (I think I read that 32 bit computers have to use a console command to get to the last level).

												This is a really fun and engaging indie horror game developed by 'Krilbyte studios'. I really enjoy the freedom of experiencing life as a toddler as well as all of the lullabyes, intuitative puzzles and unique artwork. The story of the game is that your parents are arguing on your birthday as your mum is preventing your dad from seeing you. As your imagination takes you into another world and images in your head become real the game becomes truly exciting. I really like the drag-drop objects in the game and the achivements you get for interacting with them, and I am a fan of the music. The scares are also really good and will have you staying in a corner with a shiver of excitement. As for the bad things, I think the only thing they really need to do is release more free content. So in conclusion I definately reccomend this game to people who like psychological and Indie related games.			"

												Among the Sleep. A horror from 2 years old perspective. Sounds rather interesting, don't you agree? I was waiting for the game since the start of the Kickstarter campaign. And to my embitterment, the game has disappointed me.First of all - this game is supposed to be a horror. While the game has that uncomfortable atmosphere, it failed to scare me even once (and I'm rather easy to scare off). Sudden loud noises (and many sounds like rustle, sound of something being scraped etc.)   lightning pop-ups, ""monsters"", which look like they were taken from a kid's cartoon - they are not scary for a grown-up. I would understand if the game was positioned as horror for kids, but it wasn't.Second - graphics. The design of the game is well made. Everything looks good  and not out of order, like a child would've seen (big scary coats in the dark closet, big furniture and other stuff like that). The only con is glitchy textures - they tended to disappear on my PC. Audio. Except sudden loud noises, music is very well made. It's very atmospheric and goes well with the game. Gameplay. The game is very straight - the objective of the game is to collect ""memories"" and find your mom. While doing so, you will face various obstacles (from closed doors, on which you can not reach the door knob and need to place a chair and got on it first to closed doors where you would need a key). When you need to reach high places, you will need to climb on them  using drawers, chairs and other thing. It's fun, but repetitive. The great thing is the message that the story holds (review  is spoiler free, so I'll just note that).One thing has bothered me - why a two year old child can push very heavy objects, throwing some of them  at a distance of two meters, climbing without taking a break like a professional athlete? Big chairs, tires - two year old doesn't have that amount strength. The game was promised to last for at least 3 hours, but I finished it in 90 minutes. It's really short for the money it costs. 20€ (18 with discount) is TOO much. You can buy it for 5, but not 20 Euro.So, in the end:Pros:+ Music+ Atmosphere-+ Graphics (+- because of glitchy textures)+ StoryCons:- The non-existent horror part- Repetitive gameplay- Baby has super strength- Very short- OverpricedConclusion: If you want to play this game, wait for big sale or you'll just overpay like I did. 5/10			"

												I....LOVED...THIS...GAME..IT IS LIKE AMNESIA BUT BETTER! I love amnesia because of one thing...sanity meter, when you stand in the dark for too long you start seeing things, but you know there is going to be a monster when you are picking something up when you are allready in a convenient hiding spot and I am quite bothered by that...but in this game you have to find them but sometimes even the hiding spots scare you, and for that, I thank the creaters, I only have one problem, this game is victim to a lot of games I play these days:Length, This game was AMAZING but so little game time. but thats pretty much the only flaw, maybe they could fix that by letting people make costom stories like in amnesia, I just hope there will be another Among The Sleep where like  when you are in the dad's house the umbrella monster makes a return and it turns out to be a robber...or the mom comes to get you or something they can hammer out the details, they are the creators, thats what they are for.

												Amazing and brillaint it's a short two hour game that really puts being a toddler wandering in a house into perspective. It made me feal as helpless as a child and made me scream twice wich I don't commanly do. This game is worth the money because it's cheaper and has a better plot than most movies. pros: master peice great attention to detail.cons: Price to timeoverall: buy this game for a breif and refreshing gameplay expeirence.

												The story is really solid and compelling, the pacing basically perfect, and the tension/horror is top notch. The environments are fairly linear but for the most part you don't really feel it - they're desined to make you think you're not really on a set path, and it works. Everything is designed to make you feel helpless and a little confused (just like real children ;) ). The only detraction is some of the physics can be a bit iffy, so it breaks the awesome atmosphere and immersion of the game. Between 2-4 hours of gameplay (depending on exploration and how tricky you find 1 or 2 of the puzzles). It was worth the price on sale ($15) for me, ymmv.			"

												This isn't a game you play on a laptop while hanging out with friends.  This isn't a game you play while listening to your iTunes playlist in the middle of the afternoon.  This game can only be played late at night, in the dark, with the only sound coming from your computer speakers.  When you do, you will lose yourself in the mind of our main character, a two-year-old, as he tries to make sense of the intimidating world around him.What makes this a ""Horror"" game does not come from gratuitous amounts of gore, or the living dead popping up out of nowhere.  It comes simply from crawling around, taking in the sights and sounds as you try to determine if what you are experiencing is real, a nightmare, or something that adults take for granted that is unsettling/horrifying to a toddler.The game doesn't last long; it only lasts a couple of hours (free DLC on the way)!  But it isn't meant to be a game that occupies your bored mind for hours and hours of replay on end.  It's meant to be an experience, and it was.  I hope you decide to try this experience as well!

												Playing as a toddler added a very good twist to ""Among the Sleep"" and allowed it to be unique compared to other horror games.

												Massively disapointed. Other than the interesting art style, I dont think this game has any depth or fear factor, definately not worth the £15. Saying that, what game is worth £15 when the experience is only 1-2 hours long...The first ten minutes were very imersive, after that it becomes a grind collecting 4 items, which completes the game.There are few encounters that generate any sense of threat and those encounters are short lived. It felt more like a fantasy adventure game.			"

												TLDR: I highly recommend Among The Sleep.  It's beautiful, immersive, thought provoking, and genuinely creepy.  There are few games like Among The Sleep, in fact as of now it may very well be entirely unique.  Not only does it put the player into the unique perspective of a two-year-old, it actually manages to maintain that perspective by never forcing you to do something that the average toddler couldn't.  In fact, it could well be said that this provides a significant portion of the game's difficulty.  While the challenges and puzzles are simple, so too are the actions you can take to complete them.  You can't throw a ball more than a few feet, you can't even reach doorknobs without finding something to stand on.  If something comes out to get you, you'd better believe you can't fight back, in fact you can't even run very far without tripping and falling on your face.  While we're on the subject of running from something that's come out to get you, I should mention something else that isn't nearly common enough among games: the ability to present both sections which are adorable, and sections which are downright chilling.  For instance, the character Teddy ranks very high among the cutest I've ever seen, while the Water Woman is easily one of the creepiest and well made out monsters I've ever seen.Speaking of exceptional design, the entire game fits that category to a T.  The levels are beautifully surreal, often melding bright colors with deep shadow to stunning effect, all the while employing an excellent soundtrack with plenty of auditory cues to help the player along.  The voice acting is superb; it's as good as, or better than, most AAA titles.Of course, nothing is perfect, and Among The Sleep is no exception.  There were a few minor glitches, ranging from a small section of wall in a closet which didn't display properly, to a case where my toddler failed to enter a closet and was subsequently caught by one of the beasties.  In all fairness, I'm not entirely sure I was supposed to be able to get in there in the first place.  Regardless, another issue I had was that there were a few times where I was pretty clearly supposed to be listening for the current monster to avoid it, and, well it sounded like it was coming from everywhere at once.  Honestly though, all that is very nitpicky stuff, and I've ignored far more glaring errors in games which had two orders of magnitude more development staff.  By far the most significant flaw is, in my opinion, the length of the game.  I probably took about three and a half hours to get entirely through it, and I spent a good bit of time smelling the proverbial roses along the way.  I'm pretty confident that I could do a speed run in half the time if I tried.  But before we judge it too harshly for its length, let's take a moment to consider that, so long as you take your time to enjoy the game's art and ambiance (and if you don't then I don't know why you're playing it), the price you're paying per unit time-being-entertained is no more than for a trip to the movies.

												Definitely recommended. The great thing about indie studios is that they bring you experiences that are truly different, and Among the Sleep is no exception. No combat, no complicated puzzles, just the experience of how it feels to be a baby and not truly understand the world. It is a sad story, but poignant. It is a little on the short side however, and some of the level design is a little more odd than scary. But there are some very tense moments that make the experience worthwhile. A big plus as well is that it is a horror game without gore or demonism, so if those things typically put you off about this genre don't worry, you won't find them here.			"

												Good storytelling but predictable and ruined by the bear.I wouldn't recommend this game except for the way it handled the storytelling.  Even though I figured out everything by the second painting, I felt it did a good job getting the whole feel across from a young child's perspective.The game isn't really scary, although it conveys the same sort of childhood 'spookiness' that a dark house and strange sounds bring.  That is it's greatest strength, conveying a nightmare from a child's perspective -- full of strange places and monsters.  This emersion is then quickly ruined by the addition of the damn teddy bear pulled out of some children's show who you HAVE to take with you and who ruins everything.It controlls well, looks good, and conveys a feeling of helplessness that a two-year old child would have along with the potential havoc and trouble a two-year old can get into.  At least, until the bear opens his stupid mouth again.I can't state this enough, but the bear ruins the whole experience by talking.  Listening to him suffer in the washing machine or trying to hang on to you is one thing; I hated him from the get-go but even I felt bad for him at those points.  If they cut out his dialogue and just left him emotion he would have been an excellent companion, but as implemented he screams ""HELLO YOU ARE IN A GAME WITH TALKING BEAR WHO POINTS OUT THE OBVIOUS"".The game is short, and it would have been a nice bit of art if everyone would learn to shut up.  As is, I think some people will enjoy it a lot and ultimately what it does well it does well enough that I can forgive the rest.  This game is NOT for you if:1. You are immune to childhood fears2. You want a long game (I've logged 3 hrs and that includes taking the time to write swears in blocks)3. You want a scary game (unless you are very vulnerable to childhood fears, in which case this is for you)4. You hate physics puzzlesThis game IS for you if:1. You are vulnerable to childhood fears and like being haunted by them.2. You enjoyed the demo (despite how badly the bear ruins the experirence)3. You like 'artistic' game experiences and an interactive way of telling a story.I'm personally in the middle, and would have recommended this stronger if the bear was mostly mute as well.			"

												The horror feeling was nicely done, not only from a toddler's perspective was it scary. The blurry screen and the shaking and wow the sounds was really haunting. It was really well done.Of course since the game is basically you playing a two-year old there is of course a limit to what you can do. It's not an all-out horror story, it's a little kid being scared and altohugh with imagination one can think of quite some scary things, it had to be as close to realistic as possible, which I lvoed and it totally achieved.I loved every level, how the details for example the particular objects scattered throughout an eare, hinted at something that was going on in the real life, but it was invading the toddler's dreams. Also they did an excellent job on giving you a false sense of security/safety in the beginning.Anyway, it was a joy to play. A simple yet invigorating to play through and excellent work on showing how real life things can affect everyone. Loved the twist and loved Teddy! So if you like horror games but are a bit of a scarecat or if you're simply looking for a quick enjoyable experience to pass the time, definitely try this one. It's got it all.			"

												Among the Sleep is not your typical horror game. It is a bit short, but not as short as the 1 hour playtime that I've seen others give. I'd say it's a solid 2-3 hour game, a little more if you explore the environment (which you should). It's got a beautiful, touching story that reveals itself gradually. The environments you travel through are varied and very rich, with minimal texture reusing, which is unusual and refreshing in an indie game. The atmosphere is perfect and creepy, but not chock full of jump scares. The first parts of the game will lull you into a false sense of security. To say anything more would be a spoiler.There's no incentive to replay unless you missed a Steam achievement, and this game isn't really made for replays because the story will have been revealed. However, I think the first experience was solid enough and unique enough to stand on its own. I got it for $15.99 and thought it was well worth the price because it seems much higher quality than other indie games and I am very interested to see what else the developers can do. I highly recommend it!			"

												I'm torn on this game, I really am. The atmosphere and story are very unique. It's also great to see a horror title from the perspective of a young child. Great little indie piece in the vein of The Path (More of a game, however). Should you buy it? This is where I'm torn. At full price I'm just not sure. It's VERY short. If you love indie games like this or are looking for a fun (yet short) jaunt through the eyes of a two year old, I'd get it. You just need to know what you're getting into.People who want legnth and replayability might look elsewhere. I'll update this after they release the DLC.TL;DR - Amazing atmosphere but VERY short.

												Sure, it isn't the longest lasting game ever, ok, it's quiet short. But I'm grateful that the developers took themselves on a topic, which I've never seen, in this way. SPOILER!!!! The ending hits me hard a bit, maybe because I've a 2-years old son on my own....			"

AboutAmong the Sleep is a nice little atmospheric title about a toddler and his fears. While the game itself is really easy and straight I quite liked the visuals and sounds. The main attraction here is not the gameplay but rather the story which unfolds slowly as you progress. I found the metaphors well placed and fitting but never too much. I'm still wondering about the ending of the Prologue DLC and the possible meanings.Pros A nice story with a bunch of metaphors Visually bold environments Great map design (most of the time) A dark, yet familiar atmosphere of childhood fearsCons Feels a bit shallow Way too straightforwardRating7/10 — Good			"

												I finished this game yesterday after about 7.5 hours of gameplay, and have to admit that the entire game had me in awe and at the edge of my seat during every moment I spent on it. There were a lot of emotions felt during my playthrough of this game, the most prominent being fear, to the point where I had to stop my stream for no reason other than needing to compose myself. The ending is unexpected in my opinion and I still found myself pondering it with friends hours after I had finished it. All in all I highly recoomend this game, it brings to light a very real issue, one which I feel does not get enough attention in this day and age.			"

												Experience true horror from a toddler's eyes. Played the whole game in one sitting (took me all night long) with friends. This tells the dark story of a toddler who embarks on a tramatic adventure to find his mom. The environments that you travel through and the use of props will leave the hair standing on your neck. Occasional dreams that you must venture through have horrifying creatures in it that you must avoid at all costs. Learn to hide well, or crawl fast. Your life depends on it. This is a must buy for any horror fans.			"

												Play as a two foot tall baby exploring the world through his eyes. Manipulate objects around you to your advantage; use dressers as staircases and tables and chairs as cover. Collect items along the way as clues and figure out how to get to your mother. Subtle hints of horror in beginning, gets progressively scarier thorughout the game. Lots of tension and jump scares, I love it! Also, I recommend to play with a good pair of headsets to get the full effect of the horror! Sound effects/details are great, from creaks of wooden floors to distant footsteps. Highly recommend!			"

												I just finished my first play through. It took a couple of months to finish because I played a few minutes at a time, but it took me about an hour to finish the game.I loved the experience. I'm a mom of a 2-year-old, which is why I bought the game in the first place. The story is heartbreaking and most of what's creepy about this comes from the fact that this is a neglected child. Can't get much worse than that :(That said, I'm not an expert on child psychology, but it's funny, and I say this as a mom, how accurate the game is when it comes to being a toddler. They do climb on chairs and drawers and do dangerous things without considering what could go wrong. The mechanics are totally plausible.It's very clear that the world and the events are how a very young, abused child sees them: distorted. This is also why the game is so scary, you kinda go through the house looking for your mommy but at the same time know that if you make a mistake (e.g. break a bottle), you'll regret it. Fear of someone you love is just terrible, especially if you're so vulnerable, and this game does a great job of getting you in that state of mind. This game has a great story and it makes you think about childhood, especially as a parent!			"

												Good little horror game if a bit short. I loved playing from the perspective of a 2 year old, very different and easily unsettling when you can't do much more than walk/crawl/hug your teddy through the enviroment. Nice visuals, atmosphere and story.My only gripe is some kind of bug with the achievements. I unlocked none, not even the game completion achievement once I'd finished the game. Tried to unlock an easy one at the start of the game (checked a few walkthroughs to make sure I was doing it right) but to no avail... Reading through the discussions, achievements seem to be hit and miss but I can't find anyone else who have unlocked none at all.That being said, I do recommend people have a go at this. It's a nice horror game with a different idea.			"

												Among the Sleep really surprised me!  It was much scarier than I anticipated and I found the story to be intelligently weaved into the gameplay.  The setting, the atmosphere, the controls – all of it fits together perfectly to achieve the mythical “Immersive” factor that so many games fall short of. Typical scare tactics are utilized to keep you in suspense; but there is also a more personalized fear that comes from being able to connect your own childhood fears to the obstacles that the child must overcome.  Entertainment value aside, Among the Sleep affords you the opportunity to face some of those latent fears from early development and gives parents a better perspective of what their child may be suffering through.

												I've heard a lot of complaints about how this game isn't scary, or that it's too short for the price you're paying, but I have to say I loved this game. The price is understandable since it is the first full game krillbite has put out and if it really bothers you that much pick it up on a sale it goes for half the cost. The atsmosphere is really a lot more important than the horror itself I feel like and it does nail that down pretty solidly. One of my favorite things about this game is how accurately it captures playing as a two year old. The movements, the perspective on reality, the fact that your teddy bear can walk and talk and you don't even consider questioning it, all that together just made for a really solid immersive experience. I really enjoyed this game quite a bit and I'm looking forward to seeing what krillbite will come out with in the future.			"

												If nothing else then this is a pretty interesting game.  The last time I can remember playing as an infant was in the beginning of Fallout 3.  The game seems to be about the atmosphere, environment, and getting through a spooky situation as a scared infant carrying a teddy bear (which functions as a flashlight when hugged).  I didn't find the entertainment being so much in the actual gameplay as trying to interpret what this child is seeing into what the real situation was supposed to be.  The downside of this game is that puzzle solving and entertaining gameplay is at a minimum and the game itself should take at most three hours to finish and if you push it then you could probably finish in one or two hours.  I would advise if you have any interest in this game put it on your wishlist and pick it up when it goes on a holiday sale.			"

												I have played a lot of horror games. Some excellent, and a lot of not so excellents : there's a ton of ""oh look ! Amnesia is scary because you can't defend against the monster you must hide and run away ! MAGIC INGREDIENT TO SCARE !!!!"" games that definitly didn't understand that there's more than pop monster and run. So when one of the indie horror game community appear to be different, all I can do is recommend it.Among the sleep brings a real great atmosphere of dreams and nightmares, Alice in Wonderlands type, showing a coherent view of a house at night from a 2 years old child who just want her mother back. Everything seems higher, noise louder, cracking sounds like growling. That's a great job indeed, the gameplay fitting perfectly to this 2 year old.Graphics and animation are quite decent, sometimes really good, the voice acting is great, and the story simple but effective.There's two bad point to the game : it's too short, which lead to the second bad points, it's a bit expensive for what it offers.But I'm not hiding my pleasure, I'm glad I bought it. If you feel like supporting the team, buy it, otherwise, you might want to wait for a steam reduction. But this is a game you need if you like scary and dark style.			"

												Among the Sleep is a great short horror game. Even though I didn't find it too scary, I found the atmosphere to be very tense and enjoyed it all the same. The game is original in the aspect that it is from the perspective of a toddler, which is what grabbed my attention as someone who doesn't play horror games.My main complaint is that the game is seriously short; I completed the game in around 2 hours, which is unnacceptable given its price tag. Wait for this game to go on sale before buying.To see my gameplay of Among the Sleep, visit https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmI2x3d3CJHNoGU6v2zs4FyMjt9MwIE6V "

												Before I begin, this game is very good. So when i first heard of Among the Sleep and started looking into it, it looked like a cool game with a good concept, one where you play as a child. This idea is brilliantly shown in the actual game with everything being bigger or twisted in some way due to children seeing things differently to adults. In terms of the gameplay, this game is clever. You can alternate between standing and crawling as well as using items such as chairs to reach higher places i.e. a door handle. In terms of what the game does best it is its approach to horror and tension. It doesnt throw out a lot of jump scares with it building up tension using sights and sounds for instance a passing glimpse of some other creature or hearing a door slam. It is nearer the end of the game in which you start to encounter some other creaturs but I am not saying how this is done. Overall this game is clever and very good even though it is only 2-3 hours long. Also the recently released free downloadable content adds a strong 20 minutes of additional gameplay, one which is a prologue to the events of the main game. I would thorougly recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Good game i think that it was way to short, i was able to get all the achievments in one play through. I finished the game in 3 hours.The cost of it is way to much for the small amount of game time recieved. But on the flipside the game had a decent story line and eerie atmosphere so that really helped make up for the cost of it. Other than it being short it was a decent game i would advise people who like horrors to play it. You should really get it on sale because like i said earlier the $20 was fairly steep.			"

												Among the Sleep adapts the horror genre so cleverly to the perspective and skillset of a two-year-old. It was charming, spooky, and incredibly powerful. Great soundtrack, I love the art style. My only issue with the game is that it's pretty short, especially for the pricetag. But I enjoyed it immensely.			"

												A well made an atmospheric game, with a really fresh perspective on first person horror - but quite short.I clocked it in about 2 and a half hours (had it alt+tabbed while I tended to my actual toddler).Lavishly designed in a really vibrant and alarming style, and controls that are really clever.Not sure it's worth a $20 price point, but on sale it was perfect.

												Assuming the role of a todder on their second birthday, players of Among the Sleep go on a dark, atmospheric journey that expertly plays on childhood fears and anxieties to create an immersive, if uneven, experience. After being put to bed by their mother, the player interacts with their new birthday present: Teddy the teddy bear. Teddy guides the player out of the bright, warm bedroom and into a dark, forbidding world. Stuck in this world away from their mother, the player must explore the dark environments and solve puzzles to recieve items which represent fond memories of their mother. The player explores the world by slowly walking through the environments or by crawling, which is much faster. The player is able to climb over obstacles and interact with many objects in the world. In dark areas, the player can hold Teddy tight, making the toddler feel more confident and lighting the way. The design is minimalistic and encourages the player to immerse themselves in the toddler's world. The environments are distorted perceptions of a normal household. The dark tone makes things appear more menacing than they would normally, adding to the tense atmosphere. In several environments, a dark presence hunts the player, forcing them to hide. The gameplay in these sections feel similar to Slender: The Arrivial but requires the player to hide, rather than run away, adding to the tension.Among the Sleep is short but still feels repetitive toward the end. The final section is satisfying enough to warrant a playthrough and the game as a whole delievers a well crafted psychological experience.			"

												The story is sort of interesting if not for the absolutely plodding pacing.  I realize they wanted to set an atmosphere but GODDAMMIT BABY WHY WONT YOU MOVE FASTER.  Also the physics based stuff sucks and was dull to do.  The game shows some jank at times, betraying that it was a kickstarter.  The MAJOR PLOT TWIST I kind of guessed halfway through.  Interesting game, but not really worth it in the long run.			"

												At first glance, the game seems a little pricey for the hours logged. But, one thing that is worth noting is that the game has very little down time. The pacing is good and the game alterantes primarily between suspence and intensity. Had it been longer, it would have worn out its charm. And had it been less expensive... Well, everyone has to make a living, and I'm sure a lot of work went the game. It's very polished and the visuals and sound are fantastic, so I don't feel ripped off. The two hours (ish... I left it paused for a little while) I got from the game were as fulfilling as any ""full length"" game, just condensed. I think a lot of people expect more out of games in terms of value, but that doesn't always seem fair. Considering how much you end up paying to see a movie at the theater, or for a a few rounds of drinks at a bar, this game starts to look like a pretty good deal. Overall, no matter how much you think you're getting ripped off, chances are good that a video game is still the best value in terms of hours per dollars spent.			"

												This is a very short game. Around 2 hours. Maybe 2 and a half more if you count the prologue. Aside that, this game puts you in the body of a two year old. You and your companion ""teddy bear"" venture out through your house and other worlds. There are a few puzzles that are not really difficult and there is a central bad guy that keeps re-appearing. The game has a few jump scares here and there but that is not what made me like it. The atmosphere and music are unrivaled. The game keeps you in suspense the whole time and you never know if something is going to pop out or creep up on you. That is the feeling the music and atmosphere set. The scenery is beautiful. You can interact with pretty much everything around you. I just wish it was a little longer. Also.....that twist in the end.			"

												After playing around half through i had a brake and decided not to recommend this game becouse i couldn't relate to the kid, didn't feel scared and the game were pretty slow paste. But after the brake the second half got to me. This game is beautiful both for the eye and the ear. I didn't feel any jumpscares, but i started sweating at a couple of scenes there. The second half saved this game for me, and if you decide to try it. Play it without any sounds or people around you. Try play through the whole thing in as few sessions as possible becouse the early scenes are setting your mood and preparing your brain for the next, any try to live into it. It's not a very long game, the puzzle design issn't very good and i wish the drawings around could have been collectibles, buy this game is pretty good art and any game interested should have a play-through at some point.

												This was a great game--that is, until it crashed near the end and (painfully) towards the ""big moment"" where we find out the truth to the story. I tried replaying the game and it crashed in the exact same spot. I looked it up, and it turns out many other players have had the same issue. And what's the point of playing a storyline game where you can't find out what happens in the end? Also, thank you (not) to Krillbite who, went I sent them an email about the problem, I not only had to wait two weeks to hear a response but they also simply said to post the issue in a forum. Yes, thank you, very helpful. Not really. So, no, I would NOT reccomend paying $20 for a game with major bugs.**UPDATEI wish I could say that Krillbit has fixed this problem. But it hasn't. Although I couldn't finish the game, I still attempted to play the DLC. This crashed on me as soon as the loading screen was done. So not only can I not finish the game, I can't play a single minute of the DLC as well.Very disappointed in Krillbite for not fixing these issues.			"

												Hmmmm. well...where do i begin. The gameplay is definately unique in it's gendure. If your'e waiting for something to be actually scary; you'll be waiting the whole gameplay. There is nothing scary about his game. Ok! We'll give it a creepy sensation throughout, but until you reach the end game the crepiness ends instantly with the sucky outcome. It leaves you to decide what the creepy actually was. And if you don't get the collectables during the actual gameplay you can't collect them when you go back after the game is over and try to collect them by replaying the chapters that they are in. The game is slow and grundgy. There are bits of pleasure throughout, but it is basically pure muck. And, eventually succumbs itself to a bitter disappointment. Don't expect too much when playing this game. Although, there are good moments...if there were a grading scale from SUCKS-to SUCKED! Then let's just say it's Sucks! If you can get it at a cheap price and you want a unique experience in gameplay, then buy it and play it for something different. If you can only get it at full price, then you just sucked yourself into a black hole of gameplay. In which, you forever hate the ending! I bought this game after watching the trailer thinking that it would be a fun scary game. It just ended up being cute with a sorry outcome. If you want something better, then go buy yourself a pack of gummy bears and crap yourself a rainbow!			"

The game its self is very short (~ 2.5 hours long) but it comes with free DLC that makes the game about 3 hours in total.    The game its self is very smooth, and the controls are nice,, simple and very easy to pick up on.

You need to climb on chairs to reach doors and you often fall over while running because your still learning to walk. you can hide under shelfs and small spaces an adult could never fit to save your self.If your a horror fan and can get this game cheap its well worth it for 2 hours of scares.

												The game delivers on its promise of being a non-violent horror game, seen through the eyes of a toddler. It doesn't have the greatest graphics in the world, but in this fantasy world that's not really necessary either. The only place where it bothers a bit is when the game tries to render humans,. But luckily there's only one (mommy) and we only see her very briefly.The formula revolves around navigating levels and collecting items in order to advance, whilst remaining unseen by the scary evil that roams the world. And let me tell you, when it is near, you feel its presence. This is where the game really distinguishes itself in my opinion: the evil presence is quite scary, and it will make you play it cautious so as to not invoke its wrath. Very well executed.There's little replay value though, and even the extra story in the free DLC was unnecessary in my opinion. It's also a step down from the main storyline if you ask me. It failed to captivate me because of its repetitive formula and unreasonable expectations of wilful suspension of disbelief compared to the main storyline. Then again, nobody forces you to play it, and the main storyline is definitely worth it even if it doesn't have a lot of replay value. For this reason I suggest you may perhaps want to wait for a sale.The game has a free demo, which is not something you see often. I haven't played it, but if you're curious I'd suggest you take it for a spin.			"

												So I bought the game way back for 6€ when it was on sale. I also finished the game within 1.5 hours. So note that this game is a very short one. I am almost sure that I did not see everything, because of those snowy screenshots on the shop site, since I did not come across that scenario - but I played through it and it is pretty much a long corridor you are playing in. Not many options to get lost or explore for yourself like in the Amnesia or Penumbra series.From an asthetic standpoint it is fascinating, since light, colors, voices, sounds, music and so on play together so well. You can immerse yourself in the life of a toddler. I can't say anymore because that would be a spoiler - but play it not just for the asthetics but for the great story as well. You can guess halfway through what the story is gonna be, but it has been implemented just too good.Recommendation from my end - you have to decide wheather the price tag is justified by the short playtime.

												The concept of using a two-year old as the protagonist is obviously ingenious, though somewhat undercut by how you can do stuff that is clearly just not possible for a kid that age - as the game uses a first-person view so we don't see the main character either. At times it feels like pretty much the only indicator that it's a two-year old is that the game makers have told us so. This becomes especially true when the game abandons its initial setting - the home of the kid and its mother - and dives into more surreal territory. The loving home that suddenly becomes haunted and scary works much more efficently than what takes its place a bit into the story.  Also, the graphics feel somewhat generic (with the important exception of the monster, which looks great),However, while Among the sleep is far from perfect, it's still haunting and pulls off its thematic ambitions in a smart and ultimately successful way. And for all the reservations mentioned above, having such an extremly vulnerable main character works wonders for the horror aspect of the game.			"

												The game is surprisingly short (ca. 2-3 hours if you take your timex to explore each and every corner, 1 hour if you are of the fast paced type) but well made and definitely entertaining. The unique approach to play this adventure in the role of a 2-year old child and the beautiful (sometimes scary) dream-like scenes make Among the Sleep stand out from the large amount of story driven adventure games that currently flood the market. However, it could be longer and also more challenging - just because you play a 2-year old does't mean that the challanges also need to be on that level. The ending leaves room for personal interpretation and further discussion - maybe even a part 2?			"

												I heard a lot of good things about this game, and while its not the scariest experience I've had, it's definitely worth checking out. It's a beautiful game that manages to escalate in tension the further along you go (as I feel a good horror game should...). The simplisity of the story and some really good voice acting help enhance this quite a bit and I found myself getting sucked into the world. And the one element that sets this game apart from many others is its dark underlying tone beneath this bright & colorful looking game.My only set backs are that its very short; you could beat this in 2-3 hours if you fly through it. Also, the game machanics can be slightly frustrating as you may hit the occasional hidden wall or struggle to step onto a platform.Rating: 7.5/10Had this game been at least another hour longer, I would easily give it a higher score...

Among the Sleep is a great and immersive experience, but with a few minor problems.Pros Atmospheric soundtrack Great voice acting POV of a toddler creating an immersive experience Lovely graphics Scarry tall tree mommy Realistic movement (you tend to fall if you run for too long, and crawling is faster than walking) Hugging your teddy bear lights a small area and makes you less scaredAnd here come the downfalls...CONS Autosave often fails and there is no way to save manually that I know of. Escaping from scarry mommy is a little bit hit-or-miss in it's difficulty. (You can only hide under something which makes you effectively♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck if there's nothing to hide under.)  "

												I highly recommend this atmospheric game. Not for its gameplay, because it's fairly clunky and the puzzles aren't very challenging. I recommend it because of the story that the game tells. It is a haunting and depressing tale of a toddler and his memories of his mother. Goosebumps guaranteed.			"

												An atmospheric horror game that puts you in the footie pajamas of a toddler. You've just received a cute teddy bear for your birthday that lights up when you squeeze it, and comes to life when your mother's not around. In the middle of the night, you realise that a shadowy monster is stalking you, and with teddy in hand you must locate your missing mother by finding sentimental items connected to your memories of her. As you explore your home, you slowly realise that things are far darker than they seem.Among the Sleep is truly terrifying, mostly due to the POV. Playing as a toddler with what amounts to only a night light, your only defense is to hide from danger under tables, in closets, and beneath bookcases. You can only run away for a short amount of time before falling to the ground and having to crawl, or push yourself back up to your feet. The scenery alone, just being so much larger and daunting, really adds to a feeling of helplessness.While I really enjoyed this game, its price is far too high for how short it actually is. Buy it on sale to enjoy it as much as you can.			"

												I recently finished this game with a friend on the PS4 and the story for this game is really deep.  It has a good amount of suspense that will keep you on your toes throughout the game.  Although there were a couple of slight glitches I noticed in this version, they didn't pose any huge problem.  Compared to the PS4 version, I prefer the mouse and keyboard controls as I found the controller controls kind of confusing, but that might just be me.  Definitely a recommendation for anyone who is looking forward to playing the game.			"

												For me, this game was great! Short but great!!Yes. You play a 2 year old game. Yes... it is scary.. not Amnesia scary... but more like ambient noise scary. One part in particular made scream... i made a mistake. I paid for it. The story is interesting, although there isn't really much of a story... since you are a 2 year old, you really don't know what's going on anyway... the payoff though is hindsight! When I finished the game, I reflected on some of the things I experienced in the game... disturbing. :S And THAT made me really appreciate this game.Time to beat: about 4 hours (main and dlc combined).Controlling: keyboard and mouse... very easy.Glitches: Played really smooth.Motionsickness: yes, actually... but not Half Life bad. Just a bit.The DLC: is a Prologue. Play it after. I feel like the prologue is one of those didn't-make-it-into-the-game kind of deals, so they made a DLC out of it. (30 minutes to complete dlc, but it came free with the game.)Do I recommend this? YES! I do!!			"

												Among the Sleep is a very inventive and imaginative game concept, the main focus is experiencing the world through the imagined perception a 2 year old will create when confronted with something frightening.The game's many subtle references hints at an overarching story beyond what you play, but I won't say anything that may spoil that.Personally I don't really like horror games, the concept never really appealed to me, I can enjoy one but I usually won't go out of my way to play one, this game is a bit different though, it is a horror game but it's not so much an actual threat that's scary, instead it's more of an imagined threat the player experiences from the atmosphere, there are some actual threats from time to time but it's the atmosphere that unerves me a bit more (Yeah, I'm a wimp, I know you're thinking it).In terms of gameplay, I got a good 3-4 hours of gameplay out of this game and its DLC, I really enjoyed what I played but the game really doesn't have much replayability, I got it during a sale for about £4, I don't think the game is worth £10.99, It's a good game, just not THAT good.Anyway, all in all, a very enjoyable experience and well worth your time, I'd say just wait for a sale though.

												This game told an interesting story about a family through the eyes of a toddler. Ultimately the concept and delivery of the story were both good, however this game is really short (can finish the main game and the prologue dlc in under 2 hours). I  definitely would not buy this for $15, maybe if it was under $5, but even then I would only pick it up if there is substantial interest in this game.			"

												Among the Sleep is one interesting horror game. Made by norwegian students as university project, I honestly thought this would be hastily slapped together game with interesteting premise, but underwhelming delivery.Boy was I wrong!So here it goes, and remember TL;DR is always at the bottom. Positives:  1.  Story is kept simple, yet interesting at the same time. You play as a baby exploring this nightmarish realm with help from your toy teddy bear. Prologue chapter does good job introducing characters and game mechanics and the baby perspective is pretty damn interesting since it gives this huge opportunity to run wild with creativity and imagination.To be honest, I can't tell too much about story since I'm afraid of giving anything away, but it is surprisingly serious and excellently crafted. 2.  Gameplay is pretty straight forward. Go/ crawl from A to B solving puzzles and sometimes hiding in closets/ under tables or beds. It's basically a Penumbra/ Amnesia clone but with baby as protagonist. But hey, if it works, don't break it, right? 3.  Levels are pretty linear but still very well made. Every location feels unique, looks both interesting and scary and breathes atmosphere. I have to give credits where credit is due, guys over at Krillbite did amazing job bringing this game to life. 4.  Sounds and music are also pretty damn good. Game relies heavily on creepy sounds to make you feel uneasy and does good job with it. Music is used sparingly but when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan, effect is simpy amazing and terrifying at the same time. When talking about voice work and dialogue, there's not much to it really, since characters don't speak that much, but they are good enough. 5.  Graphics, while not amazing, works just fine. Game is mostly dark, so shadows and lighting effect are only factors that really count, and can make or break it's setting. Thankfully both effects are used very well. Because of this, first level is worse looking one, since graphics engine is clearly not top gen. Animations are nothing special, but they work just fine. 6.  Among the Sleep is very well optimized and runs very smoothly even on my old laptop. I have only 3 negatives and they are:  1.  Game lenght. I managed to run through this game in 4+ hours (and I was exploring almost every corner). Sure it's story is very well made, sure it's atmosphere is amazing, sure the ending is  sorry, you need to experience it yourself and draw your own conclusion  but when I got there, I just wanted more. I understand that developers went 'quality over quantity' route and it's all well and good, but the world they created was so darn good, I really wanted more. 2.  This game is extremely easy. I wish there was some kind of difficulty select or something to make this game more challenging because (in my opinion, it's way too easy otherwise). 3.  Game is also kinda unfinished. As of moment of writing Chapter 5 is missing from the game, and while developers promised to release it soon, it's still nowhere to be found. Chapter 6 ironically is the games ending so what Chapter 5 was all about, I can only guess.At some point devs released one dlc chapter. While it was free, short and sweet, it was just an extra chapter and not Chapter 5. Hopefully it will be released one day but untill now, it's sad and dissappointing. TL;DR and/or conlusion: I really liked this game. It surprised me. Sure there are flaws and I wish it was longer, but other than that I'm extremely happy with this purchase.As far as the horror games goes, it's probably not the best or most scariest one, but it's story and setting is a damn good one. I only hope devs will release Chapter 5 someday in the future and I will be on the lookout for their next game in the future.			"

												What a game!  I'm not hugely experienced with horror as a genre, but I knew as soon as I heard about this game that it would appeal to me.  The perspective of a toddler as your character is very unique, and it adds a lot more to the game itself.  At times, the game can be completely sweet and innocent, and other times perfectly terrifying.  You mentally put yourself in the position of the toddler as well.  Everything is huge and scary/intimidating to you, having Teddy around makes you feel safe with his voice and personality, and when the going gets rough you just want your mommy.  And being a toddler makes the horror moments all the more terrifying because you are so helpless; you can't fight your way out of a situation.  All in all, the game captures playful innocence, some interesting puzzles/exploration, truly stressful horror and stealth play, and an ending that likely sends people right to discussion forums (seriously, some other opinions on that would be nice ^^;).  It may be very short (I finished in a little more than 3 hours), but it's an unforgettable ride that may merit a diaper change!  8/10			"

												If you want to enjoy this game fully you better don't read about it. I got the plot spoiled after waiting for it since it was on development but I still enjoyed it... not the same experience I guess.You are a baby that one night gets into what it seems a nightmare. Nothing beyond reality as you will find out later. You will have to run away from a monster looking for you and try to find your mother going through places that would scare not just kids.There are so few jumpscares. When you are in danger you will be warned so you better run and hide. The ""death"" animation can be a bit disturbing but it is not a jumpscare I guess since you will see it coming.One of the things I most like is looking down and seeing your body. It's a little detail but it helps with inmersion. And that feeling of being a scared kid is there... you can see harmless things as monsters when there is nothing there: getting scared by a hanged coat, ha!Once you know what is going on it is nice to play it again to see things you might have missed and that you will understand then.The only bad thing is you need a pretty good computer to play it with decent quality and framerate. If you have a so good one it will be so beautiful.			"

												I love the unique perspective of this game; it plays through the eyes of a yound child. I love how it incorporates the escape menu as part of the story as well, very well thought out! The lanuage on books shown through the eyes of the child is incomprehensible and in an alien language. This is great, since infants don't understand written words as well.

												While it's certainly not a mind-blowing experience, Among the Sleep has a decent story and some neat little features to play with. The game is pretty glitchy at some points with regards to items clipping through the floor, though none of it actually affected my progress. The end of the game was sudden and a little lackluster, but not what I would consider bad. Not much replay value but if you can catch it on sale, it'd be worth the hour or two it takes to play the game.			"

												What a great concept for a game, a horror story experienced through the eyes of a toddler. The story was told really well and the gameplay felt good, a mixture of puzzlesolving, climbing and hiding. There were some terrifying moments and the unpredictable ending hit me hard in the feels but it was a joy to play through. I loved Teddy and to be honest I don't know what I would have done without having him to hug all the time!Great game, highly recommend.			"

												With modern horror gaming's continual focus on rendering players defenceless to conjure up feelings of fear, playing as a toddler was an inevitable outcome born of this trend, and Krillbite do an adequate job of conveying that helplessness. Roger L. Jackson delivers a great performance as Teddy, who acts as a comforting presence throughout the entire game. Its ridiculously brief duration and general lack of scares are the considerably largest drawbacks that prevent the title from being a standout of the genre.Worth trying.6/10			"

												First -- play as a toddler, incredible ideaI don't want to spoil the rest but let's just say that the story as it is, is very good. But, it's something that relies on not being spoiled.As a 'game' this thing is terrible, there's no fun, no play -- but that's the thing, we now make things that are technically video games that aren't, well, games. Interactive experiences or stories, walking sims, adventure games -- whatever you call them, the key is story-driven content (this includes the setting, atmosphere, and POV). It didn't get good for me until very near the end, but it was easily worth the price of admittion jsut for that -- because it shaped my feelings of the entire experience up to that point, gave context to small details that didn't have an understood meaning ebfore then -- again, it ends on a really excellent note. A great way to spend a couple of hours, very touching.			"

												If you ever wanted to play a game where you get to be a scared toddler looking at the world from a baby's vivid imagination, then this is the game for you.Essentially this is another one of those walking simulatory Amnesia style games. Atmospheric, lots of creepy  noises  and monsters who make screeching sounds and get all blurry when you look at them. The game has received a poor PC port with numerous bugs and control issues, so beware. It is also quite short, about 2-3 hours depending on how often you screw up and have to restart at a checkpoint. My biggest enemy was the pits, so I failed a lot.While I was prepared to give this game a thumbs down for its numerous issues and copypasted Amnesia style scares, the ending elevates this game to something much better. It just made the game come together in a big way and since you can pick it up for next to nothing at a steam sale then I say go for it. Just power through the annoying moments and the hammy gameplay and you'll find a very satisfying ending to tie it all together.			"

												I was a backer of this game on Kickstarter because I loved the concept, and it certainly didn't disappoint when I finally got my hands on it. I don't usually play 'horror' games, and I'm not even sure I'd class this as one, although there were certainly a few moments that utterly terrified me, probably more so than any other game I've played. I'd recently played 'Outlast' which I also enjoyed despite being a 'horror' game, but I think the main difference with the scares in Among the Sleep is that they are unexpected, whereas a game like 'Outlast' is quite tense the whole way through.The way the story unfolds throughout the game through clues and hints makes you pay close attention to what's going on around you without getting in the way of the game itself. However, the only shortfall of the game is that I don't think the story resolves itself very effectively, which was disappointing as I'd been playing close attention to all the clues to work out what was going on throughout the game.There have been several updated to the game since I last played it, so I might have to give it another go.

												Among the sleep is a first person game where the player character is a baby. You play as a small child and along with your trusty Teddy Bear side kick you must search for your mother, solve puzzles, and get through the horrors present in your own imagination. It is a curious and frightful nightmare for the toddler. The narrative goes to some nightmarish places, but it ends all too abruptly, and technical issues apply the sleeping cap to an already mixed release. The story behind the game is a well-written script and the ending is just a little heart warming. One problem the player might have is the control part. If the player does not have a mouse, it would be a hard for them to get through the game. The player would use the trackpad, but it would take some time to move things around and open doors.			"

												Among the Sleep won't take you very long to complete, but the time you do spend on it will be worth it. It's spooky and disturbing with a puzzles thrown into the mix. (Don't worry, even a baby could complete them). The story becomes somewhat predictable as you progress, but collecting the clues is surprisingly fulfilling. Controlling a helpless baby makes the game that much more uncomfortable, but in a good way, not annoyingly so as I expected. It's a solid game if you're into psychological horror, and probably even if you aren't. When I first wrote the review it was $20 and now it's $15, but I wouldn't recommend paying that much if you can avoid it due to how short the story is. I snagged it on sale for 5 or 10 bucks when it came out. Tip: Don't turn your gamma too far down. If it's too dark it goes from immersive to just annoyingly difficult. Plus, the art style is cool and you probably want to be able to see it.			"

												Distinctive and surreal, overall a very well put together game. Just finished my second playthrough of it and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time.With a unique interaction style in the world, as an infant you must go through battling real life objects/puzzles and those of a small childs imagination. The deeper you fall into this dream land the more unhinged your perception becomes. Simple rooms or areas become scary labyrinths of the unknown. Although this isn't the point of the game, the story is infact quite sad with a somewhat reassuring ending.I don't want to talk about it to much, you'll just have to play it to see what I mean.			"

												*SPOILERS DUH*Among the Sleep is a horror experience trauma that gives a perspective of a young toddler going through an adventure with an imaginary talking teddy bear to find the child's lost depressed alcoholic mother. The visuals and effects the developers interpret on how the gamers witness the young child's point of view of the environment surroundings, figures/toys, and the monsters are all a horrifying imagination. Overall, the game has a very unique idea, an original concept, and a wonderful short storytelling experience, but the only downfall is wanting more out of the game. Personally I wanted a little bit more out of the game, more to the story, perhaps what happens next after the father takes the child. Will the mother ever come back? Will she regain strength and fix her issues with alcoholic? Questions left me to wondering on what could happen next. Sequel or without, I enjoyed the overall premence of the game and will give my rating 4/5 stars.			"

												 The game features a good story overall, with a lot of deep and hidden things that have to be put together, as it is not spelled out to the toddler protagonist. Loved figuring out the child's issues and real problems behind this Alice in Wonderland-type exploration. The controls and mechanics are a little strange. They make sense, with them being a toddler, but the game features a slow waddle in the up-right standing position and a faster crawl. I found myself almost bugging out the game switching back and forth too quickly so I could move around at a faster pace. If you just slow down the animations get laggy, but as long as you let yourself fall into the game this shouldn't be an issue for you. Other than that has pretty good overall controls and mechanics. In closing, I definitely enjoyed Among the Sleep and would recommend it to anyone to give a try to, but good game overall. "

												Among the Sleep is one interesting game. The story was really good, the graphics were awesome for a short indie game, and the rush when playing the game is indescribable. Something I do want to say out there is that this game is not motion sickness friendly, so if you do get motion sickness easily do not play this game. The cinematography was in first person which means everything you do or interact with is really close which was a problem with my laptop because I had no mouse just a touch pad. This was extremely annoying as I had to move the screen first then I could proceed to go on forward. It does make me sick playing the game for more than 10 minutes as you are required to move the camera often.  Other than that the game play was smooth and easy to follow, the monsters in the game will scare the crap out of you.			"

												Among the Sleep is a great game to play. The game is not the best, but it is also not the worst. For those who are motion sick I would not recommend this game and for those who wear glasses too because after awhile more like ten minutes of playing you will start getting dizzy and you will feel nauseous. I also do not recommend this to inpatient people because this game is to long in my opinion and it gets frustrating. The game creates this character that is not revealed to the player until the end, so that is one of the reasons why to play the game because who wouldn’t want to know who this mysterious character is. The game is more of a mystery game then a horror game, but n certain parts of the game is a bit frightening because you start to encounter different characters and they pop out unexpectedly. Overall, the video game Among the Sleep is a great game to play, but it gets on your nerves after awhile of playing it.			"

												If you want to enjoy this game fully you better don't read about it. I got the plot spoiled after waiting for it since it was on development but I still enjoyed it... not the same experience I guess.You are a baby that one night gets into what it seems a nightmare. Nothing beyond reality as you will find out later. You will have to run away from a monster looking for you and try to find your mother going through places that would scare not just kids.There are so few jumpscares. When you are in danger you will be warned so you better run and hide. The ""death"" animation can be a bit disturbing but it is not a jumpscare I guess since you will see it coming.One of the things I most like is looking down and seeing your body. It's a little detail but it helps with inmersion. And that feeling of being a scared kid is there... you can see harmless things as monsters when there is nothing there: getting scared by a hanged coat, ha!Once you know what is going on it is nice to play it again to see things you might have missed and that you will understand then.The only bad thing is you need a pretty good computer to play it with decent quality and framerate. If you have a so good one it will be so beautiful.			"

												Among the Sleep is one interesting horror game. Made by norwegian students as university project, I honestly thought this would be hastily slapped together game with interesteting premise, but underwhelming delivery.Boy was I wrong!So here it goes, and remember TL;DR is always at the bottom. Positives:  1.  Story is kept simple, yet interesting at the same time. You play as a baby exploring this nightmarish realm with help from your toy teddy bear. Prologue chapter does good job introducing characters and game mechanics and the baby perspective is pretty damn interesting since it gives this huge opportunity to run wild with creativity and imagination.To be honest, I can't tell too much about story since I'm afraid of giving anything away, but it is surprisingly serious and excellently crafted. 2.  Gameplay is pretty straight forward. Go/ crawl from A to B solving puzzles and sometimes hiding in closets/ under tables or beds. It's basically a Penumbra/ Amnesia clone but with baby as protagonist. But hey, if it works, don't break it, right? 3.  Levels are pretty linear but still very well made. Every location feels unique, looks both interesting and scary and breathes atmosphere. I have to give credits where credit is due, guys over at Krillbite did amazing job bringing this game to life. 4.  Sounds and music are also pretty damn good. Game relies heavily on creepy sounds to make you feel uneasy and does good job with it. Music is used sparingly but when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan, effect is simpy amazing and terrifying at the same time. When talking about voice work and dialogue, there's not much to it really, since characters don't speak that much, but they are good enough. 5.  Graphics, while not amazing, works just fine. Game is mostly dark, so shadows and lighting effect are only factors that really count, and can make or break it's setting. Thankfully both effects are used very well. Because of this, first level is worse looking one, since graphics engine is clearly not top gen. Animations are nothing special, but they work just fine. 6.  Among the Sleep is very well optimized and runs very smoothly even on my old laptop. I have only 3 negatives and they are:  1.  Game lenght. I managed to run through this game in 4+ hours (and I was exploring almost every corner). Sure it's story is very well made, sure it's atmosphere is amazing, sure the ending is  sorry, you need to experience it yourself and draw your own conclusion  but when I got there, I just wanted more. I understand that developers went 'quality over quantity' route and it's all well and good, but the world they created was so darn good, I really wanted more. 2.  This game is extremely easy. I wish there was some kind of difficulty select or something to make this game more challenging because (in my opinion, it's way too easy otherwise). 3.  Game is also kinda unfinished. As of moment of writing Chapter 5 is missing from the game, and while developers promised to release it soon, it's still nowhere to be found. Chapter 6 ironically is the games ending so what Chapter 5 was all about, I can only guess.At some point devs released one dlc chapter. While it was free, short and sweet, it was just an extra chapter and not Chapter 5. Hopefully it will be released one day but untill now, it's sad and dissappointing. TL;DR and/or conlusion: I really liked this game. It surprised me. Sure there are flaws and I wish it was longer, but other than that I'm extremely happy with this purchase.As far as the horror games goes, it's probably not the best or most scariest one, but it's story and setting is a damn good one. I only hope devs will release Chapter 5 someday in the future and I will be on the lookout for their next game in the future.			"

												I think Among the Sleep is amazing, and I've already had ideas about future games. .You should create a game where the main character is older and continue the end of Prologue.He should get married in the same house, where the character's 2nd birthday was held, (not the Prologue house).His daughter/son should continue a new story (It's just some ideas. You don't have to use mine!).Why is his mom a monster? There was a story in the main game where your grandma is a monster, but the main character's mom? How?Those are my main ideas. If you are not interested, don't use them. If you are, think about it. You don't HAVE to use them, my ideas are JUST ideas.			"

												I heard a lot of good things about this game, and while its not the scariest experience I've had, it's definitely worth checking out. It's a beautiful game that manages to escalate in tension the further along you go (as I feel a good horror game should...). The simplisity of the story and some really good voice acting help enhance this quite a bit and I found myself getting sucked into the world. And the one element that sets this game apart from many others is its dark underlying tone beneath this bright & colorful looking game.My only set backs are that its very short; you could beat this in 2-3 hours if you fly through it. Also, the game machanics can be slightly frustrating as you may hit the occasional hidden wall or struggle to step onto a platform.Rating: 7.5/10Had this game been at least another hour longer, I would easily give it a higher score...

												This is a pretty unique game with very interesting aspect. You play as a Toddler trying to find out what happened to your missing mother as Supernatural forces do their best to scare you and interfere in your journey. The idea behind this game was refreshing and in certain parts of the game it's very atmospheric and tension driven. Quite a few jumpscares in this, but it was generally refreshing to play. I enjoyed this game. Although some things were a little buggy. No controller support, Fake walls which you can glitch outside the map, slow animations that jump if used too quickly and some other notable ones. However, if you are able to look past all of that, I think the game is worth the price tag.			"

The sound effects are one of the best parts about this game, and it genuinely spooked me and gave me a few scares (which don't come easily to me in these games). It had me running (or rather, crawling) under tables to hide from noises frequently for no reason other than some noise scaring the pants off me.What a unique idea for a game! Really enjoyed it.			"

												I like watching gameplays of this game. I absolutely love the concept of the game, that you are a child, roaming around. Unfortunately, even though I love the gameplay and everything, I am unable to play it as it causes motion sickness for me. I'm sad, but still would recommend the game to other people.			"

Packed full of surreal and, frankly, terrifying obstacles, Among the Sleep is an extremely original game with a very powerful ending. I would be a little bummed-out that it was so short considering I bought it at full price, about $15, BUT! It was quite good, even taking that into account.			"

												Among the Sleep is an excellent game, especially for people who don't like horror games in general. The terror is more the kind that you let yourself sink into - sliding into the small hiding places that only you, as a toddler, can fit inside; rushing to climb on top of small boxes to save yourself from a fairy-tale monster; exploring the nooks and crannies of the dreamscapes you find yourself inside; feeling the discomfiture of a world that isn't quite right.The game is only a couple hours long and the story unfolds at a leisurely pace across it, but the world has a lot of very interesting details if you look for them, the simple puzzles do a good job of building tension, and the level design does a very good job of leading your forward and keeping you on edge. I definitely recommend it.			"

												This game is great!From the very start it manages to captivate you with its unique approach and perspective to a horror game. The story is mysterious and very sad at the end seeing how a child might perceive those events. I had a lot of fun playing this and it was still spooky without any gore or death. They give you a free DLC for another chapter but the game was far too short! Completed the entire game in under 4 hours. Hopefully a sequel is in development. This will be a great pickup on a sale, for $20 it might be iffy in terms of the amount of content but that content is top notch.			"

												Among the Sleep is certainly an inturesting game. More of an ""experiance"" than an actual ""video game"". Very light pzzles and enemy interaction. More so just sort of walking from point A to point B. But I do really enjoy the concept and subtle story of a difficult time through the eyes of a two year old. I think I actually enjoyed the DLC more then the main game; but both are worth a shot if your looking for something different from the norm. About 3 hours long including the DLC; Among the Sleep is a worthwhile journey. 6 out of 10.			"

I nearly finished it ages ago and then stopped playing (got sidetracked with other games) and then I played it again from the beginning (the whole game takes about 3.5 hours to finish). The makers upped the scary factor with a lot more ambient sounds that added suspense.  The ""memories"" were also altered and made a lot more sense so they were really thinking with the updates. Thanks so much guys! You've made a well done game that made me wet myself more than once.			"

												8/10An unique horror experience that puts you in the small shoes of a 3-years old child, trying to survive the horrors of the dark.The principle is the same as many survival horror games - survive and don't get caught, while you find items and complete puzzles to progress. But right as you start the game and try out the controls, you see how different it feels, since you're in the role of someone incredibly young rather than a fully grown adult. The character moves faster when crawling, but you need to stand up to reach certain things or climb up a ledge. All items used throughout the game are related to toys a young child would have - toy keys, shapes to fit inside a shape mold (squares, triangles, etc), among others.I won't spoil the story, but I'll say it's certainly interesting and the Prologue (free DLC) expands on it, explaining the events before the main game.Highly recommended.

												Just finished the game, and now I am playing through it again with the commentary track. Though this is not the scariest of games, it doesn't try to be. The only word I can describe it is... Nostalgic. We were all children once, and we can all relate with the child in this story on some level. This is the truly creepiest part of this game; not the cliches (which there are very few), but the realism and the imagination behind it. It exceptionally captures the child-like imagination that we go the rest of our lives trying to reobtain. This beautiful and mysterious game will have you remembering the darkest parts of your childhood in the most creative of ways. It is worth twice the amount, simply from the feeling you have after you complete it. Imagine Alice: Madness Returns meets Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and then you will only have a glimpse of the beauty and naive surrealism that is this game.			"

I did have a few technical issues, I had constant framerate drops and stutters and a few random crashes. With an i7 6800k, GTX 1080 SLI (disabled for this one) and 16 GB of fast RAM it was unexpected, it should run like butter but that was not the case. However it was not something that bothered me too much, I still had fun playing. The puzzles are too easy but the story and atmosphere made up for it. All in all I would give it a 7/10.			"

												For how short the story is, you may want to contemplate for a bit if you want to spend around $20 for this game. I would recommend just waiting for the Steam Summer Sale as it'll knock the price down a LOT. I find that this game is good for those who don't do too well with scary/horror games because the level of creepiness/tension is pretty moderate. There are rarely any popups (in a sense, none) and the whole ""horror"" feel to this game is based upon the child's incredibly vivid imagination. I personally enjoyed it a lot, mainly because of how cute it was to see something like a door, so big compared to how I would see it in my everyday life. If at any point, the game just seems too creepy to continue, just remember that everything is seen from the eyes of a very creative child.Pros: Impressive atmophere build up. Cute perspective from a child. Graphics are nice. Awesome teddy bear sidekick / flashlight. Creepiness > pop ups.Cons: Kind of short for the price you're paying for the game. Personal Con: It could've been a bit more frightening at some points. Ending was weird. LOL! "

Check.Hiding under your mom's bed... Check.Slowly uncovering the story... Check.Carefully carved out atmoshere... Check.But while playing it I got really sad because I considered the potential wasted.It's not that it is too short - why not pay 20 bucks for a great ~2.5h game? - but it lacks in two major points:First of it is underdeveloped.I've come across so many bugs and glitchs I did not bother counting them.Maybe I had just bad luck but at three points those completly broke the gameplay.Also there were many instances where one just felt something missing, be it technical or a design matter.Second, it's not challenging at all.Most of the time one can just freely toddle around the area, without fearing being threatend by the monster.Even when caught by the monster one respawns like 3-5 meters behind and can just walk past that spot.I'd recommed to buy this game when it's on sale, then enjoy the visuals, enjoy all those little details and have fun for a cupple of hours.

												While it may be short (around 3 hours in length), ""Among the Sleep"" offers an intriguing story with a very thoughtful presentation. The environments are imaginative, and while linear, they offer just enough puzzle solving to stay interesting. The challenges are akin to ""Amnesia"", where you solve puzzles while avoiding a monster. The monster is presented well. You never get a good glimpse of it, and the reveal at the end is gut wrenching. If you're looking for a good puzzle game with a deeper meaning behind it, play this, though know that it won't take too much of your time, for better or worse.			"

												Rasta-dreadlock-lady-tree-thing made me scream every time. I could've paused the game, I could've looked away from the screen but instead I just screamed. "

												Advertises Oculus Rift support but doesn't currently work with a DK2 - no headtracking (major nasuea), and unable to move the mouse up or down, just left/right. It makes the game literally unplayable. If you're looking for rift support wait until they fix these issues. The game overall looks to be really unique and well done. I can't wait for them to fix the rift issues.			"

												Among the Sleep is exactly as long as it ought to be - an intriguing, moving, fantastic game. My only gripe is that the game gives no real feeling of danger until you can get caught. I think token appearances a little earlier would have kept the game more consistently tense. Regardless, if you play with the lights out and let yourself get into it, it's a deeply atmospheric and creepy experience. I'm surprised at all the haters - this absolutely doesn't deserve the mixed reviews it has here. If the price tag turns you off, don't hesitate to pick it up on sale for < $10, you'll absolutely not regret it (if you're into short, sweet indie titles and the horror/suspense genre generally).

												This is an excellent, short, little horror game. Playing as a child is perfect starting point as you are so helpless and vulnerable, you can either walk slowly or crawl but you cannot see too far when crawling. The atmosphere is what makes this game so good. It starts off with a very creepy oppressive atmosphere where you never know what dangers are lurking. Then just when you are thinking it is only a sinister atmosphere and there are no actual threats you catch a glimpse of enemies. There are no really cheap jump scares but lots of menacing corner of the screen glimpses of things and when you do first get caught by the enemy it is terrifying. So this manages to maintain the atmosphere throughout that game where you are never sure if you are in danger or not. My only complaint is that some of the camera movements when climbing made me a little nauseous.			"

												There were some really good scary moments in the game that gave an interesting vibe of unease that was compounded by that fact that you're playing as only a toddler. It's short but I felt that worked to its benefit although I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. Though it's not perfect, if you're looking for a unique, GOOD horror game on Steam, this is one you should try out.			"

												Backed this on Kickstarter. Glad I did. Was a pretty fun game to play. Quite short (seems to have taken me just short of 3 hours), but a good experience while it last. Very creepy and the story was pretty good.			"

												Very nice game, definitely recommend picking it up on a sale. Full price is probably not worth it.			"

												Even being a baby, tripping over and falling when I run a little much more than I should have make me mad sometimes; this game disturbs me in a good way and sends shivers down mine spine. Touching story, with a great atmosphere. For its category 7/10.			"

												As soon as I heard about this game, I was intrigued. Although it is not very long, it's quite interesting and fun. I liked exploring the world as a little child. It's mostly not scary, creepy sometimes but not that much. There's only one part where you may get some real spooks, but depends on the person. If you get it on sale, it's a good deal.			"

												i thought this was an interesting game. i thought it was cool playing as a toddler, it felt cool seeing things bigger then you like you once did as a child. its a cool experience looking in awe at the gigantic world around you when in reality its no bigger then your room. this game plays with the idea of a childs imagination and how things we see as a normal everyday room because a completely different experience for a child who views things differently then we do. i enjoyed the game overall, if anything i say get the game for the experience alone because it is where this game shines. the atmosphere is amazing and i was not let down.

												Nice, original game. I particularly liked the unusual point of view of a 2 year old toddler, who views the world from 70-ish cm high, moves faster when crawling, and sometimes stumbles when he runs.I think many of the negative reviews fall into 3 categories:1) Those who expected a horror game. It is indeed not quite scary (despite being tagged as ""horror"" on Steam). I don't really like horror games so that was rather a plus for me.2) Those who expected AAA Crysis-ish graphics. Sure it doesn't have some kind of ultra-realistic VR graphics, but the graphics are more than decent and not an issue for immersion.3) Those who found the game too short. Indeed I finished it in less than 5 hours.Overall a good game. Wouldn't buy at retail price ($15), but okay on sale around $6.			"

												Among the sleep is an indie horror game from both publisher & developer Krillbite Studio, based on exploration. The outcome of the story will be obvious almost from 1/3rd of game, and can't really say anything else about it, to not spoil it, but i must say it reflects on a social problem, that should be spoken more about of.Although the controls are really simple, it's hard to master, because sometimes it's bugged to a point, i have to say it's game breaking. The game supposed to be an indie horror game, but except for a few minutes of tenseness, in most of the playtime it's just a walking simulator from a 2 year old boys perspective who is looking for his lost memories. With the second playthrough the game can be completed in approximately 5 hrs, which in this games particular case is pathetic, and considering that the few achievements that are in the game are reported partially broken, and that i bought the game on sale for 6 Euros instead of 15, i have to say for me it's on the edge of not recommending it, unless it's highly discounted. It's a pity because with a full 8 hrs gametime, and with a few polishments on the controls here, and bug obliterations there it could have been a decent creation. 72/100			"

												I really enjoy the concept of this game, and the overall presentation was very nice, though I felt the scary factor was often more cheesy than creepy.My main gripe about the game is it doesn't take enough advantage of you being a baby.  I liked the symbolism and child-like interpretations that were used, but there wasn't much of it.  Certain game mechanics (like being able to throw things) weren't used much, while others (like pushing objects to climb onto something) were used too much.I think if the game had 2 or 3 more chapters taking advantage of daylight, the additional content associated with it could've addressed my complaints.Overall cool concept.  Good game to play on a rainy weekend.			"
