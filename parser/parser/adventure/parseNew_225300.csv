												Absolutely brilliant level design.  That's what this game is about.  Story is alright but don't expect it to be in-your-face drama 24/7.  This is a game about fantastic atmosphere and you exploring the level.  Figuring out that one specific solution or finding that one specific item bring such a fantastic epiphany feeling when it happens.  This game is full of that.If you want stat grinding, a soap opera story, or a heavy combat focus, this isn't it.  If you want amazing level and puzzle design with matching quality atmosphere then you need to play this.The only possible downside is the usual adventure game trope of not knowing where to go occasionally.  Just go over the known areas you've been and keep searching, it doesn't take forever to find the way through.			"

												I remember playing Tomb Raider II way back when I was a little kid. A beautiful experience, even if I didn't always know what to do. Sure, it doesn't hold up anymore, but the graphics were beautiful and the gameplay outstanding. You really felt like an explorer. Lara Croft was one of the coolest things back then. Oh, how things have changed. After TRII it all pretty much went downhill. Until earlier this year, with the release of the Tomb Raider reboot. Lara was finally cool again. That's also the one game that you should play if you want to experience a Tomb Raider game. Not that this one is bad, it's just awfully dated. Play this one for the nostalgia.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												10 out of 10We join Lara on her second adventure Tomb Raider 2. One of the bestselling Tomb Raider games Tomb Raider 2 improves on the original, with new weapons like the harpoon gun, grenade launcher and M4, new graphic enhancements like gun flash and flairs. And for the first time in Tomb Raider Lara has a few costume changes along the way.You join Lara on another globetrotting adventure to recover the dagger of Xian. A mythical dagger that would turn you into a dragon if you plunged it into your heart.I feel that Tomb Raider 2 is one of the best Tomb Raider games of all time :)			"

												Lara Croft is searching for an artifact called the Dagger of Xian but discovers that a mysterious organization is also tracking it. If she wants to be the first to reach it and prevent a catastrophic fate for the world, she will need to find the keys that will open the way... elsewhere than in China.I must say that Tomb Raider II isn't perhaps my favorite game in the series, as I'm heavily influenced by the first opus and Anniversary. But the story is well written too. I mean, who doesn't want to follow her under the water or in Italy or in Tibet?The gameplay is pretty much the same as the first game: you jump, you search levers, you move stuff and you shoot anything coming in your way. And Tomb Raider II has a major shift here: instead of the animals or the legendary creatures, your enemies are now humans. Many humans. Many crazy humans. And you're confronted to them more than the animals (true, you have sharks, dogs, even Yetis or spiders). I suppose that maybe, this shift may have contributed to the fact that I'm still clinging more to the first game.But this game is also introducting vehicles for Lara: boat (well in Venice) and the snow bike which I had the most fun with. This is great to take ramps, to jump over pits or to race against the clock. That's also one of the main changes. Another new thing is the fact that you have allies in the game in the form of Tibetan monks. Don't hurt them and they'll let you in peace.Tomb Raider II is also an improvement for Lara herself: she has more weapons (like an harpoon for example) if she needs to defend herself (and trust me, she will need them nearly all the time). But the best improvement is probably aethestic: she's looking more curvy than angular, though she's still wearing her regular outfit.However, during the game, now, Lara changes also clothes. While the change is perhaps minimal, it's more realistic for the levels. It's just a little disappointing that she must find her way on a platform in the middle of the sea, where it's very very industrial. But generally, the landscapes are still sticking to the ""Tomb Raider"", aka, historical places like the Great Wall of China or Venice but also more mysterious levels like a wreck of a cruiser or a Tibetan monastery. It's very nice done and guess what? The T-Rex makes also a cameo.Anyway, I liked a lot the soundtrack, mainly the one used with the snow bike for the first time.Tomb Raider II is a nice way to keep going with the series. Too bad, it doesn't come with the add-on The Golden Mask (more snowbiking!) but anyway, if you're nostalgic of putting the butler in the fridge, given the price and the regular promotion of -75%/-80%, you shouldn't hesitate.

												Core Design's insanely successful sequel to the original, classic Tomb Raider (1996) is just more of the same. However, for some reason, this statement seems to often be taken as a negative one, whereas I just view it as more of a good thing. And that's exactly what Tomb Raider II is. Much more!Let's start with aesthetics. The graphics are largely improved in comparison with the first game. Lara looks like an even more sexy bunch of polygons this time around, complete with larger and rounder breasts, which I assume took up 60%+ of the development time and budget. Lara also has a ragdoll ponytail, which would actually look quite good, if it didn't look like a three-section staff that could knock somebody out. It would come as no surprise to me if she was almost every teenage guy's wet dream back in '97. Moving on, we have video settings this time around! Yes, actual video settings, and I'm fairly certain the game runs without any emulators or graphical enhancements that weren't there in the original release. There's even support for widescreen resolutions, but I prefer to keep it at 4:3. Textures and other models are largely improved, although for some reason all the male characters look incredibly wrinkly. I think they just started with Winston's model and built upon every male character from there. Finally, there's an improved lighting engine, which also plays a faily big role in the game itself, as well as being a nice visual enhancement. There's only one complaint here, and that's the FMVs. Not only do they have awful scanlines, but the game goes windowed in full-screen and it just looks wrong. However, when you compare that to the first one, where you'd have to alt-tab and the game would sometimes crash, it's not a big deal.Sound-wise, it's not as good as the first, at least in my opinion. The main theme is a gutted remix of the original, but Nathan McRee provides a nice selection of short, dramatic pieces which generally fit each situation well. Lara's new voice actor is good, although for some reason they didn't replace all her lines from the original. Seems a bit odd. All the male voice actors are god awful though. Just awful. Funny, but still awful. Guns sound incredibly satisfying, and there's a larger selection of environmental sounds to add to the atmosphere.In terms of plot, it's very simple; point-A to point-B. Lara hears of a legendary artifact called the Dagger of Xian, visiting China, Italy, and Tibet in the process to claim it. There's a couple of hackneyed villains here and there, but it's all very basic. If you want better stories, I'd player later entires in the series.Nothing much has changed gameplay or control-wise; rather there's just been some additional things slapped onto the already solid gameplay to provide some variety. Levels are insanely long. Like, hours long. There's 17 levels in the game and it took me 24 or so hours to complete. I'm a slow gamer, but that's still insanely long for an action adventure-game. I've also noticed a large increase in difficulty from the first game, and the learning curve is nowhere near as smooth. It seems to be completely random, but all I can say is that I recommend you save after pretty much every puzzle; according to my end statistics, I saved 217 times. There's a lot of instant deaths, and to be honest it feels quite cheap, but I suppose that's why you can save at any time. Secrets have changed and are more rewarding, and completionists will love finding them all. The new weapons are awesome, quite frankly, and some, such as the M16, require some actual tactics to use, rather than just holding control and backflipping.The use of newly added flares takes advantage of the aforementioned improved lighting system, as a lot of areas in the game are too dark to see without them, and it adds a nice extra element of exploration and discovery. Although you can use them underwater, which is kind of funny. Ladders and ziplines are also new, although the former are incredibly cumbersome, overused and slow, and the latter appears about 3 times in the whole game, so they really don't count for much in my book. As such, Lara comes equipped with some new manoeuvres, such as doing a half-turn in mid-air, and the animations for these are all just as fluid and beautiful as in the first game. Lastly, vehicle sections, which I was at first skeptical and hesitant about experiencing, are actually some of the most enjoyable parts of the game. It's a shame then, however, that like ziplines, they appear so rarely throughout the game.So what's the verdict then? Well, Tomb Raider II is everything a perfect sequel should be. It's an improvement over the previous title in an abundance of ways, but at the same time, I think the game suffers a bit from a lack of overall fluidity and pace. For example, my personal favourite parts of the game are the first couple of levels and the last 5, whereas the middle section of the game is all basically indistinguishable, incredibly long and tiring. There's also a lot of backtracking, far more than in the original. This game requires a lot of patience, but I do think it is worth it. The added positives and negatives balance it out to be exactly as good as the original, which I suppose means that it fails a sequel. But that doesn't mean it isn't a kick♥♥♥♥♥ sexy, hi-octane and lengthy adventure.3.5/5			"

												My 10-year-old self and I can't recommend this game enough. It's classic puzzle-solving at its finest. In fact I'm pretty sure that playing it made me smarter. There's no AI holding your hand here, nor any obnoxious button graphics that flash on-screen and yell at you to mash the Y key to perform some entirely gimmicky and circumstantial roundhouse backflip to the face that you'll never need to do again. Just Lara and her lovably awkward polygons running straight ahead with the arms fully stretched out at a stiff, perpendicular angle to the body. On occasion, you can make her say ""No,"" in a charming British voice, over and over again, and then kill her in a variety of exciting ways. Serously though, the levels are rendered beautifully, leaving just the right amount to the imagination, and many of the puzzles actually require more than three brain cells to figure out. There are no journal entries offering fluff faux ""immersion,"" no toggled map overlays to tell you where you are, and very little clues to help you out - just you and an often convoluted and action-packed pathway from the start of a level to the exit. The levels themselves, especially the memorable Venice series, have personality and often make you feel real suspense and a sense of danger. While some puzzles might frustrate the modern gamer (certain ones depend on very exact placement of Lara to perform a series of jumps with no room for error, for instance, which can get pretty tedious), the feeling of accomplishment you get after finally landing that horrendous jump, or opening that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ door, is so worth the effort. In my opinion, this and the original Tomb Raider are the best installments in the series, mostly thanks to their simplicity. What it lacks in modern graphics, the game makes up for tenfold in gameplay and creativity of story and design. Plus, for the first time, Lara gets to use vehicles, which add a great deal of fun to the levels they appear in, by which I mean you can drive them off cliffs and explode.  All in all, you won't regret giving this a try. Yeah, you'll probably laugh at Lara and make fun of the dated graphics, and swear loudly at the controls, but these days, that's part of the fun. Definitely a must for 90s action/adventure gaming fans and especially people who don't mind video games not insulting their intelligence for a change.Oh and you can lock the butler in the freezer.

												Tomb Raider II is one of the best Tomb Raider's I've played yet! There is a lot to explore as far as going across countries from China to Venice and more. You can find powerful guns hidden throughout the game to protect yourself from Marco's mercenaries. The sound effects and background music make it more intense as you push your way through the levels and discover what Marco is up to. I recommend this to any of my friends who have played the Tomb Raider series and those who have not. Excellent game!			"

												One of the best adventure games of all times. And i am aware that nowadays we have adventure games with impressive graphics or with great storylines, with vast areas to explore, games that offer addictive gameplay, and i love those too(i also like the  TR reboot, for example). But as wierd as it may sound, nothing beats the feeling of swan-diving through a small gap in the middle of a lava lake into a pond that lays directly under that lava. While on today`s standards, TR2 may not be quite an ""eye candy"", it compensates with some great level designs, and it sure offers great gameplay, making the player to put some effort in order to complete the game.

												Tomb Raider II is an outstanding game for all the Classic Fans of the Tomb Raider Franchise. I owned it when I was younger, but never beat it. Now that its on Steam, I finally had the chance to. When you are dropped off in China for the first time, the graphics may not be so impressive, but for a game from 1998, its pretty nice. Throughout the game, I only really had 2 problems. This game, compared to Tomb Raider I, is more fighting oriented and is ""overflowed' by the amounts of combat (Human-to-Human). In Tomb Raider I, you fought around 10 people, all of them being reoccuring characters in the storyline. My second problem was how excessively long the Shipwreck stages were. They should of decreased the amount of Shipwreck level, and should have added a new set of stages. 90/100. Gameplay 10/10. Graphics 9/10. Storyline 9/10. Badass...11/10 If you're a diehard Tomb Raider fan, or just somebody looking for a nice action/ adventure game, Tomb Raider II is right for you. "

My favourite classic Tomb Raider!Why?- Amazing and awesome levels, - VARIOUS levels, - amazing story, - first animated hair and first mobile source of light (flares),- many cool ideas packed into those levels,- very nice FMVs (movie clips with hi-poly models),- many cut-scenes,- amazing music, some those memorable notes which defined TR music,- a big training map (house & garden) available anytime,- an old servant thanks to who Lara was never thirsty (unless frozen :>),- first usable vehicles (boat & snowmobile),- various enemies (human, animals, fantasy creatures) with various weapons,- those moments when the music changed and you discovered new part of the map and you said ""WOW!"",- those some moments when you was going to s##t your pants (remember those loud howls&roars chasing you in the winter level?),- some nice FANTASY included (the dragon story, the Floating Islands map)...I simply love that part!Level sizes are JUST RIGHT in that part and they found a golden mean between the fight and the exploration!And an important thing many kids forget about. Expensive computers in that era were only capable to play (NOT encode) two MP3 320kbit/s files in realtime and do nothing more. And TR2 creators did such a great 3D game with audio for those computers and overcame those limitations...I believe it was still the moment when great ideas were involved to make the game even more fun!I bought mine game with the TR Collection and I am satisfied.There is a level editor (TRLE) for TR2, available for free! There are many fan-made custom levels for TR2! Those levels are often provided as a full games ready-to-run, but when installing those maps into the Steam game you will get the TR2 music.For Geeks: You can also use the fly-patch as it is compatible with the Steam version and is NOT compatible with the version provided with many custom levels. The fly-patch does NOT mess multiplayer experience as there are no multiplayer in TR2, but this is an unnoficial cheating hack and use it only at your own risk. It may break the gameplay experience and I do not recommend it unless you already did the whole game. You can also find 16:9, 16:10 and 5:4 widescreen support patch. Use only trusted sources and scan patcher files for malware before launching them!TR2 Steam community posted many info about HD textures pack, controller configurations, walkthroughts, etc.BTW: TR2 had the campfire visible in first level... :>DISCLAIMER: If you are 2000+ era, you may not feel like we did in 90s. You may blame a complete lack of mouse support. You may blame tank controls (but Lara does sideways when jumping). You may blame slow movement animations which created that game playable on those computers (we were very happy when having 5FPS in 640x480; well... we played so often using 320x240 back then...). But they are NOT real cons of that game. This is how games were designed back then for those hardware components (mostly no GPU, slow CPU, 4:3 CRT monitor and a ball-mouse). You may miss all those 125 hint arrows per level, glowing items and a voice which is constantly telling you what you should do in that room, but this is why we love those old classics and why we spent a part of our life there without getting bored. Sometimes there is a graphics bug with shadows and you will be forced to live with it, to find a fix or to switch to software renderer (add ""-setup"" to launch options to invoke the setup window). IMHO if you are still curious and wanna try Classic TRs, buy TR Collection. You will get so many games including: TR1, TR2, TR Anniversary (modern TR1) up to TR2013 with DLCs which has great graphics, cute Lara model and a tiny, but great multiplayer community. "

												Tomb Raider II is inferior to Tomb Raider. The franchise works best when Lara is raiding tombs not Opera Houses. The game's internal logic fails when you start wondering why a modern day opera house is filled with the same kind of puzzles/traps you would traditionally find in an ancient tomb. Combat is over emphasized in this 1997 sequel with the vast majority of the game’s enemies being  gun totting muscle men. A decent enough game but a disappointing sequel with a muddled plot. If you’re looking a challenge then you’ve found it. I give this game a 8/10  "

												old but goldbelieve it or not this game is 19 years old , playing this is like a blast from the past ( so dont expect a 3A game with superb graphics) but it has one of the beautiful main menu in video games history.-took me 17h to complete ( exploration and secrets)+ there is 5 more quest to download for free called ""the golden mask"" ,steam didn't register my playtime cause when i used ""AHK Injector"" i had to play it from a different shortcut (non steam shortcut).-graphically it did age i mean this game was realised for the ps1 and pc in 1997 so expect polygon shapes everywhere , pixelated edges , low quality textures, lara triangular boobs ...ect but you can fix all this and play it in widescreen resolution thanks to the OS version of the game that was realised like 1 tears ago on mobile, using ""AHK Injector"" you can download HD texture pack + HD fmv ( hd videos ) which make the game playable for new gamers that want to get a taste of the old times.-gameplay is slow (controlling lara is like moving a tank) , basic + advanced platformer throw lvl , a lot of going and coming back through lvls , no objective or hints and that get confusing but very satisfying once you completed the lvl (if you're blocked just search for walkthrough on youtube )-keyboard controls are a bit challenging if you never played TB before, the game is compatible with gamepad but sadly the old ones only so you cant play with an xbox360 gamepad and x360ce wont work except for ""Pinnacle Game Profiler"" (worked perfectly with the game using my xbox360 gamepad and easy to use sadly its payable but it gives you a trial time witch it's enough to complet the game ' 20 days to be exact).- cool voice acting and one badass soundtrack.-no glitches or bugs ( surprisingly for a 19 old game)-unlike the os version of the game there is no achievements which is sad and no cards.if you're looking for a good challenge and nostalgia then this game is for you , worth the price but you can get it in sales for like 1.2$9/10			"

With its intricate and creative level design, Tomb Raider II is an excellent example of this, and deserves the attention of any slower-paced adventure gamer today, despite being released almost 20 years ago.The combat isn't very interesting at all, but that's not what I'm here for. When I play the classic Tomb Raider games developed by Core (1-3), I think, ""Yay! Oldschool games with a fantastic sense of exploration!"", not, ""Yay! I get to jump around while shooting a bunch of generic bad guys with awful AI!"". Fortunately, there isn't too much combat in TR II, and I often found myself solving puzzles and examining various rooms in complete solitude. Speaking of puzzles, I felt that the game's difficulty was just right -- tricky enough so that I couldn't breeze through a level, but at the same time not ridiculously difficult/illogical as to require a walkthrough whenever a new room is entered. I never felt like there was too much backtracking, either (TR 4 has far too much backtracking in my opinion, and thinking about that game just makes me want to punch something, but I digress).Overall, Tomb Raider II is a very high-quality adventure/exploration game, but I rank it lower than TR 1 or 3 due to the four sunken ship levels that occur about half-way into the game. These levels weren't BAD in design, but I got rather sick of running around rusted and ugly engine rooms after awhile. The other locations were top-notch, though -- Barkhang Monastery is a beautiful place to get lost in. You can expect to spend at least 12 hours on TR II without using a walkthrough, so it's a great buy for its price.Just for reference, here’s how I would rate Tomb Raider 2 relative to the other classic Tomb Raider games I have played, from best to worst:Tomb Raider 1Tomb Raider 3 ( Read my review )Tomb Raider: AnniversaryTomb Raider: LegendTomb Raider 2 Tomb Raider 5 ( Read my review )Tomb Raider: UnderworldTomb Raider 4(I haven’t played Angel of Darkness)			"

Steam Controller + Higher Res/AA + bug fixes 
A Guide for Tomb Raider II
By: Liam Neeson Punching Wolves

			Tomb Raider is a classic series, best on pc. Sadly, as with many older games, the Publisher just dumps it on steam without a care in the world. Aside from graphical issues, the game has issues with the steam controller.		


If you've ever played the previous tomb raider games, OR if you're coming from the next generation of tomb raider, the 2013 tomb raider. then I would walk away from these ones, they are not for the easily frustrated.I love these games, challenging puzzles and Impossible cordination jumps.			"

												This game is a classic. It was one of the games that helped spawn the mighty fandom of the Tomb Raider franchise. It's graphics were likely pretty good for the time, but I only played it a few years later, and I still loved it. The water is particularly impressive considering it was released in 1997. However, I can't recommend buying this. The reason why is that it appears they did nothing, or next to nothing, to make it more capable of running on modern machines. When I first launched it, the setup appeared behind the main window, so I couldn't edit it. I didn't even know it was supposed to appear, so I just clicked return, and the game loaded up, with most of the right side black, and part of the left side cut off. I checked for settings, to no avail. Like a few extremely old games, the video setup is separate from the game (and not exactly intuitive to access from within Steam). Opening it, I wasn't able to change the full screen resolution from 640x480 for some reason. After disabling my second monitor, and setting my main monitor to 800x600 (the smallest resolution where I could still see the apply button), I managed to get the game to appear correctly. A bit of a hassle to say the least. I also installed the widescreen patch. After restarting to re-enable my second monitor, I then tried it in windowed mode. Steam absolutely will not launch it in windowed mode. I had to open it from the exe. It was a travesty. It kept switching the resolution to 640x480 despite being in windowed mode, and was impossible to play. But, somehow, after that, I restarted, and tried it again from steam, and it magically just worked, in full screen mode, without disabling my second monitor. It was still in 640x480 unfortunately, but there was no black bar on one side, and it appeared correctly. I played it for a few minutes before my computer switched to another application on it's own, because the standard keys are set for alt to be the jump key.So, I will play through this game once more, and keep it on my Steam to occasionally play, but I really don't suggest anyone else buys it. They didn't do a thing to try to remove any bugs or anything from what I can tell. They simply took the old retail version and packaged it for steam. Frankly, I would be embarrassed if I worked for them. They should either hand the code to some of their team to squash some bugs occasionally, and clean up the code, or open source it, so maybe someone out there somewhere will choose to clean up the code for them. This game is barely playable on a modern machine. I'm likely gonna have to set up a virtual machine just to play this and a few other old games giving me trouble.			"

												So many memories, I bought the game for some nostalgia and I can't put it down. I can't believe I have tomb raider 2015 and I have more desire to play this 19 year old game that weighs less than a steam update and uses 5 buttons to play. I wanted to jump in and see if the tigers were still scary (they are!) then I decided to find all the secrets and items and hoard medpacks (haven’t used one yet) for the extra challenge. The game loads so quick it doesn’t even frustrate me when I die, kind of makes me chuckle remembering how much I struggled when I was young.I am very surprised how well the game holds up after all these years, the terrible graphics (by todays standard), the draw distance It didn’t even bother me. The speedboat is even more fun then I remember, the level design the though behind it. I feel like a lot of love was poured into the game.I don't know what else to say, if you liked it 19 years ago, you will still like it. If you have never played it, I think you could still appreciate what the game has to offer.Oh, my god the jump button takes a year to acknowledge that you pushed it, ah good old tomb raider. "

												Many people complain that this game's controls suck and that it's so old it looks ugly. While the graphics aren't as good as the current games (obviously!) and some people might not be able to overcome this, I can't agree with the controls complaints. You need to understand that this game came out in 1997 when the current WSAD system wasn't the standard. Sure, it takes time to get used to the controls, but when you do, you will find out this is one of the most precise control systems. Now, finally to the review. I have very fond memories of this game and consider it one of the top games in Tomb Raider franchise. Great choice of locations (China, Venice, wreck of Maria Doria, Tibet), thick atmosphere and simple, but sufficient story...yes, there aren't as many movement options as in its successor, Tomb Raider III, but I never thought that matters. The only downside to this great game is the Steam port - what the flip is the problem with FMVs? They're all windowed and in small resolution. But other than that, this game is brilliant. If you aren't an impatient kind of gamer who hates games that really take some effort to finish, get it. It's classic and fun even today.			"

Were you disappointed that the Original Tomb Raider had no Rifles or that the inside of Lara's Mansion wasn't enough? Well find that out on this game if you are tempted to buy it!Also if you want to load the TR2 Setup Options for Resolution and other options, go to Set Launch Options - under Steam Library Properties for TR2, and type ""-setup"" for when you do need to adjust options.

												Absolutely brilliant level design. That's what this game is about!  I have to admit, I did enjoy playing Tomb Raider more than Tomb Raider II. My reason being is, some of the levels weren't as entertaining, although, I loved all the challenges I faced through out it.  The amount of guys you had to kill was insane. The advantage of being able to lock the butler in Lara's freezer at her home is always a plus if you manage to get him in there, and also having the ability to look around her home compared to the first game which you are very limited to. I recommend playing all the Tomb Raider series. After all these years, the Tomb Raider series still has to be one of the best games I have played.			"

												Tomb Raider 2 is undoubtedly the best old game of the Tomb Raider franchise done. The first game was revolutionary but overly ""square"", and Tomb Raider 3 had better graphics, but it was very difficult and ""more of the same"". Tomb Raider 2 got the middle ground: maintained the essence of the first game with improvements in graphics and gameplay, but without being confused, ""more of the same"" and unnecessarily difficult as the third game. In short, Tomb Raider 2 bordered on perfection. While Tomb 1 is visually dark and claustrophobic, the phases of Tomb 2 are more colorful, biggest and very memorable. The four phases of the wreck of Maria Doria are by far my favorite phases of all Tomb Raider serie, for its immersive atmosphere, symbolically and literally. Novice players of this new generation will certainly face major difficulties with the game controls, which are well archaic. No movement is automatic or fluid: from one platform to another, all the leaps and Lara moves must be calculated accurately by the player himself; otherwise it's instant death. The good news is what the PC version is possible to save the game any time you want.			"

												Controls were good enough on PS1, but these PC controls are a nightmare. Especially during gunfights when you are supposed to do jumping and rolling in order to avoid taking too much damage. ""Boss fight"" in the end of Opera house level was very frustrating, it took like 20 tries to take that guy down. (I'm not sure if you even have to kill him to finish the level.) Anyway I'm playing this mainly because of nostalgia. It's still a pretty good game if you get used to the controls.			"

												If you're on this store page then you probably already heard or even played some parts of the series. TRII is an incredible oldschool classic and my personal favorite. Even though it was released in '97 it's still really fun, atmospheric (great OST by Nathan McCree) and satisfying. An excellent sequel of TRI and by far superior too. When compared to the previous game TRII far better visuals, more weapons, different style secrets, well crafted and diverse levels. Anyone who likes action-adventure in general would love this.The game can be played in widescreen resolutions. The patch is available at http://tombraiders.net/stella/downloads/TR2files.htmlThe game has a free expansion called The Golden Mask which includes 5 extra missions.In a perfect world this should be played after finishing:- Tomb Raider (I)- Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business			"

												Review by xTzharkz.To be honest, Tomb Raider II had really nice story. It was messed up at the end as the Tomb Raider I was but I actually liked this one much more.Again, gameplay was good. Had puzzles and much more difficult combat than the first one. Story is not 24/7 in your face. So you can actually enjoy the adventures and puzzles. The game is blocky but it did have jump scares as well so. Old games can scare as well. Specially that old man in the manor.Fun fact. Boobs did improve, had one more edge than TR I.Sad part was that there was no Steam overlay on this one, so couldn't take any screenshot what to upload but it is okay. Didn't affect the gameplay. Definently recommend this game to old school gamers and to the people who are into new Tomb Raiders, just to get the taste, from what it all started from. For new gamers controls will probably be hard to master. Since it was my childhood game, it was easy for me. My total story time was 12h 34min. So you can prepare. Loved it, good memory flashbacks.xTzharkz [Eric]			"

												I love all the classic Tomb Raider titles equally, but this one is particularly adventurous.Classic Lara always had a lot to teach, and her personality was matched by the beautiful places she visited. Most people from who didn't grow up with Lara are sadly oblivious to her impact, and would scoff at the idea of playing in anything than the very-latest graphics. I would not recommend this game to those types of gamers.Gamers who realise that there is more to gaming than graphics, and can still immerse themselves in the beautiful landscapes despite their quality by todays standards, are highly likely to enjoy this game.

The level design of these games is just so intelligent that it exposes a lot of modern games.Very, very clunky controls, though, so not too many people will be able to stomach this one in large doses. A step down from Mario 64. You will die many times and 95% of the time will be due to controls and bad camera angles. Some jumping puzzles are actually a bit of trial and error since you can't see where you're supposed to go at all times.			"

												Tomb Raider 2 is arguably the best in the series. Featuring many elements that would later become staples in future games. Such as Lara's free flowing ponytail and enormous outdoor levels.It's a game that I recommend quite often over any of the others in the series. Moreso because it's clear the developers had a very clear focus with regard to it's development. The game has a very interesting and engaging plot, with imaginative locations such as Tibet, Venice, the bottom of the ocean and the Great Wall of China.While Tomb Raider 3 and later 4 would expand on many individual elements featured in 2. This one sold 8 million copies worldwide for good reason. It's just that damned good.			"

												To my mind this was just as good as the first one but the PC version is quite a mess for modern operating systems. In the first one it was just the music that was missing but this time it's the in-game cutscenes, the music and Lara's dialogue in the beginning and ending of the game. I had to use a longplay on youtube to watch the cutscenes in order to keep up with the story and it really detracted from the overall experience.The controls are also still very dated, same as the first game only this time you have to use vehicles as well. I did not have fun trying to control that snowmobile, let's just leave it at that.			"

												Tomb Raider II, released in 1997 is certainly a fascinating one. Following on from Lara's adventures in Tomb Raider, Lara finds herself in pursuit of a mythical Chinese artifact, The Dagger of Xian. Lara's journey begins at the Great Wall in China, then to the city of Venice, deep under the sea to the wreckage of the ship, Maria Doria, then to TIbet and finally back to China to face off against the leader of the Fiamma Nera, Marco Bartolli.Gameplay is considerably like the first game, only Lara can now climb ladders, twist around in mid-air or underwater to face the other way, use flares to light up dark areas and carries a much bigger arsenal with weapons like the Grenade Launcher, Harpoon Gun and Automatic Pistols, whilst still maintaining weapons from the first, like the Shotgun and Uzis. Lara controls much better in this game, runs faster than in TR1, Lara also has a new voice actress replacing Shelley Blond, the more mature and rich voice of Judith Gibbins. Another thing to be noted is that Lara has several costume changes in-game, you start in the classic gear, later she changes to a wetsuit for the underwater levels, and finally dons a bomber jacket for the cold Tibetan Foothills before returning to the classic look for the final levels. Nathan McCree returns from the first game to compose the music, and it is chilling! The title theme is a very memorable one, but some of the music can really chill, even scare you!This game is by no means short. It can be quite complicated, but with a good look around and a lot of thought, you can beat it! Highly recommend it, very essential game for any fan of Tomb Raider, good luck!			"

												One of The Best games of All time, Started playing this game when I was 4 on the Playstation needless to say this game may not have the graphics desired bt it sure does have the adventure and story line. This game In my opinion Shoots Skyrim out of the water, yes it isnt free world but it does offer countless hours of exploring and figring out puzzles. Even when you beat the game it draws you back into it, wanting to play more and more! I have beaten the game about 20-30 times now on playstation and 2 run thrus on PC. This game also goes on sale like mad it goes on sale all the time normaly for 1.24$. but the 6.99$ pricetag is worth it. (considering i own an unopened copy from 1997 worth around 150$) Buy it!			"

												Tomb Raider II is one of my first childhood video games. I can still remember the day I first beat the game and it was legendary, indeed. TR2 is my favorite Core Design Lara Croft game. It is a consequent sequel, adds some more moves, vehicles. Also her beautifully animated hair was amazing at the time; kinda reminds me of Tomb Raider 2013, which also has that special hair animation. Anyway, if you've never played a core design Lara, I'd recommend to start with  TR2!			"

												Помню, прошёл TR2 в далёком 1998 году. После этого ни одна часть (в том числе ROTR) франшизы не давала мне тех ощущений, которые мне дала в своё время TR2. Фантастические локации: Венеция, опера, затонувший корабль, снежные вершины, китайские храмы; красочные (на тот момент) видеоролики; огромный выбор оружия; интереснейший сюжет, непередаваемая словами атмосфера и враги делают эту игру одной из моих самых любимых игр. Низкий вам поклон, Core Design.I remember I finished TR2 back in 1998. After that no one part (including ROTR) of franchise did not give me the feeling that I gave at the time TR2. Fantastic location in Venice, opera, wreck, snow-capped peaks, Chinese temples; colorful (at the time) video; a huge selection of weapons; interesting plot, inexpressible atmosphere and enemies make this game one of my favorite games. Big respect for this masterpiece to you, Core Design.			"

												Still brilliant after all these years. Impeccable level design, challenging and fun gameplay and quite a mystic, spooky atmosphere! There's something extremely disturbing and unsettling about wandering the deserted canals of Venice and ruins of an opera house, ending up stranded on an offshore oil rig in the middle of the ocean and even playing at the bottom of said ocean in near total darkness with sharks circling you! Not to mention the surreal Floating Islands level with statues coming to life to kill you, in which one false step means falling into pitch black abyss. I'd recommend the game not only for nostalgia hounds such as myself, but to Tomb Raider newcomers as well. This is where it all started, girls and boys! Plus, I see this game along with other classic Tomb Raiders going on sale for 1.74 euros all the time, so there's literally no reason to buy it and try it out.			"

												Back in the day I beat the first Tomb Raider. I still remember being pretty challenged by it's puzzles. I haven't played (besides a demo) this one until now on here. So far I godda say, the puzzles in this one really require you to think outside the box if your gonna try to figure it out on your own. I have no idea how I got as far as I did without any walkthroughs.I hope theres not just humans and normal animals the rest of the game. That would be a little dissappointing when the first one keeps introducing interesting creatures. But even so, I don't think it will ruin this game for me. I'm loving it at this point.If you didn't get enough of Tomb Raider's gameplay and want more of it, then this is whats up. The way this game plays hasn't really changed, except theres vehicles.			"

												OF COURSE I locked the butler inside the walk-in freezer. Who hasn't?! Now that we've dealt with that, let's see what we have here.Let me get this over with quickly and painlessly:- yes, the graphics and animations and whatnot are VERY dated and don't play along well with modern resolutions. The game, however, runs well enough for me, and that's all I care about (but I'm very forgiving in terms of gfx and resolution).- the platforming and puzzles are awesome and in my opinion, that's what the game is about. This game is pretty slow and methodic and if you want to find all the secrets, items, and explore every nook and cranny in general, then this is your cup of tea. The environments are varied, the gameplay never gets stale although some levels (like the motherfreakin' sunken ship) drag on for a bit too long.- the combat, however, is A-T-R-O-C-I-O-U-S. Whoever thought this game needed shooting should jump into a spike pit, seriously, I canNOT stress enough how clunky, unfair, cheap and absolutely unnecessary this aspect is. Let me give you an example. You can take around 10 shots before you drop dead. The bad guys in the later levels need 2 to 3 GRENADE SHOTS. Let that sink in. I don't care if it's ""just a game"", no videogame iteration of a human grunt-type enemy should be able to withstand three grenades to the noggin.That said, for me, the platforming outweighs the terrible combat just enough to get a ""Recommend"" from me. Oh, and definitely get during a sale, not worth full price at any rate.TL;DR version: graphics/presentation meh, platforming/puzzles BIG thumbs up, combat: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!			"

												Loved this game when I was a kid, they really don't baby you, from the very beginning of the game you are set out against mobs and traps out to murderize you at every turn which is great :D One thing I can say though is it was a bit of a struggle to remember all of the controls since they don't give you everything in the controls menu that you can actually do so you might have to google some stuff. Every now and again I would hit the windows button when trying to jump which was annoying x.x But hey I guess I was fine with it back in the day so I can always get used to it again. This game has fantastically complex level designs with a massive variety. Would definitely recommend not just for nostalgia but for anyone who loves a challenge that can deal with a new set of controls and old graphics :)			"

												Tomb Raider II is a great game and the game runs fine on modern systems, the controls are fine and the keyboards controls are 10x better than using a controller, you just need to get used to them (and by that I mean like 10 minutes, not days). The game has a great soundtrack and the game has vastly improved compared to Tomb Raider I and you can lock Winston in a freezer.The only problem is that I'm assuming this version has the patches that came out and one of the patches makes Lara stumble when she does a back flip/tries to do a back flip and that is a bit annoying, this game runs better without patches and there is no way to reverse them. This might only be a problem with my game but who knows. The fmv files are a bit weird in that they window the game, only for the fmv though, but this isn't really a major problem or a problem at all.I do only have 1 hour on record, but that doesn't account for how great this game is!

Some of the levels are difficult but that's what gets you playing more because you want to get past it and complete the rest of the game. Great weapon choices and the loactions are just beautiful.

												Now that I beat Tomb Raider Anniversary more than once. I decided to skip getting Tomb Raider 1 since it is just like Anniversary except for a few parts here and there. Tomb Raider 2 I never played except for the demo, but now that I started playing it is a really nice game. The scenery is amazing and there is oodles of enemies to blaze up with your pistols, shotgun, or grenade launcher. Haha ;)I really enjoy this game so far. I do know how the controls can be kind of different from the later Tomb Raider games, but it never hurts to learn the very old controls from the new ones. It is a good change that is worth learning. I have watched walkthoughs that pretty much helped me here and there with the secrets in the China level. Bartoli's Hideout is definitely going to be interesting to play.I hope others have as much fun as I am having with this Tomb Raider game. :)			"

Just be sure to look up the widescreen fix - shame this wasn't done for this steam re-release.And such a shame we don't get achievements like the Android version.			"

												Picture yourself (back) in 1997. Sega was still in the hardware business, Microsoft hadn’t yet entered it, Bioshock wouldn’t be released for another decade, and outside Japan, PlayStation didn’t even have analog sticks. It was certainly a very different landscape to the industry we know today, but don’t be fooled; the year had its own type of first-class offerings to gamers at the time. In 1997, Tomb Raider II was Blockbuster of the Year. The start of the year had already seen the western release of Final Fantasy VII, but, a thirty-hour-plus JRPG with a mix of 2D and 3D graphics and its hybrid take on turn-based combat, it was a slow burner. With Tomb Raider II, Lara was running, jumping, swimming, shooting, mowing down thugs on a snowmobile, all in 3D, all in real-time. It was a technical achievement unsurpassed in ‘97, and that would go unsurpassed until the following year, with the likes of Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo and, of course, Tomb Raider III. If complaints about the early Tomb Raider sequels revolve mainly around them being too similar to the original, they’re probably true - but it’d be unfair to apply them to the first of these sequels. Tomb Raider II may have been Tomb Raider 1 on steroids, but with the original having set down so groundbreaking a formula, it made little sense to depart from it in the immediate follow-up. And while the core gameplay remains largely the same, Tomb Raider II does bring many new things to the table. From the introduction of vehicles that offer new dimensions in speed and mobility, to a bigger weapon arsenal of which no two are alike, Tomb Raider II is far more than a simple reskin. Even the graphical overhaul breathes new life into the game world, from little touches such as Lara’s full-length ponytail, to sharper textures and the inclusion of sky (a big deal in ‘97!). The result is a succession of characters and environments more rich and with more personality than ever before. The settings and level design for these environments is also a step up from that of the original. With the exception of roughly a third of the game, Tomb Raider II trades the original’s ancient caves and catacombs in favour of the modern and the urban - Lara guns her way through an opera house in Venice, an oil rig, a capsized ship at the bottom of the sea. With these comes the same traps found in the original Tomb Raider, updated to fit within their modern worlds, and admittedly with a hint of the ridiculous - crates swinging with constant momentum and sandbags that fall at exactly the wrong moment, for instance. But suspend your disbelief and you can appreciate inventiveness in the name of maintaining a challenge. The combat, too, has taken a bounding leap from the original’s simple point-and-shoot gunplay. With urban areas comes an army of human foes, each one armed with vicious weaponry, from basic lead pipes and pistols, to pump-action shotguns and flamethrowers, the last of these a one-hit kill if Lara isn’t careful. Now more than ever the combat is a ballet of gunplay and movement, where a split-second decision between offensive and defensive (and the best choice of weapon for each foe) can mean the difference between life and death. Underwater combat also makes its debut, adding a new breed of suspense as well as thrills. Tomb Raider II remains the best-selling game in the series, and it’s a distinction that was well-earned. With the title, developers Core Design took their already-iconic adventurer to new heights, and while the story is predictably hit-or-miss, the production values are sky-high. Almost two decades after its initial release, the game remains a shining example of the action-adventure video game. Outstanding stuff.			"

												Tomb Raider has always been one of my favourite game series'. I first joined the series when I was five or so and AoD had just been released. Despite that game being considered a low point in the series I loved it. To me there was something about Lara, something about her adventures and the history mixed with mythology that made them unique. Tomb Raider II was, and still is I might add, considered a high point for the series. Not only due to the commercial success it experienced almost twenty years ago but because of everything about it. The game was in 3d which at the time was not really a thing, save for Mario 64, and not only that but it feautured an awesome protagonist, an awesome story and very good graphics for the time. Sure it may not hold up today but it is definitely a game worth revisiting for long time fans of the series or a game worth discovering for people who were drawn in due to the 2013 reboot of the series. The plot follows Lara one year after the first game as she seacrhes for an ancient Chinese dagger said to possess the powers of a dragon to whomever plunges it into their chest. This search takes her all over the world, from China to Venice and beyond. Along the way you will experience fun, and sometimes challenging, platforming, fight all sorts of enemies from feeble spiders to mythalogical monsters. If you don't want to follow the main story right away or you maybe want a refresher course in the controls you can always visit Laras home: Croft Manor. It features an assault course, a hedge maze, various rooms and you can lock her butler Winston in the fridge so, you know, the usual for the classic tomb raider games. Whether you are new to the series or are revisiting it, this is definitely a game worth buying and really what do you have to lose? It's very cheap on steam and virtually everywhere else. However, I must say that it does take a while to get back into the controls which are a little clucky by modern standards but once you do it fits like an old glove.			"

												This game brings back some wonderful memories of when I used to play it when I was younger on the good old Play Station 1. The detail of the graphics for the PC version is truly outstanding and would make you feel more happier playing it with more of a HD detail to it than just seeing pixels in your face like when you play it on the PS3 or PSP. I have enjoyed playing so far and how I feel safe when you can save the game as you go through a level like your setting your own checkpoints for yourself instead of starting the level from the beginning. I would say this game is worth whatever you pay for it but I'm glad that a friend of mine gifted it to me.			"

My reason being is, some of the levels weren't as entertaining, although, I loved all the challenges I faced through out it. The amount of guys you had to kill was insane (a good thing of course). The advantage of being able to lock the butler in Lara's freezer at her home is always a plus if you manage to get him in there, and also having the ability to look around her home compared to the first game which you are very limited to.I recommend playing all the Tomb Raider series. After all these years, the Tomb Raider series still has to be one of the best games I have played.			"

												[played w/ widescreen mod, border fix, and donglefied Dualshock 2 remapped w/ Xpadder]Classic Tomb Raider games have pretty much disappeared from the collective consciousness and it's a damn shame, because more games started here than just Uncharted. Contrary to popular belief, Tomb Raider 2 aged like fine wine.From the perspective of level design philosophy, this is straight up Dark Souls. Locales vary greatly, rooms and corridors intertwine, and dread is trying to overcome you every step of the way. Even though every environment is blocky, the blocks are layered and textured in such a way that every level feels like an environment first, and a video game level second.People will say that controls in classic TR games are clunky, but they are actually the antithesis of clunky. They are precise and deliberate, is what they are. Somewhat obtuse and with a learning curve, but not clunky. If you endure, you will be flipping, jump-rolling and running jump grabbing without a second thought.Enjoy the fact that the controls are easy to map to a controller, and that the PC version of the game allows you to savestate, because most things in this game are lethal. But it really makes you soak it all in, much like Dark Souls does. Sometimes, you just have to slowly walk to the edge of a platform to make a jump. And the jump is missable. You literally earn every jump you make. Nothing ever railroads you or rushes you forward. I have played TR2 immediately after finishing Uncharted 2 for the first time, and there is just no comparison. TR may have inspired Uncharted's design, but there is really next to nothing left of it anymore.I don't understand how they managed to make a 3D game this good back in 1997.			"

												It works, but only just.If you want music, forget it. Loading music tracks always triggers the wrong one. For example, picking up a secret plays a short clip from the cutscene at the end of level 6.Perhaps more importantly, every few seconds thegame lags momentarily. This makes for incredibly annoying gameplay.I spent hours trying to track down support for this problem. I'm certainly not the only one having issues, but I found no hint of solutions anywhere on the web.			"

												Boy...Tomb Raider II is (as it was when it came out) still an interesting and well designed 3D platformer with challenging environmental puzzles which reward exploration and attention.But I cannot let go of how poor it is this port of the game.I cannot surecommend anybody to buy this game at full price when there is no way to properly adapt the screen resolution of the game to see properly all of the elements of the hud (such as the life indicator). Button mapping is barely functional, there are two settings: custom and user defined, but choosing one over the other does not mute the other command set, so beware of mapping the same button to two different functions in the two settings. Some of the functions of the game are not at all explained (such as sprinting the boat using the action command), the only way for you to know them would be search on the web for a pdf of the original manual that was sold with the pysical copy of the game (or still having the original in case you already owned the game).For as much as it can be fun to play this old game (and yes, it still is in my opinion) this game was not adapted properly, it is disrespectful to the i.p. and to the customers.I advise any of you who wants to buy this game to wait at least for a sale so you will be less disappointed while fighting to make this game work properly.

I remembered that on the retail box there was a graphics card chart with their supported max resolution and one or so supported more than 2k resolution.It blew my mind that this is still the same version i played back in 1997 and it supports any resolution you can imagine. The only thing missing for me today is aspect ratio correction, so i can play it in widescreen.			"

												Great game.It is more diverse than TR1 for better and worse, some might not like the departure from the buried tombs\ruins style of TR1 to less atmospheric and more urban settings like in Venice or on a (admittedly rather ugly) oil platform. But the same people would probably have complained about ""more of the same"" if Tomb raider 2 had continued on the path of exploring old ruins...But It's very interesting never the less , and I very much enjoyed the levels of this game. The difficulty is at time rather staggering even more than TR1 , but with perseverance it offers great gameplay and a real sense of discovery following the female counterpart of Indiana Jones.Apart from the oil platform which was rather ugly, the levels are beautifully done and rather unique, like exploring the inside of a sunken luxury ship deep on the bottom of the ocean or a mysterious tibetan temple with its gorgeous art. Yes even through the game is from 1997 and rather blocky, it's still beautifully made and worth a look or three. The game is difficult but never unfairly hard and there is a great deal more of shooting bad guys than the first. Great game overall, demand a lot of commitment to complete, but felt quite rewarding when you got there with a rather funny almost pastiche ending.			"

												This brings back memories!When I was a child this game's difficulty scared the @#$% out of me. It's so dark and unforgiving.I was all like: ""Oh no! I'm so short on medpacks! I might get stuck with low health and never be able to complete this godforsaken level with all those bad guys shooting at me!"" or ""Oh no! I'm trapped in a scrapheap of rusty metal which sunk 40 fathoms below sea level! (I don't even understand how mutch that is but I guess that must be very very deep since I can't see any sunlight from here.) The water is leaking inside and there are sharks all around me! How the hell am I supposed to get out of here alive?"" or ""Oh no! Those baddies on machinegunned snowmobiles are shooting me to death and I can't do anything about it!"". Obviously it's my favorite amongst the first six Tomb Raider games.What a badass woman! A female equivalent of Chuck Norris!However the game can be so mutch better if somebody sits down and makes a couple of changes to the engine (or releases the engine as open source like idSoftware does it with its games).1. The stretching for aspect ratios other than 4:3 needs to be fixed. It makes the main character look like Gabe Newell on new widescreen monitors.2. The processing power of GPUs increased by several orders of magnitude in comparison to 1997. Who needs distant objects to be turned black and/or thrown out completely in order to save computational complexity nowdays?3. Z-Buffer is buggy. By turning it on and off you just select between different types of glitches. With it there is Z-fighting. Without it some objects further away appear in front of objects that are closer. Both was forgivable back in 1997, but not in 2016.4. I reccomend playing this game with bilinear filtering disbled. Back then textures were VERY low-res and more like something we call pixel art nowdays. Bilinear filtering is a good idea for the new games with highres-textures, but in Tomb Raider 2 it messes up that nice pixel art by making it look smooth and ugly. Like smeared out oil paintings.

The graphics are slightly improved and there's some interesting stages like the ocean level and the snowy mountains of nepal. Love this game.			"

												Overall score: 6/10: Old Tomb Raider game with too much emphasis on combat.  There are other better Tomb Raider games from this era to play.  Probably worth it when on sale, but that's about it.I may not be an expert tomb raider, but I have played through this one, number 3, and am currently part way through 4, so I have a decent idea of how the games work.  The reason I have not played the 1st one (officially) is that I decided to get the strory aspect from the newer Tomb Raider: Anniversary, which is the remake.  Given the discrepancy in game release dates and control schemes, it would be vastly unfair to compare it with the older games.Firstly, the graphics have aged.  But then again, the game is released back in 1996, so I can let it pass, it was probably fine, maybe even mind blowing back then.The controls and general gameplay are going to be the hardest to get a handle on when first starting.  In short, Lara controls almost exatcly like a tank.  Do not go in expecting to use a mouse and keyboard with the WSAD mentality, the game uses either ye olde joystick are keyboard only, and I'm not even 100% sure on the joystick.  However, it feels like part of the challenge and fun of the game comes from mastering the controls.Level design is adequate.  I remember it was interesting to navigate and solve the environment puzzles, but I don't remember vast portions of the game, so nothing really left much of an impression.Combat is bad.  The way Lara is controlled does not make combat easy in the first place.  This is complicated, especially in this game, when most of the enemies are in tight quarters, and many are armed with guns.  It makes it difficult to get through the game without guzzling many of the medkits you find.  Fortunately, many of the other games so far have far fewer armed enemies, which balances combat for the better.  I don't remember there being many bosses, it may only be restricted to one, but I'm finding that these Tomb Raider games have a habit of making boss fights rather difficult.Story: I can't remember, so I'm not going to comment too much.  However, these games are rather short on dialogue, character development, narrative.  Mostly, just excuses to move you from location to location and get you into a level.  I'm fine with that, just don't go in expecting a novel masterpiece.Finally, I couldn't get any of the graphical issues or FMV sequences corrected.  I didn't spend much time on it, but this one has more technical issues than the other games I've loaded so far.			"

Whole Maria Doria concept is ridiculous. You have to save your game every few minutes because at some points only way to learn that there is a trap is to die -.- totally worthless.			"

												I'm just gonna come right out and say it. The controls ruin the game for me. Twenty hours between the first game and this one; the controls still don't feel natural. In fact, pretty much every problem I have with the game (much like the first game) can be traced back to the controls. It's not even the same case as something like Dark Souls, La-Mulana, or even Gunvalkyrie where the control scheme is just different and you get used to it after an hour or two. I do get it, though. I do get why this game is still so well-received. It's because of the people who played it back in the day. I'll admit it; I'm the same way with Glover. Lotsa people hate that game for the controls, but I think they're just fine. I also admit that the reason why I can get the controls to work is because I played it so much when I was younger. As for Tomb Raider, this is my first time with the series. I didn't grow up with it, so I came into the series as an outsider. Again, as far as everything else goes, I quite liked it. The puzzles are great, the atmosphere was incredible in the first game, especially when things go all Lovecraftian. The platforming and combat... could've been great as well, had the controls been better. However, when even after 20 some hours I still haven't gotten used to the controls, I don't think that's a problem on my end. That's why I can't recommend this game to first-timers of the series. It seems like a petty complaint, but once again, all of the problems I've had with the past two games stem from the controls. I won't give this a score, as I haven't completed the game. I don't think I will in the future, either. Here's to hoping I can enjoy Tomb Raider 3.			"

												TLDR: The neverending story of backtracking, dying in blind platforming sections, opening doors with levers located miles away and tanking bullets in a hellish savefest. This game is not exatly how I remembered it to be.I had good memories of this game when it was released originally. Unfortunately they were far from the truth.It must have been just the horny teenager me drooling over Lara Crofts low polygon curves and hearing her moan while she climbs stuff. And I did stop back then like at the Venice levels or so, cause the jumping got on my nerves then too.There's nothing else in this game than visually cool looking places (which are kinda crappy looking nowadays) and some later single enemies to keep you interested in it.The plot is ridiculous, but let's get over it and see what we have left.You collect white, yellow and green phallus statues(?) as a hobby while doing your ridiculous quest of killing hundreds of hired guns and endangered animals that spawn from thin air.Enemies are harmless, only the flamethrower and snowmobile guys can kill you early on/middle game. That is IF you don't mess up your camera controls and lose sight of you and your enemies. You take bullets like a tank, but if you get set on fire or a snowmobile runs over your toes, you die instantly. Also as you would expect crows do more damage that bullets.Doors in this world are operated not by door handles, but huge levers located on the other side of the city.Controls are ok for the most part, but it's really hard to get used to the quirks like the player not jumping immidiately. Wall/object clipping is horrible in some places and ruins jumps and makes diving a pain in the rocky parts.You don't really aim your guns, Lara does it for you while you're jumping backflips. I really liked that feature when I played the game first time and still think it's really cool.The graphics ok for a game this old and some of the places are visually really good looking. But the graphics are generally REALLY unclear and make finding what ever you're searching very hard. Simple things like ledges are hidden in the textures which are not seamless at all.Lara's animations look great, but the basic thug animations look really poor. Their walking animation is like Minecraft Alpha poor.Enemies AI is crap too. Enemies also spawn to areas you have already cleared behind you (with no entrances).Videos didn't play ok on my computer, they played fullscreen interlaced with what ever program I had open on background showing through the video.Sounds are really crappy. Music was ok and some even good, but there was little of it.-The player animations take FOREVER, are not cancelable and you have to repeat them in order to progress in the game. Even death animations have to wait for the previous to complete.(This makes 30% of the play time)-The game relies on the player having to return to visited parts of the map constantly.(This makes 350%-1050% of the play time)-Some platformer sections are a pain and require you to know where to jump beforehand blindly.(This makes 20% of the play time and forces you to save every 3 seconds)I liked the puzzle solving (including the drag boxes type) parts, but they are the easy part and not a match to the annoyance of always searching the right kind of blurry texture for a way to go or knowing that you'll have to backtrack again to progress.The game takes a long time to complete. But it's not cause there's so much content, only because you have to backtrack 10 times (I'm not even exaggerating) every map and wait for the animations to complete.I ment to complete this game now for the 14 year old me, but it was so unbelievably painful that I had to stop right at the end before I gRJAF_AgatgrlagricASTKgu			"

One is ""short-distance jump"" which can be achieved with Jump key + forward (up arrow), second one is ""long-distance jump"", you have to gain some velocity to achieve this jump. Run for a while with forward key, then press jump button. Tapping jump button while running is recommended.* Save constantly, ofc if you're sure that you're on a right spot. Especially useful before risky jumps. Even if you don't die, climbing a place again will be a waste of time and boring.* Use a gamepad. Better than keyboard.* Time by time, use walking to set optimal standing point before jumps. While walking, Lara won't fall off from edges (as i observed).Pros and cons:+ Fun ""playground""s+ Nostalgic- Controls are horrible, even with a gamepad. Mostly you have to make millimetric calculations to jump properly.- Graphics are deceiving, i mean time by time, you can't understand what is a ladder or movable crate. Actually it's OK for 1997 and for TR2, but even Chronicles (TR5) has that kind of stupidity... Anyway, that was off-topic.- Some of puzzles are bad with a foolish logic. There are a lot of them.- ""Playgrounds"". That means there is a place you have to solve how to reach the end of a level, but if you take a look, some of places are ridiculous. It doesn't have to be realistic and actually great, since it makes you feel like you're playing a game. But some areas are crazy and with a combination of weird logic of the game, solving those foolish puzzles getting unnecessarily harder (i.e. Opera House level).- Ridiculous death trapsSummaryIf you're a current/next generation gamer, keep away from this title. Even if you like old games and/or grew up with these, consider about it before start to play Tomb Raider 2.			"

												Tomb Raider ll is my favourite game of all time. The sounds, atmosphere, puzzles, exploration, laras booty, music and general captivating essence of the game are just perfection. However, this is a long and complicated game and requires alot of patience. The controls are dated and hard to master but when you get it down it's completely worth it. This is a game that wants you to explore every square inch of it, it's filled with secrets and heavily rewards those who explore relentlessly. As is tradition with tomb raider games, this is first and foremost an exploration game. There are plenty of puzzles and enemies and everything inbetween that all up to make this timeless gem.10/10 "

												One of the best action/platformer games ever made. Brilliant story, tons of puzzles and timed sequences, and the gameplay is ALL you! Not a quicktime in sight! Released in 1997 for the PS1, this is an absolute gem of the era, and every games should have atleast tried this.This DOES work with the Windows Xbox controller! However the intro movies DO NOT work propperly on Windows 7, so you just have to press Escape to get to the main menu. The IN GAME MOVIES DO WORK, by this I mean the cutscenes filling the story in between the levels.			"

												Just like the original game Tomb Raider 2 is an excellent game. And it took me even longer than the firs one. Mainly because I searched more secrets and I was finding them.There are couple of major differences I noticed. First thing is that there were more puzzles and sometimes they are not as fun as you'd expect. There are additional mechanics in the game so I recommend playing through Lara's house first so you don't get stuck with some puzzles. While playing 43 hours of this game I could barely notice that the graphics are not really up to date but gameplay is absolutely awesome.Highly recommended for those who want to re-visit all Lara's adventures before playing the latest Tomb Raider games.

												When I was a kid, I watched my uncle play this game over and over. I was amazed and scared at times – some of this levels really give you a sense of abandonment and isolation, when you venture to the Tibet, or swim down an abyss in the bottom of the sea. There are other levels, filled with baddies you kill underwater or above it, and the most recognized is the famous second level – Venice, with the boat. This is a great game, and, very much like the Hobbit, the tales you hear about a Dragon foreshadow the ending of this amazing trip that starts and ends in the Great Wall of China.			"

												Overall, a decent game.  Technically, this game holds up quite well, despite being almost 20 years old.  There are some technical issues that the game can have, especially on 64-bit versions of Windows, but I've noticed that Compatibility Mode (run in Windows 95 mode on Windows 7 x64 Pro) tends to take care of most of the issues I've experienced with it.  You'll also want to create a custom resolution in your video card for your native resolution's 4:3 aspect ratio.  So with 1920x1080 as an example, you would create a 1440x1080 resolution to run in full screen, or run in windowed mode to see the game in its proper aspect ratio.As for the game itself, it's not bad.  I think the biggest downfall to the game is that the developer went for the ""more is more"" approach, and it ended up backfiring on them.  Instead of fixing some of the core game mechanics, Eidos just pushed for a bigger tomb raider game.  We get more weapons, more bad guys, larger levels, more challenging puzzles, and more moves for Lara to execute.  But on the negative, Lara still controls awkwardly, combat is still horrible, and the locations are just straight-up boring.  How can I put this... Tomb Raider II doesn't really have tombs in it.  Oh sure, there's the first level, and the few near the end.  But for the most part, Lara is running around places like the canals of Venice (huh?), opera houses, naval bases, and shipwrecks.  And what's worse, is that the game actually starts out pretty good!  The first level has you romping through a section of the ancient Great Wall of China, and its fantastic.  It's full of booby traps, and generally keeps you on your toes.  The immediately after that, you're thrust into Venice, where you must run around the canals in search of the main bad-guy's hideout...  Weird.  In the end, Tomb Raider II just feels like a tedious and boring version of the original.  While Eidos did make a few touch-up improvements (more polys for Lara, the ability to walk in water, real-time lighting, etc.), they neglected to fix any of the core gameplay issues.  In all fairness, the original Tomb Raider was released in 1996, and this sequel was released just a year later.  So I'm pretty sure that it was a lack of time that prevented Eidos from fixing these issues.  Also, I believe that the third Tomb Raider also came out a year after this, and it also continues the trend of ""more"" - again, without any fixes to the same gameplay issues that the first game had.If you're a nostalgic fan, go ahead and get this game on sale.  It's not as tedious as the third installment, and if you've already beaten this game, there's no reason you can't romp through it again.  If you've never played the Tomb Raider games, I would strongly advise to start with the first and probably end with the first.  It just goes downhill from there until Crystal Dynamics revived the series with Tomb Raider Legend.TL:DR - Not a bad game at all.  But if you've never played the series, go ahead and start with the first one.  If you have played the first one, just know that the little improvements they made to the game don't outweigh its bigger flaws.  Still recommended though.			"

												By far my most favorite in the Tomb Raider franchise, Tomb Raider II brings back Lara Croft in the most badass sequal to a game to ever be made. Tomb Raider II not only expanded on Tomb Raider I, but it fixed everything that was wrong about Tomb Raider I- the sound audio was fixed and sounds a LOT better- even by today's standards. Eidos put in more sound effects instead of the few ones found in Tomb Raider I, so Lara didn't sound the exact same during climbing, jumping, etc. Tomb Raider II also improved GREATLY on the textures and sprites. In this adventure, Lara Croft finds herself looking for the Dagger of Xian- this antient dagger that is stuck in a dragon (as you'll see in the intro scene) and can kill the dragon instantly if it's removed. Although, if it falls into the wrong hands, he/she can resurrect the dragon and can reign terror on anyone who opposes it. Beautiful game, still looks beautifully crafted. 10/10			"

												I really enjoy the change of scenery and pace in this sequel. After the mandatory tomb I didn't expect to go to Venice, way before the Assassin's Creed series. Gun totting/katana swinging enemies are always lurking around the corner and sound effects are not only rather impressive for the time but give you many hints to progress through the levels finding hidden passages thanks to mice squeaking or thugs pacing. The controls are inferior to Mario 64, but less random than TR Anniversary's. There are also vehicules, and despite the dated graphics, breaking through windows and blowing up stuff suits Lara even if her polygons aren't as rounded up as in the future!			"

												Tomb Raider II is the best childhood game I ever played. Managed to complete it on my own this time.At least unlike TR1 this game doesn't need a emulator to run it so at the least it runs well on it's part. The music, the gameplay is pretty fun classic and solid. It's simplistic mechanics on a grid climbing level but for those who's seeking a good memory of nostalgic fun. I'd severely recommend this.I give this a 9.5 / 10. The PC version for Steam isn't fixed for getting 1920x1080 but it's an old game so that can be expected, I'd recommend playing this windowed mode for the sake of things. The FMVs need fixing as well when it comes to playing them [can disable FMV] and sometimes I had weird occasions where I had been flipping backwards and it seemed as if I was hitting into invisible walls in the second level of the game though it is not impossible or hard to get past them.P.S.-setup [is your bestfriend in the advanced command option be sure to turn it off before you play]			"

												Tomb Raider 2 - ReviewTomb Raider 2 continues the adventures of Lara Croft. One year after Tomb Raider took over the world, the team at Core design return with what is considered by many, myself included as the very best Tomb Raider game in the original series. The story of Tomb Raider II surrounds the mythical 'Dagger of Xian', a weapon which was used by an Emperor of China to command his army. By plunging the weapon into its owner's heart, the weapon has the power to turn its bearer into a dragon. The last battle fought with the Dagger ended when the warrior monks of Tibet removed the knife from the Emperor's heart, whereupon the Emperor died. The Dagger was then returned to its resting place within the Great Wall of China. This will take Lara all over the world and she will battle a dangerous cult intent on getting their hands on the dagger.  As before this is told through FMV cut scenes and in game clips, these are an improvement on before and there is more voice acting than in the previous game which helps improve the story telling experience. As before however it’s not always easy to tell what’s going on but you always have a rough idea and it keeps the game moving well.I personally preferred the story in Tomb Raider 2 to the first game and it takes Lara from the Great Wall of China to Venice then onto an underwater shipwreck, then to the mountains of Nepal and back to China. The level design is fantastic here and all the levels feel unique. One of my complaints about the first game is that many levels felt similar in design, but in Tomb Raider 2 this is not the case, they all stand out with tough, puzzles, great exploration and improved combat. Special mention must go to the Barkhang Monastery level that sees Lara explore an ancient monastery that’s full of great puzzles, many enemies and monks that if left un harmed, aid Lara against the cult members. In 1997 this was very impressive and it made the level stand out in gaming let alone Tomb Raider 2 with the impressive number of people on screen and AI.Graphically Tomb Raider 2 is much improved over the original. Lara’s model has been improved with a higher polygon count, her famous ponytail also makes its first appearance here and reacts impressively to the way Lara moves, running over her shoulder and reacting to wind ect. Environments also look improved with more varied textures, Lara will find herself in more modern surroundings such as Venice and an oil rig rather than just ancient tombs. Dynamic lighting has also been added, Lara’s weapons will cause light to bounce off the environment as she fires them and she now has flares to help brighten up darker areas. Game play has been greatly improved this time around, from the moment I picked up Tomb Raider 2 Lara felt more responsive and allot less “tank” like. It makes it much easier to play Tomb Raider 2 in 2017 than say Tomb Raider 1. Combat has been improved with more guns added to Lara’s arsenal, a grenade launcher, M16 assault rifle and harpoon for underwater combat have been added alongside the classic duel pistols, uzi’s and shotgun. The amount of gun fights in the game has been increased with Lara fighting many more human enemies this time around, the AI is rather standard for 1997 and at times can be relentless in their pursuit of Lara. The combat to exploration balance in Tomb Raider 2 feels perfect and adds a new dimension to the game play. The save system has also been changed, dropping the save crystal’s from the first game for a save anywhere system that makes the game far more forgiving than before, no longer will you have to play through the same sections of the game over and over again when you die.Tomb Raider 2 is an impressive achievement, in one year Core Design has managed to improve on the original in almost every way and create an all time classic. Not only is it one of the best games in the original Tomb Raider series, it’s one of the best games on the original PlayStation. If you’re a fan of Tomb Raider, Lara Croft or action adventure games, it’s a must play!9.6/10 – PC     9.4/10 – PS1			"

												The sequal to the original Tomb Raider offers new weapons, moves, and sets of vehicles to help you on your journey in obtaining the Dagger of Xian. Along this trek, you encounter an Italian mob who are also after the very item you seek. The slight improvements in this game, creates some new thrills. That said, the game is just as hard as the original, but still a rewarding experience to master. The thing I like most about the game is that the mansion level is more open than in the original that allows you to see more of Lara's home. Overrall, this is a good for anyone who likes the original.			"

Tomb Raider II was a solid step forward for the early days of the Tomb Raider franchise, which was still in it's infancy back in 1997. In many ways it's a refinement of the first game, carrying on with the same jumping and switch-throwing basics, but dressing them up in more varied environments. The somewhat monotonous rocks and sand of the original are swapped out for interesting locales like an opera house and sunken ship, and in a small but important change, most stages feature an outdoor portion under a blue sky.Lara herself has been given a big upgrade, with a brand new character model that better matches her promotional art. She finally gets to wear her iconic braid in-game, and her chest no longer looks like it could take your eye out. This game is also the start of costume changes for Lara, kicking off the tradition with a particularly famous wetsuit.Lara's action repertoire is expanded with two new moves. She can climb ladders now, which feels like a natural addition to her moveset, and integrates just as smoothly into the game's level designs. The new flares that she carries are less successful. Though necessary on a few occasions, it's questionable whether they earn having their own dedicated button – but at least they produce a nice lighting effect.On the downside, even in its second outing there are signs that classic Tomb Raider is showing its age. Its new environments are assembled from the same clumsy building blocks of the first game, resulting in some weird proportions in places like the interiors of Lara's home. More egregiously, the majority of the enemies Lara faces this time are human, but with no difference in AI from the animal enemies she fought the first time around. Equipped with guns, the new human foes are a lot more dangerous, but your best tactic is still to find a high ledge where you can shoot repeatedly at them, as they stupidly run around in confused circles below. Eventually these encounters feel like tiresome interruptions of the core gameplay.Of course it's no surprise that Tomb Raider II is at its best when it's not focused on combat, and the series' particular brand of puzzle platforming is still excellent when it's left alone to do its thing. Some standout stages are the monastery (which is formed as a central hub surrounded by short platforming challenges) and the temple (a thorough gauntlet that will test all the skills you've accumulated).With it's second game, the Tomb Raider series was hurriedly growing into the fame that it had fallen into unexpectedly. Some of its improvements were essential to defining the character of the franchise's early years, and most of what was fun about the first game carries over intact. But at the same time, it's clear that the original formula is already being stretched toward its limit – and the series' ongoing struggle to balance action with adventure was a problem right from the first sequel.

												Cant believe after all these years i've gotten completely hooked on TR2 again and to be honest even though for obvious reasons the graphics are just standard because of its age just adds to its charm, that plus the fact the levels are massive. I miss the days when games had more depth(playability) and size to them instead of short levels with flashy graphics, their must be some sort of happy medium where you get nice graphics with a good story and big levels. Not everything has to be about how perfect everything looks.			"

												TLDR: Amazing story, fantastic level design, capturing puzzles... way too many baddies at the end of the game that detract from the experienceTomb Raider II is an action/adventure that focuses heavily on puzzle solving and precarious platforming. Prepare to be jumping over large pits, avoiding rolling boulders, and shooting at seemingly random placed baddies. Also get ready to be hitting that save button a lot to avoid long and tedious do overs. This game has an AMAZING story and the level design is very well done. There is a really good balance between trying to find the hidden doors, the right buttons, and that one key you need to continue, and fighting the good variety of baddies that you'll be encountering. This game also had a little scare factor. With little to no background music, solving the puzzles can become quite relaxing until that BLARING alert music starts warning you of a nearby spawned enemy which had me jumping more than occasionally. This game however does have some drawbacks. The camera angles can be REALLY annoying and you'll be going around corners firing just to make sure there arent any enemies down that way. The number of enemies near the end of the game can also be a bit absurd and you'll need some fancy aerobics to avoid attacks and still getting the shots off you need.			"

												Tomb Raider II brings back the iconic charismatic archaeologist, Lara Croft, on another epic journey around the globe to investigate the legend around the Dagger of Xian. Her second adventure takes her along the Great Wall of China, the snowy terrains of Tibet, Italy’s city of Venice and a sunken shipwreck, accompanied by more complex series of jumping puzzles and death traps, lever activated time puzzles and the merciless killing of treasure hunting goons and exotic animals that stand in her path.The game grants Lara the ability to climb ladders and craggy walls, to roll in the air and underwater for trickier puzzles, and to drive vehicles such as speedboats and snowmobiles around certain levels in the game, which can be incredibly fun and very tedious at the same time. Flares have been thrown into the game to allow Lara to explore particularly dark areas with ease, which come in handy for some of the later levels, along with new weapons packing serious firepower like the M16 assault rifle, a grenade launcher and automatic dual pistols (which replace the dual magnums that were available in TR1), along with all weapons within the previous game.Enemies now have the intelligence to climb surfaces in order to reach Lara and carry pretty damaging weaponry, making combat somewhat more difficult, especially when they corner the player in tight spaces. Meaning there will be more ammo to find, a few more medicine packs to collect, and there are 3 secrets to find throughout each level; the gold, jade and silver dragons.For those who have played Tomb Raider I, you will be pleased to hear that instead of having to save your progress at a save crystal and having to restart tedious levels every time Lara plummets to her death from that point, Tomb Raider II allows you to save your progress from your save manual whenever and wherever. It makes life much, much easier.All environments and graphics appear to have been enhanced both in colour and in quality in this game, ultimately keeping movable blocks and secret areas better hidden, so it’s very easy to overlook a potential secret or an area full of loot if you aren’t actively exploring the entire level. The soundtrack in the game has been heavily built off its predecessor, only playing on certain cues like when the protagonist steps into the path of a rolling boulder, as it did in the previous game.Another change to be noted is the change in voice actress for our fearless protagonist. Personally, I felt that her new voice fitted Lara better as she sounds much more experienced and capable of handling herself like a badass, whereas, her voice in TR1 portrayed her to be more of an arrogant adolescent.The tutorial area in Lara Croft’s manor has developed greatly from its elder. The crates blocking most of the large manor have now been removed, inviting the player to explore the charming home more thoroughly. The gymnasium and the swimming pool reappear in this game, but with much obstacles to manoeuvre through and a prettier pool to swim around in.Here is where you are introduced to Winston, Lara’s old butler who is intent on following her around the house while groaning and carrying a tray of rattling tea cups. On the odd occasion when I accidently ran into him, there is a chance that he will break wind. It can be pretty fun for a while, but eventually having him dog you around the manor will grow tedious. My solution was to have him follow me to the meat locker in the kitchen, wait for him to follow a certain distance behind, then perform a well-timed leap out of the area, and lock him in. I found watching him try to walk through the door grunting and groaning to be quite amusing. Cruel, but amusing.Lara can now venture outside the manor and explore the maze behind it. The main section behind the maze is an assault course the player can now test out their skills on obstacles that are a bit more challenging than the gym.All in all, if you’re looking for a game where you can relax and enjoy shooting lead into your enemies, but still challenging enough that it keeps you wondering about any potential death traps around the corner, Tomb Raider II is a classic game with plenty of everything and is generally fun to play, even when using the Playstation controls, although the PC controls are much more fluid.

												NOTE:  I had to use a third party piece of software to be able to be able to map an XBox 360 pad in a sensible configuration.  I'd give this game a 7/10 score though because although it has many timeless elements of game design that still make it quite a bit of fun to play through, it does not have as clear and interesting a story as the first Tomb Raider, it falls short of that mark on most measures; and additionally it shows it's age graphically.  Is it still worth playing, yeah, but it could play much better with a bit of modernization.  The character model for Lara is of course excellently done for the time, as are her animations; but I think there may be more polygons in her model than in the rest of the game.  The modelling though isn't really where the game suffers;but rather in the low resolution textures.  The cut-scenes look extremely grainy on modern resolutions and the textures on the environments are sometimes poor enough to really pull you out of any immersion you may have.  I will say that there are a very wide variety of environments and some of them are quite in interesting, although if you're like me, you may not be able to clearly understand why you are actually going to all these peculiar places.  The story just isn't particularly clear or engaging.  The platforming controls are somewhat finicky.  You really end up using a set of manuevers in kind of the same way you might in a fighting game to clear these challenges.  Once you get those moves down, it's usually more a matter of finding where you need to platform to rather than the execution that is the challenge.  There are some block pushing/lever pulling puzzles as well and these are solid, usually not too much of a challenge but that's fine as they don't overstay their welcome.  As far as the combat, it's very similar to the first Tomb Raider as well, and the added weapon, and enemy variety is one of the real clear improvements over it's predecessor.  Overall, the game is dated, but fun.  If you are considering taking a look at the classic roots of the franchise though, I'd start with Tomb Raider 1 (better story, somewhat better level design, and native x-input support for the PC), and if you enjoy that .. heck yeah TR 2 is worth the time investment.

												This is actually harder than Tomb Raider I, especially with the puzzles and enemies you face. This game is the same as the 1st, its worth to pay (not exactly the same, the plots are different and they added new stuff in the game).No further comment, its really worth the buy and I recommend to those who loves puzzles. This has some more tricks than the original as well, so keep your eyes sharp!			"

												Tomb Raider ll is my favourite game of all time. The sounds, atmosphere, puzzles, exploration, laras booty, music and general captivating essence of the game are just perfection. However, this is a long and complicated game and requires alot of patience. The controls are dated and hard to master but when you get it down it's completely worth it. This is a game that wants you to explore every square inch of it, it's filled with secrets and heavily rewards those who explore relentlessly. As is tradition with tomb raider games, this is first and foremost an exploration game. There are plenty of puzzles and enemies and everything inbetween that all up to make this timeless gem.10/10 "

												I really enjoy the change of scenery and pace in this sequel. After the mandatory tomb I didn't expect to go to Venice, way before the Assassin's Creed series. Gun totting/katana swinging enemies are always lurking around the corner and sound effects are not only rather impressive for the time but give you many hints to progress through the levels finding hidden passages thanks to mice squeaking or thugs pacing. The controls are inferior to Mario 64, but less random than TR Anniversary's. There are also vehicules, and despite the dated graphics, breaking through windows and blowing up stuff suits Lara even if her polygons aren't as rounded up as in the future!			"

												This is my favorite tomb raider game, it's weird and gloomy, and like the other classics has the tank and block based controls that make the game feel so great and precise; I love the overall weirdness that this one makes me feel,You need to be very careful with any movement of Lara, which makes for a very intimate experience overall.A simple mistep can cause you to fall and die many times, and there are moments of constant danger, like some underwater sections and such.It's just a bliss, very carefully made.I can't recomend enough ^_^			"

And the desire to try again. - Traps, lot's of 'em: Spikes, water, fire, poison, bolders and the like. Think of Indiana Jones and you get the picture. - Deadly critters, many of them taken from china (real and imaginary). - A backpack that holds too many weapons and a small pharmacy. - Animations and graphics that have aged quite well. - Collectibles in every level. - No Steam Achievements. - About 12 hours of fun.

												Well, All i can say is that the Steam Version of this game (1.1 I believe) Is more or less utterly broken when it comes to Windows 8 and probably Windows 10 as well. The game runs and plays fine, but has a huge amount of bugs coming from windows 95/98. Controller support that was built for the older controller functions but very limited, I was using a Rumble Pad 2 and it worked for the most part except strafing. FMV's do not function at all for me and immediatly crash the game upon startup. I even tried downloading a modded upscaled FMV and still didnt work properly. Maybe someone should reach out to someone in the community to build a fully updated install for this. I tried the few that were on the community guide to no avail. They upscaled some textures but still didnt fix the FMV issue. Besides that its a very fun game and looks much better on PC than it did on the PSX. Very worth a play but just remember you have to have some technical knowledge of older games on older PC's to hopefully properly play this game. Good Luck!			"

												Tomb Raider II is the best childhood game I ever played. Managed to complete it on my own this time.At least unlike TR1 this game doesn't need a emulator to run it so at the least it runs well on it's part. The music, the gameplay is pretty fun classic and solid. It's simplistic mechanics on a grid climbing level but for those who's seeking a good memory of nostalgic fun. I'd severely recommend this.I give this a 9.5 / 10. The PC version for Steam isn't fixed for getting 1920x1080 but it's an old game so that can be expected, I'd recommend playing this windowed mode for the sake of things. The FMVs need fixing as well when it comes to playing them [can disable FMV] and sometimes I had weird occasions where I had been flipping backwards and it seemed as if I was hitting into invisible walls in the second level of the game though it is not impossible or hard to get past them.P.S.-setup [is your bestfriend in the advanced command option be sure to turn it off before you play]			"

												Fantastic platformer/ exploration game from the late 90's.While slightly inferior to it's predecessor in terms of local, and with an overemphasis on human enemies and combat, Tomb Raider II maintains enough personality and varied level design of it's own to stand out and be a worthy successor. This is how more games should be: Story takes a backseat, serving more as a pretext for Lara'a globe-trotting adventure. There are no horendous quite-time events, while cutscenes don't interrupt gameplay but feel more like a reward for conquering a set of levels.Levels are open and vertical; unlike those in Tomb Raider III they flow quite well. Jumping and climbing are the focus here. The game is also much more colorful that Tomb Raider I which stuck with more of a grey/ brown palette. The pixelated pastel textures are quite nostaligic.If you like solitary exploration, vertical level design and varied environments, this game is for you.			"

												Tomb Raider 2 - ReviewTomb Raider 2 continues the adventures of Lara Croft. One year after Tomb Raider took over the world, the team at Core design return with what is considered by many, myself included as the very best Tomb Raider game in the original series. The story of Tomb Raider II surrounds the mythical 'Dagger of Xian', a weapon which was used by an Emperor of China to command his army. By plunging the weapon into its owner's heart, the weapon has the power to turn its bearer into a dragon. The last battle fought with the Dagger ended when the warrior monks of Tibet removed the knife from the Emperor's heart, whereupon the Emperor died. The Dagger was then returned to its resting place within the Great Wall of China. This will take Lara all over the world and she will battle a dangerous cult intent on getting their hands on the dagger.  As before this is told through FMV cut scenes and in game clips, these are an improvement on before and there is more voice acting than in the previous game which helps improve the story telling experience. As before however it’s not always easy to tell what’s going on but you always have a rough idea and it keeps the game moving well.I personally preferred the story in Tomb Raider 2 to the first game and it takes Lara from the Great Wall of China to Venice then onto an underwater shipwreck, then to the mountains of Nepal and back to China. The level design is fantastic here and all the levels feel unique. One of my complaints about the first game is that many levels felt similar in design, but in Tomb Raider 2 this is not the case, they all stand out with tough, puzzles, great exploration and improved combat. Special mention must go to the Barkhang Monastery level that sees Lara explore an ancient monastery that’s full of great puzzles, many enemies and monks that if left un harmed, aid Lara against the cult members. In 1997 this was very impressive and it made the level stand out in gaming let alone Tomb Raider 2 with the impressive number of people on screen and AI.Graphically Tomb Raider 2 is much improved over the original. Lara’s model has been improved with a higher polygon count, her famous ponytail also makes its first appearance here and reacts impressively to the way Lara moves, running over her shoulder and reacting to wind ect. Environments also look improved with more varied textures, Lara will find herself in more modern surroundings such as Venice and an oil rig rather than just ancient tombs. Dynamic lighting has also been added, Lara’s weapons will cause light to bounce off the environment as she fires them and she now has flares to help brighten up darker areas. Game play has been greatly improved this time around, from the moment I picked up Tomb Raider 2 Lara felt more responsive and allot less “tank” like. It makes it much easier to play Tomb Raider 2 in 2017 than say Tomb Raider 1. Combat has been improved with more guns added to Lara’s arsenal, a grenade launcher, M16 assault rifle and harpoon for underwater combat have been added alongside the classic duel pistols, uzi’s and shotgun. The amount of gun fights in the game has been increased with Lara fighting many more human enemies this time around, the AI is rather standard for 1997 and at times can be relentless in their pursuit of Lara. The combat to exploration balance in Tomb Raider 2 feels perfect and adds a new dimension to the game play. The save system has also been changed, dropping the save crystal’s from the first game for a save anywhere system that makes the game far more forgiving than before, no longer will you have to play through the same sections of the game over and over again when you die.Tomb Raider 2 is an impressive achievement, in one year Core Design has managed to improve on the original in almost every way and create an all time classic. Not only is it one of the best games in the original Tomb Raider series, it’s one of the best games on the original PlayStation. If you’re a fan of Tomb Raider, Lara Croft or action adventure games, it’s a must play!9.6/10 – PC     9.4/10 – PS1			"

Tomb Raider II was a solid step forward for the early days of the Tomb Raider franchise, which was still in it's infancy back in 1997. In many ways it's a refinement of the first game, carrying on with the same jumping and switch-throwing basics, but dressing them up in more varied environments. The somewhat monotonous rocks and sand of the original are swapped out for interesting locales like an opera house and sunken ship, and in a small but important change, most stages feature an outdoor portion under a blue sky.Lara herself has been given a big upgrade, with a brand new character model that better matches her promotional art. She finally gets to wear her iconic braid in-game, and her chest no longer looks like it could take your eye out. This game is also the start of costume changes for Lara, kicking off the tradition with a particularly famous wetsuit.Lara's action repertoire is expanded with two new moves. She can climb ladders now, which feels like a natural addition to her moveset, and integrates just as smoothly into the game's level designs. The new flares that she carries are less successful. Though necessary on a few occasions, it's questionable whether they earn having their own dedicated button – but at least they produce a nice lighting effect.On the downside, even in its second outing there are signs that classic Tomb Raider is showing its age. Its new environments are assembled from the same clumsy building blocks of the first game, resulting in some weird proportions in places like the interiors of Lara's home. More egregiously, the majority of the enemies Lara faces this time are human, but with no difference in AI from the animal enemies she fought the first time around. Equipped with guns, the new human foes are a lot more dangerous, but your best tactic is still to find a high ledge where you can shoot repeatedly at them, as they stupidly run around in confused circles below. Eventually these encounters feel like tiresome interruptions of the core gameplay.Of course it's no surprise that Tomb Raider II is at its best when it's not focused on combat, and the series' particular brand of puzzle platforming is still excellent when it's left alone to do its thing. Some standout stages are the monastery (which is formed as a central hub surrounded by short platforming challenges) and the temple (a thorough gauntlet that will test all the skills you've accumulated).With it's second game, the Tomb Raider series was hurriedly growing into the fame that it had fallen into unexpectedly. Some of its improvements were essential to defining the character of the franchise's early years, and most of what was fun about the first game carries over intact. But at the same time, it's clear that the original formula is already being stretched toward its limit – and the series' ongoing struggle to balance action with adventure was a problem right from the first sequel.

												This game is awsome, even when I can look at the original install disks. The only bad thing is that the expansion is not included, and my expansion install disks will not read it even when I find the install folder. They need to include the expansions for all of the Tomb Raiders.			"

												Well, All i can say is that the Steam Version of this game (1.1 I believe) Is more or less utterly broken when it comes to Windows 8 and probably Windows 10 as well. The game runs and plays fine, but has a huge amount of bugs coming from windows 95/98. Controller support that was built for the older controller functions but very limited, I was using a Rumble Pad 2 and it worked for the most part except strafing. FMV's do not function at all for me and immediatly crash the game upon startup. I even tried downloading a modded upscaled FMV and still didnt work properly. Maybe someone should reach out to someone in the community to build a fully updated install for this. I tried the few that were on the community guide to no avail. They upscaled some textures but still didnt fix the FMV issue. Besides that its a very fun game and looks much better on PC than it did on the PSX. Very worth a play but just remember you have to have some technical knowledge of older games on older PC's to hopefully properly play this game. Good Luck!			"

												This game is NOSTALGIA and it's worth it just to lock the butler in the fridge one more time, OR introduce friends to for the first time, if they never did it before. Example:

												If you enjoyed the original this is a must. It's a lot more action focused, which is a positive and negative. It's dated, don't think otherwise, but it's still a solid game worth playing			"

												After 37 long and amazing hours I finally managed to finish this game. It was a great experience and an even better game than its prequel. I really like the direction in which this game took the Tomb Raider Series after Tomb Raider I. Still there are some flaws I could not ignore. The story is somewhat weird and not quite as interesting as Lara's first adventure. In addition to that it has a fair amount of flawed logic. Still this game is a big improvement. The first half of the game simply amazed me. The locations and non linear leveldesign were absolutely astonishing while the huge amount of fights made up for a fast paced experience. I loved solving the jump puzzles and found myself (positively) confused by the vast amount of options in each level. However, the second half of the game felt a bit over the top. It took me into the more supernatural part of the story, which for instance was really cool, but (in my humble opinion) felt like it was stretched over too many levels. I also think the fighting mechanics still offer great space for improvement so I am very curious to play the next Tomb Raider titles.No matter its flaws this game is still very worth playing especially for people who enjoy Tomb Raider games or Tomb Raider like games. That being said I encourage everyone to play this amazing piece of gaming history.			"

												If you play this game, chances are that it's part of your childhood. What you can expect if you still haven't played it: - Running, gunning, jumping, grabbing an falling to your death. And the desire to try again. - Traps, lot's of 'em: Spikes, water, fire, poison, bolders and the like. Think of Indiana Jones and you get the picture. - Deadly critters, many of them taken from china (real and imaginary). - A backpack that holds too many weapons and a small pharmacy. - Animations and graphics that have aged quite well. - Collectibles in every level. - No Steam Achievements. - About 12 hours of fun.

												This is my favorite tomb raider game, it's weird and gloomy, and like the other classics has the tank and block based controls that make the game feel so great and precise; I love the overall weirdness that this one makes me feel,You need to be very careful with any movement of Lara, which makes for a very intimate experience overall.A simple mistep can cause you to fall and die many times, and there are moments of constant danger, like some underwater sections and such.It's just a bliss, very carefully made.I can't recomend enough ^_^			"
