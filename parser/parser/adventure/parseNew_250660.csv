												So what does this game offer? Well, let me list them off:It's an excellent and unique Metroidvania. It has hilarious dialogue with the bosses. And also it has plenty of moments to make you go ""What the heck?!"". Oh yeah, and the soundtrack? It's awesome.This game will challenge you. And it will also make you laugh.			"

												This game is a rage game, as many others have said, but what many others haven't said is some of the rage comes from some very poor coding when it comes to movement - specifically turning back and forth and jumping.  If you haven't completed all animation sequences down to the pixel, you are NOT allowed to jump or turn.  That means you can't let go of the left button and immediately hold down right and expect to turn.  You won't.  In fact, if you immediately press right after holding left, the game may sometimes glitch and keep making you walk left.Same thing with jumping.  If your character is, for any reason, in the middle of standard movement - you will NOT be able to jump.  Yes, that does mean that if you are being pushed forward by an enemy, you CANNOT JUMP.  In certain situations this very much seems to be a bug.  Now, I admit, I'm not the best player, but 1 to 2 out of every 5 deaths feels like I was cheated.This is a cute game, though, and if you are able to drop a gamepad and walk away from a cheated death, then you can deal with this game.

												A very good metroidvania game. Don't turn it down if you don't like the anime style, there's more onto it. Some may find it difficult.Story: 5/10Not the focus of the game, but the characters are interesting. The dialogues are funny. The ending was a big surprise!Gameplay: 10/10Fast paced. Controls very well, with keyboard or with the controller. Time control is a very good feature that works well. So many secrets too! You'll have to play a lot if you want to get them all. Some are required to finish the game, and even more to speedrun it, so it's a bad thing if you don't like hunting them.Graphics and Design: 8/10Beautiful pixelated graphics, the enemies and bosses look awesome. SFX are your very generic doujin game ones.Music: 6/10You can choose between arranged and original versions. Not great, but not bad soundtracks, but what matters is that they fit nicely. Just like in GundeadliGne, other game by Platine Dispositif also translated and published by Rockin' Android.Overall:10/10 if you like the fast paced gameplay and hunting secrets.7/10 for the average person.5/10 for someone who would turn it down because of the anime style.Bad game for someone who would be underwhelmed by the fast pace.

												The Year is 1999X. Thermomewclear power: a modern scientific marvel that allows free clean energy for all of bunnykind. This safe and renewable energy was the perfect solution, until the Thermomewclear Power Plant blew up and cursed poor Bunny with a pair cat ears. Still retaining her long lapine ears as well, she is vexed by the fact that no one can tell if she is a rabbit or a cat. She even went as far as to seek the aid of a wise old bunny, but unfortunately he was brutally murdered by a rampaging bull and has left Bunny stranded in the cave of the 7 devils. If you think sounds mightily effed up, you are probably right, but no matter. It is time for Bunny to set forth and kick some devilish♥♥♥♥♥Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils is a classic example of the tried and true Metroidvania formula. It was created pretty much singlehandedly by Murasame of Platine Dispositif (aside from voicework), and like his other works the game can be punishingly hard at times. The original release was only in Japan, with 4:3 graphics and a midi-ish soundtrack. However this localization offers many enhancements over the original release, such as new widescreen graphics coded in by Murasame, a wild soundtrack arrangement by Woofle, and a fresh English translation.When starting BMD the first thing you'll notice is the lush hand-drawn anime graphics. The next thing you'll notice is that you can't walk to the right. You must first walk to the left a few steps to collect ""The Gears of The Past"" to be able to turn around. This quirky bit of humor quite obviously pokes fun at the general mechanics of the Metroidvania genre, and trust me when I say that a whole lot more will be lampooned before you finish the game. The game even pokes fun at you (and then throws a viciously hard boss your way) for sequence breaking. Yes, the large-foreheaded first boss lady will fly off the handle if you skip her.Now despite the amusing jokes and cliches blown out of proportion, the gameplay in Bunny Must Die is your standard Metroidvania exploration with plenty of Castlevania-style combat. You also gain the ability to bend time to your will, and that opens a whole new dimension in gameplay and puzzle solving. I should note though that no matter how good you are at this sort of game, you WILL die often. Just go into this adventure knowing that fact and you will have a good time. The way we learn is by making mistakes, right? And sometimes being repeatedly run over by a turret-tank while it fires laser beams up your♥♥♥♥♥♥is a learning experience too.Rockin' Android has definitely gone all-out in the process of making Bunny Must Die a breakout title for the western world. They have go so far as to give the options to use the original graphical mode and soundtrack, despite the overhaul that is provided by default. This speaks volumes of their dedication to customer satisfaction, and to their preservation of the original product's values. Just as with the Gundemonium Collection, Rockin' Android has taken an already awesome property and further polished it to gleam like a diamond and stand out on it's own in the rough sea of indie games.So to recap: Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils offers frenetic platforming, Metroidvania-inspired exploration, kickass brutal bosses, a rocking re-arranged soundtrack, a superbly localized and hilarious story, a cute as heck main character, a super secret hidden character with a second playthrough, and tight controls that ensure that if you screw up, it's your own damn fault. What the heck are you waiting for? Bust out your favorite gamepad, buy the game, and kick some demonic patootie! Bunny's fate depends on YOU!			"

												I was searching through the Greenlight section for games and this game stuck out to me, decided to buy it and give it a chance and I have no regret on it at all. The game is very good in my opinion and honestly, made me think I was playing a type of Metroid game, has quite a lot of similarities with Metroid, achievements/challenges for beating the game in a certain time with having all items collected, items/health to be found scattered in obvious and secret areas, bosses that are needed to beat to obtain items to open the next path, even a different suit that is purple and makes you stronger and take less damage, just like the Gravity Suit. When I had gone a few rooms to the right, I instanly thought of a similarity to Brinstar on Metroid Zero Mission, Dark King's Lair reminded me of the depths of Norfair from Zero Mission and there is even one dungeon further on in the game that will reminded you of Metroid games and Tourain (you'll know when you get there.) But enough about comparing this to Metroid, this game is hard at times as some of the bosses can be tricky the first time you fight them and you will need some quick reflixes on certain areas of the game. Overall it's not bad at all, didn't think it would be as enjoyable as it is. Controls weren't hard to get used to, lots of items to collect, soundtrack was done pretty good, nice boss battles that can be difficult or easy depending on how you go about the game and what items you have, another character to play as once you beat the game with her own story as well. Achievements in this game are quite the challenge on some of them, but that's what makes the game better, so if you're the type of person who likes challenges or going for harder achievements like me, then this will be perfect for you. I will say though, this game is going to bring back the older days with me, going back to speed runs which I haven't done in a long time. Amazing game, very enjoyable and very satisfied with my purchase.			"

												This game is very much like Super Metroid and Cave Story with some bullet hell action thrown in. The movement is fast and the controls are really sharp (takes a bit to get used to at first) but works well since it has some pretty hardcore platforming challenges. The sound track is amazingly well done.			"

												Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils is a metroidvania platformer made by Platine Dispostif, who are known mainly thanks to their bullet hell games Gundemonium and Hitogata Happa. How did the developers manage the genre change?The level design is in metroidvania style, with semi-open world where you are unlocking rooms of previous zones to progress further. What stands out with the game is definitely the sweet visual anime pixelart style that looks great, considering also the well-made animations. Chelsea and her moves look great!The unique gameplay mechanics the game offers, is the option to control time. You can stop or rewind the time, and you'll have to use it for few puzzles; in other cases it's a great utility skill for combat. But don't expect spamming those skills, you have very limited resources to slow time, so you can't affect the time for more than few seconds.Weapon system in the game feels weird, as you are finding weapons through the levels, but you can have only one weapon at time and you can't swap to the previous weapon. You have to hope you'll find your favourite sword or boomerang soon again.What ruins the whole impression from the game is the controls. They are terribly clunky, you'll miss jumps pretty often. To dash, you have to quickly double tap the movement key which usually badly reacts in shorter ranges to jump. Blocking is made, as it feels like a tradition for Japanese platformers, by tapping the specific movement direction in the moment of impact.Conclusion:Bunny must die, and she will die a lot. Sometimes because of higher difficulty, sometimes because you couldn't get her movement fully in control. Ability to control the time is nice but it doesn't change the fact that this is mediocre platformer with bad impression because of clunky controls.			"

												Pretty addicting game with awesome soundtrack. However, it's very hard, so if you're more of a casual player you might want to download the demo first to see if it's too much for you. Also, while the new music isn't really that bad on its own, you MIGHT want to change the soundtrack to the original in the options menu; it's a whole new experience with the old music because it actually fits to the environment incredibly well, which is something the arranged versions don't do, and it also feels classic because it uses Yamaha XG as its synth, which helps in a game with this style. Of course, some music like the intro and the first area themes are changed quite a bit (probably because of copyright stuff), but it isn't too much of a problem.Also, for those who are complaining about the controls: Git gud. Seriously.			"

												This is a really fun and goofy metroidvania developed single handedly by a Japanese developer. I dont like using the term ""metroidvania,"" but that is preciesely how this game functions. It feels like it was developed during the SNES/Genesis era, which makes me happy. (Slight digression: this is as opposed to the many indie games out there today which use sprite-art and chip-tune sound effects, but dont feel like retro games in the slightest.)I will admit, I have not yet finished the game as of writing this review. But I have played through a good portion of it, and I enjoy it thoroughly. It's light-hearted nature and authentic retro feel always brings a smile to my face when playing.Put the sound track and visuals on ""classic"" and enjoy!			"

												This game is super fun. Attention to detail in level design is epic. Dying, although frustrating and rage-inducing at times, often made me go ""Huh, that was... cleverly planned death!"".Controls became comfortable after 30-ish minutes - after that it was just.. how it was and should have been. There are slip-ups, fails, platform misses, but what game of this genre doesn't have them?The art is great, at least the original (haven't played enchanced on principle, ♥♥♥♥ Rockin' Android for replacing the cat!).Bunny path is the easy one, in Chelsea path things become quite confusing and i still haven't finished it.I really, really, REALLY recommend this game to anyone, who likes challenging platformers, ""metroidvanias"", marios, castlevanias or what have you.10/10 would skip first devil again.

												The idea they had is likely ""Mega Man if it was a kawaii Metroidvania"". There's also devil controls and hell platforming. This could and should be a much more fun game if the controls were reworked, as well as if display modes and widescreen were ever going to be fixed. I hear there's been a lot of improvements and some added content with the PS4/Vita versions, so I'd probably suggest you get one of those versions first if you have access to the platforms. If you don't, wait for a deep discount and maybe keep Xpadder on hand.			"

												You play as Bunny, who got stuck in the Devils Labyrinth and is trying to find a cure for her cat-ear curse. As you navigate through the labyrinth, you have to fight enemies, get through obstacles and puzzles, fight bosses and find items to power up and unlock new places to go to.The game is a pretty solid metroidvania game. It rarely has a ""What do i do next?"" moment. It has no indicators as to where to go next, but the items and minimap make most of these things clear. The music is great. I liked both the original and remixed soundtrack. The game is propperly translated, which allows non-japanese players to join in on the nonsensical humor this game provides.Bunny Must Die also features an unlockable second character, with her own story and gameplay mechanics, doubling the fun of this game. The story of Bunny and this other character are sequels, and explains some mysteries in Bunny her storyline. It also has some room for skipping/sequence breaking, adding some replay value for hardcore gamers. Doing so will cause certain events to act different as well (like the 1st boss getting a different dialogue and becoming more difficult).Unlike regular metroidvania games, Bunny Must Die also introduces some elements of bullet hell shooters. People who played the Gundemonium series will recognize some elements that have been copied from the other games. These extra elements make this game quite difficult on certain points. Although I wouldn't label it as insanely difficult, the game gets very tough at some later points in the game.			"

												If it weren't for the HORRIBLE controls and momentum I would say it is a decent game. The soundtrack is fine, it looks cute and the power ups from what I have seen so far (yeah the controls are so horrible I didn't even bother to finish it) are pretty good. But THE MOST important thing in a platformer is handled really badly here. Trust me you will WISH you had Classic castlevania controls here. Because while yes you can technicly control your jump in mid air (its awkward though) just the slightest amount of momentum will send you in a non stop until you hit a wall or ground fly. This game is really vertical in terms of level design and because of these controls you will either fall down to where you started or slugh through the sections. Attacking is really awkward too. You hold down and rapid fires ok not bad but here is the thing , I guess because the developers wanted to make sure you don't skip their animations (which are detailed yes) , you are not allowed to even TURN AROUND while attacking or until bunny finishes her animation!Don't play this , these controls are just too bad and you WON""T get use to them. At least with old school castlevania the moment you get over the stiff jump you are good to go but with this no thanks.			"

												Bunny Must Die! is a cute metroidvania exponent, as we call this genre today, but you sensibly consider it a Metroid clone - design is quite similar to Nintendo's classic title. It is enjoyable for its audiovisual style, but only if you are accustomed to some japanese excesses - the style is bizarre and exaggerated. Even its game design is appreciable. But what ruins everything is its control and collision system. Collisions are very stiff and controls are terribly inaccurate - sometimes you'll work hard to execute some simple movements like to climb down from a platform or to turn your character in the opposite way. This aspect makes the game extremely frustrating and in my opinion destroys all the good the game could have to offer - soon things get very hard, and you won't tolerate all this impreciseness.			"

												Game's fun, but too hard for me. The controls are... difficult. Not bad. Difficult. Everything is very precise. There are many different ways to jump, dashes, etc. Once you get the hang of them they're fine. It takes awhile admittedly but the game's difficulty is much more manageable at that point albeit still difficult. It does have some nasty difficulty spikes in several rooms however. I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to beat the final boss without a lot of tries.Other than that the game's presentation is pretty nice. Music's fine. Like the sprites. The time mechanic is pretty neat although early on it feels like the bar is way way too short. Overall quite good for a doujin game.  I'd recommend it if you enjoy the challenge.			"

 NOTE: THIS GAME IS A 2-PACK. All Intel on the second will be in italics to avoid confusion. Both of these games are amazing, hands down. BMD is a major cross between castlevania, prince of persia, and metroid. Your main character, Bunny, has entered the devil's labyrinth to get rid of some cat ears on her after a thermomewclear blast. Her main specialty: the ability to alter time! You simply pause at first, but you get the ability to revive(at the cost of a certain collectible), rewind everything else, and even slow it down! This all culminates in the final battle against  Chelsea, the protagonist of the 2nd game.	  If you have collected most of the items beforehand, something BIG happens. all in all, a beautiful and hilarious experience.  C7D is another ball game, however. Instead of stopping time, you build ladders, blast barriers down, Fight a foe that wasn't fought in BMD, and take on a massive final battle that has over 7 Freaking forms!	  "

												Not the worst game by any means, but given the fact so many games better for $10 makes it a hard sell. First off you need to pickup abilities, for example the firt thing you will think is your joystick isnt working, she only runs forward, you need to pickup an ability when you first start the game. Not a bad thing, just a strange way of playing a platformer to me. When started the game in fullscreen, the screen was black, had to go into the compatability settings and ""run in 640x480 screen resolution"" not a big issue, but its hard to recommmend a game that doesnt work out of the box. If you like oldschool platformers its a gem, but only at a discounted price.			"

												Currently I am still attempting to finish this game, but I figured I would give my two cents.If you're looking for a ""Metroid-Vania"" style game, this game is probably for you. It is a platforming game where you explore different areas. Collecting power-ups such as dashing or wall-jumping opens up new areas of the game. Collecting different sub-weapons allows you to deal with enemies and bosses. You also have the ability to control time. You have to figure out how to progress to new areas using a combination of these elements. The puzzles that you have to solve are well thought out and give you a great sense of accomplishment once you figure them out. The game also has hidden areas and secrets that encourage players to look at every nook and cranny of the game, further extending gameplay. Enemies and bosses have a lot of charm to them despite the anime look. Unfortunately all of these great things about the game are hampered by really bad controls. I practically have a laundry list of all the problems with the controls. The following talks about my experience using a controller:-Jumping: If you are moving on the ground and then jump at the same time, you do a spin jump. When you make this jump, the height of your jump is fixed. On the other hand, if you are standing still and then jump, you can control the height of the jump and can actually jump higher than a spin jump. This can get irritating because if I'm trying to reach a high platform that is ahead of me, I have to stop, jump, and then move forward.Another problem I have with jumping is the fact that while you are in the air, you can move left or right regardless of the type of jump you perform, but you cannot change the direction you are facing while in the air. This ties in to the next problem I have.-Wall jumping: When you approach a wall you want to jump on, you have to make sure that you are facing the wall when you are in the air. If you accidently fall and are trying to recover by jumping off a wall you are not facing, frustration occurs. Another problem that I personally have is that if you press the direction opposite the wall the moment after jumping off said wall, you perform a dash instead of jumping higher. This creates a problem for me because if I'm trying to getting to higher ground between two walls, I have to make sure I'm pressing the correct direction on time and make it to the walls. More often than not I perform a dash instead of jumping higher. I've seen videos of people getting higher by doing wall jumps off the same wall repeatedly, but for the life of me I cannot replicate the technique due to the precision required to perform such a move. -Attacking: With a majority of the weapons, you cannot change directions until the attack animation is done. This applies when the player is on the ground as well as in the air. What makes this inconsistent is the fact that when you are on the ground you can angle your attack upwards or downwards, but if you want to switch between left and right, you have to wait for the attack animation to finish before you can turn. You can jump while attacking but cannot move left or right. I personally feel that auto-fire is being discouraged in the game.-Blocking: This one isn't really such a big deal to me than I first thought. You have to push any direction at the moment before getting hit. I think I would prefer to have this assigned to one of the shoulder buttons instead. This is a very fun and challenging game, and there are a lot of great things going for it. However, if I have to think about the controls all the time as I am playing it, it means that I cannot enjoy all of the other aspects of the game. The controls are inconsistent and need considerable improvement. I understand that there are people who have been able to play the game with these controls, meaning it is not impossible to complete this game 100%. This game requires a lot of practice and precision, I get it. Regardless, I cannot recommend this game unless the controls are changed.			"

												The controls of this game seem tight at first, but the game actually has a horrible counter intuitive jumping system. And then most of the game is frantic precise jumping through timed traps. I really like hard sidescrolling platmormers like this, but this one is difficult and frustrating for the wrong reasons.			"

												""What a cute game is this?"", was my first impression of it. That was before I went through an hell of a pain! Nonetheless, this game has quite a bunch of things that makes you want to play it, even if it's ungodly hard for first timers.~Graphics~This game offer you two sprites graphics for who prefer older graphics or revamped graphics. 16bits and 32bits era. Both have usefulness, since the hud change, and other things. The graphics is well made for a simple platforming game and it's quite pretty!~Gameplay~It's a really fast paced game. You must react to every situation really quick. You can do several stuff after getting the items spreaded throughout the game, like metroid's game. (E.g. Dash Shoes/Red Shoes, would be a similar item for Speed Booster.)  Even if the game is quite harsh in the way you can heal yourself, that fast paced gameplay doesn't get old at all!~Controls~Oh god, they are wonky in someways. It takes a while to get the hang of it. Whenever you do anything, until you land on the ground (if you are on the ground, it's the same too), you have to wait until the character finish her animation to either move around, jump or attack again. As I said and many others, it takes a while to get used to it. They aren't as bad as they seems. Just tricky to get the hold of it. Once you get it, you will be dashing through everything like it's nothing.~Summery~(This game is good. 'Nuff said.) That's what I would like to say in a very short fashion, but I cannot do simple stuff like that, right?Basically, if you like metroid games, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this one. Be prepared to die a lot though. Don't let your rage meter get ahold of yourself. It's normal to die in this game, it was meant this way. Just keep going, and save Bunny!			"

												Ive just picked up the game and Its pretty fun so far. I wouldn't say its a bad game but its not good eaither. This game tends to re-use a lot of the same sound effects repeatedly and it makes the game look really lazy. I should not that Bunny Must Die has really weird physics when it come down to jumping, dashing, and any sort of movment feels very clunky and akward for a platformer metroidvania game. The only thing I can say is really well done is its soundtrack. In short, I would stay away from this game.			"

												Bad, floaty controls with weird momentum and odd jumping mechanics. Plus the only way i could get it to work was in Win95 compatability windowed mode on Win10. Come to find out there is a console port but tthe Steam version doesnt get any updates is annoying.Heres what i mean by odd jumping mechanics:A to jump highest. -> + A does a spin jump but is not as high. -> -> + A does a dash jump which is lower but covers more ground. So for example, when you get to a ledge that is high instead of just holding down A like most games you have to line yourself up to edge, jump, THEN move forward. Its weird and doesnt make sense.  "

												Bunny Must DIe is an incredible hybrid of Thestrategy required in the Cstlevania titles and the exploration element of the Metroid titles, the quintessential Metroidvania if you will. It has an interestig back drop to its amazing music and its challenging yet addictive gameplay. This game is an incredibly challenging experience yet it is also fair at the same time and it just requires you to take different approaches to each situation. If you have disliked modern day hand holding in games then I cannot think of a game I would reccomend more.Full Review Here http://www.gamefaqs.com/PC/944518-bunny-must-die-chelsea-and-the-7devils/reviews/157002 "

												Overall impression, it's a decent game with a few caveats. Things I liked:+ Music+ Varied Bosses+ Sprite workThings I hated:- ControlsThus far, the game has been pretty fun but there would be a lot less ""cheap deaths""  (for lack of a better phrase) if the controls were more responsive. It's the little things, for example: the slight delay between changing directions and the accompanying automatic camera scroll, fairly easy to get temporarily ""locked"" into a certain direction when attacking, etc.Jumping is a somewhat odd affair. Most platformers will gradually scale your height proportional to how long you hold the button down irrespective what you are doing.In this game, your jump control depends on your current preceding action:Standing Still: Behaves like conventional platformer, you can control height of jumpWalking/Dashing: No control over jump height. Pressing jump always results in highest possible jump, which can be extremely frustrating.Basically, if you're getting this game with the expectation of a precision platformer (like a Meat Boy, They Bleed Pixels, or Super House of Dead Ninjas), you're going to be disappointed. On the other hand, if you treat it like it is, a solid action platformer with controls more akin to rigid-style type games like the old Castlevania games, I think you'll enjoy it for the most part.

												First off shoutouts to NakaTeleeli or I wouldn't even know this was a thing.  This is by far one of the best Matroidvania titles I have ever played.  Gameplay is always fresh and new items and mechanics are introduced at a good pace.  The learning curve is steep at first but once you get used to the gameplay you can have a lot of fun with this.  The music is good, and the enemies are immaginative.  The only issue I have with this game at all is with a change to a gameplay mechanic with a certain set of items in the ""second quest"" (for lack of a better spoiler free term) but going into detail about it is a bit of a spoiler...so I won't.  That being said the issue I have is nothing that would cause me to regret geetting this game and it shouldn't stop you from enjoying it.Play this if you like: Quirky humor, Super Metroid, Catz "

												While I want to really like it, and I sort of do, this game is just too frustrating for me to really want to continue it to the end.Now I know that I'm really just supposed to Git Gud, because it's not that the game is really bad or anything... It's just that the controls and the way the character handles are just so much of a puzzle to keep up with.The game is almost literally Metroid Castlevania, and I do like these types of games. You start underpowered, unable to even walk to the right until you get a powerup... Wall candles that break to give you stuff and weapons, and upgrades that give you health, new abilities, etc.The ""story"" of Bunny Devil Sin: Stacies First Day Out, is obviously purposely half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as a kind of joke. Much of the intro and cutscenes and other dialogue boxes show a somewhat cheesy comedic aspect, probably designed to make fun of how ridiculous situations and universes are that a lot of video game characters live in. It's dumb, but it's meant to be dumb, and that's fine.The graphics are very well done, nice animation and sprite work. The sound effects are OK, if a little annoying and cheesy, but the music is nice and well done.Of course though, my biggest gripe with the game is the archaic controls and movement for the player character. You can't change direction in mid-air or during a spinning jump, which means no turning around to change direction or shoot. That would normally be ok, but there are like 3 or four different kinds of jumping, with the most useful one being jumping from standing still. The sprinting/dash jump goes far but isn't tall. OK, that's understandable, but when you are walking left or right your jump will be just too short to get onto ledges for some reason, meaning you will have to run up to walls, and then stand still against them, jump, AND THEN press left or right. You can't really press any other buttons before you jump if you wanna get up, you have to jump THEN move... Which is the kind of stuff that games like Action 52 taught us was bullhonkey.There's so many things I was irked about in just an hour of play I could probably write a million more paragraphs just about the awkward movement, but I'll at least try to wrap my qualms with the movement up. Walking to the edge of a ledge will give you a little push-back so that you don't fall off. That's cool in a lot of platformers, but there's such a large area it considers you will fall off of that it just seems more restrictive and janky than anything else. Most games would at least let one of the characters feet dangle off the ledge, but not here. You can't just start shooting to the left if you have already started shooting to the right. Once you start shooting you can hold down and aim in a couple of angles up and down. But if an enemy gets behind you as you were trying to spray at them, you have to stop shooting, finish the animation, get up, and move five feet in the other direction to turn the character around so you can shoot the other way. By that time the boss has usually done another swoop over your head back to where you were aiming before... And lastly, the multiple weapons in the game, and how you obtain them. The variety of weapons is cool, and a lot of them have various uses... but... The way that you get them is so obtuse that you will go out of your way to try NOT to get the next new weapon since you don't even know when you will get it, or how useful it will be. Weapons drop out of a certain few candles mixed into the environment along with ones that recharge time meter stuff, but they don't look any different than the normal ones, and once you pick up that weapon you are stuck with it until you either find a new one or go back to a candle you've memorized has a weapon, and get it back there. I understand that this mechanic is basically just Castlevania, but it seems like a decent idea from Castlevania that was just taken and poorly implemented. This game isn't arcade-y at all really, and the weapon you pick up is your ONLY weapon, not a secondary one. If the candles looked different than the others, or you could keep and switch through them, or something... It's just such a weird choice to have certain weapons only hidden in certain candles in certain places and once you pick one up you can't even change it unless you backtrack.I think my last gripe along with all of that, is just that every time you die it kicks you back to the main menu. Why. Having to do everything again from your last save-point is fine... But why do I have to go back to the main menu to load them? Why not just respawn at them right after you die...Overall, it IS a good game, just... uh... not for me I guess... The controls and movement physics are just too puzzling and confusing to really get a hang of for me, and it's almost like every mechanic of this game was designed to stop the flow of combat and platforming that would normally be in a game like Metroid. It's expected to go fast a lot of the time, but you are made to stop every five seconds to correct a jump, or kill an annoying enemy, or to just try to figure out one simple thing that shouldn't be so complicated when plenty of other games did the same stuff so fluently... Ah well.Oh yeah, and theres this time stopping/reversing mechanism, but it's just not too... enticing or incentivizing to use. Stopping time runs out very quickly, controls are still as clunky as before, you can't attack, and you can still be damaged. Reversing time doesn't seem to have much of a use outside of a few puzzles that have doors close too quickly to run through. You can't even rewind time to revive yourself.Just too clunky of an action platformer for me. I'm sure the mechanics and controls can be memorized and perfected through time, but I'm an easily confused individual and even if I did memorize them I would constantly be miss-pressing and messing up things. Though even memorization of the controls still wouldn't rectify some of the other questionable issues that this game has.			"

												The controls are way too unintuitive and make platforming a nightmare to the point of just moving around in the simple looking rooms in the starting area is already a challenge. They are of an ancient time this game isn't part of, so there is no excuse for such terrible controls. It is just not fun. Crough and press jump to do a quick dodge to the back, jump to jump, use a direction and then jump to move left or right while a jump, but you lose some height and are therefore unable to get to most places... jump and then use a direction to keep facing the same side... use a direction and jump with some specific timing and use the attack button at the same time to do a circle attack... The game is way too vertical from what I've seen, with almost non-existent horizontal play. Cliffs have an ""auto-fall"" kind of feature so that the character runs over an edge by itself to drop down... Moving platforms with weird timers... Using a direction or something when getting hit by an attack to deflect it... and like in many games this is very confusing because it doesn't seem to be working every time, to the point of forgetting how to do it in the first place... The ""stop time"" feature fading off very quickly and feels a bit mandatory so it's more of an annoyance than a cool power for the few minutes I had the patience to play this game... And the enemies are always placed where it totally looks like the perfect spot so it looks like you have to glitch to take them down so you just spam the hell out of the circle attack to throw AoE instead of fixed horizontal attacks that can hardly hit anything and exposes the character to the enemies. It's just bad.			"

												With one of the longest titles in video game history, Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils is a 2D platforming action adventure with rigid and terrible controls that get in the way of any fun there could be. On the surface its a good looking game and I think that's all there needs to be. You fight a giant cat, you wear a bunny girl costume while platforming a labyrinth and there's a button to take a selfie screenshot. Does a game need more than that to sell it? There is plenty of old school charm with the visuals, a few items to collect like running shoes and the game's time mechanic that lets you freeze time around Bunny and halt traps. Other games have done it better, but the genre itself is popular enough where any game in it becomes a must own.When you start the game for the first time, you're given a choice what type of game window you'd like and you had better make the right choice because you're only asked once. Making the wrong choice gives you a black screen with music. You can sometimes remedy this by pressing Right, Right, Z and then Right, Right, Right, Up, Z. Otherwise just go digging through the game's .ini file to solve the problem. Perhaps that's a Windows 10 issue, but its still a giant issue.The real problem is that its tough to control Bunny. Movement feels stiff and you're either attacking or moving, never both at once. There is no duck attack, but rather Bunny will attack down at an angle. She can also attack up and up at an angle. Another limitation is when you're attacking, there is no way to turn around. You need to stop attacking, move the other way and risk bumping into an enemy if they are close enough.If you try to nudge your way off of a platform, if you do it too slight, she will correct herself back on the platform. This feels like a glitch to just disappear and move ten pixels over to safety. On the other hand, there are plenty of blind jumps with the potential for death spikes below. To compensate, you can halt all movement and push down and after a moment the screen with scroll down to show you spikes. Plus, the item icons can obscure what's below even if they're a bit transparent. The list of items seems unnecessary since you never have to switch between them.Oh but then there are other blind challenges, such as flying enemies that shoot and gravity takes their projectiles downward to you. They can fire at you from off screen and it adds to the challenge, but only because movement is so stiff.Once you earn the running shoes, you can dash with a double tap in one direction. The dash is quick and you can jump kick enemies with it, but the issue is that its easy to run by accident. Perhaps using a keyboard makes it less prone to issues, but I was using a 360 controller.Bunny is a game with several weapons and she can only hold one at a time. Some are interesting, others are basic like throwing swords. Rather than a gun they are swords. She can get a slashing sword that is borderline useless since its easier to kill enemies from a distance with anything else. There are boomerangs which are always cool to have in any game and even a giant mace that will come back at you. Using the mace almost turns into an orbiting shield. The only downside is you need to catch the mace again to use it.To get these weapons you need to break candles, which is fine because other games have done it before. The issue is if you are close enough to a candle and a weapon drops, that weapon is yours. The old weapon should be dropped so you have a choice. While weapons only pop out of specific candles I found myself getting a weapon by accident and I'd need to backtrack to get the weapon I did want.One of the interesting facets of the game is the jump mechanic. Its just as rigid as movement, but when you just jump, its a tall jump, but when you leap in a direction, Bunny spins around. When you spin and attack she will throw weapons in a spiral. Well except the mace. The mace can destroy red projectiles, while other weapons can only take out blue ones. This is helpful for boss fights.As for the bosses, the early fights feel laughable and easy. Just stand and spam your projectile. One boss managed to never hit me, despite standing in front of it and never moving. Perhaps that was just a boss rather than one of the 7 devils. Major bosses incorporate a cut scene, but I was never invested in the story. The title says more than what you need to know.The time mechanic feels underutilized. Time will stop everything but Bunny and her mace. It stops your projectiles, that is except for the mace, but the catch is the mace cannot damage enemies when time is stopped. The game attempts to make more use of the time mechanic by letting you hold the button to reverse time, yet I was never able to get it to work except for a few occasions. Even then it only respawns candles and enemies I had destroyed. If there's anything that needs explaining, there are several signs with hints. Things like freeze time to jump on a platform, freeze time to disable a trap and double tap a direction to run and jump a gap.Death in the game is a true annoyance, because its game over and you're kicked out into the main menu where you must continue from your last save. This is a ridiculous punishment for a tough to control game. I would think that a mechanic that lets you reverse time would spare you from death, but no; Bunny needs to be alive to reverse time. That feels like a missed opportunity and the entire game feels like missed opportunities. You have a time stopping mechanic yet there are no puzzles beyond find an orb to open a door. You collect items so fast and furious it makes me feel like the game is devoid of content.Saving will restore health and your time powers. When you save it adds time to your run, so for experts, there is reason to run through the game with minimal saves. Collecting purple triangles that spray out of defeated foes and candles will refill your time meter. There are a few collectibles that will increase your time meter as well.Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils is a game that needed more time on the fun and less time on the graphics. The art and style help sell it, but its a tough game to play or enjoy for that matter. At the price tag, a night with this bunny feels like a risky proposition.			"

Product received for free
												Bunny must die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils is an amazing action platformer that heavily focuses on metroidvania elements... On second thought, scrap that, this game is the best definition of ""Metroidvania Done Right"" I have played this far!I never expected to enjoy this title that much and it's way bigger than I ever expected! Essentially you get 2 quite similar games, as your first playthrough will be with Bunny (who will die tons of times!) and after you finish her story, you will unlock Chelsea and her story! The map will be similar for both playthroughs, but there will be numerous variations to keep it spicy, as the 2 heroines have different abilities! The game is difficult as it will require precision and eye to hand coordination to beat some rooms and observation skills for others, as some exits can be reached only through certain use of skills, as they are either hidden or blocked. In short you will use all mechanics the game has to offer to their fullest or die trying! As I said, the game is an excellent example of what the metroidvania genre is supposed to be and it achieves that in numerous ways. From the lovely pixelated graphics, to the numerous upgrades you will find for each character (Bunny starts without the ability to move to the right, which she gets almost immediately), the various weapons each unique to its usage and the splendid level design, where you'll get the feeling that every block placed is there for a reason! The games greatly promotes you to explore each room, as in order to progress the story you will have to go back to previous areas quite many times. Also you will have to use your observation skills to find hidden items or even rooms, that most of the time will have some upgrade, thus making your time hitting each and every wall to be rewarded, sometimes however these rooms can be frustratingly well hidden, I found one after accidentally breaking some spikes! Besides the difficulty of precision platforming the games difficulty does not stop there. The bosses and minibosses are difficult at first and will reward you with reduced difficulty, for trying different weapons or approaches, each will have its own moveset and sometimes environmental mechanics to either aid you or make your life harder! After having encountered 7 bosses and minibosses there is not even one that I do not remember!The game is visually pleasing with both the original and the remixed graphics and while the original music didn't give me the idea that it complements the action of the game, the sounds effects do that so well that I almost forgot the soundtrack! After that I noticed that besides the new visuals the game also featured a new soundtrack that essentially delivered me what I wanted, boosting what happening in each room! If you are an anime fan the sound effects will put a smile on your face and keep it there even in the most gruesome deaths! I strongly recommend setting the subtitle options to full, as quite many times the game can be a bit humorous, from the bosses dialogues to when you collect a weapon or upgrade (when you get the very first upgrade, the ability to move to the right, the item note says 'The game can be completed without this item, but it's quite tedious...). You can get a small taste of the humor by watching the into to the story!As far as controls go, they can be fully customized and, at first, will feel a bit weird, clunky and the jumping a bit delayed. However you will get used to them quite fast, as the best way to learn something is to repeat it, and you gonna repeat a lot of this game by dying!The negative parts are that once you die, you are thrown back to the main menu, where you need to select again to load your game, instead of automatically loading the last saved game. The game has serious compatibility issues with windows 10 as you will be unable to play if you set it to full screen mode. Thankfully you can find some good suggestions and solutions on steams community forums on how to deal with this issue. Finally the game tutorials are really lackluster as they are mostly signs through the game with some tips. While generally on this kind of game I do not expect any kind of tutorial, my playthrough became a lot easier when I accidentally left the game idle on main menu and showed me the 'demonstration' gameplay. Also I recommend you to view the in game manual for the moveset of the character. Finally, while this should not affect my judgement of the game, a warning. Bunny must die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils will come on PS4 and PSvita and it will feature additional content, from bosses and levels to abilities and in game shop. At the moment I have zero info of if and when this update will come to steam, so if you are a completionist, want the full experience this game can offer and you own one of these 2 consoles you may want to get it there when its out.Overall Bunny must die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils is a must play for any platformer/metroidvania fan out there. It will keep you occupied for a lot more than you would expect!-------------------------------------------I recieved this game by the steamified group.For similar reviews and great giveaways feel free to visit http://www.steamified.com "

												This would be a fine game, but there is one very important problem: The controls are actively out to kill you.  Aiming certain weapons is a pain, the general feel is that everything is wonky and incredibly picky about when it wants to work. If the game controlled a bit better, maybe I could reccommend it as a decent metroidvania-type game, but with how clunky and picky these controls are, I'd say just save your money until it's on sale for a stupidly low price or put it toward a better game.

												Edit: It was a joke review guys, how did this thing receive upvotes?Turn on the purple bunny suit, huge boobs! Yeessssssss!A catgirl bunnygirl. She is normally flat, but man when she puts on that purple suit her hooters get huggggeeeee.I mean I like big breasts and curves, but them things go 'boing' and suddenly big ol tittays. Not to mention her ears are nice and adorable. The purple suit makes her 'heavier' for obvious reasons (her boobaloobs are large) which makes her capable of many things. I rather enjoy the purple suit and wish there was also a blue suit for even larger melons. I suppose the added weight might be a bit much though, but still.Also did I mention curves too? She's gets pretty curvy. She's bordering on cute and sexy so I'm totally down with that too, but the main feature is those boobs jumping up and trying to escape her top. Everyone is staring hoping to see them slip out. Course the game isn't porn so that shouldn't happen and I'm not huge into that kind of stuff anyway. Just the lucious line in between them. Beautiful cleavage.She has white hair. Did I mention that? Also there's other characters who are kind of hot, but I think the purple bunny suit keeps her at the 'largest', though I haven't been through the entire game so I don't know for sure. Things are kind of silly, I mean hello, giant breasts! I think I mentioned this but those boobs are great. I wish they'd bounce more when you jump. That'd be awesome and I'd record it and say 'lets see that again!' contantly.I didn't say anything about the actual game? Uhm...well whatever. The game doesn't matter. What really matters is busty bunny boobs.Anyway, the game plays sort of like a faster paced side scrolling platformer with minor RPG elements. The game is pretty damn good actually, but hurts my eyes are points. Music is ok, nothing amazing though. It has some odd elements in it and the story is off, but in a good kind of way. Also there's a ufo. Maybe they made the purple bunny suit? Have I mentioned her bulging breasts? Probably worth 10 bucks if you're a big side scroller fan. You might hold off till a sale though.			"

												This game looked appealing from the store page, but the controls are frustrating to the point of making the game almost unplayable to me. For a game with a similar premise where the controls are actually responsive, check out Rabi-Ribi instead.EDIT To expand on the problems a bit after spending a bit longer with the game:The problem is the mechanics of the controls.  In particular:First, when in an attack animation, including after releasing the attack button for most of a second, the character can't turn around, and the game ignores any attempt to do so.  This means that attempts to attack, stop attacking, and turn around, and then attack again often result in the second attack going the wrong direction because the directional input wasn't accepted.Second, the character doesn't stop moving in the air when you release the directional input.  You can turn them around by pressing the opposite direction, but the only way to jump off a platform and fall straight down onto one directly below is to do an incredibly awkward zig-zag, pressing left and right repeatedly all the way down.  This mechanic alone makes the platforming sections of the game way harder than they need to be.Either of these flaws taken alone would seriously reduce the enjoyability of the game, but taken together they are a total deal-breaker.  They're both awful design choices for a platformer, and they go directly against the expectations set by nearly every other game in the genre.Beyond the controls themselves, the game has a few other more forgivable flaws.  For example, it lacks any ""continue"" or ""reload from checkpoint"" facility.  In a game where death is frequent and expected, going through the extra two or three screens to load your save game from the title screen every time gets annoying quickly.  Also, as other reviews have noted, the weapon-switching system is based on random pick-ups that essentially erase your current weapon, many of them in central areas.  This often creates annoying avoid-the-powerup puzzles when you are simply trying to explore but don't want to lose your current weapon.			"

												An amazing game full of intresting levels, powerups, and plentry of content to explore. intresting bosses, gorgeous graphics, and an amazing soundtrack. you will often find that the levels are full of intresting enemies and unique designs, the open metroidvania style map makes for a lot of intresting exploration and many of the powerups are intresting and help with completing the game. aside from a few confusing moments in the game there is only one problem i have with the game, and that problem is a huge one. the controls are awful. in order to jump high you must first jump without holding forward (or you do a spin jump) and then hold forward to move forward, you find this happens a lot durring certain segments. you also need to double tap dash which makes dodging a chore and nightmarish late on in the game. combind that with very precise moments of platforming and you have a horrible experiance. i would not reccomend thsi game over other platformers in the genere.

												I played this game round about 3 years ago if I remember right, it was quite a lot of fun, so getting it on steam now is pretty cool, though I don't know if I'll bother to play through it again. Being able to play through the game with 2 different characters is an additional plus.And sure the controls aren't quite easy, but if they don't work out for you, maybe you should simply reassign the keys to a scheme that works better for you. At least that worked out perfectly for me, and I wouldn't call myself someone who loves overly hard games or controls.			"

												The controls could be a bit better, that's really my only complaint about this game. I feel like a lot of the difficulty is purely from the controls being kinda cumbersome. That said, I am totally addicted to this game. The music is awesome and I like the character art  a lot too. I prefer paying in 4:3 windowed mode so I can see all of the artwork, wide screen mode cuts the bottom of it off on the various title/status screens. "

												I've tried to play this 3 times and just can get myself to like it rather then a metroidvania this felt more like a game for speed runners. most of the reviews say its hard and comparing it to Dark souls but most of the difficulty would disappear if the controls where tighter. As is the controls are really sloppy and annoying and jumping is really floaty and there are moves that have the same button inputs thus causing action that you didn't mean to do Or ones you have difficulty doing quickly again.

												It's a Metroidvania and takes that term to a literal level also with gameplay being a mixture of Metroid and Castlevania (you even got the candles!). The game can be pretty hard also with how it adds bullet hell elements into the mix. The asthetics are very colourful and nice to look at and even the soundtrack, old or new can leaving a tune stuck in your head.Overall it's a very fun game and is also pretty zany. The difficulty might throw a fair lot of people off but it's still a game worth experiencing.			"

												This game is just what you think; a cute girl in a bunny suit doing platforming in a dungeon. What you don't expect however is that it gets incredibly difficult really fast. Coupled with the large map, exciting music, and awesome visuals, this game is definitely worth the price, sale or not.In terms of graphics, it's what pixel-based games should at least strive for. It's got depth, color, proportion, and detail; all things you'd see in 3D materials. Instead of going for realism, it aims for an eastern style similar to anime. While a turnoff for some, it's an interesting addition to the crazy details of other things in the area. The contrast between cute and girly and the detailed and fearsome monsters is easy to enjoy. There is one enemy who has two different appearances, one being a photo-realistic cat, and the other being a cartoony cat. You can choose the original or remastered versions in the options, with the photo-realistic cat being the original.In terms of music, it's hit or miss. The original soundtrack is amazing, having what sounds like midi music rather than orchestrated, while the remastered music is orchestrated with little hints of the original. I personally did not like the remastered music, as the original definitely sounded better in the settings. Both soundtracks differ, but you are bound to like one or the other, maybe both and never neither.Enemy variety is a bit lacking, as there's many reskinned pumpkin and clay zombie monsters. Likewise, there's two or three different colored turrets that shoot differently, and two spider tanks that do different attacks. Bosses have unique designs, and are pretty interesting. From a hot-headed fairy to a realistic cat, all the way to a girl with a pumpkin on her head. Let's not even talk about the nudist vampire with a revolver for a haircut, nor the tank you'd see in a bullet hell game. The bosses more than make up for the lack of fodder enemies.The puzzles are surprisingly easy, but many times you will flip out trying to figure out what to do. The use of dash, wall jump, and time stopping are almost required to do some puzzles, and then there's puzzles that require timed jumps, pausing and reversing time multiple times, and my favorite one; bouncing off of enemy heads over a lake of blue fire to get to a door that seals if you take any damage in that room. There's even hidden blocks that you will likely not expect, so walk against every wall to find them!Now we come to the bad aspects of the game.Controls. While limited to movement, jumping, attacking, and time power, there is a combo system that lets you control which time power to use by simply changing how you move, provided you have the powerup. Healing and slow motion time are the most valuable powers, and turning into Dynamite Bunny is also handy. How can these be bad? Because you have to be facing where you want to go every time. You can't dash until you turn and face where you want to go, you can't jump on enemy heads when spin jumping, you have to make sure that you time your movements and turns, and so on. There's also an ability that lets you block all damage, even from those spike pits. Only problem is that it randomly works, and never when you want it to.While I said it was a good aspect, some puzzles have ""You are stupid"" mechanics. There's a point where, to open a door, you have to place an item in a place you can't even see. In no way is it obvious, nor is there any hint of what to do. The worst puzzle is a hallway with an endless supply of invincible robot rabbits; you NEED to use a specific order of time abilities to prevent them from spawning, but as I pointed out in controls, it's incredibly difficult to do. If you have enough max health, you can just brute force your way through by dashing constantly after being hit, but that's definitely not the intended way.Story. NOTHING makes any sense. Game is supposed to be nonsensical, but for the sake of completing a full review, I'll touch on it. You play as Bunny, a bunny girl who was cursed with cat ears. She goes with a fat rabbit to the game's dungeon, and has to defeat seven devils to get rid of her curse. Fun fact; there's only 6 bosses, and the last boss is entirely unrelated to Bunny's plight. I will avoid spoilers, so I won't reveal who the villain at the end is, but if you have earned all the time power ups, you outright cancel the entire game's story. Not exactly a spoiler since it unlocks another game mode, but I'll stop here. Haven't beaten the second story, and doubt I will. It's absolutely hard.Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10. It has its flaws (CONTROLS CONTROLS CONTROLS), but disregarding them, the game is exceptionally fun. The difficulty is high, but not so much that a casual player couldn't beat it.If you want a Metroidvania game, this is definitely something to look into.			"

												Absolutly hated this game. Granted I am not much of a ""punish yourself till you cry"" type of gamer, but the controls and Metroid-esque jumping style just kills it for me. The story made little to no sense, but then again I couldn't finish the game. After viewing some gameplay videos of this game I couldn't have beaten Chelsea with Bunny anyway because I didn't collect enough power-ups, and I'll be damned if I go back and try and find them.If ""I Want to Be the Guy"" or ""Kazai Mario"" is your type of game, you'll probably love this. If bullet hell is your style of game, you might like this. If punish games + bullet hell sounds like heaven, then you just hit jackpot. If not, stay away. Far, far away.			"

												A fairly fun little metrovania, heavy on the action and with an emphasis on hardcore difficulty.The game is setup to encourage carefully thought out movement (see notes on controls below), but it is also targeted at speed-runners.The way the power-ups work has a very arcadey feel; eg. you can only have 1 weapon at a time, and get them from pickups.There is also a time stop/rewind mechanic, similar to things like Braid.The controls need an especial mention; if you look at many of the negative reviews here they will call them things like impercise or unresponsive. This is both a bit accurate and inaccurate. The controls are NOT impercise, they are high high percision; You can also easily make your character do many things: 'bunny' jump up, foward, and backwards, spin jump, attack up, foward, & diagonally, duck, dash, dash attack.The problem is a number of those manuvers require very percise button presses, and the controls are also setup so that the character will 'commit' to some actions, so you can't quickly cancel it to do another action.This can make the contols feel *unresponsive*, if you do things by refex and get a button press wrong.For those of you who remember, it is similar to the problems in Super Metroid in making a spin vs. regular jump, or in Symphony of the Night and accidentally doing Alucards reverse mini-dash thingy, except a bit more unforgiving.I'm pretty sure it was an intentional choice in how to setup the controls, they want to award percisely controlling the character.Example: Try to turn the character around and do a spin jump (jump and push forward same time), what actually happens is you do a backward jump (jump and push bacward same time), what you need to do is turn, then spin jump.

Not being able to restore your life is annoying but after a while you don't notice. This is a game where you will always save at a save point.

												This was kind of a ""so bad it's good"" game for a while, but then it got frustrating enough to wrap back around into ""so bad it's terrible"" territory.Like. The main problem comes down to the stiff, archaic controls. For one, stuff just flat out doesn't work sometimes, and random stuff just happens at other times. Double tapping to dash is always a bad mechanic, but here it doesn't even work half the time, and the other times you'll arbitrarily dash without meaning to. There's two different main jumps, a straight up jump that's taller and a lower spinning jump, and naturally the lower jump is useless in platforming and basically pointless to have at all. There's a dash kick you can use by attacking while dashing, which will sometimes arbitrarily stop for no reason and get you stuck not moving. TURNING AROUND in this game is a busted mechanic, even, you won't face the direction you're holding unless you perform the specific turning around animation first, and yes, this means you'll attack the wrong way quite often.  There's also three kinds of wall jump (though the game only tells you about one) which is great when wall jumping by itself is already super finnicky (seriously, worse than Super Metroid's wall jump... geez), and then sometimes a different wall jump than the one you want will activate (the low kicking jump is utterly useless and likes to trigger quite often). Basically, as you can see, nothing works. Outright. Nothing. It's basically one of the worst controlling games I've ever played; at least La-Mulana is consistent with its weird mechanics.So yeah, the controls alone make the game a failure, but then it's not like the rest of the game is great design-wise; it's generally pretty awful. Most of the boss designs are just spamfests; the first boss and the fourth boss are basically the only exceptions, the only bosses that feel actually skill-based instead of luck-based. The final boss especially is a seven phase monstrosity that boils down to just a battle of attrition more than anything else. And naturally the controls make the platforming pretty bad, though even then there's a lot of one-block jumps and weird wall jumps and with how arbitrary damage output of various things is it's just not fun. Spikes do a ton of damage and there are a few enemies who randomly do a ton of damage too, while everything else does relatively little in comparison. There's also a few attacks that stunlock you, even though other times you have decently long invincibility frames... who needs consistency? The puzzle designs are mixed, there's a few clever ones but a lot of them are just ""do section fast, if not, rewind time if you can"". And exploring in this game... is not fun at all, because of how awkward the game is to play. On top of that, secrets are hidden in pretty universally mean places, random blocks in the wall, fake walls guarded by breakable spikes (not all spikes are breakable, notably), switches hidden behind foreground objects, just, all sorts of stupid stuff, I didn't bother exploring without consulting a guide to make sure I wouldn't miss anything. So basically... the controls are garbage and the game design is garbage. It's... not a fun game in the slightest. It was a little fun in the earlier areas I guess, before all the game's problems really showed up in spades, but any part of the back half of the game was just filled with frustration and bitterness, it does not feel like this game likes players in the slightest.The graphics are okay though and the soundtrack is quite good, but that's not, like, going to save a fundamentally unfun game in the slightest :PUpdate regarding Chelsea mode:It's good, until the final boss, which is literally the worst part of the entire package. Instakills as late as the 8th phase and the 9th phase does half your maximum health with contact damage, disgusting.			"

												(Disclaimer: used wired 360 controller)Extremely poor controls ruin what could be a great platformer. The dashing relies on a double tap which works 50% of the time you NEED it to, and 50% when you need it to NOT dash. Jumping is also painful, as the game relies on several different jumps: jumping from a standstill, jumping while moving, jumping while dashing, and an attack kick which is an attack while dashing. Again, the dash jumps are painful because dashing barely works but jumping also sometimes doesn't react well when you need it. Also, jumping from a standstill has just a little more height than jumping while moving, and the game WILL require this. It makes trying to move through some parts really frustrating as you need to stop moving (and dodging!) to get a fraction more of an inch in your height to get to where you need to go.You'll stick to ledges of platforms your standing on, which works out okay when you want to stay on a platform, but it will magnetically pull you when you want to jump down past it, or throw you off small platforms when you attempt to land on them. Just.. infuriating when this part goes wrong.The fighting is fine, there are different weapons which feel great, the art is light-hearted and whimscle, and the game has clever time-manipulation puzzles, but I just can't recommend it due to the fact I want to break my controller in half when the game doesn't recognize my input to do a sequence of very precise moves, which is 90% of this game. 6/10			"

												I wanted to like this game but it's SO poorly designed the bad outweight the good, by a LOTA platformer game that fails really hard at being a platformer. The controls are bad and unresponsive which often makes you fall into a pit of insta-kill spikes. The level design sometimes forces you to take damage which leaves you at a disadvantage with the few save locations they have scattered around the map. I got stuck in an area forever before giving in and asking the all-powerful internet what to do next and I learned that there were 4 switches I need to press in an area to open a gate, 1 of which is hidden inside a totaly ordinary wall with no collision that you wouldn't know was needed unless you were told so. After that hell I moved on to the VERY next area where my progression is stumped again. This is bad game design and in no way player error. I wish it was player error that way I could at least progress, but I'm stuck until I find the next wall with no collision or whatever the hell I need to do now.This game is okay for maybe 30 minutes to an hour before it becomes a chore to get to the next save location before climbing another platform hell. Really not worth the price at all			"

												One of the worst game i ever played, animations must finish so you can perform the next movement (attack animations are rly long), you cant turn left, right unles you are on ground and not shooting, walljump is awful since you cant turn left right on midair, aim directions are awful, most secrets doesnt have any clue of secrets so you must shoot every wall in the game to find them, some normal monster has tons of life, the knockback you get for getting hit is exaggerated, checkpoints are bad placed, the camera position is bad placed too, the parry frames and timing is a bit wrong calculated and finnaly i think this is the worst thing, there are 2 kinds of jump, 1 that makes you jump higher but not too far and you can stomp enemies or proyectiles, and the other is the oposite the problem with this is when you want to speedrun or something you have to stand still (because it must finish the wal animation) jump, and then move, it just sucks.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS ITS ON SALE (80-90%)			"

Cursed with cat ears by radiation Bunny's quest begins her search to return to her slightly more normal form.  Along the way unlocking additional powers and abilities in this metroidvania style platformer.  At times the game fails to showcase how to use the new powers it introduces which can cause some players to falter.The abstract non-sequitur humor tries it's hardest but at times it conflicts with the playability of the game.  Controls are a bit loose, especially in air and sticky animation leads to dropped input and frustration.			"

												I played this game off of Steam, yet I have done it all the way through before. This game is a really fun ""Metroidvania-style"" game. There are numerous upgrades to collect throughout the journey, but not all of them are necessary--Heck, you can even complete the game without the joke-upgrade that lets you turn around.The gameplay is very fast-paced and not too forgiving about mistakes. You later gain the ability to use your extra lives, but until that point you're pretty much on your own. That's not really a bad thing. The bosses are challenging enough that having something to lose REALLY makes it feel worth the time spent when you actually beat them.Another thing I love about this title is that it is so flexible about how you complete it. At least in Bunny's story, you can often do the bosses out of order, and they will change depending on what you do first. I actually managed to goof up a save-file doing this though. The first boss does NOT like to be defeated second. I couldn't beat her in pissy-mode.Anyway, my rambling aside, I love this game and I'm glad it's on Steam. If you like exploring a huge maze-like map while searching for upgrades, battling hilarious yet difficult bosses, and following a goofy storyline that somehow drags you in despite its lack of seriousness, then you'll love this game.Now if only I could figure out how I beat this thing in the first place. Going back to it, it's really hard T_T			"

												I really wanted to like this game the general theme/gameplay seem pretty solid. There is a nice detailed map which includes items/obstacles etc so you dont get lost. This had the potential to be a really good game.Then they decided to go full retro and even include the old 8/16 bit platformer staple: bad controls.So yeah probably give this a miss, its a platform game with bad controls. You cant really forgive that when basically every  platform game this these has good controls. Even worse the controls and very deliberately bad so players can ""enjoy"" mastering them and going from awkward bunnygirl to awsome bunnyninja i guess. I doubt most people will ever make it to the exalted bunnyninja state.			"

												This starts off as a cute and funny parody of Metroid and Symphony of the Night, but as the game demands more from you, the experience is ruined by the slow and sometimes unresponsive movement. There are some neat, if underused uses of time powers, and a Third Strike like parry that can save you from most attacks if you can pull it off. The bosses are also funny, epically the third devil. While I can't personally recommend it, if you can look past the controls there is a good time to be had.

I am not very inclined when it comes to adjusting things in a folder unless a step by step process is drawn out. Anyway, this black screen has been going on since September I believe. When I played the game is was great until the update made everything black. So if you have windows 8 I would stay away.			"

There are also a slew of moves you can pull of like wall climbing and back-dashing that aren't explained in-game to figure out! To put it in perspective, if two people played this game side-by-side, the one with no experience would finish after the one with experience, even if they had to play the game without turning to the right, which is indeed, an ability to unlock (Don't freak out, its right in front of you at the start of the game). Even so, Its one of the funnest games I have ever played.There is also a lot to play, just when you FINNALLY think you beat the game, BOOM! Second game!

However, it's absolutely no fun when you have to perform split second actions and deal with loads of things coming your way with stiff, unresponsive controls and character movement.  Especially when the only way to recover health is at a save point, and you usually wind up taking far too much damage than you should thanks to the aforementioned control problems.It's unfortunate that I have to give an otherwise creative and quirky Metroid-style game a snub.  Unless the devs patch the game to improve the controls, it's going to remain in my ""unfinished"" category.			"

												Interesting metroidvania game so far. Not very far in but I watched the SGDQ run for this and it was amazing. I'm sure the game is much different then the speedrun route/glitches but the base mechanics are still there and the combat is cool. Also pretty funny at times			"

												Really quite the mind numbing experience. I found myself struggling early on with the easiest of tasks, but eventually I got used to the control! This game is really enjoyable after that, if you like a challenge! Very nice Metroidvania title right here, with some catchy music and silly dialogue that might give you a chuckle or to. Stay adorable, Bunny!			"

												Where to begin?This game is a metroidvania in the way that Bubsy is a platformer. Not nescissarily broken but just poorly executed. Unlike defining games of the genre, Super Metroid ans Super Castlevania 4, which ease you into the game and are more or less well scaled difficulty that challenges what you've learned in previous areas, this game gives you two or three screens to aquire the skills you need to face the first boss. After the aforementioned screens it basically turns into a Super Meat Boy/Touhou/Kaizo hybrid without any of the awesome game mechanics in any of the games mentioned.The shooting is cumbersome, at least on keyboard, And kinda hard to get used to in the SIX FIRGGIN SCREENS YOU HAVE TO DO SO!!! Super Metroid did have a similar 8 direction shooting mechanic, but at no point did you have to fight Flandre Scarlet with only one HP upgrade. This wouldn't be such a big deal if there was auto-fire like in, I don't know, most bullet hell shmups that let you fight back. To bring back metroid, the first major fight, Ridley, can be challenging but nothing you can't deal with because they hid the tutorial in the opening level and you are competent in basic combat  because of that.Keep in mind, I don't hate rediculously difficult games. In fact, Super Meat Boy is probably my favorite platformer. But what do all good insanely difficult games have in common? The answer, make death painless (Super Meat Boy), Funny (AVGN Adventures), or preface the game with the prospect of thousands of deaths (Dark Souls). Maybe it's because I grew up with games where death was an actual setback, but I kind of expect one of those three things in games where I can't expect not to die multiple times in the first 20 minutes of the game on a first playthrough. Deaths are supposed to tell you that you did something at least a little more stupid than not memorizing attacks, in this sense if you could take more than about 4 hits from the first boss, this might be more tolerable as you could get some bearing. Harking back to Super Meat Boy, technically, only the boss of chapter 4 is trial and error, everything else, with good reaction and recognising what does what, you could get through 99% of the levels in one life... if you're good enough.I also by no means hate anime esq art styles. what with skullgirls being my favorite head to head fighter. In fact in games that have them, they're often done remarkably well, including here. But the difference between SkullGirls and this atrocity  is that SkullGirls actually has good gameplay to back it upTwo last complaints: Soundtrack is lackluster and Chelsea is sounds about as grating as just about any character in any game I have played.

												I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this game. Already having played some excellent metroidvania games, the controls for Bunny Must Die! are honestly horrible in a kinda god-awful way.Play Rogue Legacy or Guacamelee! for 3 min and tell me you feel differently. The character animations are smooth, platforming enjoyable and attacking is effortless. I'm so glad I got this game on sale and probably won't finish it. I'm all for hard games, but this is hard due to inefficient and clunky controls.			"

												I saw the game and thought it might be fun to play. My friend owned it and it reminded me of a castlevania/metroid-esque game (You know, metroidvania)... well This is one of the few games where I literally had no idea what the hell I was doing at all.I defeated the first boss, but I felt that 90% of the battle was me taking hits I should have been able to avoid if this cat-rabbit-girl-thing could actually be controllable whilst jumping. I don't know if you get an item to improve jumping stability later in the game (You know, like the item that lets you walk the other way you have to actually find...) but I have to state this game is practically unplayable how it is, it feels unpolished and needs work.

												Doesn't deserve to be compared to castlevania, even as a joke. Bad enemy and level design served with unbelieveably unresponsive controls stolen straight from Cheetahmen. Story non existent. Uses cheap tactics like screen rolling in bossfights to kill you. I quit playing after the forced screenrolling caused a boss to be able to attack me from off screen, giving me absolutely no change but to take the hits as they came.Waste of good potential.			"

												(35% completed)This game is listed as Metroidvania, and it cannot be further away from it. Its a castlevania 1 clone through and through.Every single problem i have with this game could of been avoided if it was properly playtested, really unresponsive and clunky flow. unfair deaths all over the place, saves in almost every room to make it playable, useless secrets, linear, dumb story, unbalanced weapons, filled with bugs everywhere, buggy timestop function, extremely irritating voices.You have no freedom at all to explore since there is only 1 right way to go, there is no secrets that has any meaning at all because every single secret up to this point has been extra lives which are useless when there is a save in every 2-3 rooms. You get different keys after killing a boss, these keys are used to open a door on the other side of the map of where you fought boss so backtrack through where you just came to unlock the next area, when you have finished that area it will loop back so you can pick up that same key and use again DO NOT FORGET TO BRING THE KEY AGAIN OR YOU WILL HAVE TO RETURN AGAIN!The bosses and mosters have patterns, but because of the horrendus control, its almost impossible to properly react to these patterns. Which turns every bossfight into a buttonmasher where you hope for the best. Worst part is, this tactic works 40% of the time too. The platforming when backtracking through areas you have already been is harder then every boss so far.I am hessitant if i should finish this game or not, and this I'm saying as a avid metroidvania fanboy. This game is not metroidvania whatsoever, its everything bad about castlevania 1 thrown into a game with great art, music and animations.I do not recommend this game to even the most dedicated metroidvania type lover. The only people who should play this is those who like the frustration of castlevania 1, without the satisfaction of actually completing something. To these people i would recommend buying it on sale when its 80% off, everybody else should stay away. Do not support the release of such buggy garbage with your money			"

												This is a terrible game. It has the most awkward clunky controls i've played since bad NES games. You will likely die from the controls more than anything else, or if you get stuck with a terrible weapon for a difficult area. the time mechanic is badly implemented as well, it has a very selective effectiveness, some areas it works, others it won't. It also takes forever to recharge it and it doesn't last very long. There are some positive aspects of the game. the graphics and music are amazing, but that's about it. the bosses are easy, most of the enemies are easy and you will be seeing the same enemies through out most of the game. Spikes instant kill you at the beginning of the game, and the first area is loaded with them. Most of the game you will be struggling to jump through all the platforming sections, there are also some very strict timing areas for switch activated doors, which time stopping does not work on. You can reverse time a few seconds once you get that ability but it's still very strict timing in most areas. Overall i rage quit this game due to long stretches of platforming and laser-blasting enemies with too few checkpoints. the game isn't fun mostly due to bad level design and awful controls. Recommened for traditional hardcore platform fans only.			"

Ugh I often wonder why some games are made, do they even play them for one minute?

												1. Once I saw people comparing this to the ultimate meme game, Dark Souls, I knew that was a bad sign.2. I expected this game to be difficult and it is, but it's artificial difficulty. It's a game with average difficulty that's boosted to very difficult because of the horrible controls.3. I don't mind chinese hentais (that's chinese for cartoons) but this is just a bit too cringy for me. I understand the style they were going for and they did a good job of it, but it just doesn't appeal to me. That's not a critique of the game, I just didn't like it.Overall: I wanted to like this game but it's just not fun. I like difficult games but this just sucks. Horrible controls, even worse mechanics... I just don't see any appeal in it. $10 is way too much for this nonsense. The $5 I paid for it was too much. Don't buy this, there are way more challenging yet fun games out there that are worth the money.			"

												A potentially amazing platformer brought down my awful controls.I started the game out very optimistic, loving games like Wings of Vi, But, I steadily realized how imprecise and unreliable the controls and movement in the game are. If you can get around the terrible controls, however, it's pretty cute and the art and music is cool. From what I've played so far, however, I would suggest you give this a pass.I do intend to keep playing it, if nothing more than to justify my purchase, so I might update this later if something happens.Edit: So, after beating Bunny's story, I feel compelled to give it a recommendation. While the controls continue to be awful, everything else the game throws at you is quite good. So, buy it on sale.For some reason I didn't unlock ""Chelsea and the 7 Devils"" after beating ""Bunny Must Die"", so I guess I won't be doing that. Oh well.			"

												Got this game for $0.25 mixed in with other games in a bundle, I would definitely recommend it for that price. Even maybe $3 to $5. $9 is a bit steep.Biggest challenge to this game? Very hard. It's a old-school metroidisque feel, too challenging in parts for a ""meh"" reward. Achievements are hard to get and once again.. not worth the effort imo.Certain bosses require certain items, which are near impossible to get unless you precisely time your jumps. If these bosses didn't have to heavily relie on said items, the game would be a lot more fair. Short answer. Fun game, fun items, weapons, etc. Too challenging, not enough interest in working hard.Neat time/puzzle/platformerisque game, but be ready for a challenge.			"

												It is a rage game.  However, the controls are ""precise"", but that does not mean they are responsive.  I just would not recommend it based on the controls.  They require such precision and can be messed up so easily that I don't know if it is bad coding or by design.  At its core it is a solid looking metroidvania with some time manipulation elements. I liked the call back to the old arcade games I'd play where breaking random things would give you usable items.  For some people I imagine this is, and will be, a very enjoyable game. I have trouble recommending a rage game where a good chunk of the rage comes from horrible controls and other design elements.  So much so that I half wonder if the controls weren't made horrible to make an iffy game do well in the ""rage"" genre.   At least games like Octodad and Surgeon Simulator are up front with what they are.			"

												I tried giving this game a chance. At first glance, it appears to be a Metroid-inspired platformer/exploration game. You move around, explore a 2D labyrinth, collect powerups, and fight monsters. However, this game just doesn't give me the satisfaction that you'd get from your typical metroid game. First off, you can't fire your weapon while moving, unless you're pulling off an aerial maneuver, and that gets old fast. It limits your options for attacking enemies while on the go, and enemies in this game will be guaranteed to get a few hits off on you before you can kill them. The environments you fight in are also tightly cramped, a little too much for comfort. As for bosses, the game doesn't really offer much there. Some are pretty tough, but I was able to cheese several bosses in by just getting up tot hem and shooting, and their AI couldn't make heads or tails regarding how to attack me.  Poorly coded if you ask me.Overall, big disappointment in my eyes. I see alot of other people in these comments enjoy the game, which is a-okay by me. I just can't personally invest too much time into it, which is why I requested a refund.  It's so puzzling too, since I like the rest of the games from this developer. Guess platforming metroidvanias aren't their strong suit.			"

												I've played a lot of Metroidvanias, and out of all of them, this one adheres closer to the original Metroid than most.  Don't be fooled by the cutesy art; this gaming is filled with tough platforming puzzles and hard bosses.  It doesn't hold your hand, and there are a lot of situations that look impossible at first but are very satisfying after you figure out how to get past them.  The game has a lot of secrets; not just in the sense of hidden rooms and items, but even aspects of the controls are not explained in depth, and the game expects you to experiment to figure out how everything works.  Then, after you think you've almost completed the game, it turns out that you're only halfway done.  It's actually got a surprising length for a Metroidvania; it's taken me about 20 hours to get the real ending and collect most (but not all) of the items. While the gameplay is the real reason to play the game, it's got a lot of other strengths, too.  The soundtrack is fantastic, the graphics are cute, and the plot has some absurd humor.  I wholeheartedly recommend Bunny Must Die, if you're not afraid of death.			"

												An expertly made 2D platformer, old school players will adore the metroid/castlevania feel this game has.}The gameplay is genius, the silly humor is enjoyable and Bunny is a lovable character; there is alot in here for the completionist that likes spending hours in a single room, trying to find a hidden passage or item.Controls could be better, true, but they are accurate enough.Music and art are both perfect, except for some places where the designers got obviously bored.Which brings me to my next point... Level design...As good as it is, there are parts where the designers are just exploiting the low accuracy of the controls to give the game difficulty, something I greatly disliked. The game makes broad use of geniously planned, challenging situations without having the need of pulling the ""Yeah good luck making this movement with the D-pad/Arrow Keys"", and sadly, it does, and it does it a lot.The aqua colored area is an example of this, while the Yellow Area with the purple bubbly floor is entertaining and challenging, the aqua area is just tedious.Then we have Chelsea...I'd have to make a separate entry to tell how badly written this character is; regardless of the ""unserious"" nature of this game, Chelsea just seems like something out of a DeviantArt webcomic, her personality, voice and powers are just plain stupid. While Bunny has a similar, bratty attitude, there is something in her that lets you enjoy the game... While Chelsea... She just makes everything SO boring and tedious, she is a totally flat character, and her ""Game"" feels just forced, as if the creator of the character had made a tantrum just to have their character in the game.Her gameplay is, while boring and unentertaining, marvelously achieved, Chelsea feels slow and clumsy, yes, but her skills do work and challenge you to find the correct use for them... Most of the time... And this is because the designers tried to play the ""Easy boss before, hard boss now"" card and they failed horribly. Some Lesser bosses are a big threat for Chelsea due to her rock slow combat and this just makes the fights long and boring, this feels extremely forced and unnecesary.Chelsea's final Bosses are cleverly designed, and whoever created those things has a reserved place in the Hall of A$$shole Designers (that is a compliment). This last part is the only thing I've enjoyed in Chelsea's Run... And that is dissapointing.Overall, Bunny Must Die is a pleasant experience for the most part, it is not for everyone and I believe that people that had problems with the 2D metroids and castlevanias will most likely dropping this game before long. Bunny's part is a solid 9/10. And that's what this game would've got if not for Chelsea... That part is boring, tedious and loaded with the ""This is so not worth it"" feel... And you're right, Chelsea is so not worth it; the only incentive I had to go with her was to save bunny.}On its own, Chelsea's part gets a 7/10, but let's say that the WHole ""Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils"" is an 8/10.Chelsea a ship.			"

Bunny Must Die!Yeah, you die a lot, so I guess the title's accurate.--------------------------------------------------------------Bunny Must Die! is a metroidvania game in which you play as Bunny, a bunny girl who is cursed with cat ears from a thermomeowclear explosion for some reason. The story isn't incredibly important, and the writing seems to be self-referential to the point were the game knows this too. It's funny, but ultimately you're there to murder everything you see.As for gameplay itself, it has the standard jumping, moving, attacking actions of any metroidvania, as well as some added techniques. In total, there are 6 weapons, each which different effects and powers that distinguish them from each other. No two weapons feel the same, which is good. The most interesting mechanic BMD! has is its time warping functionality : Bunny is capable of stopping time, allowing her to move past enemies, do specific platforming things, and as she collects more Yellow Powder, rewind time, heal herself, and more.True to any Metroidvania, Bunny encounters a variety of power-ups along her adveture, ranging from the ability to turn Right to wall-jumping, and even a suit that increases her bust size, giving her added offensive capabilities and slower movement. Not going to lie, it's pretty funny.As hinted at from above the line, BMD! is hard. Hellaciously hard, even. This is in part due to its steep difficult in platforming and overall difficult boss fights [which are equally as absurd as Bunny herself], but also to the game's most fatal flaw : the movement controls. Jumping is a feat in of itself. The entire system feels very clunky, and oftentimes, you might perform a somersault when you meant to do a straight jump, end up falling down a long tower shaft, and being forced to climb up again. Enemies also inflict a knockback when you're hurt, lending to frustrating moments [in particular, the Jade Tower comes to mind.] However, the controls aren't terrible, and can be surmounted with enough practice.The game's art and soundtrack are delightful. Environments and enemies look nice and distinct, and each musical score, while nothing particularly catchy or memorable, is nice to listen to. Bunny's voice acting is also pretty solid, but it should be noted that it is in Japanese. The game runs phenomenally well. In my experience, I encountered no graphical slow down, even with dozens of fireballs on the screen at once.A minor issue is that, should you play this game on Windows 10, you have to edit the game's configuration files to fix the window, otherwise it's just a black screen. It's annoying, but once it's fixed, it's gone.--------------------------------------------------------------Overall Rating7.3/10Bunny Must Die! is an overall enjoyable experience. Aside from its wonky controls, the gameplay is simple and fun, offering fast action and hair-trigger timing. The game is rather short, and can be beaten in as little as an hour [the game even has an achievement for doing so!], but that detail is offset by the fact it has an additional mode in which you play as a different character, who plays almost entirely differently. It is, at times, frustrating, but in the end, Bunny Must Die! is a game worth playing, and I feel as if it isn't talked about enough.PROS;+Excellent weapon variety and smooth combat.+Humorous story and characters+Wide variety of power-ups and gameplay options.+Second story mode adds replayability, in addition to speed-run possibilities.+Good art and music.+Excellent technical performance.+A worthy challenge.+You get to play as a Bunny Girl. That's a new one.CONS:-Mind boggling frustrating-Somewhat short-Wonky controls provide an artificial challenge.-Some issue getting the thing to work.-Animeish style might drive people off.			"

												This game is fun and enjoyable but unbelievably frustrating,some deaths feel entirely cheap or wall jumping in areas need 100% accurate timing or you fall completely to the bottom and have to start all over.Another thing is nothing is obvious, there are hidden walls, and back tracking, though out of all that once you make it through you feel a sense of accomplishment.So I reccomend it to anyone who is up for a challendge, just don't feel ashamed if you have to look up a walkthrough, I did.

												It is a rage game.  However, the controls are ""precise"", but that does not mean they are responsive.  I just would not recommend it based on the controls.  They require such precision and can be messed up so easily that I don't know if it is bad coding or by design.  At its core it is a solid looking metroidvania with some time manipulation elements. I liked the call back to the old arcade games I'd play where breaking random things would give you usable items.  For some people I imagine this is, and will be, a very enjoyable game. I have trouble recommending a rage game where a good chunk of the rage comes from horrible controls and other design elements.  So much so that I half wonder if the controls weren't made horrible to make an iffy game do well in the ""rage"" genre.   At least games like Octodad and Surgeon Simulator are up front with what they are.			"

												I've played a lot of Metroidvanias, and out of all of them, this one adheres closer to the original Metroid than most.  Don't be fooled by the cutesy art; this gaming is filled with tough platforming puzzles and hard bosses.  It doesn't hold your hand, and there are a lot of situations that look impossible at first but are very satisfying after you figure out how to get past them.  The game has a lot of secrets; not just in the sense of hidden rooms and items, but even aspects of the controls are not explained in depth, and the game expects you to experiment to figure out how everything works.  Then, after you think you've almost completed the game, it turns out that you're only halfway done.  It's actually got a surprising length for a Metroidvania; it's taken me about 20 hours to get the real ending and collect most (but not all) of the items. While the gameplay is the real reason to play the game, it's got a lot of other strengths, too.  The soundtrack is fantastic, the graphics are cute, and the plot has some absurd humor.  I wholeheartedly recommend Bunny Must Die, if you're not afraid of death.			"

												Y'know how in a lot of games you know you screwed up before you even fall in that hole?Or you see a projectile flying at you and just know that's gonna hit you and you just accept the fact that you're gonna get hit?In this game, even if you're below the platform you were supposed to land on and you're headed for those spikes. You still don't have to accept the fact you failed. You get full control, block everything, escape that from infinite single-wall jumps. Hardly ever will you have to think ''Oh, looks like that's gonna hit me.''  And it's absolutely amazing.The biggest downside is level design, which wouldn't be so bad if there was no difference in jumping while holding a direction, or jumping straight up and then pushing a direction. The latter gives you more height and you need to use it for some jumps. It feels a bit sloppy whenever you need to do that.A personal issue is unbalanced weapons? That might be just me though.  There is no reason to ever use anything other than the sword is how I see it. You don't have to turn around to effectively use the sword. To get the most of the other weapons, you do need to turn around. Turning takes half a second.Non-gameplay wise?I like the music but there are some pretty bad songs too. The quality seems to go all over the place. Still, the soundtrack is worth having.The looks, well.. Nothing to say about it really. I don't think it's anything outstanding but it definitely isn't bad.8.5/10			"

												I hate to say don't try this game so if you are interested wait for a sale because its still a half decent metroidvania but its frustrations may leave you feeling buyers remorse so you've been warned. the problems are listed below as such.A funny, never takes itself too serious metroidvania story that ends up being marred by taking its controls too serious.The only problems I have with this game is its heavy reliance of cheap deaths and its gimmicks. the gimmicks would not be a problem to rely on normally because why have them if your aren't going to use them but the problem lies in the gimmicks aren't fine tuned enough to be demanded on as accurately as the game does. The gimmick I am really taking the stab at most here is the perfect guard, there's quite a few secrets in the game that demand perfect guard vs ""instant"" (high damage but for the first half of the game it may as well be instant) death spikes which I found a little demanding on a game where I've had the game I've had the guard fail many times.The time mechanics for bunny on the other hand work quite fine and are responsive in what they do but still may frustrate players as some puzzles that use the time gimmick can be quite demanding on skill and may deter people. I've not gotten to try ""spoilers"" game play yet to make an opinion on it yet.The official state side release came with a few perks which included arranged music, and a overhaul to a few bosses to make it feel less low budget doujin. This are a few nice touches to sweeten the deal if you can survive the mechanics to experience them.			"

												Date: 2/24/16Review Number: 26 Game: Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 devils.From (Creator Publisher): Platine DispositifPlayed On: Steambox w/ControllerSteam Price as of Review: $9.99Total Time played: 30 MinutesReview:The next game to come up on the randomizer, another indie platformer, this time a game called Bunny Must Die long subtitle goes here by Platine Dispositif.  Now, indie platformers haven't necessarily been kind to me for the last several reviews, and when I initially had a couple of controller issues, I was concerned that that trend was going to continue.  However, after about five minutes of tweaking the default controller settings and I was surprised to find myself correcting... myself.  Behind the slightly subpar graphics and slightly off controls is a surprisingly snappy metroidvania clone.  As this is an indie game created by a smaller developer, the game seems significantly smaller than most other clones of the kings of platformers, however the gameplay is interesting, and the unique ability of the main character to both slow and reverse time is a refreshing new take on the old weapon/missile pattern.  Both the voices and the soundtrack are nothing necessarily special but fit the game very well in both tone and style, though the lack of voiceovers during the cutscenes seems like a miss.  The gameplay in general is delightfully metroid, with only a few minor flaws.  The control scheme is simple enough, with three main buttons to handle everything, though the controls are not always the most precise, and I would often find myself jumping in the opposite direction I was moving, which can become frustrating in precision platforming.All in all, I feel like this game is certainly worthy of the genre, even if it's nothing special within it.  A decent buy if it's on sale, especially if you're not currently playing one.Game’s Fate: Kept.  The last metroidvania I actually played actively was the trope namer, so until a better one comes up on the randomizer, this one will do nicely.Buy/No Buy:  It's pretty good.  I know there are better ones out there, but if you see this on sale, it's totally worth the money.  Buy.			"

Short Version:Are you looking for a hard metroidvania with time-controlling abilities? Then this is for you! Just keep in mind that the controls can be clunky. Personally I like the extra layer of challenge it brings, but for some players this has dragged down (or even outright ruined) their experience. The story is very silly (but fun!) so this is a game you play mainly for the gameplay/challenge. Unless you really, really love bunny girls or have a strong craving for a metroidvania, I'd recommend you wait with this one until it's on sale. Long Version:I played this game a couple years ago, so when I saw it greenlit on steam it was an instant buy. It's a classic for me, and so far I've had a blast revisiting it. With that said, let's get to the review.The story is very basic - Bunny got cursed with cat ears, get's lost, and now it's revenge time! The entire game is very silly in a good way, one boss in particular if you play classic. Speaking of, you can chose between classic and updated graphics and soundtrack. Personally I prefer the classic, but the updated version isn't bad either. Just make sure you play through the thermeowclear plant on classic. As for the gameplay... The controls definitely take some getting used to. You can't turn when attacking, there's no ducking, there's at least three different jumps, the dash triggers extremely easy and apparently ledges have a gravity of their own. For some people this completely ruins the game, while others see the unusual controls as part of the challenge. Personally I like how I'm forced to think differently compared to many other platformers. Speaking of challenge, this game is hard. Some of the secrets are devilishly hard to find, the weapon system requires you consider your choices, the controls force you to think differently, and overall this game was designed specifically to make bunny die. A lot. Collecting upgrades is also incredibly rewarding - there isn't a single one that won't be worth it.One major feature is the ability to control time, which I love. It creates a nice contrast to the normally chaotic gameplay. It's utilized very well and creates quite a few interesting puzzles. The only thing to keep in mind is that your time ability will be very lackluster until you've collected enough upgrades to unlock the eternal stop.Other than that, the only thing to keep in mind is that when starting the game, DON'T pick fullscreen. A lot of players have had problems with that, and fixing it, while not too complicated, can still be very annoying. Some personal tips:- You can wall jump up a single wall. Exploit this to save time- Save your Bunny Dolls for the final boss- There's three different jumps: standing jump, walking jump, and dashing jump. - Try to find as many items as you can. You're missing out on half the game if you don't. - There's lots of objects that can be destroyed or even walked through, and there's usually no hint as to where they are. Have fun!			"

												Got this game for $0.25 mixed in with other games in a bundle, I would definitely recommend it for that price. Even maybe $3 to $5. $9 is a bit steep.Biggest challenge to this game? Very hard. It's a old-school metroidisque feel, too challenging in parts for a ""meh"" reward. Achievements are hard to get and once again.. not worth the effort imo.Certain bosses require certain items, which are near impossible to get unless you precisely time your jumps. If these bosses didn't have to heavily relie on said items, the game would be a lot more fair. Short answer. Fun game, fun items, weapons, etc. Too challenging, not enough interest in working hard.Neat time/puzzle/platformerisque game, but be ready for a challenge.			"
