												This, has to be the most compelling story I've ever played through in a game. One of the best, most charmingly clever, point & click titles I've ever played, a masterpiece of a game. The rustic hand drawn graphics are genuinely exquisite and really help disguise the click areas of this game. Features a really touching twisted fate mecha-folkstory, of a young robot living in a steam-punk dystopian wasteland, trying to save an enslaved princess robot. The only dialog between the characters are small animated scenes inside thought bubbles, which I think is a cool way to help tell a story without literal or verbal ques. The music is beautiful, very original and thought provoking, it really helped set the tone. You'll come across the occasional puzzle here and there and they're are some tough ones, but none are too frustrating. Unlike many titles in this genre, Machinarium consistently had me at an ""aHa!"" moment, great game 10/10			"

												Machinarium is a point-and-click adventure game in the old fashion of ""click inventory items against everything on screen until it works"". You play the role of a tiny little robot dude whose first task is to rebuild his body, having been unceremoniously dumped into a junkyard. The story is told without any words, instead using the charming artstyle and clever worldbuilding to convey what's happening. It's a risky venture, especially in story-driven games like these, but Machinarium pulls it off very well; Little Robot Dude's attempts to sneak back into the city are easy to follow and very cute. Some of the puzzles can be somewhat obtuse, as is the norm for adventure games, which may put off some players, but there is a hint system built into every puzzle which lets Dude give his own insight on the solution. For times when this doesn't suffice, a short walkthrough can be unlocked with some skill at a minigame, which will give the player a storybook guide on what to do next. The wordless presentation makes Machniarum a game that can be enjoyed by all-comers of any language, age, or skill with words.Finally, the Robot Street Band's performance will stay with you forever.

												Just WOW! If you like a good adventure game with lots of things to explore, some hard puzzles and beautiful artwork, then Machinarium is your game.Without a single spoken word the story line is set very well in a world where machines have feeling too. The ambiance is amazing and the puzzles very original. You just gotta love the main character and the creative ways he finds to defeat the bad guys. The humor in the game is great too.For me this game could have lasted for several hours (days, weeks!) more, without ever boring me. The game also offers a unique hint system, so there's no need to search the internet to be able to advance in case you're stuck. I recommend not using it too often though, because the game is much more fun by solving everything yourself.If machines ever take over the world, I sure hope this is what it will look like. The downside? Maybe the fact that there's no Steam achievements. Really can't think of anything else. This game is a must-have & must-play!			"

												Machinarium is unique in so many ways, which makes it difficult to write about. It's also one of those games that is best experienced firsthand rather than after reading a spoiler-ridden review. As much as I'd like to lecture on about something that impacted me so greatly, I'm left with very little to work with; but what's there to discuss paints a picture of a masterpiece.Visually, Machinarium takes a Victorian children's book illustration style and blends it with dystopian psuedo-steampunk imagery. It's not only as striking as that description suggests but it adds layer upon layer to the gameplay and storyline. Characters and scenes are beautifully hand-drawn and painstakingly animated to bring life to the citizens of the eponymous metropolis. When I say life, I mean it metaphorically as the cast are entirely robotic; their endearing movements and actions convince you that they're genuine creatures, acting out of circuitry or as puppets.The whole game is a juxtaposition. The pure and sweet protagonist stands brightly against the grim, dank underbelly of the city whilst the dark despair of obsolescence and helplessness is often paired with love and hope. There's a great story to be discovered without ever uttering a single word, written or spoken. That alone is a remarkable feat but the characters you meet along the way are just as impressively fleshed. From the musical troupe in need of new instruments to the brutish and bullying pair that serve as antagonists; so many moments will ring in your mind when you reminisce years later, which is a powerful statement.I don't personally enjoy point and click adventures very often as I find they can sometimes be generic, predictable and require great leaps in logic. There are always exceptions, especially when it comes to LucasArts game, but lumping Machinarium into that category does little to help explain just why it's something every gamer should experience. It's on a par with the bests but ultimately nothing like them except in some key ingredients. The puzzles are frequent and never bordering on torturous like say 7th Guest, but they will certainly test you at times. It's a story-focused experience without sacrificing those times where you need to take a step back and hope for a eureka moment.There are moments where I wish you could walk across scenes a little faster, but the protagonist's gentle hobbling is endearing and easily forgiven. Puzzles that prove an irritation are quickly overshadowed by the sheer genius of the next. I'd have liked less of the retro-gaming elements but that comes down purely to preference. I can raise minor criticisms but there are no dealbreakers, nothing that will make distract from how compelling it becomes to see through Josef's quest to reunite with his girlfriend. What Machinarium does, it does extremely well.As with many games of the genre, it's a fairly brief journey, clocking in at around two hours if you're adept. It's not the longest game by any means and the ending is abrupt and slightly underwhelming but it manages not to overstay its welcome. The brevity does nothing to impact a powerful tale that had me smiling at several moments; you can put a value on the length of a game but it's much harder to put a value on something that makes you feel.

												I, a robot?Adventure is only a point-and-click away as Irreverend Opinions reviews Machinarium!---The BlurbA puzzle adventure in a stylised world of robots and amazing music.  A robot that has been abandoned by his city in pieces must pull himself together and return to not only confront some rather bad robots, but save his robot girlfriend in the process.The GoodThe first thing I noticed about Machinarium, as a first impression, is the music.  The soundtrack by Czech composer Tomáš Dvořák[floex.cz] really stands out in the task of impressing a strange new world without alienating the player from what they are engaged in.Graphically, the art style for Machinarium is quite striking, with hand-drawn animation hauntingly evocative of works by surrealist Jan Švankmajer, and seeming to be another achievement for Dvorský that fans of Amatina Design will be encouraged to see.  With their pencil-and-paper 'living comic' art style, the organic appearance of the background and characters helps to round out the artificial world with a warm and almost human sense, which helps the player to get involved with the characters quite readily.For an adventure game without dialogue at all, the plot is quite memorable and involving, with the characters having both impact and personality.  By removing dialogue from the game, the designers also allow the game to be accessible to players who do not speak English, using thought bubbles and pictures, authentic instruments and short beeps or buzzes to illustrate what characters are thinking or asking.Puzzles throughout the game are both thought-provoking and challenging, sometimes requiring the player to think outside the box to complete tasks without pushing for weird feats of skewed logic present in some games of the genre.  Should the game prove to be too much of a bother, an in-built 'hint' system allows players to get some suggestions to how they can complete the task.The BadFor some players, the puzzles will be a bit too challenging, though thankfully a short minigame can help to unlock the puzzles if you are more of a mind to do a reflexive shooter than a point-and-click puzzle solve.Some players have reported having issues with transferring the game from fullscreen to windowed mode, though this seems to be more of a UI confusion than a bug issue.The UglyNone to speak of.SuggestionsTurn out the lights and enjoy the immersive, imaginative world.The SummaryWell deserving of the awards it has recieved, Machinarium is a beautiful game with something special for art and music lovers, as well as fans of the point-and-click puzzle genre.  10/10.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												Machinarium was the first video game I've ever played, so I like to look at it as the start of my adventure behind the computer screen.I think I was around 13 at the time. We didn't have a console or gameboy at home and the only previous contact I had had with games happened when I went to my friend's place to play FIFA on his PS2. I remember there was only one computer in my place and it was my dad's work laptop. We barely ever touched it. One day my father came home with a usb pen which he took from a colleague by mistake. It had this game inside (probably an illegal copy). After having finished it, my dad gave me and my younger sisters permission to use his laptop to play Machinarium. He even encouraged us to play it, sort of like when he tried to convince us to read good books. This on itself tells a lot about the game, considering how conservative my father used to be when it came to video games.Anyway, from then on we started gathering in front of the computer screen every day to play the game one hour each time. It was everyone's favourite part of the day. Everyone looked forward to the time just before dinner when my father used to get home. He'd open the laptop, launch the game and we'd all get absorbed by these hand-drawn scenarios, the adorable robots and the fascinating music. Eventually my mom joined in and soon this became something we'd do as a family every day (we're five). Can you imagine five people in front of a laptop playing a point-and-click game? Ye, it's as weird as it sounds.The interesting part is my parents don't even like video games or technology in general. They are bookworms more than anything else and for instance they are heavily against my usage of the PC for entertainment. But somehow... somehow this game captivated them. Somehow they were able (more like eager) to spend an hour of their busy lives to take part in this adventure. And the fact that I was able to immerse myself in this masterpiece together with my parents and sisters, makes me look back at this time of my life with fondness and gratitude. Fondness towards the fact that this game united my family and brought us closer together. And gratitude towards my father for having introduced me to video games in the best way possible... through a game with an amazingly well-written storyline, beautiful and charming visuals, a stunningly atmospheric ost (one of the best soundtracks I've heard) and challenging/clever puzzles. This game will always have a special place in my heart and I couldn't recommend it more.PS: I eventually bought this game on Humble Bundle to support the devs but I haven't played it since.PS2: I find it funny that the trigger that started my video game adventure 6 years ago was pulled by my parents, who were so against this kind of stuff to start with. Little did they know...			"

												One of the best point-and-click adventure games I've seen, along with Monkey Island series, The Longest Journey series, Syberia series, Broken Sword series, Discworld, Full Thortle, and Broken Age (I may have forgot some.). Brilliant art design and story, with a futuristic sci-fi touch. Definitely a must-play if you enjoy this genre...Note: Do not make the mistake of comparing Machinarium with Botanicula or Samorost series (which are the other point-and-click adventures of Amanita Design), and coming to a conclusion about Machinarium. Trust me, they are as different as possible.			"

												Manchinarium is a good game for senior game players like me. Easy going and yet challenging with hints and maps to use more or less depending on your brain function at that moment. It's creative, funny, and quirky, without going dark. I like how the little guy folds his arms and taps his foot when it takes you too long to figure something out, the way I picture my sons.			"

												More than a point and click game, but shorter than a traditional puzzle game, Mechinarium relies heavily on its stylized graphics to woo the player. The puzzles are less intuitive than most games, and the creators chose not to use “easy pixels” to highlight important items. This made Mechinarium more challenging than most. It was worth the effort. The story comes through near the end, and I’m glad I stuck with it. Be prepared to think outside the box.			"

												I like the art style and music. Puzzles are standard moon-logic that you'd expect out of  a point and click adventure game. But unlike most of them this has a hint book built right into it that you have to play a tedious minigame to get into. Which is probably good because it makes it not too trivial to look at but not too hard either. A good transplant of the dead-tree books we'd get with the adventure games on disk of yore. It took me longer than everyone else on my list who has it to get through it. Seven hours.			"

												Machinarium is an enjoyable point and click adventure which has you play as a cool little robot dude in a wasteland of debris.I enjoyed this game, as I'm a big fan of point and click adventures. In terms of difficulty, the game was okay, but later on ramped up the difficulty quite severely to the point where I was just stuck. Which happens, in these kinds of games, but the world was so vast that I couldn't work out the problems as logically as I should have.But that isn't a flaw, it's just a design choice. For me, it bugged me, but it wasn't a big deal at all.If you like point-and-click adventure games, check this one out, as it's one of the most well-known of them all.Nilesy			"

												I adore Amanita Design's games, this one is no exception. Machinarium is a wonderful example of non-verbal story telling, telling a heart warming story through imagery and game mechanics. Sometimes the puzzles are a bit obtuse in a standard point 'n' click kind of way, so I will admit to looking up walkthroughs a couple of times but that might be my own failing.I can't post much about the story without spoilers, so I'll just recommend that you get immersed in the wonderful visuals and try to play this in one sitting if you have the time because it's quite lovely.

												Don't you ever say this is a kids' game.Because it is not.Machinarium, in fact, is a great standalone from Amanita Design, a game development studio I am very proud of being from the same country as I am. It's a point-and-click adventure game about Machinarium - an ancient city of robots. You take control of Joseph, a robot thrown out of the city and dumped for untold reasons, and you'll lead him trough hours of great drawing and animations, story great yet simply told and soundtrack that you just have to love and admire as he makes his way back to the top, rescues his ""girlfriend"" Bertha, saves the city and escapes from it.Point-and-click adventures are highly relying on their story, yet this game doesn't feature a single line of text (exception to main menu and credits). Instead, it explains it with simple comics which appear in classical speech bubbles. This adds to a feeling of really being a robotic being that doesn't need any words to explain it's thoughts, even though I don't believe the creation such a feeling would be truly intentional in it's nature.The gameplay is simple as well, featuring locations with several puzzles and riddles you need to complete in order to advance further trough the city and the story. However, they aren't in any way dumb or repetetive, and can provide several hours of fun for those who enjoy solving these. And if you don't, the game always has a helpful guide for the location you can unlock trough fulfilling a simple minigame.The graphics and design are the most awesome things about this game, providing you with beautiful sceneries, impecable characters and detailed drawings of the city and it's parts all along your path to the top. The city looks industrial and mechanical, creating a kind of a depressing feeling, with rust and metal pipes everywhere. The graphics are a true art, and that is not a statment I make lightly. Same of course goes for the soundtrack, so get ready to stay looking at the scenery and listening to a music, balancing at the edge of falling into depression or starting maniacally laughing. The feel is something many ""horror games"" of today miss - and yet this game doesn't even have to try to achieve it.So my recommendation is simple - Go for it.			"

												Machinarium is point & click adventure set in beautiful world of robots. Game is not easy. Difficulty is set in a way that even smart people need to think hard to complete game without help. Problems are logical enough and you need to use your imagination a bit. Logic mini game puzzles are probably the hardest part of the game. Some of them take a bit of time to solve. When you solve a problem reward is sense of accomplishment and moving forward in the game. If you know exactly what to do and just walk the walk, Machinarium is about 1.5 hours long. But length of a game is probably about 10 hours if you get stuck a lot and want to solve everything without help (like me). This is a beautiful game that reminds me of the best P&C titles I played for the length of years. I recommend it to everyone who is not afraid to use the gray matter between the ears :-)			"

PROS:+ cute story+ beautiful art style+ original atmosphere/levels+ mostly fun puzzles+ hint/advice system+ speech bubble communication+ great soundtrackCONS:- UI is a bit clunky sometimes- simple story & not much replayability- couple of annoying puzzlesComment:I remember playing this game years ago with my dad. Well, he was playing mostly, telling me what to do. Now I played it again and I have to see this game aged really well. The beautiful graphics style coupled with a great soundtrack gives you a great feel right away. There is no talking in this game but you get the whole story line just as easily via speech bubbles. But maybe this is also why some extra effort was not put into making the story and characters more detailed and less flat. Puzzles are kind of cool most of the time although there are some that were just weird to figure out.Overall it is a fantastic game with a couple of flaws which you will forgive because of the unique setting of a robot town.

												Machinarium is a very well made puzzle game.However, the gameplay itself and the puzzle difficulty is waaaaaay to extreme for beginners/a bit experienced puzzle gamers.Most of the puzzles are not logical, and you will either have to play the little mini-game inside the game to unlock a hint, or look up a guide on the internet, because alot of these puzzles will literally break your head and poop down your neck.The style of the game is very unique and very well drawn. I really liked it.The characters are all weird, but I liked all of them too.I haven't finished the game and I don't plan on finishing it. Why? Because it is waaaay too hard without a guide for me, and I am not a guy who likes looking up guides on the internet. I did it once, and they are SOOOO confusing because the things you have to do in this game in order to solve a puzzle is just... too much lol.9/10 as a puzzle game, simply because it is probably one of the hardest and yet most rewarding puzzle games I've EVER played in my whole entire life!7/10 as a game in general. It is definitely nothing for casual players or unexperienced puzzle players.			"

												Machinarium is and adventure game from the hands of developers from Amanita design (who are my fellow countrymen) who are responsible for couple of very well accepted adventure games. Machinarium is another one of those and it can boast a very cute, original and !lovely! art followed by a very decent soundtrack.Adventures are usually a story driven games and Machinarium is no exception, though compared to other adventures it is quite exceptional. There is not a single line of text (spoken or written) and the story is narrated with the use of comics bubbles showing thoughts of characters in pictures. I would not like to spoil anything and my memory is also a little fuzzy since I have been playing the game with months worth of pauses so I will not dig deep into the story, but to outline it a little I will say at least a bit. You are a small, male robot who has been separated from his sweet robot ""girlfriend"" and you have to find her. To do so you have to travel through a robot town doing the usuall adventurist stuff like using and combining items.As for the art itself, as I have said, it is really cute however overally the locations and characters are actually depressing, very dark and negatively industrial. This leads to pretty mixed feelings because on one hand you admire the cuteness of the drawings, on the other you feel sorry and sad.What I cannot vouch for is the design of the puzzles. They are not insanely hard, actually you will probably be able to guess what you are supposed to do pretty fast, or that was at least my case, however the steps needed to get it done seemed pretty much random and I did often struggle with them. There is nothing more frustrating than knowing the answer and struggling with finding the right paper to write it on. Because of that I often had to resort to using the build in hint system.The hint system has two levels. Upon using the first level, your little robot will pop a thought comics bubble and give you a small hint usually pointing out what it is you should do in the current room and you are to find a way to do it yourself. This may help you, but as I have already said, figuring out what to do is not much of a problem, but how to do it, that's the question. And that is what level 2 hint is for, if you are really desperate you can use it, but in order for it to work you have to finish a small mini-game which involves navigating a key through areas and monsters in kind of a side scrolling shoot-them-up (like Space Impact on old Nokia cells). Upon finishing it (and you will probably hate every second of it, because it has terrible hitbox and is just no fun) you will be given a comics like page in a book showing you step-by-step walkthrough.So to sum up, I did like this game to an extent mainly because of the art and soundtrack. Story was good enough but I was really annoyed with puzzles and the hint system. I do recommend you to play this game, but I would say, don't feel a shame if you want to grab a hint or two, or rather get  a walkthrough on the internet (if you hate the minigame required to complete for the hint as much as I did) when you are stuck for unreasonably long time.

												It’s not often that a point and click adventure grabs my attention these days, in fact the only two that come to mind are Back to the Future and Finding Teddy, yet Machinarium had just the right charm to stand out amongst the masses and pull me in.And it’s a good thing too, because without the adorable robot/steampunkish skin, the precious animations, and fantastic soundscape, Machinarium would just be another generic point and click puzzle game. The puzzles themselves were often convoluted and some just outright infuriated me when I found out what you had to do to solve them. If I had not been so invested in this adorable little robot and watching him move around this world my game time would have ended after about 45 minutes.If you love what you see in the screenshots, and are not totally averse to the Point and Click genre then I think there’s a ton of enjoyment to be had with Machinarium. However, if you find this genre of game insufferable or don’t find the same charm in the art that I do, then steer clear because there’s nothing here that you’re not expecting.			"

												A wonderful point and click adventure game. The artwork and music are both fantastic, the story is compelling, the humour is brilliant, and it being told entirely pictorially is really nice. The one downside, as others have noted, is the abrupt and unsatisying ending. Overall, though, this is a truly great game, which I would definitely reccomend.			"

												It breaks my heart to give Machinarium a ""No"". I played a demo, then I saved for it, I loved the art, and I was determined to love it... but nope.PROS:+ Beautiful steampunk-esque artwork.+ Original setting and dialog by drawings in bubbles.CONS:- No saves... Your saves won't stay!- The puzzles aren't logical. It starts ok (I did play the demo!), but then it becomes ""click on everything ad nauseam until something works"", which is the worst kind of point and click ever.- That alone wouldn't be that bad (I played a lot of those...), but the steps needed for each trial and error become incredibly annoying after a while.The way the character walks slowly when you forget to put him back to ""regular"" size is adorable... the first hour.Now, IF you enjoy this kind of ""click on random pixel hunt until something happens"" games, you will love Machinarium and its really beautiful hand drawn environment.EDIT: I understand most people disagreeing with me; it's a truly beautiful game, and I see how people wouldn't find this ""helpful"", especially when helpful/not helpful is the only way Steam can allow us to like/dislike a review. I tried to help other buyers, rather than simply bashing the game, explaining the things I didn't like in it. And I do hope it helps!			"

												Machinarium was, I believe, the second game I owned on Steam. Now I have 1000 games but Machinarium still holds a place in my heart. As Amanita's first full-length game, it has its flaws - Save-game issues, originally had no achievements, now it has achievements but they don't unlock. Slow, unskippable walking animations. The seemingly unescapable ""click the exact pixel"" puzzles. In spite of all that, Machinarium has undeniable charm and style. Beautiful art, one of my favourite video game soundtracks. Clever puzzles to accompany a gorgeous game. I think everyone should finish Machinarium at least once, which is saying something considering how many flaws I was able to list. For what Machinarium does right, it excels at.8.5/10			"

												A really pretty and charming point-and-click adventure with puzzles which are tough without just being stupid and illogical. The's hand-drawn steampunk art is really great to look at, and the thought bubbles instead of speech make for no reading in the entire game other than signs in-universe, and the hint system is pretty cool, giving first a basic hint then giving you a full solution after playing a minigame - however I'd still recommend using an online walkthrough as 1) the minigame is rather slow and 2) the minigame-like puzzles, however fun, will certainly get you stuck the most, and are not detailed in the in-game walkthrough.

												Machinarium is a gorgeous point and click puzzler from Amanita Design, who have also created the wonderful Samorost series and Botanicula. Having played their other titles I can honestly tell you that Machinarium has a similarily beautiful world that you must make your way through to complete the game. The robot city you will explore in this title is extremely detailed, with emotionally moving scenescapes galore. The puzzles featured in this title are also the most challenging of Amanita's catalogue, though this is no criticism. Each puzzle is unique from the last, and will take careful consideration to solve. Just as the wold of Machinarium is complex and detailed, so to are its puzzles. I would highly recommend this title to fans of any of Amanita's work, or those who would enjoy a gorgeous and engaging puzzler to sink a few hours into.			"

For a very long time I hadn’t played any point and clicks and I was really yearning for a decent one to play. This game right here definitely fits the bill.This game is beautiful, the artwork is just amazing, it’s very pleasing to look at and satisfying to play.You play as a very innocent little robot that is searching for someone he loves after being thrown out to the trash. You work your way through pickling puzzles that can really challenge you and your ability to make sense of something without obvious clues. We are talking pen and paper, taking notes kind of stuff here.It’s a wonderfully made game that is extremely fulfilling. The characters are loveable and it’s easy to get completely immersed into.One of the best indie games I have ever played, I highly recommend this one.			"

												Machinarium is a beautiful and maybe a bit short graphic adventure in which we control a nameless little robot trying to get back to its home city and learning why he got expelled from it in the first place.With a great and unique artistic style and no dialogues, Machinarium almost always manages to comunicate the player ""what does he need to do next"", although there are some points in the story in which the in-game help (Through both hints and a total solution for a puzzle, unlockable through a mini-game that you have to beat each time you want to check it so you don't have instant access to it) is kind of needed, as the next objective is not too clear.The puzzles are not too hard to solve, although some of them are challenging enough to get stuck on them for some time (Which is kind of the point in this type of games), and they are usually ""logical"" puzzles (Sliders, buttons, etc) with even some mini-games (A space invaders clone, a small top-down shooter game..) to add some variety to our little robot's adventure.Machinarium is a charming adventure game, with emphasis on logical puzzles more than in the ""mix items A and B to get C to open door D"" formula and an adjusted difficulty to provide a nice challenge while not making the player go crazy. A great addition to anyone's game collection.Also, I blame Amanita design for not selling a toy of the little robot :(			"

Short version: 82%Machinarium is a textless point ‘n’ click adventure game set in a robot world with a really memorable design, difficult puzzles, and a simple, yet wonderful story.Long version:Anamita Design is famous for their adventure games where the entire story is told purely in visuals, without any voices or text. Machinarium is no exception.The game is set in a strange world, where cyberpunk-style city slums and rust heaps meet very friendly, children’s storybook-like character design and story structure. Even the story is childishly simple, from a certain degree: you are a little “boy” who must save his girlfriend from a band of good-for-nothing hoodlums. These bullies not only managed to throw him out of the city after hurting his mentor(?), but also plan to cause further havoc among the peace-loving citizens.Machinarium has an interesting difficulty curve. Initially, all scenes are self-contained puzzles, but after a while it switches to traditional point ‘n’ click format. You suddenly have a somewhat decent-sized city to search for items you can use, but it won’t be easy. The world is quite alien despite the somewhat human-like elements, and there are no descriptions anywhere. This can make identifying objects quite tricky sometimes, so prepare to resort to some brute force trial and error.Despite the difficulty, the game is surprisingly short; if you start it up again knowing all the solutions, you can enjoy the full story in about two hours. As an Anamita game this length is pretty much expected, and you can know that you get a sweet, fun and charming little gem– with a memorable soundtrack– for your money.			"

Machinarium is a 2D click-and-point adventure with a charming story, amazing lovingly drawn backgrounds and a wonderfully completing soundtrack. The game’s atmosphere immediately touches the heart and the whole concept is quite inspiring. It’s somehow a mix of Salvador Dalí and an enchanted picture book. The puzzles are not easy yet not too hard, especially because the game helps, if one hasn’t any clue of what to do – and even this help is embedded in a nice mini-game. Overall it’s clear: the game is created by heart and not by financial thoughts. I recommend this game to anyone but children – even if the story may suit a child’s fantasy, the puzzles are not, because of their difficulty. The game is slow-paced yet interesting and is a good match for people who are new to this genre as well as for point-and-click fans. Machinarium is a fantastic game.			"

												I give Machinarum90%In a Nutshell:Casual 2D puzzle game, with great art and music.Pros:Fun. Puzzles aren’t terribly difficult. The artwork is amazingly detailed, the foreground and background tie together to the point where you want to click everything to see what it does. The music goes perfectly with the game which when you are stuck on a puzzle less aggravating.Cons:More content. It ends too soon. Other Notes:It’s a flash game. You don’t need a supercomputer to play this. It’ll look great on any computer.			"

												Superb, my new favorite point & Click game.Its polish as ♥♥♥♥ simply put.

												I had a ton of fun playing this game! The art, animations and music are all great and although it didn't have any dialouge the story was still conveyed nicely through thought bubbles and pictures. Most of the puzzles are pretty easy and straight forward, but I found the last three (bead, robot brain and sound puzzles) to be the most difficult and they may cause some trouble for first time Point n' Click players. Overall I'd give it 9/10Be advised that unlike most other Point n' Click games the robot has to be near an object to ineract with it, you aren't able to click on things from across the room and have him walk to and activate it.Here's a link to the demo incase you want to give a go before purchasing.http://machinarium.net/demo/ "

It's such a unfun disconnect that after playing it once or twice, you much rather google a picture of the clues/answers it gives then bother doing it.			"

												Artistic Score: 9.5/10Gameplay Score: 9.5/10Overall Score: 9.5/10Machinarium is a highly atmospheric point and click sci-fi adventure game. The game's creepy but also eerily beautiful art sets it apart from other games and makes it a totally unique and engrossing experience. The difficulty is well balanced; challenging but completely doable.Pros:+Beautiful art that really takes you into another world. The paintings in this game have so much character. Together with the music it feels deeply atmospheric and it's a great experience.+Nice soundtrack that fits perfectly with the game.+Excellent gameplay. Great puzzles with the perfect difficulty; challenging enough that I was racking my brains but not impossible. Occasional minigames also enhance the experience.+A simple story that, through the atmosphere created by the art and music, is told beautifully and seamlessly.Cons:-The game doesn't support right click, which would be a really nice way to let the player send items back to the inventory. Right now right clicking yeilds an ""about Adobe Flash Player"" tab, which slightly cheapens the look of the game, which is so beautiful otherwise.As a side note it took me about 7 hours to beat the game.This game is so perfect, so beautiful, that there's no reason why anyone on Earth shouldn't experience it for themselves. I can't stress it enough; this is really one that you have to play to experience.			"

												Machinarium is one of those cute little Indie designs that, due to it's small team or low budget, has to pick up its boots and survive on its charm alone, and while concise and simplistic, it does that in spades. A sombre meander through a beautifully stylized, decaying robotic and alien world.HighlightsThe reason Machinarium works so well is that it's very simple, what would normally be a flat flash game has been given life with tone, interaction, soundtrack and art style all marrying together to create a truly solid little game.* The lack of dialogue and the fantastic sound and music, when placed together with the rustic, dystopian art really give the world a strong but still alien character to the world and make you want to explore and see more of it* Little detailed works like the mini-games for hints add a fun layer of light wonderMistakes* Genuinely none that take away from the game other than perhaps a lacklustre endingRecommendationsPlay time clocks in at 5 hours, and there are better indie titles out there for less than Machinarium, and with more replay value, of which Machinarium has very little, but at £7.49/8.49€/$9.99, it's still a reasonably priced and is a good buy when on sale.There's also an Amanita Collection, which matches the prices of the separate games, but adds the value of the Machinarium soundtrack for free, but since it's soothing and ambient, but not a particularly amazing soundtrack, buying the titles separately is going to be the better choice for most.* There's a free demo available on the store page* You can play Samorost (a previous flash title by Amanita) on their website for free[amanita-design.net]* [spoler]The bricks with the spiders in the hint-book sometimes spell out the word rebol..[/spoiler] ..if you type ""rebol"" on the start screen you will gain access to a developer menu where you can select all levels and access all items* There's was a limited edition Machinarium Fan Edition[forum.amanita-design.net] which may still be available on Amazon "

												This is probably my new favorite adventure game. It's beautiful, charming, funny, and very clever.I had played the App Store version most of the way through, and it still took some thinking to redo the puzzles in the Steam copy. One of the most challenging puzzles is near the beginning of the game, so if the first few areas don't seem too bad, you won't need to resort to a guide.There was only one puzzle whose solution seemed a bit arbitrary and illogical (it has to do with a bird...), and I admit to figuring it out by accident. Other than that one example, I really appreciated the intuitive design of every other single element in the game, which made the puzzle solving a pleasant experience even while I was scratching my head or ""stuck"". I also played this with no less than three non-gamers, and they all enjoyed getting into it as much as I did.I have read many people complaining about the game's length, saying it took 6-8 hours on average while using the in-game guide for the tougher puzzles. I am a decent puzzle solver (not great), and it easily netted me 10 hours of gameplay time without using a guide at all. That having been said, knowing the solutions can make a speed run of an hour or two very easy.Machinarium is innovative and brilliant, and I like it.8/10			"

												An ""indie"" game from before they were cool, Machinarium combines creative point and click tasks with excellent puzzles that briefly pop you out of the point and click interface to solve problems similar to classic real world mind benders like unhook the horeshoe/nails puzzle (but not that).  It wraps all this up in an immersive world of decrepit technology and cute little sentient robots.  One thing that works well in this game is the complete absence of dialog.  And I don't mean just spoken dialog - there is no spoken or written language at all.  The story and game progression is communicated through hand drawn diagrams and trail and error.  The game is entirely in flash, so your controls are usually limited to left mouse button and mouse movement.  Although, the game has a built in hint system comprised of a very short SHMUP sequence that allows you to use the keyboard.  Strangely an end game action sequence forced me to use mouse control which was the only real point where I experienced significant frustration while playing the game.Overall, this game is easy to recommend even at full price.  The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating and the pace of self discovery is excellent for a point and click game.  The art style really makes you feel like you are discovering a new world, and invites you to participate in it with its quirky characters.			"

												Beautifully drawn, but clearly insufficiently playtested. Some of the puzzles rely on visually finding the equivalent of a needle in a haystack. The character you control moves agnoizingly slowly at times, which decimates the game's playability.If only the authors had been as skilled at desigining user experience as they are at visual art, this game would be spectacular,.Oh, and if you buy the soundtrack DLC, you only get lossy MP3 files.

												I'm really enjoying this game. It has a great graphical style, funny animations, and fun puzzles. If a puzzle solution isn't working out, the game has a built-in hint mini-game that lets you unlock a hint page for a given location. This is useful for when you have an idea of what needs to be done, but just can't figure out the right combination of inventory item, location, and action to make it happen. I like that it makes you work a little bit for the hints.I'm only partway through right now, but am looking forward to continuing through the story.			"

												A wonderful puzzle adventure that reminds me in some ways of Myst. The challenges don't get quite as deep and long-reaching, but they still require the player to be observant, clever, and logical. Fortunately, if you get stuck you can get hints or play a small mini-game to unlock the cheat book that tells you how to beat the current challenge in your path.			"

												A good game, if you enjoy handdrawn art, style-fitting music, logic puzzles and point and click adventures. Has mini-games build in. Gets more difficult as you progress but not frustrating. Every puzzle is different. I really enjoyed the art style of the game, all fits so well together. Another big plus was the variety of puzzles. At one moment u play space invaders the other moment u solve a mosaic puzzle, a few minutes later u solve a sound puzzle, how awesome it that?			"

												If you like indie point-and-click games with detailed quirky graphics, challenging (and often frustrating) puzzles, and loveable characters all set to the soundtrack that would make a techno minimalist ♥♥♥♥♥♥, this is the game for you. Machinarium starts off a bit rough around the edges, you don't really care for your main character nor understand what his goal in the game is. But that's just the best part. The amazing thing is, without ANY dialogue, you start to become concerned for him as you start to overcome obstacles. In short the pros:- great 2D graphics- character development and plot- for $3.49 this game entertained me for ~5 hours and more (since I'm almost finished)- majority of puzzles are innovative- added element since main character can adjust himself to be taller/shorter- hints and walkthrough provided by game (you just have to work for them)cons:- HOLY CRAP some of the puzzles get hard and redundant- you walk really freaking slowIf I have convinced you to purchase this game, my last bit of advice would be to either 1. have patience or 2. get good at killing spiders			"

												I was fortunate enough to pick this game up in a bundled sale a little while ago. It was also my first experience with a point-and-click adventure game, and I have to say that it did a great job convincing me to play more in this genre. The art style is wonderful, with a rough and hand-drawn feel to the environment and characters, while important items stand out just enough to notice them without losing the immersion in each area. The setting and the story feel very rich without any words or text throughout the entire game, though sometimes it feels like you're not accomplishing anything, just finding things to click on.The puzzles in the game are varied and plenty, testing your spatial reasoning, forethought, attention to detail, and in a few cases, reaction time. While collecting items to propel the story, there are times when you'll be carrying three or four different things around, but it rarely goes past that, and figuring out which items to combine is never a struggle. Some of the obstacles actually require you to use items separately, but in conjunction with each other, which took me a good deal longer than I care to admit to figure out how it was supposed to work.There are times you'll sit in front of your computer, just thinking ""I don't know what to do..."" for 10 minutes, and some of the puzzles are so frustrating that you might just force your way through them instead of thinking through it; however, I don't believe those moments detract from the game that much, because even when you're wandering aimlessly, not noticing that one item sitting on the ground that would let you move on, you're still treated to a beautiful environment and great music which creates a perfect atmospheric feel to the experience.Overall, I think this game is worth playing, and I don't think $10 is too much to spend on it. There are a few thing's I would have liked different, but that might be because of my inexperience in the genre. It is a challenging, engaging game that will give you 3-6 hours of fun the first time through. The biggest issue for me is replay value, and a second time through will let you focus on the story instead of the puzzles, which I consider a good enough reason to play again.			"

												Before point and click adventures never interested me. They seemed boring with their lack of action and their settings were always something i could find in a more interesting game. Machinarium changed that. I still prefer action titles but Machinarium had the unique charm i had heard about. Not too easy, not too hard, i loved it. The story telling was superb and the atmosphere was unlike any other game I've played. This nameless robot had wedged himself into my heart and is now one of my favorite video game characters, from one of my most memorable games, with one of the most memorable adventures.This game is ABSOLUTELY worth the full price!

For some of the puzzles, I had to resort to using their hints. That being said, the only thing I didn't like was that you have to play the mini-game each time you want to look at the hints, even if you've already played the mini-game to unlock a certain puzzle's hints; it became quite tedious.Overall, Machinarium is a lovely point-and-click adventure game with a cute little storyline and characters and challenging puzzles!

												A very charming point & click adventure that had me walking around and enjoying the atmosphere a lot instead of just rushing through the puzzles. In addition to the map-walking-item-using puzzles, occasional minigames make the experience even more colourful. The story and the solveable problems are great (when there is a missing step which is starting to become a nuisance, there are in-game schematics showing you how to solve the puzzles without demolishing the general feeling of accomplishment), but what makes this a wonderful game is the world you are in, which is alien yet highly likeable.The play time is really short and the game is not difficult at all, and it all left me wanting more.

												Machinarium is a point-and-click adventure game with heavy use of puzzles and brain teasers. It’s created by Amanita Design, a small, independent game developing studio based in the Czech Republic. The game was released in 2009, but that something is “old” doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s bad. “Old” in this case means that us patient gamers can get it on sale. “Old” in this case also means that the game is written in Flash, but we’ll come back to that later. Machinarium tells the story about Josef, a little robot who finds himself dumped on a scrapheap. After re-assembling himself he sets off towards the city to look for a friend. The story, which is told without the use of text or dialogue, unfolds as you play, and even though it’s not the most intriguing and creative story I’ve seen – you’ll probably feel it’s very familiar – it’s very well told.The story’s backdrop is beautiful, hand-drawn scenes accompanied to a lovely soundtrack by Floex, Amanita Design’s own in-house “sound maker”, as he is entitled on their website. The soundtrack is available here[store.floex.cz] if you want to listen to it. If I’d have to label it, I’d call it “industrial chill”, which is perfect for Machinarium – except for some plants and a bit of water, everything in the game is mechanized and industrial, including the local wild life. The game design is extraordinary well thought-through and the attention to detail is impressive.The puzzles you stumble across in Machinarium are mostly about pattern recognition. How to interact with the environment is also often part of the puzzles, which are very well balanced and just challenging enough for Average Joe. I got stuck once, but even if that happens, there is hope. Josef will have a small clue for you most of the time and if you find yourself feeling like an idiot for not being able to solve a puzzle even with his help, you can play a little mini-game that will reveal the solution, or at least give you some very good clues on how to solve it.But Machinarium, like all games, has its flaws. The game is written in Flash, and clicking the right mouse button brings up the Flash menu with its “About Flash” and whatnot. Since clicking the right mouse button is usually some kind of action in other point-and-click adventure games – for instance that you automatically put whatever you are holding back in to your inventory – the Flash menu got a bit annoying after a while. It’s mostly my own fault though, for not being able to memorize that I could not use the right mouse button to return whatever the little robot was holding in his hand back to the inventory. Instead the inventory had to be opened before the item could be returned. Point-and-click adventure games often involves a lot of pointing and clicking – hence the genre’s name – with items from the inventory, a process that got rather tedious.The game lagged considerably on my computer when played in fullscreen. It have to be said that my hardware isn’t what you would call state of the art, but it should be able to handle a game from 2009. Hardware acceleration was turned on in the Flash settings, but that didn’t help at all. I ended up playing the game in windowed mode, which worked a lot better and was fine since fullscreen didn’t really add anything to the game: The resolution used in both fullscreen and window mode is the same. The immense detail of the background images also proved to be a challenge: In one of the scenes, it was virtually impossible to see that the main character could interact with an object on the screen, and it was only by accident I clicked on it.But in spite of these minor issues, Machinarium is a great game. If you like puzzle games and brain teasers, you should go right ahead and buy it. It won’t entertain you that long, it took me only 6 hours to complete the game and I really suck at puzzles, but at the asking price of USD 10 it’s certainly worth it.This review is also available on http://www.vegard.net/.

												If you like indie point-and-click games with detailed quirky graphics, challenging (and often frustrating) puzzles, and loveable characters all set to the soundtrack that would make a techno minimalist ♥♥♥♥♥♥, this is the game for you. Machinarium starts off a bit rough around the edges, you don't really care for your main character nor understand what his goal in the game is. But that's just the best part. The amazing thing is, without ANY dialogue, you start to become concerned for him as you start to overcome obstacles. In short the pros:- great 2D graphics- character development and plot- for $3.49 this game entertained me for ~5 hours and more (since I'm almost finished)- majority of puzzles are innovative- added element since main character can adjust himself to be taller/shorter- hints and walkthrough provided by game (you just have to work for them)cons:- HOLY CRAP some of the puzzles get hard and redundant- you walk really freaking slowIf I have convinced you to purchase this game, my last bit of advice would be to either 1. have patience or 2. get good at killing spiders			"

												A very charming point & click adventure that had me walking around and enjoying the atmosphere a lot instead of just rushing through the puzzles. In addition to the map-walking-item-using puzzles, occasional minigames make the experience even more colourful. The story and the solveable problems are great (when there is a missing step which is starting to become a nuisance, there are in-game schematics showing you how to solve the puzzles without demolishing the general feeling of accomplishment), but what makes this a wonderful game is the world you are in, which is alien yet highly likeable.The play time is really short and the game is not difficult at all, and it all left me wanting more.

												Before point and click adventures never interested me. They seemed boring with their lack of action and their settings were always something i could find in a more interesting game. Machinarium changed that. I still prefer action titles but Machinarium had the unique charm i had heard about. Not too easy, not too hard, i loved it. The story telling was superb and the atmosphere was unlike any other game I've played. This nameless robot had wedged himself into my heart and is now one of my favorite video game characters, from one of my most memorable games, with one of the most memorable adventures.This game is ABSOLUTELY worth the full price!

												I was fortunate enough to pick this game up in a bundled sale a little while ago. It was also my first experience with a point-and-click adventure game, and I have to say that it did a great job convincing me to play more in this genre. The art style is wonderful, with a rough and hand-drawn feel to the environment and characters, while important items stand out just enough to notice them without losing the immersion in each area. The setting and the story feel very rich without any words or text throughout the entire game, though sometimes it feels like you're not accomplishing anything, just finding things to click on.The puzzles in the game are varied and plenty, testing your spatial reasoning, forethought, attention to detail, and in a few cases, reaction time. While collecting items to propel the story, there are times when you'll be carrying three or four different things around, but it rarely goes past that, and figuring out which items to combine is never a struggle. Some of the obstacles actually require you to use items separately, but in conjunction with each other, which took me a good deal longer than I care to admit to figure out how it was supposed to work.There are times you'll sit in front of your computer, just thinking ""I don't know what to do..."" for 10 minutes, and some of the puzzles are so frustrating that you might just force your way through them instead of thinking through it; however, I don't believe those moments detract from the game that much, because even when you're wandering aimlessly, not noticing that one item sitting on the ground that would let you move on, you're still treated to a beautiful environment and great music which creates a perfect atmospheric feel to the experience.Overall, I think this game is worth playing, and I don't think $10 is too much to spend on it. There are a few thing's I would have liked different, but that might be because of my inexperience in the genre. It is a challenging, engaging game that will give you 3-6 hours of fun the first time through. The biggest issue for me is replay value, and a second time through will let you focus on the story instead of the puzzles, which I consider a good enough reason to play again.			"

												Machinarium is a puzzle point & click adventure game. The game has a captivating story, where the player character, a robot has to collect items to help him solve certain puzzles to get further through the story. There is no dialogue, spoken or written. Instead the game uses animated thought bubbles, which I feel gets the story across very well. The game has really interesting puzzles, beautifully detailed hand drawn style graphics, which help hide any obvious click areas in the game. The music and sound effects are very good. Probably not much replayability once you've gone through it once, nevertheless a game worth getting for it's great puzzles, story and excellent style.9/10			"

												At this point this game has been critically aproved but I feel like leaving a positive review anyway. Normally I'm not a fan of point and click adventure games but Machinarium has sold me on the idea of them. Great art design, captivating world, and imersive story that unfolds without even a single word being spoken all build something greater than the sum of their parts. If you like point and click adventure games Machinarium will make a great addition to your collection; If you don't it might just change your mind.			"

												I'm glad that I bought and played Machinarium, so I have no regrets. I enjoyed playing it. However, I should point out that some of the solutions to puzzles during the game didn't really make sense. Most of the puzzles were reasonable, some real thought or investigation was needed to solve them. But a few were just off the wall. I can't imagine many (if any) people completing the entire game without having to get a hint or consult a walkthrough at some point.			"

												Im Spiel Machinarium spielt man den kleinen lieben Roboter Josef, der seine Freundin aus den Klauen des Böse retten muss.Das Spiel ist in der  Klick and Point Adventures Ecke zu finden.Die Rätsel sind manchmal echt hart und man braucht ab und zu echt Gehirnschmalz um hinter das Geheimnis zukommen.Aber man braucht keine Angst haben das man nie durch kommt. Wenn man nicht mehr weiter kommt kann man ein kleines Buch öffnen (das öffnen wird durch ein kleines Spiel verschönert) und dann sieht man die Lösung an Hand von Comicbildern.Die Grafik ist wirklich wunderschön gezeichnet worden. In jeder kleinen Ecken kann man einen kleinen Roboter oder etwas ähnliches bewegen sehen.Das Spiel kommt komplett ohne Sprachausgabe aus, so wird dem Spieler alles per Comicbildern gezeigt und erklärt.Genre: Abenteuer, IndieEntwickler: Amanita Design Publisher: Amanita Design Bewertung:10/10 Klick and Point EckeWir wünschen euch viel Spass beim spielen/rätzeln.Euer Team PixelHeads			"

												This is a point-and-click puzzle solving game where unlike the most popular FPS games, there aren't enemies to shoot at and you can't die...  However, it is still a LOT of fun!The graphics are for the most part still backgrounds but they are quite beautiful.  The character animation that is present I think is very well done.The soundtrack in this game is really good also and I found myself getting hooked on a few of the songs.For the most part I found it to be a nice low stress game where I could relax, explore, and solve the various puzzles.  I found the puzzles on average to be mildly challenging, with one or two what I'd say was a real challenge.  I do consider myself to have excellent puzzle-solving skills and these type of games tend to come easy to me so I'm sure some may find it much more difficult.  It will provide you with hints if you do get stuck.  My advice to anyone playing this is be VERY observant of whats around you and when the cursor changes to a hand, indicating a ""hot"" spot.I think anyone who likes to solve puzzles will enjoy this game.

												Machinarium is like a small box of hand-crafted chocolate truffles: it might seem expensive for something so small, yes for the same amount you could buy a lot more from the nearly as tasty other ones, but once in a while surely you can afford a true delicacy. Great visuals, very creative and distinct world design, decently hard to find out puzzles, simple but gogeuos little story, and a brilliant soundtrack make this game stand out.It is a short, sweet and memorable experience, much like the other games of Amanita.If you'd like to have a once-in-a-while dosage of 'gaming chocolate truffles' this is the studio you should keep attention to.

												Machinarium is a point and click game that has mind blowing animation quality.  You get involved with the main character, which is a cute little robot trying to save his ""girlfriend"".  The soundtrack is amazing as well.  I am the kind of guy who loves multiplayer games, more than singleplayer; but THIS is my favorite game even though it's one player.  The storyline is gripping, and is actually pretty well coordinated for you have to complete all of these challenges to get to each room, collect items, and satisfy each minor character in need of help.  The end is complete and gives you a feeling of relief.  A few areas may be tough, but Its all worth it.  It has beautiful artwork and an extra ""touch"" to the color.The only problem I have with it is it may glitch every once in a while by throwing away all saved data if you dont play within 2 months from the previous time of playing. Overall, I give this game an 11/10. . . Best game I have ever played!			"

												Will give a more detailed account below. For now, general informationThe Good --   - Good Aesthetic -- It looks nice, and it creates a very mellow atmosphere. The art style fits well.   - Intersting puzzles -- The puzzles are fun and challanging, with only a few that I would call bad   - Interesting story -- The narrative of the game is fun, interesting, and fairly light hearted. It's also kid friendly   - Good Hint system -- Both hint systems in the game are good in their own right. The Bad -- (mostly nitpicking)   - Same old adventure game problems -- has many of the problems old adventure games had          - Some puzzles have odd solutions, goals can be a bit random, trial and error, and backtracking a thing you missed.   - Some puzzles are hard to contextualize -- making the sequence of events occur correctly to get something can be tedious and hard to figure out. Not in a logistical way, more in a, ""how was i supposed to know the object would do that?"" way.   - No verbal communication can mean confusion as to what the game wants, which forces you to use both hint systems.   - Moving some objects will force you to follow through with the action. When you misclick, this can mean waiting 40 or so seconds before you can do what you were supposed to do. In a few cases, this would also reset a puzzle and force you to do it again.   - Some of the background noises grate on the ears a bit. Not a game i would recommend with headphones on.   - The controls are much more fitting a touchpad then a PCFull thoughts --This game was fun. Not the best thing I've ever played, and certainly nothing new. The art design is interesting, but everything else has been seen and done before. This isn't a bad thing, however, as the game delivers on what it promises. It's a puzzle game with no verbal feedback. The story is simple; you solve puzzles, move forward, and right the wrongs brought about by some bullies. You save a girl you know, and help the citizens who are bummed for one reason or another. It's a simple story, especially by adventure game standards, but it delivers on some really good puzzles and explaining everything without a word of spoken dialogue.The gameplay is point and click gameplay combined with puzzle solving. It's fairly standard and familiar, but still challanging. Mostly, you walk into a room, collect objects, and solve puzzles in the room to find more or allow for objects to interact with one another. In most cases it's easy to deduce what to do and where to start, though there are a few instances where you will resort to the hint systems to see what the game wants you to do. As for the hint systems, there are actually two in this game. One is a one per screen type of deal. It will rarely tell you what you do next, so much as what you need to accomplish in the room. Sometimes that's enough, but if you need more help there's a second option. There is a wallet that will let you play a short mini-game. After beating the mini-game, you will be shown (with pictures and diagrams, which are great for puzzle solutions) everything you need to do within that room. It won't show you how to get objects in other rooms, but it will show you if you need an object you don't yet have to complete a puzzle. This takes a lot of frustration out of the puzzling, and gives you a place to go if you don't have a clue and don't want to resort to a walkthrough.As for the port, it isn't great. I mentioned some aspects are build for a touchpad, and this is true. There are some puzzles whos parts are a bit unresponsive, or work poorly with a mouse. Other parts work just fine or better. Some puzzles integrate keyboard keys (though they don't every tell you which keys will work and for what), and it's generally self explainitory as to which keys to use (the arrow keys and spacebar are the most common when they can be used). You cannot rebind keys (though you can play entirely with the mouse), and there are few options. Adjusting your options is very easy, however, as they're at the bottom of the screen if you mouse over them. The port is what you would expect of a game ported from a tablet. Not bad, but not very good either.My opinion --I enjoyed the game. It was a short and fun puzzle adventure game that didn't overstay it's welcome. I felt like only one or two puzzles were bad, but none of them were game breaking or too frustrating. I really liked the hint system in this game, as it ment I never needed a walkthrough. If the puzzle solution was rediculous or too tough, you can find the solution ingame (even if getting to the second hint system is a bit tedious). Most Adventure games have a few points where they lose the player, usually because they didn't know they missed something, or that they simply can't progress yet and have to go to a new area to get a new item to get futher. This hint system lets you get over that hump, so that frustration is kept to a minimum. Most of the problems i have with the game are nitpicks, with no really bad things to say. If you like puzzle games, and don't mind a little UI fiddliness, this game is great.Overall, buy it if you like adventure games, puzzle games, or mellow games that don't stress you out. Also, decent game for getting the brain working after so many years out of school =) "

The soundtrack is amazing as well.  I am the kind of guy who loves multiplayer games, more than singleplayer; but THIS is my favorite game even though it's one player.  The storyline is gripping, and is actually pretty well coordinated for you have to complete all of these challenges to get to each room, collect items, and satisfy each minor character in need of help.  The end is complete and gives you a feeling of relief.  A few areas may be tough, but Its all worth it.  It has beautiful artwork and an extra ""touch"" to the color.The only problem I have with it is it may glitch every once in a while by throwing away all saved data if you dont play within 2 months from the previous time of playing. Overall, I give this game an 11/10. . . Best game I have ever played!			"

Machinarium: 10/10A little robot who's been thrown out of the city and into the scrap yard must battle his way back into the city to save his robot-girl friend.""Hold it. Hold it. What is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports? Is this a kissing story?""Joking aside, this game is so much fun to play and it's probably one of the best point and click adventure games that I've ever played. The story is great, the puzzles are a little challenging (nothing that you can't figure out with a little bit of time or a pen and paper), and the music/atmosphere is beautiful. It's a fairly short game that took me about 5-6 hours to beat, but it was still worth it. If you liked this one, be sure to check out their other games :)My name is robot. You kidnapped my robot-girl friend. Prepare to die.Good luck and have fun! "

Can not get any beautiful-er!Here are some of characteristics I've noticed about this game(Includes obvious ones). One of the most beautiful game I've ever played, both visually and musically. It's humorous and filled with pretty good story line and maps!  Puzzle will fit your level of intellegence, the story will put you right back to your childhood in someways.  Sit back and enjoy and view, relax to the music if some of the challenging puzzles struggles you, that'd be my advice if you decide to give this amazing game a try :) I belive this game have inspired many other puzzle game creators, must play if you enjoy puzzle games! On negative reviews, I saw a lot of problems on saving system, but since I don't really clean out my computer and most of users' saving problem was caused from that, I did not have any saving problem, I'll probably get virus soon haha :') but I do recommend you to not clean out your cache before finishing this game. I had this game running on the background while I was writing this review because I love one of the soundtrack from this game, and I realized that this game plays mini memory animation of the main character if you afk from the game for awhile, they are super cute! 10/10!

												I love this game so much,man.I was ten when this game released,my brother had it on his computer and from the moment i started the game,i fell in love with the Artstyle.The game is not really story rich but the puzzles are where the game really shines. And the soundtracks,it fits PERFECTLY with the places. the game gives you kinda the 1950's robots kinda vibe. and trough the game it shows how the protagonist is a sweet,little smart robot who just wants to find his girlfriend. and help not the city blow up from the bomb.Overall the game is very much worth it's price but there is one problem that kept me away from this game. THE SAVE FILES GET LOST/CORRUPTED. (i hope there's a way to fix it,cause i really wanna play this game,again)			"

												Finally I could play this game, I've heard a lot of good things about it before. The game is great for people who like point and click adventure games. There is mostly a clue for the solution of the puzzle, just a few moments of ""try everything till you get it"" but overall puzzles are really good constructed. I'd argue if interaction range was a good idea since we are rejected when an interaction is not available anyway. Wish the game was also playable in higher resolutions but I understand why it is not. I have nothing to say about visuals or the imaginary world of Machinarium, they are both awesome.			"

												If only the point-'n-click destination from your character was fixed, this game would be in my top 10. It's beautiful in every sense, and I've played every other Amanita design game because of it, but that small problem (which was solved on mobile!) tears it apart.I cannot recommend it, but I will anyway - in the hopes that this will be fixed one day.Explanation: You can only interact with things that are physically close to your character, and you walk pretty slow. So if you want to test something on a big screen, you have to walk all the way towards it only to see if it's interactable.			"

												Stangely depressing, but not in a bad way. This game establishes a uniquely empty atmosphere, and keeps you engrossed as the gorgeous art and soundtrack establish everything. The puzzles aren't too challenging, and even if you get stuck, the game has a built in walkthrough. Regardless of whether you'd prefer to think through the puzzles or skip through them to get to each area, the game is worth your time and your money. An absolute timeless classic.			"

												I knew and admired Amanita Design ever since the first Samorost webgame, and Samorost 2 was a great sequel, so when they came out with Machinarium, their first full-length game, I expected nothing less than something great. But what I discovered was far above all my expectations. With seemingly simple tools in a 2d world, Czech artist Jakub Dvorský and his team create a live, beautiful and magically strange world with so much detail you'll want to explore every pixel of it, and you will be well rewarded to do so.Characters are colourful and charming, interactions are fun, puzzles interesting, animations fluid, each location is wonderfully detailed, and a touching little story is told without a single spelled word. Great sound design adds layers to the atmosphere, and the music... Well, the music just sticks with you. To this day, every time I turn on the OST by Tomáš Dvořák I still get those magical chills.This game is a 100% proof that videogame design is/can/should be an art. PS> very enjoyable with a girlfriend, wife or kids.			"

The modernization comes from the game's unique and cool help system, which will let you progress through the game with as much or as little help as you want, and you'll *never* need an outside walkthrough.

												Machinarium is a groovy little adventure game. The puzzles are not too difficult, and fairly logical... you rarely have that awful adventure-game experience where you're moving from room to room, clicking on random stuff, trying to get lucky. The game starts you out slow - one room, one puzzle, and gradually works you up to several rooms with several simultaneous puzzles.The overall atmosphere is very good... a little robot exploring a run-down robot city. And the sound is fantastic, with a variety of full-length songs and themes for each area you explore.There's very little not to like, here. The length of this game is about 6-8 hours. Maybe a little less if you're an adventure game junkie. Overall, Machinarium is a finely-tuned gem.			"

												6/10. I have very mixed feelings about this game, because the good things about it are very good and the bad things about it are very bad. Especially noteworthy on the bad side is the fact that I had a hard time getting the game to work right in the first place. The game warns you to adjust your flash settings (right click and disable hardware acceleration), and I did indeed have to do that, but it wasn't enough. I went through several variations of display problems and malfunctioning mouse input before I finally got it to work by messing with Windows compatibility settings. So, it took me 30 minutes just to start playing the gameOnce you get into it, the game is fun. The art style and animation are really something special, and made me smile frequently throughout the game. It also has some of the best logic puzzles I have seen in an adventure game. Most of them are challenging but fair. Of course, like most adventure games, it does have a few moments of ""How was I supposed to know that?"" or ""I was stuck because I didn't even see that object!"" It gets frustrating at times. There is a minigame that you can play to get hints if you are stuck, which is a great idea. Unfortunately, the minigame isn't actually fun and becomes a chore after the first couple of times. Cute idea, bad execution, and it adds to the frustration when that's the last thing you need. Also, the controls are awkward, even for a point-and-click game.It's a really tough call to recommend this game or not. I'm going with ""No"" because I think most people would not enjoy this kind of experience, especially with the technical difficulties. I can understand why it has its fans, and I did enjoy it sometimes, but it's just too much of a mixed bag for me to recommend buying it.			"

												Machinarium is a classic point-and-click adventure game. It has an incredibly deep ambiance, amazing and utterly captivating graphics and such a cute little story! Although you can play it from 3 to 6 hours without stopping, it is a short one when compared to the bigger names.Nonetheless, it is exactly this shortness that makes it even better.Another good side of Machinarium is the puzzle-ful environment. Everything you have to achieve is reached via puzzles. The only negative side I can think of is the small resolution which is due to the game being hand-drawn (as far as I know).			"

												This is a game about a robot trying to save a friend/girlfriend, It's only weapon is it's intelligence so you'll have to solve plenty of puzzles and also help many other robots along your way if you want to succeed in this great point-and-click game. It has amazing artwork and a beautiful, haunting soundtrack that sets the mood just right and sinergizes very well with the artwork. The game designers opted to not have any writing or voice acting whatsoever, telling all the story through animated baloons that show what happened, or what people want.  It also has a built-in visual walktrhough that you have to play a mini game every time you have to access and also doesn't tell you everything, but it can be refreshing for when you don't know what to do and leaves you feeling a little less of a cheater than reading an actual walktrhough It also is very linear and provides only one answer to the puzzles so you may find yourself using this walkthrough more than you'd like, but that's actually a characteristic of most video-games and of point and click in particular. In my opinion, I found that all in all the game tells a light and heartwarming tale of courage and love and leaves you with a smile afterwards, managing to get you satisfied with all that puzzle solving when you see the result of all that hard work.

												Machinarium is an alternate universe puzzle point and click adventure in which you play as a small robot known as Josef who is looking for his missing girlfriend Berta. The adventure starts with you laying in a scrapheap figuring out how to piece yourself together. And once you get past that little puzzle, you quickly realise this is not an easy game... The puzzles are definitely more inline with the difficultly of the 16bit area of video gaming, not that it is a bad thing thing. The difficulty of the game naturally fits in with the aesthetics of the art, one can spend so long on certain puzzles, it gives plenty of time to admire the sheer beauty of the hand drawn art. The puzzles are creative and fresh, with a strong touch of quirkiness and humour with every completion. The music is easy on the ears and integrates with the games deep atmosphere. My criticisms of Machinarium would be that pointer can be a little imprecise, also if you move Josef while he is in tall or shot form, he hobbles along at a tedious pace. And the game does not offer any video settings, on certain monitors it can appear 'boxed'. Besides these minor setbacks, Machinarium is a beautiful work of art and a solid puzzle game full of humour, unique surprises and character. I strongly recommend this one.			"

												Super cute. Love the puzzles that made me go ""OHHHH!"" Music is SUPERB. Artwork is AMAZING. Not too long of a game if you have no other real life things to do. Even so, this game is still a must have in my opinion. This is one amazing little gem.<3 <3			"

												Great atmosphere, for a simple point and click. It draws you in with a well done sound track and surprisingly good character development. The puzzles range from relatively simple to fairly complex. The help system is a nice addition, as the developers must have realized that if people got stuck they would just go to the internet. Although being able to get hints before the solution would have been preferred. The penalty for looking at the solution is taking the time to play a short mini game, which is much better than other games simply having a countdown timer. The length decent, it tells it's story without rushing or overstaying it's bounds.  Simply put, I absolutely adore this game and would recommend it to anyone.

												Top-notch point-and-click adventure with beautifully drawn 2D environments. You begin as a robot in a scrap heap putting yourself back together. Your mission is to rescue your girlfriend and the story is charming, with minimal text and characters' memories and thoughts played out through animated comic bubbles. Combined with a perfect atmosphere, you'll easily be immersed in the mechanical world. As far as how it plays, you do actually walk around and, when you find useful objects in the environment and click on them, you will either use them or eat them, which places them into your inventory to be used later. You can also stretch yourself vertically and will need to utilize that ability to solve certain puzzles. While there is some hidden object, the game is light on it; it's more a puzzle adventure and figuring out what you need to do on a few screens at a time to progress. A good variety of puzzle types and minigames. Sketch hints available if you're stumped. Highly recommended.			"

												Have asked for a refund. It looks like a really good game. But my monitor runs at  2560x1440 and the game just fills a small portion of the screen with a huge black border all the way around,  Running in windows mode simply runs in a window without the black borders, running in full screen simply keeps the window the same size and adds a huge black border.The suggested solution is to change my desktop resolution which I dont want to do  (and shouldnt have to do) jjust to play one game.I tried setting it at 1024x768 just to try and there was still a gap all round.That is the only reason I'm giving it a thumbs down. Many people have large resolution monitors and shouldnt have to alter from their native display resolution just to play one gameNeeds to say what resolution it runs at and that you cant change it			"

												I'm going to recommend this game, but only barely.Pros:- Absolutely beautiful. One of the best games I've ever looked at- Fun aesthetic, neat world that they built, characters are enjoyable- Logic mini-games inside the game were super fun (but I like that sort of thing)Cons:- Puzzles were completely unintuitive, and that almost killed the game for me. I like not using hints in puzzle games, even if it takes a long time. Hints (or a detailed walkthrough which I resorted to in the end) are straight up mandatory. OH! Use the cat on the digeridoo! DUH! (Actual thing in game.)In the end, I'd still say but it; it's totally worth the experience, but sweet merciful crap, find a walkthrough.Adendum: After another playthrough, I've come to like it a lot more. I just had to get over my frustration. It's awesome; totally get it. Oh, get the bundle with Botanicula; that game was just fantastic.			"

												I think this game is a great flavor addition to League of Legends. I mean, Blitzcrank's origin story? I mean who wouldn't want to play that right? He's easily the most developed and dynamic character in LoL so I can respect Riot's decision to make this game for his fans. Only problem I had is that I can't figure out how to cast Rocket Grab and I feel like that's a core component to the Blitzcrank experience but maybe that's just me. 8/10 would love to see one of these about Gangplank			"

												Well I guess I'll start by saying if steam had something between yes and no I would have picked that.I wanted to like this game, but I found it hard to.Pros:- Well I like the graphics, so I'll call that a pro- A variety of puzzles to solve- A happy ending, I think at least.Cons:- I prefer the keyboard (obviously I am fine using the mouse for point and click games), and two of the mini games let me use that, the third didn't and was also the most annoying thing in the game to control.- The sound fx and music, I didn't hear much, but what was there was just...not great.- The biggest con for me was not having a clue what I was suppose to do. Clicking the hint button is a waste of time, because it shows you a picture of what you are trying to accomplish, which for most of the game you can find out easily by talking to the NPCs, and doesn't help if your stuck, have an empty inventory, and no clue what strange things you need to find, or do, to accomplish the task.- The second biggest con for me was lack of zooming in on some things that you need to see. I played in full screen mode yet some of the things opened up in reletively small windows. Personally I hate having to put my face next to my screen to see important things in games.That's about all I can think of to mention. In my opinion it isn't a bad game, it's just not a great game either. I guess I just expected better because of all the good reviews.			"

I came to find out it's surprisingly difficult, with puzzles that are deviously clever and will legitimately challenge your brain throughout.  There's a surprising amount of charm in this little gem as well, though at times I was left scratching my head a bit when it came to the storyline.

Unlike typical adventure games where you have complex storylines and lots of talking with other characters, this one has all speech reduced to the form of simple animations showing what the characters you're talking to want. It also has a simple storyline that becomes clearer as you progress. So if you're not a fan of complex adventures with lots of talking, you might still enjoy playing this one. It has plenty of little puzzles to solve and they're nice. It's not a very long game (but I wouldn't say it's too short either) and it's probably a one-time fun, but there's nothing to regret. I finished, I enjoyed, I recommend.			"

												This game is a masterpiece. It's cute, it's funny, it's beautiful, it's engaging, but most of all it's thoroughly entertaining.It's so rare to come across a flawless game like this that I'm actually lost for words. There are literally no faults, just a list of things that were done well or adequately. There were no frivolous attempts at reinventing the wheel - saving works the old fashioned way, as does returning from the dead. I don't think level of perfection was an accident either. The game openly invites you to glare at it, to scrutinize, looking for clues, to scan every inch of the screen admiring the attention to detail. The features have been pared down to the very barebones required for function, leaving nothing to distract from the overall experience.The main character and protagonist is a big standout for me. He's hilarious, adorable, and instantly likeable. Everything from his little dance to the way he ""speaks"" fills my heart with joy. It's not often that I find myself so attached to the player character, so I was pleasantly surprised by this.The music and artwork/level design is simply beautiful. The OST was written by notable IDM artist, Floex, who was also responsible for the soundtrack to Samarost. These two game elements come together in perfect harmony to create a uniquely atmospheric world that gave me a limbic response I haven't felt since playing the Oddworld series.The humour is organic, witty, and sometimes quite subtle. The game strikes a great balance between comedy and serious themes. When it's not being funny, the storyline explores loss, loneliness, depression, addiction, reunion, family, and various other themes with tact and sensitivity. There is never ""too much"" of any one emotion, so that the game remains enjoyable without straying into being overwhelming. This level of emotional balance is, in my opinion, unparalleled.The storyline flows extremely well - there are no side quests, instead the game takes a seemingly meandering course through all characters and areas. Sometimes it can take a while to figure out a puzzle, while others are relatively straightforward. The nice thing about this is, the game works a bit like an IQ test in the sense that it will test your weaknesses as well as your strengths. It's puzzles run the gamut and no puzzle is repeated - some gamers will find a section hard, while others will find it easy. Your mileage will truly vary.Finally, I want to add that after finishing this game I felt like my life had been enriched having played it. I felt like I was better off, like I had taken a cultural-tour holiday, or been to a museum. This game is wholesome and good for the soul. If none of the other things I've said have encouraged you to buy and play it, but you've been feeling a little blue lately, here's my advice: Take one Machinarium and call me in the morning.			"

 Best Point & Click I've ever playedI don't normally play point and click games as its not a popular genre in this day and age but for this I'd make an exception. Machinarium is a truly enjoyable experience with relatable and interesting characters and an incredible world that suits the atmosphere and story perfectly. PuzzlesVery challenging and really push your puzzle solving abilities to the limit. If you find one to be to hard there's tips and even a walk through book that requires you to beat a small mini game to access.StoryTypical story of the small unexpected hero who goes above and beyond to save the girl from the bad guys and save the day but with robots!9.7/10 - Best Point and click game I've ever played, Amazing atmosphere that feels fresh and believable for the setting. Only downside is its a bit short, only 3-4 hours of gameplay  "

He must make his way into and through a large robot city full of quirks and strange contraptions, and along the way solve puzzles and help other robots to gain their help.While the game appeals to all ages, the puzzles are quite hard at times, though ingeniously made without involving math, text, etc, and we must rely on logic, memory and observation. If the player is having trouble continuing, there are tools to help.Its not a long game, but very funny, beautiful and rewarding when you solve a hard section.Highly recommendable!			"

												Machinarium is some kind of hidden object, point and klick and puzzle game. You control a tiny robot, who's protecting robo city and rescuing his girlfriend at the same time. The story develops nicely during the gameplay, but falls somewhat short in the end. It is painted quite nicely, and the complexity of the game expands well with it's length. The puzzles, in the endgame, become sometimes very difficult (like moving boxes in a 16 step solution). I personally prefer the puzzle mechanics in portal or thalos, but If your ok with a) guessing or b) thinking alot, (or c) cheating) instead of smooth and uninterupted gameplay, you might like this. I would give it a thumbs up, if there wasn't: I can't save. Ok I can save, but I can not load. This happens, following google, to many others and is caused by that crappy saving policy - it's using a macomedia's flash cookie (it's a flash game ... ).If you are like me, automatically deleting that kind of stuff, you will delete your saves too.The solution is simple: disable autoamtic flash cookie deletion. If that is not an option for you, you should consider not byuing this game.That said, it is also worth mentioning, that there actually is a version of the game that runs under linux - but that version is not available in steam.

												A very sweet point and click adventure with so many great mechanics and puzzles. At times things aren't obvious but there's a very nifty hint system which will help you when you get lost but doesn't get too descriptive.  Its definitely worth at least $20 even though I practically only payed 1.75.			"

												I played a lot lot of P&C games since my childhood being born in early 90s, so I kinda follow the genre ever since. And it took me time to get Machinarium, I wanted it!But I must say the visual appeal has unfortunatly nothing to do with the content. The first hour of discovery is alright and pretty blowing. But as I went through ""riddles"" and repetitiv puzzles and minigames (which represent half of the game), I found Machinarium's limit. Not only some minigames are  either difficult and unfunny to solve (they have several levels you must enforce to progress), either pointlessly easy, like fillers. But the riddles are out of logic, even in this mysterious world.The last decades have proven you can achieve to implement a sense of logic in an absurd story and lore. And Machinarium fails at it imho. You have to try every item on every interactiv npc/environnement to find your way through. It's a pixel-check game that reminds the darkest days of p&c.Then, devs have put 2 ""help"" tool in-game, including the solution to riddles/puzzles. Besides the gentle will of helping the customer, it tells us that devs were totally aware of the absurdity and difficulty of their own riddles. And that is unprofessional. A p&c with solution in-game, this says a lot...Lastly, the ergonomy is nowhere to be seen. In Machinarium you actually have to ""go to"" the item you wanna check, and only then, you can interact with it. Meanwhile most p&c do that simply by a single click on the item itself.Also when you click on a door on top of stairs, the character will go up the stairs, and once on top, what does he do?? He forgets about your command! Open the door ffs! And there are others ""little details"" like this that kills the gameplay and rythm of progression. That is sad. You can't double click to run, the inventory slide-thingy is not really responsive, the size of the character never resets when you move him, so he takes ages to go somewhere after interactions... We could go on. Did they play p&c before developping this at least?No I can't recommend this game for the hardcore p&c gamers. At least, never intend to beat it in a single session unless you wanna go crazy. Give it time to finish, and better be real patient. The only way to appreciate this game is by watching a playthrough of someone knowing exactly what to do.By the way, the artistic dept is great, the ost is ok. The universe is catchy and lovely, they did a good job there.			"

												What a great creative game! This adventure puzzle game doesn't just give you puzzles to complete, but a story line. The story line may not seem very present at first, but builds up into an interesting story as you learn more and more about the character you play. These puzzles can be challenging, but the game offers a nice way to get hints and if you are really bad it will give you a walk through right there in the game if you so choose. In addition to the the great gameplay this game has an amazin sound track. I found myself sitting in the plaza listing the band play their whole song before I moved on to the next room. I highly recommend buying this game! There isn't too much in terms of replayability, but some day I may find myself coming back to it once I've forgotten the puzzles.			"

												This game has an amazing story, and a fantastic atmosphere. The puzzles, while being tough for someone who generally always pops open a walkthrough during these kinds of games, were very engaging. I found myself dedicating myself to solving most of them without resorting to the handy-dandy walkthrough button. I won't lie, I got stuck in this game. A lot.

												A cute puzzle game with excellent aesthetics and an immersive ambient soundtrack. Worth playing just for the music alone. None of the puzzles are undoable, and are enjoyable to see play out. Some people have complained about the difficulty of figuring out the puzzles, but remember that as an animated game that it utilizes cartoon physics at times and require that you use your imagination to put together the solutions. The game can take 5-8 hours depending on your problem solving skills.The weakest part of the game is the flat, sudden ending. It was like the developer had all these interesting ideas but couldn't figure out how to tie it all together in a way which was satisfying. Nowhere near a deal breaking flaw and the game is worth it for the experience alone.			"

												Does not work at all for me with Windows 10 on a new [2015] Asus computer.Looks like cool art and sounds, but the cursor will not point at the things on the screen, have to find a place some distance from the thing you want to click on, and click on that empty space, if that description makes sense.  Sometimes the cursor will not click on anything at all.  Maybe I am just playing on the ""impossible"" difficulty level.  Oh, also, won't uninstall entirely.  Try to remove, but it remains in my inventory of games, even proudly says that it will stay there, and I will have to reload if I want to [attempt to] play it again in the future.  Which I won't.  Maybe the uninstall button is also set to ""impossible"" level of difficulty.  Most impossibly difficult game I have ever [attempted to] play!  And, of course, Valve will not refund the few dollars I spent on the game, because I waited too long to request a refund.  Despite the fact that I bought other games from them, and that I only spent a few minutes on this one before giving up in frustration.  And despite the fact that I am not asking for a refund because I changed my mind or didn't like it, I'm asking because it is defective, &/or won't play at all on my machine.

												More than anything, just a gorgeous game to play. I can't say the gameplay does much original; it's a standard point-and-click game with a few other puzzles thrown in the mix. The narrative isn't particularly unique either, though being told entirely without dialogue is perhaps an interesting spin on it. But the game world looks and sounds beautiful and the game has charm to it. The puzzles rarely get too obscure (or at least, as far as I can recall, since it's been a while since I touched this game). I can't really help but recall this one fondly, for whatever reason. It's definitely a worthy experience, though.			"

												going against the tide of popular opinion I didn't enjoy this game all that much to be honest I felt that the color scheme and sound of the game made it feel bland and a few of the puzzles had very hard to figure out mechanics  (I've started to come the conclusion that the more I play point and click games the less I i have come to like them so there is also that for you to consider in this short review but overall I just didn't like it and feel others wouldn't like it either)			"

												Cute story, wide variety of puzzles, good art, but clumsy controls and sometimes obscure puzzles make this game sort of a wash for me. You play as a cute little robot in a point-and-click adventure with added puzzles like ""move these pegs into a certain pattern"" or ""fill in all the lights on a grid"" to help you progress to new areas of this robot-inhabited world and avoid/foil villainous robots.Pros:+Good story, despite the lack of dialogue. Everything is done with thought bubbles and grunts and sounds instead of speech. Cute.+Interesting art. Hand-drawn feel with an interesting pallete of mostly brown with splashes of muted colors here and there. The variety of robot character designs is fantastic.+Wide variety of puzzles. Not just point and click, but logic and spatial reasoning puzzles, and you even get to play Space Invaders.Cons:-There's no really good way of finding interactable items other than skimming the screen with your mouse. There were several puzzles I had to get a hint for (see below) simply because I didn't notice that tiny little item I was supposed to pick up because it was so well integrated with the art. Object highlighting in the art or a keyboard shortcut to highlight them would have greatly helped. Thus, for me, it was a steep learning curve trying to get a feel for the kinds of puzzles the designers were intending because the goal was obvious but the means of attaining that goal were obscure.-Only one pre-set hint per level, which means if you're stuck on a part that happens AFTER the hint, you're screwed. There's a way to unlock the entire solution, but it requires playing an annoying mini game first. The internet is faster, honestly.-The interface is annoying, as you can only interact with things within reach. You want to use this thing over there, so you grab it from your inventory and try to use it, but it's out of reach. Is there an easy way to put things back into your inventory? No, of course not! So then you've got to manually put it back in your inventory, which doesn't always pop up on mouseover and is hard to see because it's black, the same color as the border around the image, which is not fullscreen despite the settings. Then you've got to walk your guy over to the spot, hoping you're close enough this time, then get the item from your inventory AGAIN and use it. Very frustrating. -On a related note, there's also a mechanic where you can stretch your body up to get things high up, but sometimes you have to physically do it yourself, and other times (if it's close enough), it does it for you automatically. And if you accidentally start walking while you're stretched, God help you, because you walk around really, REALLY slowly that way, and it's hard to cancel out of a movement once it's initiated. There are ZERO puzzles where being tall while walking is needed, so the designers should have made it automatic to shrink down before attempting to walk and saved themselves some animation time and the players some frustration. And although the tutorial teaches you that you can be tall, it DOESN'T tell you that you can make yourself shorter, which is required for an early puzzle to reach an item I didn't even know could be accessed and looked like part of the background.Overall: 5/10It may be worth it for the story and the actual puzzles themselves (the non-point-and-click variety), but the frustration and amount of cheating via the internet I had to do robbed me of the joy I should have had.

												I love this game!! It is beautifully designed, challenging and really, really fun!  But I cannot save my games and that for me is a huge let down and makes it unplayable.  I have played three times.  After that I searched everywhere for help.  There are many fixes, none of which worked for me, but I am not a computer geek.  And even if I was more literate that way I don't think I should have to try and fix this myself either.  I don't want to run around trying to desperately save my game.  I want to play this game.  In this day and age a game that doesn't keep saves? That seems very silly to me.  Sadly, and with regret, I cannot recommend this game.  :-(			"

In my opinion they are not fun or interesting. It's either completely obvious or so ridiculous that you need to resort to the little walkthrough minigame to find the answer. In the end I was blind to the beauty and deaf to the sounds, I played this point & click game like I played so many other disappointing point & click games - randomly clicking on (or combining) every possible objects, not even bothering to finish the game.

												It really breaks my heart to have to give this game a bad reveiw. There were clearly talented and passionate people behind it, but it just doesn't play well.Here's an example that helps to describe one of my biggest issues.-You've just broken out of your cell, and are currently in a crawl space under a room occupied by a guard, who is shooting a pellet gun of some sort at a target on the wall. You can get into the room via a manhole under the table. The guard has a large dish full of pellets on the table and a key on his belt.You try to reach for the keys. You're not allowed to do that.You try to reach for the pellets on the table. You're not allowed to do that.you try to do both in the moment when the guard is aiming and has his attention elsewhere. You're not allowed to do that.You slowly, slowly, slowly, shuffle your way back down the tunnel.You try going back to your cell to see if there's anything you missed. the exit is wide open, but you're still not allowed back in.You slowly, slowly, slowly, shuffle your way back down the tunnel.You go back to the room with the guard. You notice that he tips back in his chair every time he goes to take a shot. You click on the chair, hoping to send him tumbling backwards. Nothing happens.Enraged, you finally crack, and decide to use the walkthrough provided in-game. You slowly, slowly, slowly scroll through the randomly-generated shooter level.When you finally get the walkthrough! the answer was... to click on the guard's chair, knocking him over. You enter an entirely new realm of anger when you realize that you were supposed to click on the guard's chair, you just didn't click on the bottom of the front left leg. This is the only game I've played where you could be right, but still be wrong.That, and a lot of the artistic choices prevent the game from playing well as a point-and-click. Specifically, because none of the characters speak, there's no proper way to examine your environment besides looking at it. For example, in one scene, you have to dry some lichen on a lightbulb. However, the light was in a thick-looking glass housing with metal bands, nothing really indicated that it was hot. In any other P&CA, you could look at the light, and your character would say ""It's hot."" or something similar.Also, the game's main means of movement is horrible. The robot is SO SLOW! the game also doesn't include any sort of automatic movement when iteracting with the environment. If you drag an item out of your inventory and click it on something in the environment, what do you expect from a P&CA? for your character to either say ""that won't work"" or to walk over and do something with the item. In this game, you have to click on where you want to go, then watch the robot slowly waddle over, then take the item out of your inventory and use it. It seems like a minor gripe, but when you've played other P&CAs it gets so obnoxious, like a child who won't eat if his sandwich isn't cut at a precisely 62.5 degree angle.In short, this game doesn't want you to play good, it wants to look good.

												Beautiful design, but also very poorly designed. While it looks wonderful, and is a brilliant idea there are too many issues once you get into the game. For example the saved file system is atrocious. Unlike normal steam games the files and most importantly the saved files are not stored in the steam folder but in your operating systems user folder. this is because it uses flash, and if you just happen to delete your browser history and wipe the cookies, believe it or not, your Machinarium saved files go too. Given the difficulty of the game, this in itself is a reason not to bother, but coupled with the ridiculous difficulty hike part way through, and a number of in game puzzles that are almost impossible and you can see why I didn't bother to play for more than a few hours before deleting this game forever.

												I haven't even played this game but it is a Flash game which means it handles poorly - this really should have been stated clearly when buying it.* If you use a clean up tool (e.g. CCleaner) then it will remove your save game if you don't tell it to exclude clearing Adobe Flash cache.* The game will only appear in a small area on your monitor taking up about 1200x800 - so if you have a 2560x1440 monitor like me then it will look ridiculous.  I don't believe there is a standard resolution like that on PC montors so you will always land up with black borders around it.  Even at 1920x1080 it is silly.* I believe others have mentioned poor interface because of Flash but I didn't make it past the main menu before giving up.Looked good if it wasn't freakin' Flash though!

												I really don't understand why there are so many positive reviews on this game...Machinarium is a classic point and click adventure. It has nice artwork and can be funny at times but that's about it.-The game is very linear compared to other games of the same genre (no backtracking), some people may like this but I found it removed most of the challenge associated with the genre.-The puzzles are very easy, might be appropriate for a very young kid but I can't picture anyone above 12 years old getting stuck anywhere, you are offered in-game hints and walkthrough wich I haven't considered using even once-The game is stupidly short (about 7 hours), if compared to other games of the same genre (I'm thinking of monkey island, deponia, grim fandango, etc.) the whole game has the lenght of about a single level of those titles I mentionedIf you ever see this game 75% off I would recommend buying it but not at full price. It won't live up to the expectations of any point-and-click adventure fans			"

												Good game but unplayable on steam. The game uses temporary flash storage, which gets cleared on a regular basis so don't expect your save file to last more than a day. The only workaround for this is to manually find the save file and save it to a different folder, and then put it back when you want to play. Totally unacceptable for a steam game, don't know how there are so many positive reviews. Its like playing a ps1 game with no memory card.			"

												Very well illustrated. Puzzles are difficult, but not too difficult. Fun for an hour or two. But really  how long can you play a point and click game before you get bored? Ive lasted 7hrs and im done. But if you like this sort of thing - you will enjoy the art and the puzzles.			"

												I really don't understand why there are so many positive reviews on this game...Machinarium is a classic point and click adventure. It has nice artwork and can be funny at times but that's about it.-The game is very linear compared to other games of the same genre (no backtracking), some people may like this but I found it removed most of the challenge associated with the genre.-The puzzles are very easy, might be appropriate for a very young kid but I can't picture anyone above 12 years old getting stuck anywhere, you are offered in-game hints and walkthrough wich I haven't considered using even once-The game is stupidly short (about 7 hours), if compared to other games of the same genre (I'm thinking of monkey island, deponia, grim fandango, etc.) the whole game has the lenght of about a single level of those titles I mentionedIf you ever see this game 75% off I would recommend buying it but not at full price. It won't live up to the expectations of any point-and-click adventure fans			"

												as i sat atop the west gate bridge a dark stormy night, suicidal thoughts were running through my head. i didn't want to jump, but life had me down and it seemed like the only good option at the time. then i remembered the good things in the world. stevi's a.ss, maccas quarter pounders, going gym with the boys and mase's party. i was convinced that the world is a good place and suicide is not the answer to end my suffering. then i remembered that this game exists, and i said fukk it cunnt this game's existence brings about enough suffering that i should just end my fukking life because it's so fukking dogshit. i leaped off the west gate, feeling a brief release from all my worries, tranquil, at peace, finally, the sweet release of death will come to me and i'll forget all about this fukking travesty, but, as i landed in the yarra river, a little robot cunnt swam up from the bottom and lifted my dying body out of the yarra and onto the river bank. he mended my dying body and i felt the agony of life again. this game cursed me and now i can't fukking feel the sweet embrace of the sithis because the same little robot cunnt who you control in this shiit always stops me. this game makes you want to pull a west gate, and traps you in a vicious cycle of westgating by preventing a full west gate from actually occuring.

												What a POS of a game.1) The game is a FLASH application.  By default, your FLASH player is likely set to NO STORAGE, which means the game will not save itself.2) Graphics is locked at something like 1200 x 720.  If you run the game with your desktop set to 1920 x 1080 or higher, you WILL see large chunks of black all around.  There is no fix for this.3) I could look past the previous 2 points, but what I cannot look past is that many of the puzzles in this game make no sense whatsoever.  The developer basically expects players to know WHAT to do, as opposed to HOW to do them.DO NOT BUY THIS POS.			"

												That awkward moment when a good friend gifts you a game that you're just not that into. I first played this a few years ago, shortly after it was released and had a wealth of critical acclaim surrounding it, but made the difficult and uncharacteristic decision to abandon it half way through as it was bugging me way too much to be bothered with it anymore. A combination of grindingly slow pacing, tedious, unsatisfying puzzles and downright depressing atmosphere put me off it way too quickly. But after receiving it as a birthday present, I felt I owed it to both the game and my friend to give it another shot and play it through to its entirety. Unfortunately, all that did was further reinforce my opinion that this game really isn't for me. Playing as a tiny, little robot, in a big, bad robot world, you'll point and click your way through sections of the city of Machinarium as you try to thwart the plans of a nasty gang of bullying, nogoodnik robots who've placed a bomb on the tower of your former place of residence... or workplace, it's hard to tell for sure. But apparently robots and their dwellings are pretty grim. Pretty much from top to bottom, everything feels dingy and bleak, like all hope is lost and everyone is now resigned to living a pitiful existence with no sign of ever getting better. Everything just felt so soul-crushingly oppressive and didn't make me want to stay a moment longer than I needed to, really not a good quality for a game. Normally dark tones in games don't bother me in the slightest, and if anything, really appeal to me. I felt right at home wandering the wastes of Fallout, or scavenging among the leftover detritus of humanity in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., but this just felt like too much even for me. At least Fallout has its dark humour laced throughout, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has its sense of mystery and vague suggestion that the outside world is a better place or people are building towards something better inside the disaster zone. But there's no such optimism here. It isn't even like it's a fictitious dystopia here, more like a way-too-close-to-reality feeling of dire finality and going through the motions. To their credit, the hand drawn art that makes up every part of the game is incredibly well done and feels like a real labour of love, like something much more personal that you don't get in other games. I just wish they had've chosen another direction for the aesthetics and made something less downbeat. Though I guess that's just going to come down to personal opinion more than anything. Aside from the opening introduction to the controls, there isn't a single line of text or dialogue throughout the game, with everything expressed through animated speech/thought bubbles or observing cues from the world and the robots that fill it. But, again, this only adds to tone. The subdued, mood music and low-rumbling barks and grunts of every other character further drills home how morbid everything feels. Yeah, in case you didn't already get it, I think this game is grim. There's something about Eastern European developers that makes them way too good at capturing those feelings in a game, with a sense that some studios are almost in a race to try and outgrim one another. Well, this feels like it could be their crowning achievement. Yet, even had the overall mood of the game been different, that still wouldn't have helped my issues with the slow crawl of so many parts of the game, or the fact that most of the puzzles felt like a chore to do, either because of the execution once you knew the solution, or finding the solution itself... and then executing it. I'm a fan of the studio's other works, Botanicula and the Samorost games, and I look forward to more titles along those lines if more point and click games are what they're sticking with. But unfortunately this is one I can't recommend above those and have no wish to ever visit again in future.			"

												If you want to buy this game for the art, then I will recommend it. Otherwise, the puzzles are always randomly constructed out of the surroundings as an afterthought and never take after common sense to clue you towards the goal. The player is left randomly clicking on everything without clues to figure out which piece of the environment the designer actually wanted you to touch. Essentially, it feels like you're wasting your time.			"

												I haven't played a lot of point-and-click games but I do know that Machinarium is overflowing with charm. The art style looks like it was sketched with colored pencils, the protagonist is a cute little robot that stores items in his belly, and the story is told through little cartoons in thought bubbles. The only reason I can't recommend this game is its difficulty. Perhaps it was intended for veteran point-and-click gamers but I found many of the puzzles to be difficult and confusing. Luckily, the developers decided to included hint for each level in the form of a cartoon bubble to help you understand what your primary goal is in each level. Unfortunately, most of the time I had no idea of how to get to that goal with whatever was placed before me in the level. The developers also included a walk-through for each level in the form of a book which you can unlock by playing a mini-game. The walk-through helps a lot but I found myself turning to its guidance for most of the levels (especially later in the game). It may have just been difficult for me but I don't want to continue playing a game where I constantly have to be taught how to play the game. That being said, you can tell that a lot of heart and soul went into this game. So if you're in to point-and-clicks, you might give this one a try.			"

												A decent puzzle game, aside from awkward mouse control (having to stand just so in order to frob the lever, having the game sometimes automate the extend/crouch mechanism, other times having to do so manually.)  Has a couple of action game puzzles - space invaders, and an annoying little room crawl shooting 33 little baddies, and a timed puzzle that really doesn't seem to give you enough time - I prefer my puzzle games in the Myst tradition of having no urgency aside from that driven by plot concerns, since it's a puzzle game and thus designed to be cryptic, and non violent.  Also, its a flash game, and thus much more limited in its interface than most games for sale these days.It was, at times, amusing and perhaps a little charming, but for maybe 5 hours of gameplay (significantly less if you're not missing clues along the way - most of my 3.3 hours of playtime was a wild goose chase trying to figure out which screen this particular oddity in my inventory was for.  (Very Monkey Island in that regard, but Monkey Island generally told you what the items were - it took me ages to figure out that the random piece of cloth I grabbed at one point was something called ""flypaper"", since I'd never heard of the stuff, or how it worked.)Did I have fun? yes.  Did I have $10 worth of fun?  No.  I picked it up during a holiday sale for 2.49, and that might be worthwhile.  No replay value to speak of - as you might expect, the puzzles don't change, and I didn't get invested in the characters enough to want to replay for the story, like I did with Myst and Portal (perhaps unfair to compare this game to those, though, given that they're abnormally good games.)

												Original Review:The art and music are nice, but it is SUPER easy for a point & click adventure/puzzle game. Unfortunately I can't recommend it based on this.Addition as of 12/5/2015:To elaborate, Machinarium does not play to the genre's strengths. It does not make many meaningful strides to get you to soak in its lustrous environments. The environments are... not quite lustrous either, which contributes to this disengagement. It needed to utilize the environments way more for it to be considered a really great point and click adventure game. Just see The Secret of Monkey Island: that game makes such excellent use of its environments, backgrounds, and setting, that it's no wonder why it's lauded as one of the BEST point and click adventure games ever made. Machinarium, on the other hand, is very amateur and did not make nearly as great an effort in immersing you within the game world.			"

												Machinarium is a point-and-click adventure game that's mostly carried by its art style, because the actual gameplay is not very good. Unless the object you want to pick up is in the character's reach, there's no indication that the object is even something you can pick up. Not sure if it's because the game is made with Flash.The puzzles were mostly logical although some of them had a trial-and-error aspect. Hardest part of the puzzles was actually finding the items needed. There were a few quite challenging puzzles too. The game has an in-game walkthrough, but it requires you to play a mini-game every time you want to access it. Also the NPCs give some hints about the needed items when you ""talk"" to them.I found the story to be uninteresting even though it's told without words and is open for interpretation. Basically you're shown thought bubbles, which show a ""flashback"" of an event that happened. The story just didn't feel any fresh and it didn't make me care for the characters at all. Quite many people seem to find the plot great, which I find weird, because the plot is very generic. You can find similar plots in many other games as well as in many movies.I probably belong in the minority with my opinion about this game as I now think that it's overrated. It has a pretty nice art style and fairly good puzzles, but it still has somewhat clunky mechanics and a bland story. In my opinion Machinarium is just an average game and nothing more. I also managed to delete my save twice by using CCleaner, which cleared Flash cache.			"

												I've played much more of this game on a friend's tablet, so don't think this review is limited to the short playtime I have logged on Steam.  I'm severely neutral about this game, which is a shame given how enjoyable its atmoshpere is.  It is a pretty game, with an interesting touch of characterization on your little gizmo.  There are two reasons why I can't quite reccomend this game though, and while they don't make the game bad it definitely makes it worth less than the 10 USD price.First is a more personal peeve, it's made to immitate old-school point and click adventures in that there's a thread of logic that usually makes sense in the game world but doesn't if the immersion is broken.  That thread of how to progress can feel arbitrary, like the developers have contrived a reason why you can't just do a simple solution here, or why this device's switch is in a nigh-unaccesible alcove.  And that adventure game logic has always peeved me, but it's perfectly fine so long as you're immersed.Aaaaand that's the two of it: the immersion.  This game has a great soundtrack and needs it, because the gameplay is far from enough to pull (in my experience) the player in.  The tokenism and the obviously contrived puzzles are a big part of it, which encourages players to click around looking for what can and can't be used, but the other part is a bit more subtle.  Your character's competency changes, and that always pulls me out of a game.  Sometimes your character (Read: the game) will do something automatically that in a less-padded puzzle would have required you to hunt for an inventory item to do.  So occasionally I'm looking for what I believe is the last piece and then when I can't find it just rub my inventory against itself and give birth to progress.  That, or the gizmo guy can squeeze into or stretch to reach something that in a previous puzzle would not have been possible.Two faults, yes, and two major ones that the 10 USD price cannot afford to have.

The graphics for this game is unique and calm.The hint system is unique in this game that you are given a space invader-ish game and if you completed it you will be given the hint in comic book style without any dialogue and if it requires something from other screen the comic will just skip to the parts only happening in current screen. The game does not even remember which screen's comic you have unlocked and you have to play the unlock minigame every time.I think is game is okay for a flash game, but not meeting my expectation for a Steam game.

												Machinarium is an adventure game in the classic point & click style. A genre that by now only lives in the indie development scene. Whether that is a good or a bad thing is still up for debate.You play as a little lovable robot that seems to have been made out of mostly trash. As an entirely mute protagonist, as are every character in the game, mute that is, you experience the entirety of the storyline through little memory bubbles that pop every now and then to explain your connection to a particular item or individual. You may or may not understand them however.Gameplay is entirely point and click. You click on an object in the world to interact with it and on occasion pick it up. Items you collect can be used to interact with those same objects and occasionally can be combined with other collected items to form a new object. It is all very tried and true having been done this way for ages. Unfortunately Machinarium always keeps around some the failings of this genre. Many times you will find that you have to interact with a very specific part of a larger object with no discernible way to see which small place on the screen you have to click to make it work. The logic of the various puzzles, in true point and click fashion, marches to it's own drummer and if you approach the puzzles without being able to adopt this often bizarre method of thinking you will find your stumped quite often.Machinarium is quite a pretty game, despite being made entirely in flash it manages to produce a beautiful steampunkish environment that is very pleasing to the eye. Being made in flash however means that the occasional accidental right click can often ruin your day.All in all Machinarium is a fun little game if you're a fan of adventure point and clicks. It is however not a game that stands out in the genre or makes any attempt at even being playable for someone that is not a fan of the genre already.			"

												The first thing the game's tutorial tells you is that you can only click on things ""in the robot's reach"", but then keeps breaking that rule by randomly having the robot suddenly able to cartoonishly stretch out its arms and legs, and jump twice its own height. If this isn't poor sportsmanship on the designer's part, then maybe I just do not like point-and-click games anymore. The puzzles are mostly pretty neat, but there's enough extraneous visual and gameplay detail that it feels like you're being tricked into ignoring important clues. There are doors that you'll never open, but you can still yank on them. There are conspicuous items that scream out with potential that you can reach for but never pick up. Sometimes you'll pick up an item and it's simply not clear what it is; I went around clicking on everything in sight with what I thought was a corkscrew but turned out to be a strip of flypaper. Using the hint book is humiliating and needlessly complicated by an easy but dull minigame.There's lots of stupid minigame puzzles here, actually. It's okay to have a few, but after the sixth or seventh variation on peg-jumping or whatever, one realizes they're vastly inferior to environmental puzzles because they're disproportionately time-consuming for how little narrative importance they carry: for example, it is not compelling to spend ten minutes staring at an elevator keypad, even if the puzzle is an interesting one. And then finally, the big climax is a literal mini video game itself, on a tiny screen, that looks boring, has annoying music, and terrible controls.The story? You are a robot in a city populated entirely by robots. You begin the game after having been dismantled and thrown in a junkyard, and once you fix yourself you set out to get revenge, and, uh, save your girlfriend, I guess. I don't understand why ""save your girlfriend"" is still such a fixture even in indie games. And so often there's a inept, painful sincerity to it; Nintendo doesn't expect your heart to be in your throat when Bowser tosses Peach over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes, but the makers of Machinarium are hell bent on pushing this trite cliche to its fullest in the interest of giving you the ooie-gooies, and it comes off as lazy, not charming. Why are these robots gendered, anyway? Probably the same reason they still have human religions! Incidentally, that was my favorite part of the game. Cute, funny, clever, refreshingly inoffensive, and a good puzzle to boot. At least this review is ending on a positive note.			"

												Machinarium is a point-and-click adventure with beautiful, hand-drawn graphics. That's where the good stuff ends. The puzzles are convoluted and excessive; because hey, why do a puzzle once when you can do it four times? The character you control is painfully slow at moving around and it takes a good 10 or 20 seconds just to move from area to area. Every scene has annoying ambience that endlessly loops. I ended up turning the sound off  because I was so sick of the bloody noise. There are several points where you have to twist your mouse about awkwardly to do stuff; eg turning a wheel. Rather than just moving the wheel with the cursor, you have to circle around it twenty times. The worst point came when there was a puzzle that demanded that you flicked the mouse up and down really quickly. It took me twenty minutes to get the damn thing to work and I had to switch to a different mouse because the puzzle was so broken. The game is frustrating and tedious. I can understand why people would enjoy the story and interesting world it takes place in but the gameplay is more stressful than fun.			"

												I thought I reviewed this previously. Anyway, Machinarium has a unique style, but doesn't hold up greatly these days. The primary issue is the reliance on Flash, making the game unstable and buggy. Clearing Flash data will erase your save, but at least the game is short enough that it can be beat in one sitting, assuming it doesn't crash. Puzzles are mostly a hunt for objects that blend into the environment, sometimes involving trial and error. The long animation times became annoying at times, making backtracking obnoxious and save-deleting crashes just made me quit. Story pieces are told by animated sequences, but cannot be skipped. Some elements are done purely for charm, such as making the robot walk at half-speed when extended, but charming aspects shouldn't interfere with gameplay so much. Many puzzle elements are ambiguous, but items will never allow mistakes. The robot will just shake ""no"" with very few explanation animations in the game, so there seems to be 1 approach to everything.I guess the game is not too far from Kaptain Brawe, which I am playing now and then. I feel like that game is more charming and feels less obscured by muddy art, and isn't wasting my time with crashes and long animations. Still, this game is far from the value of $10, and it got on my nerves.			"

												Point and click flash storytelling/adventure game. A few things you should know that the game wants you to learn instead of telling you: you need to be close to things to use them, and your head can extend by dragging it. This one got pretty dull pretty quickly for me by the third area when I got utterly frustrated at trying to work out what else was around that I could click on. Cute, but not much fun.			"

												Do you like Zdzislaw Beksinski? Then go look at his artwork and leave the godawful Adobe Flash point-and-click turd that mimics his visual style alone, because staring at a painting of some horrifying♥♥♥♥♥♥made with the Call of Duty color palette by a dude who got murdered by a teenager--likely for something only marginally cooler than making a terrible browser game and selling it on Steam--is a better use of your time.

												Game is a mess.   Controls are bothersome. Story is incredibly weak; there is very little of it and never enough to actual know whats going on or what you are supposed to be doing.   You end up wandering around trying to tinker with things not know what anything does.  Most of the things you pick up you have no idea what they are even.  Very illogical, do things in certain way, in certain order with no idea what you are actually doing.  I always heard nice things about this.  I think people just played the very first section and were like ""wow this is sort of neat looking, its probably really fun""   then quit and never came back to it. "

												I don't tend to like point and click games. Mostly because if the puzzles and controls aren't perfect then you can waste alot of time trying to find a solution that you already found. For example, an early puzzle invoules putting something on some train tracks. This was the very last step of the puzzle, and I spent maybe 5 minutes putting this thing on the tracks, trying to solve the puzzle, and having it fail. After many annoyed clicks I discovered that if you lower your mouse down to the other side of the tracks you can put it there. The problem is the click box for the wrong side of the tracks was so big, that you would assume that that is all you could do with it. Suffice it to say, I was very annoyed at this. I played through, and figured that was an one off event.In the very next screen I figure out the puzzle in a reasonable amount of time, but the very last step was bugged. As in I would click on the thing, and it wouldn't work. After maybe 10 minutes of cursing at it, I quit out of the game, and come back to it the next day. The exact same action I was trying to do before works the first time. It was just that the game wasn't reading my clicks correctly.On the very next screen, I get stuck again. This time because the puzzle wanted me to stand if a very exact spot for it to work. After reading a walk through, and finding out that I was doing the right thing, I tried different spots and quickly was able to continue.I play the game for about another 45 minutes until I run into the same bug of the game not reading my clicks. At this point I've had enough of the game. I really wanted to like this game, but the fact that the game could ruin the experience in many different ways put me off in a very bad way.			"

The atmosphere of the game also didn't really draw me in, it was cute in a very run-down way, but left me more annoyed than anything.

Lots and lots of swirling your mouse pointer about to find the items that can be interacted with. Otherwise: an oddly charming feel to the game. (Note: 0.6 hours on record? Nope. More like 3 hours.

												I really wish there was a 'neutral' option for rating games, rather than just positive or negative.This game is beautiful to look at, and the melancholy, subdued tone of the artwork combined with the lovely music creates a wonderful overall aesthetic.Unfortunately, the gameplay itself soon became tedious and boring, and the lack of a story also meant there was little incentive for me to keep playing. Some of the of the puzzles are quite random and hard to figure out, and although the hint system is useful it's a pain to play the mini-game every time you want to take another look at the helpful diagrams.The world of Machinarium is unique and engaging, and if the game had been a few hours shorter then I would definitely recommend it. However, as it is I'm afraid I quickly came to find it dull and repetitive.			"

												I'm a sucker for some good point-and-click gamnes. But when it comes to this one, I can't recommend it.The art style makes everything extremely difficult to make out one item from another. Somethimes they hvae a VERY subtle glow, but even that isn't hepful. The game mechanics are interesting to say the least. You can only interact with things in your reach, and you can extend or retract your robots body to add height-specific puzzle solving. My complaints with the height changing are extremely lengthy. My main issue with it, is the walking speed. There's time sensitive puzzles you have to do early on in the game. And if you forget to retract your body (or raise it) you end up walking extremely slow. Lo and behold, you find yourself hobbling back to the original point of interest to restart the puzzle.The game does a terrible job of explaining anything to you, and the controls often feel clunky. Though the game is fun for a little bit, it finds itself repeated quite quickly.If point-and-click adventure games are your thing, I recommend anything but this game. It wore me out to the point where I don't even want to play any of the other games that do what this is trying to do, better.The normal price is $9.99 but is 65% off for $3.49 during the winter sale. I can't say it's a waste of money, because it's inexpensive and after an hour or so (give or take based on preference) pays for itself. If you can avoid buying it for full price but still want to pick it up, it's better to get it on sale, or wait for one. Otherwise, I don't feel it's really worth the trouble for $10 (or regional equal to USD)			"

												The visual style of this point'n'click adventure game is fantastic and the art really makes exploring the world thoroughly enjoyable, but for me the music is the real gem in this game. Categorize it how you want (I choose ambient/downtempo) - the sound track is perfectly enjoyable all on its own and well worth the money you pay for the whole game.Little Robot is unceremoniously dumped out of his city and has to figure out how to get back inside and find his girlfriend. The puzzles are great, the hint system subtle yet useful, and some of the problems fiendishly difficult (without being impossible or incomprehensible).If you're the type of person who thinks completing a game is the only point, then stay away from this brain-teaser. (Using the walk-through it will take you a few hours to complete). But if you enjoy thinking, are happy to get stuck and leave the game alone for a night or two whilst you think what you could do, and prepared to use your grey matter, then buy this. Now.			"

												An imaginative adventure with the atmosphere and charm that can only come from an Amanita Design game, Machinarium puts you in the rusty metal body of a thoughtful robot. The player quickly becomes enraptured by the unique sound design, pantomiming characters, and gorgeous backgrounds along their journey. If you're looking for an immersive world to lose yourself in for a few hour and are not afraid to challenge your thinking skills every now and again, I wholeheartedly recommend Machinarium.			"

If you like this also consider trying Samorost 2 and check out the Amanita Design website for other stuff by them (although a lot of their stuff is more like Samorost)			"

(Rusted) iron+ irony = win-win.It won't last dozens of hours, but the brighter candle always burns faster!The last time I enjoyed so much a Point&Click Adventure, I was playing Grim Fandango.

The music and visuals in the game are fantastic. The humor is cute and cooky. As well is the style of everything something to brag about. It's a very short but enjoyable indie game.			"

												Machinarium is an excellent point-and-click adventure. A simple, yet meaningful story of a cute little robot in a beautifully illustrated enviornment.Puzzles range from simple to quite difficult, but not too far out that you'd need to be using a walkthrough for the entire game.  Everything melds well together, and the puzzles fit the story superbly.For as inexpensive as the game is, it's a steal.  Give it a shot if you're into puzzle and point-and-click adventure titles (like Adera, etc), as it won't dissapoint.			"

												This was a fun little throwback to the point and click adventure games of yore.  A great story is woven in here despite there being zero dialog.  Some of the puzzles were a bit difficult, but there is a built in hint system to unstick you whenever you choose to use it.  Total playtime is short (about 7 hours for us), but it was worth it for the price.  This game appeals to all ages, my kids (3 and 5 at the time) called it the ""robot game"" and were fully engrossed by the story.			"

												This is one of my favourite adventure games that I have played. The story is pretty simple yet well done and the combination of mechanics, art and music really makes this game enjoyable.I was initially attracted by the artwork when I played the demo on the developer's website but quickly was impressed by every other aspect of the game. If you're into point and click adventures, I'd definitely recommend this one.The only issue that I had (and it was a very big one) is that the save files were not working for me. I've heard complaints about this issue on the forums and such but basically you would save a game into a slot and when you open the game next time, the save file is gone. This prevented me from finishing the game for a long time and was very frustrating. A couple of times I tried to finish the game in a single play-through but that was not possible for me. Fortunately, the save files worked on my brand new computer so I'm thinking it's something to do with a few systems. I'm not sure.			"

												My biggest issue with Machinarium is that like the Samorost games from the same developer, it’s flash-based which makes me think it should be playable for free in a browser. It is however, and enjoyable, visually-focused adventure game just like I’d expect after Samorost. The art and sounds are appealing, and the way they manage to tell a story, convey emotion (even from robots), and give you what you need to solve puzzles completely non-verbally is highly impressive.

Its setup is in a some kind of robotic world, it has decent puzzles, and the fact that it's completely hand-drawn, sure makes this game unforgettable. Most of the robots are anthropomorphized, and I especially like every little detail that added to the feeling of the game. Recommended for point-and-click adventurers :)			"

												Great Adventure Game for kids and adults.   The puzzles are different and the world is unique.  I don't generally like adventure games but Machinarium doesn't rely on the typical adventure formula.  For Kids there is no reading involved, everything is relayed in pictures, from clues to storyline so my little ones could play without me. The hint system is great, there is a minigame that once completed treats you to a sketch comic showing you step by step how to complete the current puzzle.  Overall Machinarium was a great game that made for some great quality time with my kids.			"

This game gets pretty confusing at times, but that's what online walkthroughs are for though ;) Definitely worth your moooolaaaaa!!! :D This game isn't for everyone though. If you don't like the feeling of wanting to rip your hair at times because you're too dumb to figure out what to do next, or the fact there is no dialogue.. then this game is not for you.			"

												If you're waffling on the decision of whether or not to buy ""Machinarium,"" check out the free online games ""Samorost"" and ""Samorost 2"" by the same developer. You'll find yourself in awe of the wonderful worlds Amanita Design creates.Even if you're not a fan of point-and-click adventure games (and I'm certainly not), you owe it yourself to pick up Machinarium. It's beautiful, charming, and challenging to a degree that never forces you to quit. All in all, a shining example of what games can be.			"

												I was hooked to this game from the moment I started it and was upset when it ended. I want more! It's a very clever point and click type game with many mini-games and brilliant puzzles to solve. It has that ""just one more puzzle"" quality to it and would I definitely recommend it. The sense of accomplishment when solving a puzzle on your own makes it all so worth any effort! And if you get stuck there is a help book that can give you the answers, after winning the short mini-game of course.			"

												Good casual and fairly-easy point-and-click adventure game.  Cute robot unraveling a big story in a quirky robot world.  Could be done in one night or a few, and it's probably able to be done by a kid although they might need help once in a while for a puzzle or for a timing part.NOTE: I think the save files are kept as Flash-related files on your computer.  Do not clear your Flash cache/files if you have not finished the game yet!			"

												My biggest issue with Machinarium is that like the Samorost games from the same developer, it’s flash-based which makes me think it should be playable for free in a browser. It is however, and enjoyable, visually-focused adventure game just like I’d expect after Samorost. The art and sounds are appealing, and the way they manage to tell a story, convey emotion (even from robots), and give you what you need to solve puzzles completely non-verbally is highly impressive.

												This masterpiece by Amanita Design is funny, complex, maddening, clever, and extremely well designed. As adventure games go there is some pixel hunting. More often than not you are clearly presented with a puzzle that seems unsolvable at first, but that is where the real joy in this game is found. Whether it's a new character or item you can use, or figuring out a 2 or 3 layer puzzle, each layer more difficult than the last.Take a second to admire the art. Never have I seen so much detail packed into a 2D environment. There's much life in this robotic and automated world. A tremendously beautiful and difficult adventure game. You will know a robot could love. Funny, quirky, smart, and genuine. Buy it!			"

It's not for the casual puzzle solver.  Though I appreciate not having to go to the internet to figure it out, I would have appreciated it if I didn't have to resort to peeking at the solution.  I just couldn't handle being stuck at the game and leaving it unfinished.Nevertheless, it's a really nice little game that's worth the trouble just to see through till the end.Completed in 12.2 hours.

The hints for when you get stuck are good because it saves you alt-tabbing out of the game and looking them up online... which inevitably will happen. Saying that the puzzles are well balanced and with a little patience the majority can be solved without being too easy and at the same time not being so frustrating for the need to check them online.The game seems to be free of bugs HOWEVER running a cleanup program will lead to saves being deleted due to the location they're in.Entertainment: 8/10Mechanics: 8/10Artwork: 10/10Environments: 9/10Immersion: 8/10Variation in gameplay: 7/10Stability: 6/10Originality: 8/10 "

												A beautiful adventure game by Czech developer Amanita, beautiful in concept, music and atmosphere among numerous other things.However, I must say that I hated the first hour of the game. Being a fan of the old adventure titles such as Monkey Island series, The Fate of Atlantis and Day of the Tentacle (mostly all the Scumm games), I found the logic behind Machinarium's puzzle a little bit incoherent.Puzzles aren't solved in the way you would thinkthey should. Instead they are solved mainly by the stuff you manage to pick up from around the game. Some items don't really seem to be a certain puzzle's solution but it just turns out that it is.Overall, Machinarium is a great and aspiring game that strives to be on par with Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle, but it's the lack of experience on the developer's part that couldn't give it this small boost. I expect upcoming games by Amanita to conquer the adventure market!			"

EDIT: The text below was written before Steam Recommendations became Steam Reviews.Unforgettable adventure game. Machinarium is a flash-based, point and click game with great hand-made graphics and a stunning soundtrack composed by Tomáš Dvořák. There are many interesting, untypical puzzles to solve, some are quite hard, but you can always use ""The Tome of Tips"", as I like to call it, if you're stuck. It's available all the time, you just have to unlock it first by playing a mini-game. Machinarium is rather short, it takes about seven hours to finish it without using hints or about three hours if you play for the second time and know exactly what to do. Is it worth it? Absolutely. I would say that for this price you won't get a more charming game than Machinarium. I have good memories with this game. Reminds me a little of Stanisław Lem's book, ""The Cyberiad"". If you are still uncertain then try out the demo on the official website. No need to download any files!			"

Even when you think you'd sussed one, you'll find a twist that adds an extra layer to it.As you move through each scene, you'll love the artwork on display, with loads of enjoyable details.It acts as a slow-paced antidote to all the high-octane shooters out there.Take your time.  Chill out.  Absorb the game.  Enjoy.			"

												Machinarium has fantastic ambience and music. The wonderfully hand-drawn images are a delight to look at, alongside the simple yet fluid-like animations. If you're into point-and-click adventure-puzzle solving, I highly recommend this gem.			"

												Machinarium is a beautiful game. Every screen is a work of art. The puzzles are tricky sometimes but never to the point of not being fun.The soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly and sometimes music comes to you as a reward of sorts.All in all a very enjoyable experience.My only criticism would be that I encountered a bug that deleted my save files. I had to download a program to fix it.			"

												A quick summary of my thoughts on the game:An adventure game with an interresting way of telling the story through pictures (thought / speech bubbles) in stead of text. I found the characters and situations you encounter to be quite funny. The puzzles are nicely varied, although some of them are a bit tedious (those that arent really puzzles at all!). Item combining usually made sense the few times it was needed. Game is about the expected length (short), but the prize tag makes it worthwhile in my opinion.This is an adventure game that you may enjoy even if you arent a die hard adventure game enthusiast.Id also recommend it if you are looking for a casual experience to share with your better half.

												A gorgeously hand-drawn point&click adventure puzzle game with an excellent soundtrack that fits the game's atmosphere flawlessly.Despite featuring about 0 spoken or written words, the plot (what very little of it there is) and emotions of the characters are very well conveyed.As far as puzzles go, they're all fairly smart and considerably well thought out. Also, if you're having trouble with a particular stage, the game provides a ""semi-walkthrough book"" that, after completing a small shooting minigame, will give you a few hints as to what you need to do to progress further.

												This is a quaint and short adventure game in which you control a little robot as he tries to uncover an evil scheme. This game takes a little getting used to at first, but once you familiarise yourself with the interface you will not find it too hard to play. One of the nicest features of this particular adventure game is the 'guide book'. If you become stuck, you can play a short minigame to access the guide book which will tell you exactly what to do. That might make it sound a little easy; but the thing is, while the book is open you cannot see the rest of the screen; and whenever you close the book, you must replay the minigame to reopen it. This game is definitely worth checking out, although at $20 it seems a little steep given how short it is.			"

 Machinarium So.. Machinarium.. This is really one of those games that allready has so many positive reviews that it might not need another one. But here it goes:Machinarium is set to a universe where there seems to be no humans. Instead there is machines building machines. As you can see from the screenshots posted on the store page of the game, it almost seems like it takes place in a junkyard, where the living machines often are built from scrap metal. Even tho these are machines and don't speak, they have character, and show emotions. Gameplay & Stroy:Machinarium follows the old and well known point and click game mechanic. It is a story driven adventure/puzzle game, that has a rather serious story, but manages to add humor to it on several places.The story captured me from the very first moment that i started playing this. I don't want to ruin the story for those who haven't played this yet, so im not going to cover any part of the story in this review.As mention above, the characters in Machinarium don't speak, but they show thinking boubles above their head and make noises (an alternative way to give the player hints about what they need to do next). This method, in my opinion works very well. Puzzles: I have played many puzzle games and i have to say that for me, this was kind of perfect in terms of difficulty. Many puzzle games tend to become to confusing when they try to make it a big and challenging game. Like having a big area with lots and lots of things to interact with, without a single clue on what to do next. Machinarium manages to give you a lot of different options on what to interact with, but at the same time you get enough hints on what your goal is that you for example knows that you have to do someting with this item, just not what. Level design:The levels in Machinarium are great actually. There is a lot of variations and different enviroments through out the game. They also made the levels in a way that you get a feeling of a big living world even outside of the playable areas. You still have to remember that this is a sideview game with limited possibilities of movement. Still, there is depth in the levels, so you can for example walk away and towards the camera. Nostalgia:For me these kinds of games gives me some nostalgia from the time around 2001-2006 when i used to play games like these on flash sites all the time. There is something ""calming"" about sitting there without any stress, and figuring out these sorts of games. Of course Machinarium is more polished, longer and better than most free flash games out there.Bugs & Crashes:So far in my review, i've only said positive things about Machinarium. But as many other games before it, Machinarium suffers when it comes to bugs and crashes. I experienced several times during my playthrough that the games just froze with a black screen. I still could hear the music but i had to close it through task manager and restart it to keep playing. I also experienced that the game just closed for no apparent reason, and sometimes while playing and i clicked on something, nothing happened in-game. But since this is a very small game in terms of size, and that it practically doesn't require anything to run, it took me seconds to restart and be back in it. Conclusion:Machinarium is a great game, really. If you like story driven puzzle games i would recommend you to get this.			"

No ""combine the fish-hook with the balloon of laughing gas"" kind of nutty solutions. I used hints a few times, but later I regretted it because I was 75% to the solution when I gave up. The artwork is really beautiful, more so than any other game I have played. I used a version downloaded from Steam. I did not have any technical problems. I think this is a really special game that I would recommend to anyone who likes puzzles and adventure games.			"

												I really enjoyed this game, though relatively short.   A great puzzle game with some great background music.Once you discover that on most screens there are tiny objects that are hard to spot which are key elements in moving forward in the game, it becomes relatively simple to move through the game.  The game also does not punish you for trying things out, it simply rewinds back to where you went wrong.  This doesn't lead to a trial and error type game though, as some thing require thinking on your feet (i.e. the modified computer connect-5 or tic-tac-toe w/ 5 pieces game).4/5			"

												Machinarium is a Point&Click with a brilliant and beautiful universe. Sounds and musics are made with metallic noises. There’s a lot of humor too. The story is about a world of robots; we control a small robot which was thrown to the dump and is going to return in town to repair the insult which was made for it. Dialogues and flashbacks are made in drawn bubbles.The difficulty is more present than in Botanicula for several reasons: at first, objects to be collected are facing in the background, so they are not easily locatable at first glance and force us to look well everywhere.Secondly, the robot has the capacity to change its size; what makes that there are actions which we can make only for a certain height and not for an other one.Finally, the objects which we collect can sometimes merge between them to form only one.The whole allowing to have riddles a little more complex, increasing the interest and the length of the game.However, even by being blocked, no need to fetch the soluce on Google. The game integrates itself the solutions of 2 manners: in every area, it is possible to consult a clue, which just gives the main action to realize at one time or another to finish the area. But it is also possible to consult the guide of solutions (which is a comic strip showing step by step what to do to achieve the level), if you manage to play with success to a short shooting game.Indeed, numerous short games punctuate Machinarium: several puzzles, riddles and games like Space Invaders.In conclusion, a very good Point&Click game, with a well thought universe and a good level of difficulty!

												Machinarium is a touching game that is just long enough to be refreshing but not long enough to get stale. The characters invoke emotion without words, the puzzles are fun, and the hint scheme is a fantastic middle ground between banging one's head against a wall and reading a walkthrough - just enough work that you don't instantly give up, but not so frustrating that you're driven off.Also, it is great for kids. :)			"

												Machinarium is a modern adventure game. Which means that it is short, with easy puzzles. However, it has a cute protagonist, and the puzzles are interesting. Machinarium is also a good transitional piece; if you like the casual hidden-object adventure games but find the traditional point-and-clicks to be too frustratingly hard, Machinarium may be a happy medium for you.Contrariwise, if you are a fan of classic point-and-click adventure games, you may find this one to be breezy and wonder what the fuss is about.

												Your usual adventure game but with a catch. There's no text in the whole game, relying mostly on visuals to tell its basic story and hint what do do next. The latter is the true challenge of the game, which is not new in this genre, but several puzzles will make you go in circles. Fortunately you have a minigame that if beated, it will give you the full playthrough of the screen you're in, so you can work a little extra to get the solution rather just googling it.The game works in flash and that's probably its main problem. The game runs well, but some inputs can be rough specially as the character has a very limited area to interact with. There's also some puzzles that might feel the game becomes either bugged or unresponsive, so better double check before making assumptions.If you figure out all its puzzles Machinarium is actually pretty short. But due how vague the game is hinting the next step as well the limited interaction range will force you into, is not a game that you can beat by just clicking everything until the character walks into it.

												Machinarium is a cute and funny game about a robot who have had enough of bullying and corrupt systems. The main robot of the game finds itself in a landfill and after figuring out how to assemble itself begins its quest of getting back home and stopping the evildoers that has been supressing it for so long.The game features a lot of minigames and puzzles, most of which are classic logic question of geometrical type but also some new and clever ideas that are really challenging. The storyline is a bit wierd and since none of the characters really say anything, it's hard to realize where you should go after you've solved a part of the puzzle. The developers have made a smart solution to this by implementing a ""tips and tricks""-help manual that you can only access after you have played a short bit of simple sidescroller.I've only had the opportunity to play it once, and since it only took me roughly five hours (even with getting stuck and trying many different paths time and again) I do not feel like this is a game that I want to own. Even though there is the option to solve some things in different order, it is a very linear game with few things that are out of the main quest.Overall I think that Machinarium is a really cute game, a nice challenge for anyone that are new to puzzle solvers or really like playing a lot of them and the design in it is really wonderful.85% is my rating			"

Every level appears hand-drawn, with gritty texture (and I don't mean that in the 3D rendering way) that makes the world stand out as a tarnished and dirty place. Despite not having any lines, the game is quite good at articulating not just what characters are talking about, but how they're saying it.

The music, the story, the puzzles, the visuals, the gameplay....I'll admit, I had to look up a walkthrough a few times to get past some of the puzzles, but that was more so due to me being so excited to see what happens next rather than spending time working through them. I still listen to the soundtrack. Also, the story still managed to touch my heart despite not using words to do so. Visual narratives, in my opinion, always have the greatest impact when done right.

Also need to mention the music; relaxing blippy bloppy electronica. Definitely one of my favourite game soundtracks as well. Amanita Design is a games studio to keep an eye on.			"

Played completely through remarkably sketched illustrations, the game's lack of text is a testament to its outstanding storytelling and well-crafted puzzles. And the package is only sweetened by its utterly captivating soundtrack.			"

												Machinarium is a beautiful point and click puzzle with lovely and very original hand-drawn graphics and a nicely-told classical story. The music and sound are perfect for this game. Some of the puzzles are easy while others will make you go back and forth to look for items or actions you could have forgotten. The game runs very smoothly and as expected with this kind of game, the pace is rather slow and calm and the game is rather short (but not too short).Amanita hasn't fully solved a very annoying issue: sometimes you cannot resume a saved game and the main menu shows only the ""Play new game"" option. They provide a solution where you can start from pre-saved files with the basic progression of each level and continue your adventure from there, but this falut is honestly very frustrating.The game is beautiful. If you don't mind searching the official page for those pre-saved files if you're unlucky, I recommend you to give it a go.			"

												Machinarium tells the unconventional story of a charming little robot living in an enigmatic automaton world. Beautiful yet monochromatic hand-drawn environments are filled with appreciable minute details, all rendered in a very unique style. Mostly logical and diverse puzzles aided by clever subtle guidance make the player feel smart and rarely at a loss for progression.This moderately short game is nonetheless of a very satisfying length. It features a solid and enjoyable soundtrack that perfectly accompanies every scene. The game's adroit presentation even manages to make players understand characters' needs and emotions flawlessly without necessitating a single line of dialogue, adding to the charismatic otherworldliness.I've been wanting to play this game since its release but somehow managed to procrastinate over half a decade before finally indulging. As a result, its Flash engine now shows its age and limitations, and the game's medium resolution assets do not use full screen (black borders fill all four sides). The clunky inventory interface doesn't work as well as it should but at least nothing feels broken.Some mildly repetitive sections could have been improved, and despite all its prowesses the game has no truly impressive wow factor (nor any major flaw). A consistently competent and enjoyable experience throughout should please most adventure fans.			"

												A wonderful point-and-click walkaround game.  The art and music are attractive and atmospheric.   I had to do very minimal clue-googling, and in both cases I felt sure I wouldn't have solved the puzzle on my own.  My only complaint is that two of the minigames are reflex-based (a Pacman-like robot-killing game and a Space Invaders game) and they don't fit the atmosphere or style of the rest of the game.   Furthermore, the robot-killing game doesn't allow keyboard controls: it's mouse-only.   But that's a nitpick.  Overall the puzzles are varied and fun and I felt a real sense of achievement when I figured each one out.			"

												This is a beautiful and charming game, you won't be able to stop yourself from smiling. There's no dialog in it, the story is mostly told through thought bubbles with pictures. So I suppose it'd be a good game for people of any language or the hard of hearing. As a point-n-click adventure it's fun for people who aren't into twitch games or for sharing with a non-gamer SO. I'm not a parent so I can't say for certain that it's kid friendly but there's no violence in it and it's just a sweet love story.			"

												What to say... Inspired me to so much! Very artistic - in a dusty, robotic aesthetic -, the game itself was surprisingly difficult by the end (as in not too easy)... lovely! The two downsides for me were the un-longevity of the game, if I may say so, and the second one was that sometimes the point-and-clicking was a bit too detailed, as in you knew where and what you wanted to click on but the mouse always seemed to not reach it.I just wish there was more to play..!

												This little flash based game, be it the futuristic music or the beautiful graphics, is a true work of art.  Also there are no long and annoying dialogues which usually can turn an adventure game into a frustrating event;  instead of verbal dialogues all forms of communication are graphical.  Plus, for those who get stuck, the game has a built in illustrated walkthrough for each level, which can be unlocked by playng a short and simple mini-game. The only downside, imo, is that some of the puzzles can be solved only through pure luck and guessing, and not logic, but that is where the built in walkthrough comes to the rescue.  All in all this is a gem of a game that every collector should have in their archive, especially those who want to give their support to independant game makers.			"

Machinarium is also a good transitional piece; if you like the casual hidden-object adventure games but find the traditional point-and-clicks to be too frustratingly hard, Machinarium may be a happy medium for you.Contrariwise, if you are a fan of classic point-and-click adventure games, you may find this one to be breezy and wonder what the fuss is about.

												Machinarium is an adventure game with a more than charming art style. It has got its fair share of challenging puzzles but for the experienced fan of adventure games should get through those as well. The game has a simple, yet charming storyline and a hand full of quirky, but lovable charakters. Most interesting point of this game is, that it needs absolutely no dialogue and still anyone should be able to understand it. In the end I think, the sellingpoint of this game is the interesting art style. If you are the type of gamer who enjoys that kind of thing, this game is a must have. If you expect another monkey island or broken sword, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												One of my ABSOLUTE favorite games of all time! Point and Click games are my favorite and this game was both challenging and amazingly fun at the same time. The multiple dimensions of the game really added to my overall experience and left me wanting to continue on forever! I loved the feature where you collected items and could combine them to create new tools to utilize in the game. The story was undeniably adorable, extremely creative, and original. I enjoyed every moment of this game and would recommend it to ALL! The built in ""one hint"" feature was awesome and provided me with just the right amount of support to get me unstuck at the frustrational level, yet still leave me to figure out the main chunk of the puzzle. The character development, crazy puzzles, and phenomenal graphics grabbed my attention, stretched my thinking, and had me laughing at the unbelievable attention to detail and added humor all at the same time. This game is truly fun and engaging by every definition under the sun.			"

												I had SO MUCH FUN playing this game.  Granted, I do have a soft spot for point and click adventure games, but even my boyfriend said that it was fun when he got past pointing and clicking.  Its a very fun puzzle game and the artistic style is gorgeous.  I love that it looks I wish it could be a little longer though.I'm definitely going to look for games by Amanita Design in the future.			"

												A beautiful adventure game with real personality. Every level appears hand-drawn, with gritty texture (and I don't mean that in the 3D rendering way) that makes the world stand out as a tarnished and dirty place. Despite not having any lines, the game is quite good at articulating not just what characters are talking about, but how they're saying it. Even the backstory, doled out piece by piece, is touching.			"

												I am legitimately impressed with this game. The music, the story, the puzzles, the visuals, the gameplay....I'll admit, I had to look up a walkthrough a few times to get past some of the puzzles, but that was more so due to me being so excited to see what happens next rather than spending time working through them. I still listen to the soundtrack. Also, the story still managed to touch my heart despite not using words to do so. Visual narratives, in my opinion, always have the greatest impact when done right. I look forward to playing Botanicula now :)			"

Thomas Dvorak has created a music masterpiece to accompany this gorgeous game about a little robot trying to save his city and get his girl robot. Some of the puzzles can get tedious, but the adventure game aspect is beautiful. One of the best hidden gems on Steam.			"

												Machinarium tells the unconventional story of a charming little robot living in an enigmatic automaton world. Beautiful yet monochromatic hand-drawn environments are filled with appreciable minute details, all rendered in a very unique style. Mostly logical and diverse puzzles aided by clever subtle guidance make the player feel smart and rarely at a loss for progression.This moderately short game is nonetheless of a very satisfying length. It features a solid and enjoyable soundtrack that perfectly accompanies every scene. The game's adroit presentation even manages to make players understand characters' needs and emotions flawlessly without necessitating a single line of dialogue, adding to the charismatic otherworldliness.I've been wanting to play this game since its release but somehow managed to procrastinate over half a decade before finally indulging. As a result, its Flash engine now shows its age and limitations, and the game's medium resolution assets do not use full screen (black borders fill all four sides). The clunky inventory interface doesn't work as well as it should but at least nothing feels broken.Some mildly repetitive sections could have been improved, and despite all its prowesses the game has no truly impressive wow factor (nor any major flaw). A consistently competent and enjoyable experience throughout should please most adventure fans.			"

												Machinarium is a fun little game. It's full of puzzles and has a really interesting little world of robots to explore. It can be pretty easy to get lost sometimes though because sometimes your objectives aren't clear. You also have to keep a sharp eye out because some things can be missed pretty easily. There's a good bit of running around back and forth when you're tying to figure things out, but if you get truly stuck the game actually has a walkthrough built inside of it. If you like puzzles and cute robots Machinarium is worth a try. The art is pretty and has a nice sketchy look to it. Plus some of the little robot's reminiscing is   pretty funny. If you liked Botanicula it's made by the same guys so you'll probably like it.			"

												The game has overall cute if - at some time - repetitive animations (when letting the main charater just sitting there) or having him perform a task. Also remarkable is the hand-drawn scenary at every single screen (there're so much details drawn to match the ambiance).That's combined with increasing difficulty at small technical and logical riddles (say: minigames) all along the way to the goal where it started to go all wrong - that much for revealing the background story.Most of the time you'll have to complete a string of actions before getting to the next screen and more often to solve some brain-teasers to proceed.The real task is mostly to understand what's the goal of the minigame before accomplishing it since there're only abstract hints to the task: one for free by clicking the bulb following an animated film to get  the global picture (rather than having the whole solution picture-wise after sucessfully shooting from a key at lots of moving spiders hanging from a thread).

												If you love puzzle games, or point and click. This is the perfect game for you.This game is a very well put together puzzle game mixed with Point and click.The artstyle is fantastic, the puzzles are equally dificult. Some are easy to figure out, while others leave you scratching your head, wondering what to do. The story in this game is very clear, even though not a single word is spoken throughout the entire game. It's cheap, and may only grant you one or maybe two playthroughs, but i would definitely recommed this game.The music is another thing about the game that is great. You have the option to turn it off, but throughout my nearly 3 hour playthrough of the game, i didn't. I never found it to be annoying or anything like that.The interface is great, very simplistic and minimalistic, but very easy to navigate.It gives you a very easy to follow on how to play the game and use the games different mechanics.I can only recommend this game. Do check it out!			"

												Machinarium is a beautifully done puzzle adventure. Not as long as games like Myst, but the journey is a wonderful experience full of unusual thinking and robotic conundrums. The characters are cute, and well made, as well as full of personality which is rare for a puzzle game. The presence of a hint for each area is helpful for those who get stuck, and if you really want a solution you can work through a mini-game, moving a key through a side-scrolling maze while avoiding the spiders (or shooting them) and not touching the walls or bricks, until you find the keyhole at the end, which unlocks the walkthrough book and shows you a page for the area you're in with a step by step picture guide of what needs to be done. It thoughtfully avoids any spoilers, and has a few surprises for those who explore possibilities aside from those needed to directly progress. A good game, with fun and cute characters, a fantastic style, plenty to see, and a great ending. It's worth the price.			"

												Nice point-and-click/puzzle game. The art style and created atmosphere are the biggest attractors of this game. Puzzles are clever and on average a bit less random than some other point-and-click games can be, most combinations are logical.HOWEVER, the game is made in Flash and that causes some serious issues you have to deal with. The interface is clunky and saving and loading games can sometimes not work. I have had my saves get lost after system reboots, Flash updates etc. There are some workarounds, like manually copying your save files, but they are a bit of a hassle.			"

												You're a robot, what else must be said? the art in this game is truly amazing, the world has a weird emptiness about it, and a feel of neglect for the whole city, but still manages to be beautiful, and ever so inviting in its rusted out corridors. As for the story, you must rescue your Girl Friend from the kitchen, yes the kitchen. As she was kid napped and taken away and forced to cook for your enemies, as there is no talking in this game, every thought and emotion is displayed in a very pretty little thought bubbles, and the emotion of the protagonist is displayed just right. My last statement, are the puzzles some of these puzzles are push overs, others will take a wile, and might even require you to get the answer in this handy little answer book that is always available to you, so your not stuck on the same puzzle for 10 days strait ripping out your hair. Add all this up, and you got a nice little puzzle game about love and robots, a good buy.			"

												Machinarium, a very stylized puzzle game made by Amanita Design. It starts off with a robot named Josef landing in a junkyard who eventually makes his way back home, after a brief encounter with some criminal robots the story slowly unfolds to what Josef must do. The design of this robot world is very stylized with its design and characters, the music reminds me of the classic Spyro the Dragon series as both of their music have a very other worldy quality. Gameplay wise it's a real challenge, the puzzle can sometimes be hard to get through that I ended up looking for a walkthrough to solve some of them lol But there are some fun little mini games here and there so it's not always that frustrating. This is definantly worth a buy for those of you that want to face a real challenging puzzle game.			"

												A very cute point and click game. There is no dialogue so the story and the hints are a bit more subtle,  and are given through visuals. The environment gives off a relaxed feeling, especially with the excellent background music. Puzzles were mostly fairly easily doable.			"

												Things start out fairly simple, but the games intuitive cartoon/hyper realism styling just draws you in instantly. And not only that, its an indie game, which is always a plus in my book. Its an insanely fantastic game, although the price is a bit steep, I caught this on sale. In the end though this game is one of my favorites, its got a bit of humor in it, but you cant help but feel its got a little bit of a sick twist to it. Definantly pick this up if you enjoy thinking and puzzles.			"

												Machinarium has three components making it awesome: colourful charechters, cute pen-drawn graphics and tons of puzzles which do rack your brains. Machinarium's soundtrack composed by Tomas Dvorak should be mentioned separately. It is absolutely masterpiece of electronic ambient. This music nicely complement Machinarium game phenomena.			"

												A beautiful adventure game by Czech developer Amanita, beautiful in concept, music and atmosphere among numerous other things.However, I must say that I hated the first hour of the game. Being a fan of the old adventure titles such as Monkey Island series, The Fate of Atlantis and Day of the Tentacle (mostly all the Scumm games), I found the logic behind Machinarium's puzzle a little bit incoherent.Puzzles aren't solved in the way you would thinkthey should. Instead they are solved mainly by the stuff you manage to pick up from around the game. Some items don't really seem to be a certain puzzle's solution but it just turns out that it is.Overall, Machinarium is a great and aspiring game that strives to be on par with Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle, but it's the lack of experience on the developer's part that couldn't give it this small boost. I expect upcoming games by Amanita to conquer the adventure market!			"

												A really nice story about a cute little robot who goes on a point and click adventure to save his cute little robot girlfriend. The art style is amazing, and the game is definetly as difficult as a point and click game should be. There's this odd little minigame you can play to get hints as well if the game proves just too difficult. I got around 9 hours out of one playthrough without hints, so it will keep you occupied for a while. Past that, it's just a gorgeous game with bucketloads of character.			"

												Great Adventure Game for kids and adults.   The puzzles are different and the world is unique.  I don't generally like adventure games but Machinarium doesn't rely on the typical adventure formula.  For Kids there is no reading involved, everything is relayed in pictures, from clues to storyline so my little ones could play without me. The hint system is great, there is a minigame that once completed treats you to a sketch comic showing you step by step how to complete the current puzzle.  Overall Machinarium was a great game that made for some great quality time with my kids.			"

												A fantastic adventure game. It's just beautiful, the art is exquisite, the puzzle element is good, the music is great with some particularly beautiful tracks and in general it does a great job in setting the ambiance for the robot city. The only problem is that as with other adventure games once you've completed it and know how to solve everything you're pretty much done with it. Unless you want to enjoy all of its wonderful art agin, which is perfectly ok  =)And I totally recommend getting the soundtrack too. Speaking of soundtrack, make sure to check the game folder! There's a bonus EP there  :)			"

												This game's artwork and music alone make it worth a try. The hand-drawn animation and environments are equal parts adorable and eerie, and I'm hoping the developer eventually returns to this quirky robot city. There's something familiar about it...This was my first real experience with an adventure game (I've tried a few, but never for long). The environmental puzzles were all logical and satisfying, but I admit I cheated a bit for the puzzles involving patterns etc. It didn't affect my enjoyment of the game...I really wanted to see the story through.I recommend this to anyone who doesn't think they'd be interested in this sort of game.

												I am legitimately impressed with this game. The music, the story, the puzzles, the visuals, the gameplay....I'll admit, I had to look up a walkthrough a few times to get past some of the puzzles, but that was more so due to me being so excited to see what happens next rather than spending time working through them. I still listen to the soundtrack. Also, the story still managed to touch my heart despite not using words to do so. Visual narratives, in my opinion, always have the greatest impact when done right. I look forward to playing Botanicula now :)			"

												This game is short and sweet. It's very pleasant and enjoyable.However, the logic used to solve some of these is absolutely ridiculous. Sometimes, I just sit back and scratch my head trying to figure out what the developers were thinking when they came up with ways to get around some of the problems you face in this game.But once you've solved a puzzle or two, you can figure out where to go in the next few puzzles.Also, it glitched out at the part with the cat that you electrify. For the longest time, my cat didn't work. I thought I was doing the puzzle wrong, so I looked up a walkthrough only to realize I was doing it correctly. When I went back to the spot where I picked up the passed-out cat, another one was lying on the ground there, even though it was already in my inventory. I picked it up again, and it worked to solve the problem after that.8/10, in my opinion.			"

												Nice point-and-click/puzzle game. The art style and created atmosphere are the biggest attractors of this game. Puzzles are clever and on average a bit less random than some other point-and-click games can be, most combinations are logical.HOWEVER, the game is made in Flash and that causes some serious issues you have to deal with. The interface is clunky and saving and loading games can sometimes not work. I have had my saves get lost after system reboots, Flash updates etc. There are some workarounds, like manually copying your save files, but they are a bit of a hassle.			"

Not a long game in terms of hours (unless you really get stuck) but a really good example of what an Indie game can give you that triple-a titles simply can't. *****			"

												Machinarium is a Flash based point and click adventure game that is unique in its execution.  Each area has readily accessable hint and a full walkthrough of the area at the cost of playing a somewhat tedious mini-game to keep you from looking at it unless you're really stuck.  The robot you control can be stretched shorter or taller with a mouse drag which gives you the ability to reach areas you couldn't without it and adds complexity to many of the game's puzzles.  Most of the puzzles are pretty simple and produce, at most, a moderate challenge.The real appeal of this game though is its art.  Almost everything is made of metal and the way it's drawn and painted gives the abstract looking structures a touch of realism that shows each ones age through how rusted or weathered it looks.  The ambient music helps to set the darkish tone of the game with mechanical and lo-fi sounds. While I'm on the topic of tone despite the dark atmosphere, the character you play as, and many of the ones you meet, are quite peppy and charming which gives an interesting contrast that made me feel as if the robots were living it a different paradigm.It might just be nostalgia, but I miss adventure games, and I really feel the medium still holds up today; at least on PC's.

												Yeah!:Gorgous hand drawn point and click adventure set in a robot world. Length is pretty good as well.Meh!: Some puzzles are annoying(Looking at you King's brain action mini game) or difficult(Bomb).Bleh!: The fact that your character can only interact(or know its clickable) with objects with in reach of its arms is annoying. This has you basically moving the chacter around the screen at his snail pace to make sure you have everything. Wish there was ability to skip screen transition animations to speed things up.Verdict: A gorgous point and click adventure that is just right in difficulty most of the time. A few of the mini-game puzzles do annoy and seem out of place in the genre but can be overlooked in the overall picture. Not worth full price, but was worth it via the humble bundle obtained in.***/5			"

												Excellent, Beautiful and original adventure set in the old-school point & click style. The comical animations, emotive personalities of the characters through imagery alone, and incredible backdrops all hand-drawn to extremely high quality finish combined with a humorous and engaging storyline clearly outline the level of attention to detail and an affectionate amount of dedication from developers.Machinarium is a great title for those who seek a more cerebral, perhaps slower-paced gameplay than many of the frustrating arcade games around. The puzzles are clearly described and visible clues help to keep on the right track, so there's little chance of being utterly 'stuck'. Even in such situations, there is a buiilt-in diagramatic walkthrough guide for every puzzle that requires a fun little mini-game to view.At such a bargain price, you can't really go wrong with this game. I wholeheartedly recommend Machinarium to any fans of puzzles/adventure games or just gamers in general who seek something a little different...			"

												This was a fun little throwback to the point and click adventure games of yore.  A great story is woven in here despite there being zero dialog.  Some of the puzzles were a bit difficult, but there is a built in hint system to unstick you whenever you choose to use it.  Total playtime is short (about 7 hours for us), but it was worth it for the price.  This game appeals to all ages, my kids (3 and 5 at the time) called it the ""robot game"" and were fully engrossed by the story.			"

												This is one of my favourite adventure games that I have played. The story is pretty simple yet well done and the combination of mechanics, art and music really makes this game enjoyable.I was initially attracted by the artwork when I played the demo on the developer's website but quickly was impressed by every other aspect of the game. If you're into point and click adventures, I'd definitely recommend this one.The only issue that I had (and it was a very big one) is that the save files were not working for me. I've heard complaints about this issue on the forums and such but basically you would save a game into a slot and when you open the game next time, the save file is gone. This prevented me from finishing the game for a long time and was very frustrating. A couple of times I tried to finish the game in a single play-through but that was not possible for me. Fortunately, the save files worked on my brand new computer so I'm thinking it's something to do with a few systems. I'm not sure.			"

												Machinarium is a beautifully done puzzle adventure. Not as long as games like Myst, but the journey is a wonderful experience full of unusual thinking and robotic conundrums. The characters are cute, and well made, as well as full of personality which is rare for a puzzle game. The presence of a hint for each area is helpful for those who get stuck, and if you really want a solution you can work through a mini-game, moving a key through a side-scrolling maze while avoiding the spiders (or shooting them) and not touching the walls or bricks, until you find the keyhole at the end, which unlocks the walkthrough book and shows you a page for the area you're in with a step by step picture guide of what needs to be done. It thoughtfully avoids any spoilers, and has a few surprises for those who explore possibilities aside from those needed to directly progress. A good game, with fun and cute characters, a fantastic style, plenty to see, and a great ending. It's worth the price.			"

												Brilliant P&C adventure. One of the best. Great soundtrack and 2d visuals. Contains all the humor P&Cs are known for without any of the text. Adds many great features that modern P&Cs should have: taking away useless inventory items, giving a general clue for every room, giving an in game walkthrough for those who are truly stumped, and mixing in challenging puzzles that are simple in concept. The downsides? It's a flash game, so resolution options are terribly limited and wiping your brower data can erase your save. Also, the robot moves too slow/no fastforward or skipping.			"

												6/10 point-and-click. Visually this thing is killer and a ton of fun to experience. The concept is just very well thought out and the puzzles are clever and frankly some of the smartest I've ever played. Mechanically, this game is just awful at times which is silly since it's a mechanical world (face-palm for dumb pun). It's a flash port so don't expect it to be super well optimized for any system. The thing that just cranked my gears the wrong way was that I would click to go somewhere and realize I had left the robot's body elongated or shortened which makes him travel at half the pace. You can't redirect him back mid-travel, as far as I know you can't speed up the game, and you can't readjust him to normal height while he's walking either making for a lot of headbanging on my desk waiting for the stupid robot to get to the place he needed to go. Other than that, it has a killer aesthetic and a fun dialogue free story which is just fantastic and you should definitely give this game a try if you're at all into these kind of adventures. The docked points were for the time wasting oversights and not for the actual puzzles themselves which were easily some of the best I've ever seen in any game.			"

												A wonderful world of rag tag robots.  Follow the little mechanical hero as he finds his parts, girlfriend, new friends and along the way, save a city from destruction.It has some tough puzzles that send you playing a mini-game for a built-in walkthrough.  It's not for the casual puzzle solver.  Though I appreciate not having to go to the internet to figure it out, I would have appreciated it if I didn't have to resort to peeking at the solution.  I just couldn't handle being stuck at the game and leaving it unfinished.Nevertheless, it's a really nice little game that's worth the trouble just to see through till the end.Completed in 12.2 hours.

												If you have played computer games for longer than the past decade (or if you have a taste for the classics) then you have played one or more of those old point-and-click adventure games, like those of old-school Lucasarts fame. Machinarium really brings you back to that time, when games did not have to be about leveling-up, taking the shot, making that jump, or fighting your way to the next checkpoint just in case that one annoying enemy takes away your last few hit points. Machinarium is a hallmark of this old-fashioned game style. In a time when few studios focus on this type of game, it is amazing to see an indie game with this level of artistic development. Every screen is unbelievably beautiful and breathtaking. The simple, hand-drawn characters have depth and personality that even the greatest mo-capped, celebrity-voiced charicatures cannot match. The puzzles are just right: not too easy, not too hard. Most of the time, the solution will come to you and you will think, ""Why did I not think of that before?"" THAT is what makes a great point-and-click adventure, and Machinarium is definitely a great game.			"

												Machinarium is an excellent point-and-click adventure. A simple, yet meaningful story of a cute little robot in a beautifully illustrated enviornment.Puzzles range from simple to quite difficult, but not too far out that you'd need to be using a walkthrough for the entire game.  Everything melds well together, and the puzzles fit the story superbly.For as inexpensive as the game is, it's a steal.  Give it a shot if you're into puzzle and point-and-click adventure titles (like Adera, etc), as it won't dissapoint.			"

												So pretty. Painterly, cartoonish images that embody the charm and decay of the environment and characters, with a fantastic, eminently listenable soundtrack. The puzzles are sufficiently challenging, even bewildering at times, but if you've played a point-and-click adventure, you know what you're in for; there is a hint system in place, integrated beautifully and playfully. Plot and backstory are fed to you with a dropper, via daydreams of the cute little robot protagonist. In sum, it's handcrafted in the best sense, imperfections included: fun, adorable, clever, and engaging. And seriously, get the soundtrack.			"

The frustration comes in when you know what needs to be done, but can't do it out of order. Or when you get stuck and walk back and forth doing the same actions over and over expecting a different result. It's kind of like life in that respect.

Some of the objectives are a little tricky but there is a fantastic inbuilt walkthrough with it's own little bonus!If you like point and clicks and want to spend a few hours roaming around a delightful cartoon robot landscape, this could be a winner!

												What to say... Inspired me to so much! Very artistic - in a dusty, robotic aesthetic -, the game itself was surprisingly difficult by the end (as in not too easy)... lovely! The two downsides for me were the un-longevity of the game, if I may say so, and the second one was that sometimes the point-and-clicking was a bit too detailed, as in you knew where and what you wanted to click on but the mouse always seemed to not reach it.I just wish there was more to play..!

												TL:DR Beautifully animated point and click adventure thats quite enjoyableFull version:This is a great point and click adventure with some great puzzles and mini-games. You play as a little robot who gets dumped outside the city ,also completely populated by other strange robots, who has to get back to the city and stop a gang of robots who have been terrorizing the citys inhabitants. The best thing about this game is the fantastic hand drawn art style. All the backgrounds and characters are beautifully animated and the strange and gloomy looking artwork gives the game a lot of character. It also has a great soundtrack that perfectly matches the games atmosphereGood points:- beautifully animated characters and backgrounds. If you've played Botanicula or Samorost you'll be familiar with the art style.-has some great puzzles and mini-games that you'll encounter throughout the gameBad points:- its not very long and doesnt have a lot of replay value			"

 Machinarium So.. Machinarium.. This is really one of those games that allready has so many positive reviews that it might not need another one. But here it goes:Machinarium is set to a universe where there seems to be no humans. Instead there is machines building machines. As you can see from the screenshots posted on the store page of the game, it almost seems like it takes place in a junkyard, where the living machines often are built from scrap metal. Even tho these are machines and don't speak, they have character, and show emotions. Gameplay & Stroy:Machinarium follows the old and well known point and click game mechanic. It is a story driven adventure/puzzle game, that has a rather serious story, but manages to add humor to it on several places.The story captured me from the very first moment that i started playing this. I don't want to ruin the story for those who haven't played this yet, so im not going to cover any part of the story in this review.As mention above, the characters in Machinarium don't speak, but they show thinking boubles above their head and make noises (an alternative way to give the player hints about what they need to do next). This method, in my opinion works very well. Puzzles: I have played many puzzle games and i have to say that for me, this was kind of perfect in terms of difficulty. Many puzzle games tend to become to confusing when they try to make it a big and challenging game. Like having a big area with lots and lots of things to interact with, without a single clue on what to do next. Machinarium manages to give you a lot of different options on what to interact with, but at the same time you get enough hints on what your goal is that you for example knows that you have to do someting with this item, just not what. Level design:The levels in Machinarium are great actually. There is a lot of variations and different enviroments through out the game. They also made the levels in a way that you get a feeling of a big living world even outside of the playable areas. You still have to remember that this is a sideview game with limited possibilities of movement. Still, there is depth in the levels, so you can for example walk away and towards the camera. Nostalgia:For me these kinds of games gives me some nostalgia from the time around 2001-2006 when i used to play games like these on flash sites all the time. There is something ""calming"" about sitting there without any stress, and figuring out these sorts of games. Of course Machinarium is more polished, longer and better than most free flash games out there.Bugs & Crashes:So far in my review, i've only said positive things about Machinarium. But as many other games before it, Machinarium suffers when it comes to bugs and crashes. I experienced several times during my playthrough that the games just froze with a black screen. I still could hear the music but i had to close it through task manager and restart it to keep playing. I also experienced that the game just closed for no apparent reason, and sometimes while playing and i clicked on something, nothing happened in-game. But since this is a very small game in terms of size, and that it practically doesn't require anything to run, it took me seconds to restart and be back in it. Conclusion:Machinarium is a great game, really. If you like story driven puzzle games i would recommend you to get this.			"

												This game has so much to offer, if you're interested in this game: its definitely worth buying. I am not normally into Point & Click or Adventure style games, but this one really is a cut above the rest. The art and style of the game is really interesting and unique. It also doesnt try to be too obvious with all of the objects and clues, but it does have them. Its style and the world created by the visuals really gives the game some depth and character. The areas are varied and unique, but still remaining cohesive. My only possible complaint with art & visuals is that I wish it would fully scale & stretch up to 1080P, but with the way the game is designed and with the way the game's art is made, I understand and accept why it doesnt.The music is very good. It fits the areas in the game very well and gives it so much personality. All of the tracks are long enough and are composed in a way that wont become grating on your nerves, even if you get stuck or stumped by a puzzle for a very long time.  one of my favorite soundtracks I've heard recently.The puzzles are all well designed, and they tend to be fair and dont fall into the trope of being needlessly obtuse in the illusion of being ""challenging."" The difficulty progression of the puzzles is fairly gradual and it tries really hard to teach the player its style and how you should be approaching each puzzle as you go. Only a few of them really took me a while to figure out and even if you get stuck: theres in-game hints and when you are 100% stumped: it has an unlockable walkthrough (you have to do a mini side-scrolling shooter to open it up) and the walkthrough doesnt completely spoil the puzzles.

The puzzles are sufficiently challenging, even bewildering at times, but if you've played a point-and-click adventure, you know what you're in for; there is a hint system in place, integrated beautifully and playfully. Plot and backstory are fed to you with a dropper, via daydreams of the cute little robot protagonist. In sum, it's handcrafted in the best sense, imperfections included: fun, adorable, clever, and engaging. And seriously, get the soundtrack.			"

Do robots dream of electric sheep?City robots Mashinarium, smelling of oil and covered with rust, live the life of a giant mechanism. You would never think that the same vending machine for batteries is also a robot! Originally posted by Jakub Dvorsky: - It happened on a distant and forgotten planet, where people used to send the garbage that they were producing old machines, mechanisms, computers, etc. This mechanical scrap was formed a few simple robots. Some time later they built other, more advanced robots, and then — settlement. Thus was created the city of Machinarium.  You play as a robot named Josef, Yes, our hero has a name, though it is not mentioned. You mistakenly throw away to the city dump, your girlfriend is kidnapped by the bandit and all around town is in danger! And who do you need to solve these problems? Of course You. Maybe You look funny, but full of resoluteness and courage.And so begins your exciting journey in the city of rusted steel, constantly working mechanisms and sleepless, the most diverse and unusual residents.Machinarium - a game of Czech developer Amanita Design company. Was created by the efforts of only 7 people and was sponsored by savings of developers. Guys, only 7 developers! And the project turned out just beautiful! Won many awards and entered the top 10 of ""Best games of 2009"" and is a game created in Adobe flash. Unlike stamped new games, before, tried to make something different, unique and memorable. In the game everything is fine. Great atmosphere, which is felt not only in the image created manually, but in a beautiful soundtrack. Each composition, each location gives a feeling of positivity and a sense of independent life of the city. Unusual for the time mechanics, which is expressed in the interaction of objects in the vicinity of the character, the change in the growth of Joseph and a complete lack of dialogue. The soundtrack deserves special mention. To listen to it forever. It is so beautiful that takes your mind straight to Machinarium, and your imagination just explodes. It also blends perfectly with real life. Listen to the song ""The Bottom"" or ""Mr. Handagote"" and watch the bustling city, just great.Puzzles also did not disappoint. They are funny, interesting and sometimes challenging. Will have to break your head a little bit, but it's worth it. Of course, the developers have simplified the game and after the passage of a small scrolling shooter, you can spy hints at this level. But I assure you, to do everything yourself - a lot of fun. Go back to the game and to pass it on a new, never get bored. She always looks fresh and breathtaking. I replayed it for the umpteenth time since its release and purchase the disc, and it is October 2009. 7 years, the game is not removed from my computer.Well, go ahead! Who knows what the outcome of Your little adventure?The game is definitely worth the money. And I hope, one day, will be its continuation.OVER9000 small Josefov out of 10.			"

												This game was a breath of fresh air. Beautiful, charming, leisurely, and thoughtful, Machinarium continued to surprise me all the way until the end. It's definitely worth the price. I recommend giving it a try.The only warning I have for you, is that this game can feel slow. If you want high action, you can try a different game for now, but if you ever feel like you want to curl up, wrap yourself in a blanket, and settle in for a pleasant experience, Machinarium is waiting. Machinarium welcomes you.			"

This is the first game he has actually helped with, and, so far, we've avoided looking at guides or using the 'tip' button.I got it on sale with a bundle (humble indie?) -- if you see it for cheap, scoop it up even though it is a flash game.

												The visual style of this point'n'click adventure game is fantastic and the art really makes exploring the world thoroughly enjoyable, but for me the music is the real gem in this game. Categorize it how you want (I choose ambient/downtempo) - the sound track is perfectly enjoyable all on its own and well worth the money you pay for the whole game.Little Robot is unceremoniously dumped out of his city and has to figure out how to get back inside and find his girlfriend. The puzzles are great, the hint system subtle yet useful, and some of the problems fiendishly difficult (without being impossible or incomprehensible).If you're the type of person who thinks completing a game is the only point, then stay away from this brain-teaser. (Using the walk-through it will take you a few hours to complete). But if you enjoy thinking, are happy to get stuck and leave the game alone for a night or two whilst you think what you could do, and prepared to use your grey matter, then buy this. Now.			"

												This is an extremely special point-and-click adventure game.The strange, metallic fantasy world is delivered by a perfectly blended art-style and ambient, electronic soundtrack. The story is told abstractly, without dialog, but remains engaging. You'll always want to know what happens next.By the end, you will feel an emotional connection to the robotic main characters; which is a real testament to the developers' game-crafting ability.			"

												Machinarium is a pretty awesome point and click adventure game. The art style is reminiscent of some sort of Tim Burton film, eerie looking yet somewhat cool at the same time. The puzzles themselves have stumped me more times than not, but they made me crave for more. It is certainly for those who want to think outside of the box and get those cogs moving in your brain. The great thing about this game is that it has helped me decrease the size of my brain tumor. If you herp derp, do not play this game. Go play some easy game like Call of Duty.			"

												This is easily one of the best puzzle games ever made, and definitely my favorite for this category. If you're looking for a tough puzzle game that has both incredibly art, and beautiful music, then this is the game for you. This point and click puzzle game will get you to think, and even though at times you may feel frustrated, the game puts a help book (mini-game included to unlock it) to help you on your journey if need be.I'd highly recommend anybody to buy this. Even when it's not on sale, it's still very affordable to buy. Do not forget to grab the soundtrack with it however, because it's definitely something you won't want to miss out on after playing through it. I nominate this game for the Test of Time award, because even though I've played this game over 5 times, I still have a lot of fun. I never fully remember how to do the puzzles, which keeps the game fresh everytime I play it, and even if I can speed through some of them, the cute story, incredibly visuals, and music just keep me going.10/10			"

												Cute, funny, and with a unique art style.In many games of this genre, you can get stuck because you didn't think of doing a totally unpredictable and illogical action. You then get frustrated and either give up or google for the solution. This game is not frustrating like that. It is designed in a way where the visuals give you subtle hints, an I never felt like ""how could I possibly have known that?!?"".Machinarium also has an in-game hint system, where you can get more hints and not the solution outright.From all the point-and-click games I've played, I give this game my highest recommendation.Don't leave this for too long in your backlog!

												Greastest game ever made. Soundtrack is beautiful. Art is stunning. The depth in this game is impalpable, but so simplistic at the same time. This game will give you a sense of how vast our world is, what is to come and how much we as humans don't know. The characters speak so loud and true, yet the world of Machinarium has no vernacular at all. Once you play this game, you are egulfed into a world of wondrous glee then petrified with a horrid layer of truthful saddness. Machinarium is a must play.10/10			"

												This is the best point and click adventure game I have ever played. It took me about 23-24 hours to complete. The puzzles are very interesting and challenging and I like a good challenge. The artwork is amazing and the gameplay is loads of fun. If you do ever get stuck, there is a pretty good hint system but I wouldn't rely on it, it's so much more satisfying to actually figure the puzzles out yourself. I could play this game forever without getting bored so it did not matter how long it took me to complete a puzzle. I highly recommend this game! ^_^			"

												Machinarium is lots of fun and highly enjoyable. I love the art style and the puzzles. If you get stuck, there's a book of hints to help you out. The hints aren't free, though. You have to play a little minigame which makes you work for it, which is a nice little twist so you don't reach for the solution immediately. The storyline was engaging and had a satisfying ending. Sneaking around the city was a lot of (often mischievous) fun. The music and excellent art really set the mood, and despite all the grunge, it's quite playful. All in all, Machinarium is wonderful game and absolutely deserves all its awards. I like this game so much, I've even played it twice. Great for all ages.			"

												Machinarium is a very hard puzzle game that i sometimes have to cheat my way through. The storyline is very intresting and so is the scenery. If you have an ipad or an android tablet i would really consider getting this game on those devices, the pc version is not necessary unless you dont have tablet. The puzzles in this game are very difficult and thats if and only if you dont have the internet, but i really dont recommend using the internet all the time, so only use it if you really need to. This game features: Diffucult puzzles in every level, and artistic cartoon detail quality. Only get this game if you have an ipad or a android tablet if not then its ok on the PC but this game is something you play now and then.Cost: $10 (PC) $5 (Ipad) $4 (Android tablet)Rating: 61/100 Fair			"

The puzzles are well thought out and had me stumped quite a few times, but that just makes you feel that much better when you figure them out (it was such a good feeling when I figured out the greenhouse puzzle!). The last puzzle was a little frustrating because the notes didn't sound the same as the solution, but overall a charming game with a cute story and lovely art/music.10/10 would spend 30 minutes working through a 5 minute puzzle again			"

												Excellent, Beautiful and original adventure set in the old-school point & click style. The comical animations, emotive personalities of the characters through imagery alone, and incredible backdrops all hand-drawn to extremely high quality finish combined with a humorous and engaging storyline clearly outline the level of attention to detail and an affectionate amount of dedication from developers.Machinarium is a great title for those who seek a more cerebral, perhaps slower-paced gameplay than many of the frustrating arcade games around. The puzzles are clearly described and visible clues help to keep on the right track, so there's little chance of being utterly 'stuck'. Even in such situations, there is a buiilt-in diagramatic walkthrough guide for every puzzle that requires a fun little mini-game to view.At such a bargain price, you can't really go wrong with this game. I wholeheartedly recommend Machinarium to any fans of puzzles/adventure games or just gamers in general who seek something a little different...			"

And then I got laid and everything was fine.

It's clever puzzles and breath-taking atmosphere make it a worthwhile addition to any adventure gamer's collection.Seriously.Buy this game.If you have a heart anywhere in your body, you'll love it.

Uninstalled the game after playing it for a short while.  However the soundtrack is fantastic.  If I had heard the soundtrack anywhere else and didn't know it was from a game I still would have purchased it. When game soundtracks are available for sale it would be nice if they could be purchased separately from the game.   I'm sure that would help out the composer and encourage better game music.			"

												Why did I wait so long before playing this little gem? It's beautiful in every way. The aesthetics, the music, the story... So many adorable scenes and funny and memorable characters, despite the fact that nobody speaks a word.I also enjoyed the fact that it's quite short, and I finished it in one go.Do yourself a favor, play this game, then buy the soundtrack, fall in love with Floex's beautiful composition and search his albums at Minority Records.Just like I learned how to love Double Fine, I'm loving Amanita Design. Will look forward to play other games from them!			"

												It's a point-and-click game. The pace is very slow because it is pretty much one long puzzle. Plot, character development, and drama are all minimal.This game tests your ability to patiently observe your surroundings and connect the dots. Everything is laid out clearly but if you aren't paying attention you can spend a lot of time searching for a plunger and feeling dumb once you find it.Casual though it is, I recommend playing with your wits about you and rested rather than just before you go to sleep.Overall the game is not difficult, but there were a few moments when I was utterly stumped and relied on the in-game hint system.If you are looking for something different and somewhat lonely Machinarium fills that niche nicely.

												This is how point and click adventure games should be. The graphics and soundtrack are beautiful; the characters are given depth and emotion without ever speaking a word; the puzzles are clever and varied, and their goals are properly communicated without obvious hints being dropped. Item combinations are intuitive and simple, and generally the only hitch is finding out how to get one of the items required.If at any point a puzzle solution or a goal completely evades you, there are buttons that either give you a hint, or outright tell you the solution (the cost being that you have to play a cute and simple mini game every time you want to check or re-check the solution).Telltale games could learn a lesson or two from this game.

												I've had my eye on this one for a long time, but being a massive tight♥♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to games, I wasn't going to pay $30 for it. Managed to grab it during the Steam Christmas sale, and without a word of a lie, after having played just a couple of hours of it I started to regret not buying the colectors edition (in a pretty tin ie. Halo2) from those stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at EB. The animations are stunning, and the score is perfectly suited to the game, to the point where rather than♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off while you're trying to solve puzzles that make you feel like you should be licking the closest window, you actually take the time to listen to them (perfect example is the band puzzle - one of them has a ♥♥♥♥ing didge!) The flash interface is a little rage worthy sometimes, but it's usually just because you're getting angry that you're too much of a spud to solve a puzzle without cheating. Don't play it when you're tired, it takes brain power.			"

												Years after I played this game, and you know I'm still thinking about it.Machinarium, a point-and-click, third-person adventure game made entirely in flash by a Czech game company.It's a beautiful world full of robots and mechanical equipment. Even the decaying equipment is beautiful to look at. If you like Myst-style adventures, The Neverhood, or games to test your mind instead of your trigger finger, try this one!The puzzles are the ideal balance between inventory, environment, and logic. There is no pixel-hunting here--everything you need is out in the open, you just have to decide how to use it. As you progress, the story gradually becomes clear, and your actions have a purpose. The puzzles are fair and make perfect sense. They never feel like contrived devices to delay the player, but are part of the world. Sometimes they're even fun distractions.As if that weren't enough, the soundtrack is outstanding!The characters are memorable long after finishing the game. The simple story is fun to discover. The puzzles are challenging, but never unfair. It's the perfect balance of humor, challenge, puzzle and action. Check it out!			"

												Your usual adventure game but with a catch. There's no text in the whole game, relying mostly on visuals to tell its basic story and hint what do do next. The latter is the true challenge of the game, which is not new in this genre, but several puzzles will make you go in circles. Fortunately you have a minigame that if beated, it will give you the full playthrough of the screen you're in, so you can work a little extra to get the solution rather just googling it.The game works in flash and that's probably its main problem. The game runs well, but some inputs can be rough specially as the character has a very limited area to interact with. There's also some puzzles that might feel the game becomes either bugged or unresponsive, so better double check before making assumptions.If you figure out all its puzzles Machinarium is actually pretty short. But due how vague the game is hinting the next step as well the limited interaction range will force you into, is not a game that you can beat by just clicking everything until the character walks into it.

												This is a quaint and short adventure game in which you control a little robot as he tries to uncover an evil scheme. This game takes a little getting used to at first, but once you familiarise yourself with the interface you will not find it too hard to play. One of the nicest features of this particular adventure game is the 'guide book'. If you become stuck, you can play a short minigame to access the guide book which will tell you exactly what to do. That might make it sound a little easy; but the thing is, while the book is open you cannot see the rest of the screen; and whenever you close the book, you must replay the minigame to reopen it. This game is definitely worth checking out, although at $20 it seems a little steep given how short it is.			"

												I first played the demo and greatly enjoyed it. The graphics are gorgeous and the characters are incredibly cute. I particularly enjoyed the sounds the characters make and the way they communicate with each other.The mechanics are really neat but I kept forgetting that you can make your robot crouch down or extend its body.The puzzles can be a bit confusing. They're not super hard but it can be tricky to figure out what things are supposed to be and do. I still don't understand the clock tower and I got stuck on the lift for ages. Some puzzles require you to act quickly but they're far from impossible.The robot can give you hints as to what needs to be done and if you need more help you can play a mini game to reveal instructions.The ending was very disappointing to me. It was never really clear what the story was from the beginning or what the little robot was hoping to do but it didn't matter. The atmosphere, graphics and adorable little robots were enough to make it an amazing experience. I especially enjoyed retrieving instruments for a band of musicians and listening to them play.The ending explains what the story was and how your robot ended up on the garbage heap where the game starts and you have to defeat the main bad guys, but it feels very anticlimactic. I think it would feel better if you knew what you were trying to accomplish from the beginning or if it was at least hinted at during the game.The way it plays out you're just controlling a robot who wanders around a city and helps other robots who have been the victims to a pair of robot bullies. Then suddenly an evil master plot is revealed, you defeat the bad guy, and the game has ended.The ending was the only thing in the game I didn't enjoy, though. All in all it's an incredibly charming and very enjoyable game.			"

												Loved it. I'm that kind of annoying person who only writes bad reviews (albeit constructively). It's not because I give everything bad reviews, but because I only ever feel the drive to write a review when I'm angry that sellers stole my money. I feel like I have to write a good review for Machinarium, though. Knowing that this masterpiece will stay in my Steam account forever, for only £2.09 (70% sale) makes me a happy buyer. It's an artistic game, and what an atmosphere it has, too. Out of all the games I've played in my lifetime, this might be the one most deserving of a 'puzzle game' categorisation. There are puzzles within puzzles. Basically, everything's a puzzle. There's a lot of backtracking to be done to solve certain puzzles, and that's why the game is of a decent length. There aren't many areas in the game, but each area is detailed with care, and most of the areas have to be revisited a number of times. I don't mind this, at all. I've grown to really like the areas in which this game is set, and I got really comfortable and confident with the map. I knew how to get where quite easily, and also, whenever I found or earned a new artefact, I tended to know just where to use it eg. which door it will open, even if that door is relatively far away. The cartooney scrap metal theme, with robots mimicking human life was done brilliantly. It shows that the developers put a lot of time and care into that. Add that to the downtemp/IDM (I think?) soundtrack and you have a brilliant atmosphere. It's also  worth noting that this game is rather funny. The humour was also something that the developers seem to have put a lot of thought into. Although the humour is generally subtle, it will make you laugh out loud if you like the right kind of humour for it, and not too common for it to get old. One flaw I found in this game is that the puzzles are a bit too hard sometimes. As a person who's against ever using guides to beat games, even puzzle games, I'm not ashamed to admit that I did use guides on certain occasions here, and I never regretted it. Rather than thinking ""Oh, no! It was that obvious all along!"", I was more like, ""How was I supposed to know that I should do THAT? I wish I checked a guide an hour ago!"". Of course, there are also some puzzles in the game that don't require you to have to figure out what artefact you have to find where to open what, and more obvious puzzles that require skill (and hair-tearing), like doing actual puzzles on game machines to earn coins. These were genuinely really hard and required a lot of time (and similar stuff... people who beat the game will know what I'm talking about). I was not ashamed to use guides to beat these puzzles. I would never in a million years accept to try and do those by myself, they're not worth it. Anyway, I don't want to end this review on a bad note, so I'll just end it by saying that I loved this game. It's different and great. If watching trailers and looking at pictures got you interested in buying this, then buy it! Chances are, it will exceed your expectations like it did mine! :)			"

The seemingly perfect blend of fine-tuned challenge and whimsical and wholly immersive environments makes this game a tall, refreshing order of distilled enjoyment. However, the relatively short completion time and low replay value make it a game better suited to those with a few extra bucks to burn.			"

												I love the art in this game. I enjoyed walking through the many screens and seeing all sorts of neat things, especially the robots. The animation is both charming and hilarious. The sound direction is pretty great too, especially the music played after solving a particular series of puzzles.Gameplay-wise, Machinarium is a point-and-click adventure. Most of the puzzles were easy enough to solve without help, though a few left me holding my head for a while. There was only one instance where I could not find the item I needed to progress. Figuring out what to do next was usually no problem due to a helpful ""idea bubble"" button, and there's also an INCREDIBLY WELL-ILLUSTRATED built-in walkthrough just in case.The plot is minimal, in a good way. The lack of verbal dialogue added to the game's charm. I finished the game in just under 4 hours.Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play an elegantly simple, stylistically astounding adventure game.			"

												Machinarium is a fun little game. It's full of puzzles and has a really interesting little world of robots to explore. It can be pretty easy to get lost sometimes though because sometimes your objectives aren't clear. You also have to keep a sharp eye out because some things can be missed pretty easily. There's a good bit of running around back and forth when you're tying to figure things out, but if you get truly stuck the game actually has a walkthrough built inside of it. If you like puzzles and cute robots Machinarium is worth a try. The art is pretty and has a nice sketchy look to it. Plus some of the little robot's reminiscing is   pretty funny. If you liked Botanicula it's made by the same guys so you'll probably like it.			"

												The game has overall cute if - at some time - repetitive animations (when letting the main charater just sitting there) or having him perform a task. Also remarkable is the hand-drawn scenary at every single screen (there're so much details drawn to match the ambiance).That's combined with increasing difficulty at small technical and logical riddles (say: minigames) all along the way to the goal where it started to go all wrong - that much for revealing the background story.Most of the time you'll have to complete a string of actions before getting to the next screen and more often to solve some brain-teasers to proceed.The real task is mostly to understand what's the goal of the minigame before accomplishing it since there're only abstract hints to the task: one for free by clicking the bulb following an animated film to get  the global picture (rather than having the whole solution picture-wise after sucessfully shooting from a key at lots of moving spiders hanging from a thread).

												If you love puzzle games, or point and click. This is the perfect game for you.This game is a very well put together puzzle game mixed with Point and click.The artstyle is fantastic, the puzzles are equally dificult. Some are easy to figure out, while others leave you scratching your head, wondering what to do. The story in this game is very clear, even though not a single word is spoken throughout the entire game. It's cheap, and may only grant you one or maybe two playthroughs, but i would definitely recommed this game.The music is another thing about the game that is great. You have the option to turn it off, but throughout my nearly 3 hour playthrough of the game, i didn't. I never found it to be annoying or anything like that.The interface is great, very simplistic and minimalistic, but very easy to navigate.It gives you a very easy to follow on how to play the game and use the games different mechanics.I can only recommend this game. Do check it out!			"

So many adorable scenes and funny and memorable characters, despite the fact that nobody speaks a word.I also enjoyed the fact that it's quite short, and I finished it in one go.Do yourself a favor, play this game, then buy the soundtrack, fall in love with Floex's beautiful composition and search his albums at Minority Records.Just like I learned how to love Double Fine, I'm loving Amanita Design.

												This is not a game. This is interactive art.Machinarium is among the legendary independent games along with Braid and Limbo.  It was designed by Amanita games, which is known to make similar point&click adventure games.The nameless protagonist of the game is a tin can robot who sets off for journey to find and rescue his girlfriend in a mesmerising machine city, that is Machinarium. You progress through the machine metropolis receiving quests and solving clever puzzles accompanied by stunning visuals and absolutely beautiful soundtrack. You can sense so much love and effort went into both the visual and auditory compenents of the game. I don't know how this game could be made any betterThis is a masterpiece. There are very few games that was able to come this close to perfection.(My one and only slating is about the stubbornness of the developers of not launching their products in Linux including the upcoming Samarost 3 in Q1 2016)			"

												Very fun animation and world. The puzzles are from easy to very hard (for me). If you love digging your brain to find the solution, then this is your game.The hints are rare, even non existent. I had to use the help of a walk-through at couple of occasions, because anything I did, didn't work. I hat using walk-through to finish a game.It would of been more fun if the hints were more user friendly.I still recommend the game. Was fun.			"

												Nice point-and-click/puzzle game. The art style and created atmosphere are the biggest attractors of this game. Puzzles are clever and on average a bit less random than some other point-and-click games can be, most combinations are logical.HOWEVER, the game is made in Flash and that causes some serious issues you have to deal with. The interface is clunky and saving and loading games can sometimes not work. I have had my saves get lost after system reboots, Flash updates etc. There are some workarounds, like manually copying your save files, but they are a bit of a hassle.			"

												This game is short and sweet. It's very pleasant and enjoyable.However, the logic used to solve some of these is absolutely ridiculous. Sometimes, I just sit back and scratch my head trying to figure out what the developers were thinking when they came up with ways to get around some of the problems you face in this game.But once you've solved a puzzle or two, you can figure out where to go in the next few puzzles.Also, it glitched out at the part with the cat that you electrify. For the longest time, my cat didn't work. I thought I was doing the puzzle wrong, so I looked up a walkthrough only to realize I was doing it correctly. When I went back to the spot where I picked up the passed-out cat, another one was lying on the ground there, even though it was already in my inventory. I picked it up again, and it worked to solve the problem after that.8/10, in my opinion.			"

												We have just completed Machinarium, my 4 year old daughter and me, and if a game can be considered a work of art then this could rightly claim to be one.  Machinarium delivers on all accounts. An engrossing and satisfying puzzle and adventure.  Its scenes richly detailed in equistite detail through its illustrative backgrounds and beautul rendering. Robot characters that have more soul and character than robots have any right to possess. Its games within games that challenge and could be considered orginal in themselves. And a soundtrack that pulls everything together, part ambient electronica, part sound effects, part Radiohead - genius.			"

Or when you get stuck and walk back and forth doing the same actions over and over expecting a different result. It's kind of like life in that respect.

												A great, adventure, point-and-click game. If you're looking into this game, get ready for an adventure. You've gotta set yourself in the mindset to be ready to plunge into the world Machinarium presents. It's a really immersive world where you really feel like a part of the story, despite how minimally and beautifully it is told.Technical stuff: The art is great, the puzzles and puzzle difficulty scale really well. It starts off where you can be in a room and complete it with what you can find in your immediate environment, but after a while, you've got to explore a bit. It really gives a sense of progression, and gives you a sense of being a part of a huge world.			"

												This little flash based game, be it the futuristic music or the beautiful graphics, is a true work of art.  Also there are no long and annoying dialogues which usually can turn an adventure game into a frustrating event;  instead of verbal dialogues all forms of communication are graphical.  Plus, for those who get stuck, the game has a built in illustrated walkthrough for each level, which can be unlocked by playng a short and simple mini-game. The only downside, imo, is that some of the puzzles can be solved only through pure luck and guessing, and not logic, but that is where the built in walkthrough comes to the rescue.  All in all this is a gem of a game that every collector should have in their archive, especially those who want to give their support to independant game makers.			"

It's not for the casual puzzle solver.  Though I appreciate not having to go to the internet to figure it out, I would have appreciated it if I didn't have to resort to peeking at the solution.  I just couldn't handle being stuck at the game and leaving it unfinished.Nevertheless, it's a really nice little game that's worth the trouble just to see through till the end.Completed in 12.2 hours.

Является по праву одной из лучших игр 2009 года по версиям различных игровых сайтов, как за рубежом, так и у нас.Ещё понравилось то, что игра абсолютно не нуждается в переводе.

												Brilliant P&C adventure. One of the best. Great soundtrack and 2d visuals. Contains all the humor P&Cs are known for without any of the text. Adds many great features that modern P&Cs should have: taking away useless inventory items, giving a general clue for every room, giving an in game walkthrough for those who are truly stumped, and mixing in challenging puzzles that are simple in concept. The downsides? It's a flash game, so resolution options are terribly limited and wiping your brower data can erase your save. Also, the robot moves too slow/no fastforward or skipping.			"

												I first played the demo and greatly enjoyed it. The graphics are gorgeous and the characters are incredibly cute. I particularly enjoyed the sounds the characters make and the way they communicate with each other.The mechanics are really neat but I kept forgetting that you can make your robot crouch down or extend its body.The puzzles can be a bit confusing. They're not super hard but it can be tricky to figure out what things are supposed to be and do. I still don't understand the clock tower and I got stuck on the lift for ages. Some puzzles require you to act quickly but they're far from impossible.The robot can give you hints as to what needs to be done and if you need more help you can play a mini game to reveal instructions.The ending was very disappointing to me. It was never really clear what the story was from the beginning or what the little robot was hoping to do but it didn't matter. The atmosphere, graphics and adorable little robots were enough to make it an amazing experience. I especially enjoyed retrieving instruments for a band of musicians and listening to them play.The ending explains what the story was and how your robot ended up on the garbage heap where the game starts and you have to defeat the main bad guys, but it feels very anticlimactic. I think it would feel better if you knew what you were trying to accomplish from the beginning or if it was at least hinted at during the game.The way it plays out you're just controlling a robot who wanders around a city and helps other robots who have been the victims to a pair of robot bullies. Then suddenly an evil master plot is revealed, you defeat the bad guy, and the game has ended.The ending was the only thing in the game I didn't enjoy, though. All in all it's an incredibly charming and very enjoyable game.			"

												Loved it. I'm that kind of annoying person who only writes bad reviews (albeit constructively). It's not because I give everything bad reviews, but because I only ever feel the drive to write a review when I'm angry that sellers stole my money. I feel like I have to write a good review for Machinarium, though. Knowing that this masterpiece will stay in my Steam account forever, for only £2.09 (70% sale) makes me a happy buyer. It's an artistic game, and what an atmosphere it has, too. Out of all the games I've played in my lifetime, this might be the one most deserving of a 'puzzle game' categorisation. There are puzzles within puzzles. Basically, everything's a puzzle. There's a lot of backtracking to be done to solve certain puzzles, and that's why the game is of a decent length. There aren't many areas in the game, but each area is detailed with care, and most of the areas have to be revisited a number of times. I don't mind this, at all. I've grown to really like the areas in which this game is set, and I got really comfortable and confident with the map. I knew how to get where quite easily, and also, whenever I found or earned a new artefact, I tended to know just where to use it eg. which door it will open, even if that door is relatively far away. The cartooney scrap metal theme, with robots mimicking human life was done brilliantly. It shows that the developers put a lot of time and care into that. Add that to the downtemp/IDM (I think?) soundtrack and you have a brilliant atmosphere. It's also  worth noting that this game is rather funny. The humour was also something that the developers seem to have put a lot of thought into. Although the humour is generally subtle, it will make you laugh out loud if you like the right kind of humour for it, and not too common for it to get old. One flaw I found in this game is that the puzzles are a bit too hard sometimes. As a person who's against ever using guides to beat games, even puzzle games, I'm not ashamed to admit that I did use guides on certain occasions here, and I never regretted it. Rather than thinking ""Oh, no! It was that obvious all along!"", I was more like, ""How was I supposed to know that I should do THAT? I wish I checked a guide an hour ago!"". Of course, there are also some puzzles in the game that don't require you to have to figure out what artefact you have to find where to open what, and more obvious puzzles that require skill (and hair-tearing), like doing actual puzzles on game machines to earn coins. These were genuinely really hard and required a lot of time (and similar stuff... people who beat the game will know what I'm talking about). I was not ashamed to use guides to beat these puzzles. I would never in a million years accept to try and do those by myself, they're not worth it. Anyway, I don't want to end this review on a bad note, so I'll just end it by saying that I loved this game. It's different and great. If watching trailers and looking at pictures got you interested in buying this, then buy it! Chances are, it will exceed your expectations like it did mine! :)			"

												Excellent game, one of my favorite point-and-clicks! I love the main character, the way the story is presented, and the world it takes place in; also I would have deeply regretted not getting the soundtrack. My only two complaints is that the nuts and bolts tic-tac-toe minigame is always impossible for me to win without a guide, and I find a part of the main story to be a bit cliche (a damsel in distress situation).

												Machinarium is a pretty awesome point and click adventure game. The art style is reminiscent of some sort of Tim Burton film, eerie looking yet somewhat cool at the same time. The puzzles themselves have stumped me more times than not, but they made me crave for more. It is certainly for those who want to think outside of the box and get those cogs moving in your brain. The great thing about this game is that it has helped me decrease the size of my brain tumor. If you herp derp, do not play this game. Go play some easy game like Call of Duty.			"

I'd definitely recommend this those newer to point-and-click adventures, due to the well intergrated hint system, but there's enough variation in here for most people to enjoy.Best part: I loved the mini-games that broke up the usual game-play.Minor gripe: the character movement is a little slow, so traversing multiple areas (as you sometimes need to do) can be tedious. Definitely worth getting :)			"

												I couldn't want to anti-recommend a stylish adventure puzzle game more than I anti-recommend Machinarium. The style and atmosphere is brillliant, if I could just get a puzzle game in it that doesn't ruin the whole thing.If you want a hint you get to play a pissant mini-game that is so easy it's just a time sink, one that's especially frustrating if you manage to screw it up because you were so bored with it you weren't paying attention. When you're through with the half-minute of mindless tedium you get a cell by cell comic for a hint, cool, except that IT IS NOT A HINT IT'S A COMPLETE SPOILER FOR THAT WHOLE ROOM! The kicker is, the art work of the spoiler page is so cool, it's almost worth going through the minigame, after you've managed to solve the thing yourself, just to see it. The whole deal spoils the pacing of what was proving to be a charming story.So many interactable items just blend into the background. Out of the first 6 or so rooms. I needed to go through the spoiler process THREE TIMES to find out how the hell I was supposed to do exactly what I already knew I needed to do. Knowing what to do is simple, mindbogglingly easy. Actually clicking the correct thing that blends into the background to be able to do it... 3/5			"

												Years after I played this game, and you know I'm still thinking about it.Machinarium, a point-and-click, third-person adventure game made entirely in flash by a Czech game company.It's a beautiful world full of robots and mechanical equipment. Even the decaying equipment is beautiful to look at. If you like Myst-style adventures, The Neverhood, or games to test your mind instead of your trigger finger, try this one!The puzzles are the ideal balance between inventory, environment, and logic. There is no pixel-hunting here--everything you need is out in the open, you just have to decide how to use it. As you progress, the story gradually becomes clear, and your actions have a purpose. The puzzles are fair and make perfect sense. They never feel like contrived devices to delay the player, but are part of the world. Sometimes they're even fun distractions.As if that weren't enough, the soundtrack is outstanding!The characters are memorable long after finishing the game. The simple story is fun to discover. The puzzles are challenging, but never unfair. It's the perfect balance of humor, challenge, puzzle and action. Check it out!			"

Managed to grab it during the Steam Christmas sale, and without a word of a lie, after having played just a couple of hours of it I started to regret not buying the colectors edition (in a pretty tin ie. Halo2) from those stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at EB. The animations are stunning, and the score is perfectly suited to the game, to the point where rather than♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off while you're trying to solve puzzles that make you feel like you should be licking the closest window, you actually take the time to listen to them (perfect example is the band puzzle - one of them has a ♥♥♥♥ing didge!) The flash interface is a little rage worthy sometimes, but it's usually just because you're getting angry that you're too much of a spud to solve a puzzle without cheating.

 Machinarium So.. Machinarium.. This is really one of those games that allready has so many positive reviews that it might not need another one. But here it goes:Machinarium is set to a universe where there seems to be no humans. Instead there is machines building machines. As you can see from the screenshots posted on the store page of the game, it almost seems like it takes place in a junkyard, where the living machines often are built from scrap metal. Even tho these are machines and don't speak, they have character, and show emotions. Gameplay & Stroy:Machinarium follows the old and well known point and click game mechanic. It is a story driven adventure/puzzle game, that has a rather serious story, but manages to add humor to it on several places.The story captured me from the very first moment that i started playing this. I don't want to ruin the story for those who haven't played this yet, so im not going to cover any part of the story in this review.As mention above, the characters in Machinarium don't speak, but they show thinking boubles above their head and make noises (an alternative way to give the player hints about what they need to do next). This method, in my opinion works very well. Puzzles: I have played many puzzle games and i have to say that for me, this was kind of perfect in terms of difficulty. Many puzzle games tend to become to confusing when they try to make it a big and challenging game. Like having a big area with lots and lots of things to interact with, without a single clue on what to do next. Machinarium manages to give you a lot of different options on what to interact with, but at the same time you get enough hints on what your goal is that you for example knows that you have to do someting with this item, just not what. Level design:The levels in Machinarium are great actually. There is a lot of variations and different enviroments through out the game. They also made the levels in a way that you get a feeling of a big living world even outside of the playable areas. You still have to remember that this is a sideview game with limited possibilities of movement. Still, there is depth in the levels, so you can for example walk away and towards the camera. Nostalgia:For me these kinds of games gives me some nostalgia from the time around 2001-2006 when i used to play games like these on flash sites all the time. There is something ""calming"" about sitting there without any stress, and figuring out these sorts of games. Of course Machinarium is more polished, longer and better than most free flash games out there.Bugs & Crashes:So far in my review, i've only said positive things about Machinarium. But as many other games before it, Machinarium suffers when it comes to bugs and crashes. I experienced several times during my playthrough that the games just froze with a black screen. I still could hear the music but i had to close it through task manager and restart it to keep playing. I also experienced that the game just closed for no apparent reason, and sometimes while playing and i clicked on something, nothing happened in-game. But since this is a very small game in terms of size, and that it practically doesn't require anything to run, it took me seconds to restart and be back in it. Conclusion:Machinarium is a great game, really. If you like story driven puzzle games i would recommend you to get this.			"

												I loves me a good adventure game and the best adventure games have the following blend...a likeable character, a great story, and great puzzles.  If we can agree on that criteria, Machinarium is just about the perfect adventure game.  It's also one of the funniest games I've ever played and there isn't a single word of dialogue that you have to read or listen to.Short and sweet, intentionally humorous (as opposed to being humorous as a side effect of being badly designed), and even heart warming...Machinarium is a recent entry into the genre but already one of my all time favorites.

												What to say... Inspired me to so much! Very artistic - in a dusty, robotic aesthetic -, the game itself was surprisingly difficult by the end (as in not too easy)... lovely! The two downsides for me were the un-longevity of the game, if I may say so, and the second one was that sometimes the point-and-clicking was a bit too detailed, as in you knew where and what you wanted to click on but the mouse always seemed to not reach it.I just wish there was more to play..!

												I love this game. I bought it years ago because the artwork intrigued me. I played it for a little while, but set it aside, but it had always stuck with me. Today, I started it up again, and I didn't stop until I was finished with it. I love point and click adventure games, but I'm not great at solving puzzles, really. For me, feeling in a casual mood, the puzzles were just challening enough, and the little hint dynamic definitely came in handy. Mostly, though, the game and its atmosphere is just wonderful. The artwork is amazingly detailed, and the style makes rust and decay seem charming. I don't think there is a forgettable character in the entire cast, and they are animated wonderfully. The music is great. It complements the game incredibly well, and it's nice to listen to even as an album. The replacement of dialog with animated pictorial thought bubbles is a novel choice, and makes for a fun narrative that doesn't require any reading.I really can't think of any drawbacks to Machinarium. It was just what I wanted to fill a leisurely afternoon with an amusing and heartfelt single-sitting game.			"

It's rich art style and marked isolationism makes it a charming adventure to top of this indie bundle.  The player will most-definitely, at all times, feel completely alone throughout the adventure.  Luckily, the threats aren't directed at the player at all, and it illustrates nothing more than a lost soul wandering through a seemingly-moving, but stagnant world.It's a 3.5/5.			"

												I can only suggest this game if you have the patience for point and click adventures. I can say I got about 90% done before I got to a point where I felt like I NEEDED a FAQ to get past - I would have to remember a very hard to remember tone to make a ladder appear, that disappears within seconds, plus a hard ...Node dragging? puzzle and having to find some way to get the girl back with a fan. Some of that I could probably take care of, but I got irritated once I met the tone puzzle. I love the look of Amanita games, but hate how thier design affects gameplay, making solutions seems very obscure.			"

Machinarium is a very artistic and difficult point and click game about robots. There are plenty of funny moments with the way your character interacts with the environment and the antagonists are explained through visual representations. There is one hint per area that was helpful. There is also a book that will show everything that needs to be done in that area after you finish a minigame to earn that information. I am recommending this game for people who have patience for it's difficulty, enjoy great artwork, and like a steampunk/robotic themed world..			"

You'll probably play through it 8 hours tops, I played through it within a day, but will definately re-play in the future when I've forgotten how to solve the puzzles :)Edit: It's also suitable for all ages and child friendly, however younger players will most probably need help completing it.

Do robots dream of electric sheep?City robots Mashinarium, smelling of oil and covered with rust, live the life of a giant mechanism. You would never think that the same vending machine for batteries is also a robot! Originally posted by Jakub Dvorsky: - It happened on a distant and forgotten planet, where people used to send the garbage that they were producing old machines, mechanisms, computers, etc. This mechanical scrap was formed a few simple robots. Some time later they built other, more advanced robots, and then — settlement. Thus was created the city of Machinarium.  You play as a robot named Josef, Yes, our hero has a name, though it is not mentioned. You mistakenly throw away to the city dump, your girlfriend is kidnapped by the bandit and all around town is in danger! And who do you need to solve these problems? Of course You. Maybe You look funny, but full of resoluteness and courage.And so begins your exciting journey in the city of rusted steel, constantly working mechanisms and sleepless, the most diverse and unusual residents.Machinarium - a game of Czech developer Amanita Design company. Was created by the efforts of only 7 people and was sponsored by savings of developers. Guys, only 7 developers! And the project turned out just beautiful! Won many awards and entered the top 10 of ""Best games of 2009"" and is a game created in Adobe flash. Unlike stamped new games, before, tried to make something different, unique and memorable. In the game everything is fine. Great atmosphere, which is felt not only in the image created manually, but in a beautiful soundtrack. Each composition, each location gives a feeling of positivity and a sense of independent life of the city. Unusual for the time mechanics, which is expressed in the interaction of objects in the vicinity of the character, the change in the growth of Joseph and a complete lack of dialogue. The soundtrack deserves special mention. To listen to it forever. It is so beautiful that takes your mind straight to Machinarium, and your imagination just explodes. It also blends perfectly with real life. Listen to the song ""The Bottom"" or ""Mr. Handagote"" and watch the bustling city, just great.Puzzles also did not disappoint. They are funny, interesting and sometimes challenging. Will have to break your head a little bit, but it's worth it. Of course, the developers have simplified the game and after the passage of a small scrolling shooter, you can spy hints at this level. But I assure you, to do everything yourself - a lot of fun. Go back to the game and to pass it on a new, never get bored. She always looks fresh and breathtaking. I replayed it for the umpteenth time since its release and purchase the disc, and it is October 2009. 7 years, the game is not removed from my computer.Well, go ahead! Who knows what the outcome of Your little adventure?The game is definitely worth the money. And I hope, one day, will be its continuation.OVER9000 small Josefov out of 10.			"

												Cute little point&click with well thought out level design and choices. The puzzles are clever and sometimes a bit hard but the game is still fun, well worth 4€.			"

												This is one of those fun and quirky games that you can easily get into. It's reasonably challenging (for a puzzle game), but never seems to get boring. Definitely on my list of games to re-play in the future.			"

												Simple point and click but i found a few puzzles challenging enough to keep me enterained and it even made me try to use the help guide book.  The art and animation is beautiful along with a solid storyline.			"
