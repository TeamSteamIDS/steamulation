												I'm not entirely sure what the aim of creating this game was. Let me explain;Nothing is explained. Why do you magically zap on to a boat? Why is the crystal on the boat? Why do you need to retrieve it in the first place from the boat and not on Xen? Why were the Xen creatures already there before the resonance cascade?Why?WHY?WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?All of this is completely unanswered, but this is just the start. [Spoilers]Once you magically apear upon the boat, seemingly sent by Zeus, you pickup almost all of the weapons available in the game, instantly making it very easy. If that didn't make it easy enough for you, then you're in luck! Right in front of you is a conveniently placed helicopter, complete with a mounted machine gun, meaning all those Xen creatures are dead before you move 10 metres.Once you finally reach the main cabin, you are greeted by 3 turrets, which are easily avoidable. In fact, there are 100s of better locations for them, which would have proved challenging, however, the creators were obviously not in a creative mood, so decided to place them right in the open, however, they did take the time to ensure even spacing, which was a nice touch.Next, you are inside, where you'll reach the lift, clamber through the overhead opening, and up the tedious ladder, and eventually reach the control deck, where you're warmly greeted by 3 soldiers, seemingly oblivious to the Xen creatures which have engulfed their ship. After this, and a few random Xen creatures which magically appear, you find a man. The soldiers also seemed oblivious to him, which is surprising as he was literally next to them. The man is the most socially awkward NPC I've ever encountered, and was a walk suitable for the Ministry of Silly Walks. He opens a security coded box for you, containing a med kit. This was much needed, as the previous 20 were not quite enough. He the proceeds to open the cargo doors, containing a dangerous creature, which is obviously the best idea. On top of this, he automatically knows why you're there. No questions asked. You then need to BACKTRACK THE WHOLE MAP in order to reach the cargo hold. Of course, it should be a nice brisk walk, after all, you have just defeated all the creatures, right? Wrong. They've respawned, and in seemingly higher numbers. Once you battle your way through the Battle of Somme, you reach the cargo doors. At first, I wasn't sure what to do, as surely if I jump in I'd die? I discovered that jumping in to a gaping dark hole actually heals you, which was a nice surprise.So, the boss fight. Before anything even begins, you get to endure a lovely cutscene where the boss sucks up the crystals, which once again begs the question, why?You've spent the whole game (10 minutes) collecting all the weapons in the game, conserving your ammo, well guess what? They're all gone. You can pickup a few off the floor, but ammo is almost non-existent. The boss itself is, well... interesting. It is a down-sized and retextured version of Nihilanth, and completely lacks any form of animation. To me, it resembles a over-stuffed teddy bear, so stiff that it puts viagra to shame.  Once you've finally defeated him, (Cooked grenades seem to work well),  that's it. That's literally it. The boss shatters like if I picked up your vase and threw it on the ground. Oh and the crystals? Gone. The final credits/cutscene shows the crystals in a different location, which I can only assume is suppose to represent Black Mesa. I don't think I can truly express how underwhelming this game is. The idea of Half-Life: Before is brilliant, but this game, is certainly not brilliant.			"

												This. This is amazing game, really. Not many games gets us into brainstorming about WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  So, if someone didn't get the plot: You're on your mission to stop Gabe Newell's madness. He greenlights alot of horrible games, You make your way trough brainless zombies AKA steam greenlighters that voted for this and probably most of the mobile games that are on steam at this moment. So, after you get trough that and get on captain's desk, you see that ship is under control of INSANE MOD MAKERS, they're trying to get their mod greenlit and nothing going to stop them. Except you. So, after dealing with that, you think it's finally over. But no, the only sane person on this ship reveals himself. They locked that poor guy because he didn't agree on getting this game greenlit. They possibly bullied him, he got terrified, that's why his grammar is so affected. He tells you that Gaben got completely mad, he greenlit ALL of the horrible games out there. Guy opens a ""cavgo doors"" for you, you fall inside just to meet Gaben face to face. Then, you see him. He consumes dorrito and gets very powerful. After that, he tries to lick your private places. But BOOM. You did it. Madness has stopped. No more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ greenlight games on steam. You make dorrito that fell from his exploded belly your trophy. And that's the end. But i got it that it was another demension all along, that's why madness haven't stopped in our world. AND THAT'S WHY THIS GAME IS GREENLIT DAMMNIT			"

												First of all.....what. the. hell. is. this. game? OK, when I saw the name Half-Life: Before, I thought it'd be like a game that has at least 5 ~ 6 missions like those expansion packs of the first Half-Life, but hell, was I wrong. First, story. Does not make any kind of sense. I should say there is no such thing as a story in this. A.I.....horrible. Some zombies don't even move at all, they just stand there like idiots and do nothing. And there are only a few enemies that you can kill. I still kind of remember how many there were still, 6 ~ 7 enemies + one boss. How long does it take to beat this game? 6 MINUTES. 6 FRIGGIN MINUTES, AND THAT INCLUDES WATCHING THE ENTIRE ENDING, TOO.At the beginning, I get my suit and then I fell and died, and all of a sudden I am at the place where there are those enemies. Doesn't make any sense. And then I kill all enemies, and there is a helicopter but it don't do jack **** so I just fall down, as that is the only thing you can do there and that leads to the boss fight, which is pretty ridiculously stupid. Oh, sorry, did I spoil the game. WELL GUESS WHAT, THERE IS NOTHING, I SAY AGAIN, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SPOIL IN THIS.Well, at least the game is free. Yah, but AIN'T WORTH MY 6 MINUTES. Why did they make this? Were they bored like hell? I do not see the point of this game, and I do not see why this game had to be made. 1 out of 10			"

												Was that all? I'm throughly disappointed. The creator could have done a lot better than... this.Two levels that you can blow through in about 10 minutes. Don't tell me that this is actually acceptable. A game gets accepted for Steam, the most popular gaming platform on PC, and this is what we get?The fact that this is called a challenge is nothing short of laughable. It might be the easiest mod I've ever played.There are lots of grammatical errors, too. The developer of this mod's first language isn't English, that's for sure. The least he could've done is get someone to spellcheck.Don't waste your time on this.			"

												What the hell. Seriously. What the hell. Why was this even mentioned on the front page again? From what I could glean from the insane ramblings of the one in-game character and the text that popped up, you are a scientist who has been beamed aboard a ship to retrieve a crystal that does..... Something. I think I have more eyelashes than the game has enemies and there are just enough 'puzzles' to make you briefly consider this a Half-Life Mod and not some trashy Call of Duty flashback. There's a boss, I guess, and I think GMAN is involved, but besides that this is just a mashup of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design and wasted space. The fact that people greenlit this makes me physically ill and I shudder to think what future swill will show up on Steam. Barely any effort, barely any motivation. This mod was free and I still feel cheated. Dear LORD, what is this?!			"

												This is a game everybody must play.Not because it is good, but because it is so horrible, so shockingly subpar that it might well not even be a game at all. Nothing works. The puzzles are extremely easy, any difficulty is artificial (bunches of turrets in an area, 1090123123 damage bullets, what have you), and the AI makes little to no effort to do anything at all.The best part is the final boss, which has zero animatons and just floats around over you. After you beat it (which takes all of twenty seconds), you are treated to the credits, then a game crash.The soundtrack was decent, but the music started and stopped playing at random times for no real reason.Still, play the game. Play it not because it is good, but because it is bad.			"

												A masterpiece that is ahead of it's time.  Only took me like twenty minutes to beat, but in those twenty minutes I also ate a sandwich and some biscuits, which made me enjoy myself.  I eventually stopped paying attention to the game and just ate and ate.  Then I went to the toilet and when I came back I found that I forgot to pause the game and I had died.  Then I alt tabbed out of the game and watched an episode of House of Cards, checked my email, then came back to the game.  Then I shot a thing and won the game.  I then got up out of my seat, walked to the end of my room, then walked back and sat down again.  Also my right shoulder was a bit itchy.Tl;dr 500/4 It's OK -IGN			"

												This game shows literally nothing innovative, the mod says it uses Spirit of Half-Life modifications, but they used it next to nothing they might as well just not add it.The story? Non-existent, if it wasn't for the store description I wouldn't even know what I'm supposed to do, and even with the store description it lacks of everything.Also, this mod makes Gordon Freeman a joke character if you take this mod as canon. Since the final boss is a Nihilant that acts as a Barnacle and is extremely easy to beat.It took me 40 minutes to beat the game, not because the game is that long no! It's because it crashed the game TWICE and I had to start since the beginning all over again, the mod campaign length only lasts like 15 minutes, 10 if you know what to do.I seriously don't recommend playing this mod, I only played it because it's on Steam and thought ""Welp if it's on the Store it might be high quality mod material right there"" and considered the first map (AND ONLY MAP OF THE GAME) just the prologue thinking there's more, oh boy I was wrong.

												Ok. So. Lets imagine this was a free custom map. Nobody hates it . So then, add some custom content including a new pistol (which looks and feels worlds better than those in half life) textures for characters (or rather corpses), scripted sequences, decent music, voice acting and a second level. Now suddenly everyone hates it.Why?Now, I admit that some of the points are valid.It lags. Yes, but that's because in the setting it's raining.The amount of health kits. True, there are way to many health packs, but considering that you have to cross the deck twice, both times being attacked by the fearsome creatures of Xen, I think the developer made a fair assumtion that we would need this many.The boss. I agree. It's crap.The story. I don't think everyone has even thought about it.So. You are aparently in another dimension, yet we spawn in a flash of lightning on a boat. Does anyone remember how the xen monsters spawned? IN A FLASH OF LIGHTNING. How do you think a human would arrive? Also, the boat. Let me insert an extract from the Combine OverWiki.""In addition to this legitimate research, several secret projects are also carried out at Black Mesa, which are deliberately left vague. A large amount of classified research is carried out, including the development of high-tech weapons and defense systems, research into extra-dimensional travel, teleportation, and the study of Xen.""So, we already know that Black mesa have been to other dimensions-is it so far fetched that black mesa have a boat in one of these dimensions? So you travel to this dimension expecting it to be an easy collection; get the test sample and go-hence, you have no weaponry. But, you arrive and everyones dead. Xen creatures have manged to get aboard. How? we don't know You don't know Your character doesn't know nobody knows! But they are here and you have to fight them off. You eventually reach a survivor who opens the CARGO doors for you.And before i finish, i'd like to mention a great scripted event most people have probably overlooked. As you make your way over the deck, you see the gman watching you. Then, just as you get close to the point he's at, you are distracted by some turrtes. You have to destroy them, and when you look back to where the G-man was, he's gone. That's just an example.There is more I could mention, but multiple issues mentioned in other reviews have been cleared up now.If we had to pay as much as a penny for this, I would agree. But we dont. ITS FREE. No price, no problem.			"

												Half-Life: Before looked promising when i saw it at the steam store but sadly in the end it didn't meet up with the expectations. The encounters on the deck were easily avoidable by just running through and it didn't challenge me much other then wonder what is going on storywise. Fights became repetitive after a while that was not a good sign either.The ship map itself was nicely made however and in the 2 playthroughs i went through this game did not encounter any glitches that forced me to reload so when it comes to making maps the people who made this mod deserves some credit. The soundtrack this game had definitly deserves some credit for a job done right aswell, despite of the things this game lacked it created more tension in the athmosphere of the game. Enemy movement however leaves many desires, i encountered enemies who were unable to move properly around the place like they normally would but the final boss takes the grand prize for obvious reasons. This is not a game mod i would recommend for serious playing though it is free to download (Half-Life needed) and there is absolutely no harm in trying it out for yourself and share your thoughts about it.I give my best of luck in the future to the developers of this mod who did their best to create and publish a game mod like this. It might not be an A+ title but we all have to make a beginning somewhere.All the best!(s.i.e)			"

												Looking for an interesting, well polished and fun game? This is not the place.Shorter than most single map mods I've played, Half-Life: Before is a pile of incomplete ideas strung together by a lack of design experience. It really feels as if it's a first attempt at a short story in the Half-Life universe, using Spirit of Half-Life functions in their most basic forms and having a lack of understanding of pacing and difficulty in games. Enemies seem placed only to momentarily prevent progress instead of trying to provide a challenging experience, as weapons and ammo were placed at every turn, making it almost impossible to fail as long as you managed your health.After a short stretch of gameplay that I would think of as an intro sequence to any other game, I was already facing a static model of Nihilanth merged with a generic Barnacle enemy colored white, acting as a final boss which will kill you instantly if you even hesitate after the cutscene introducing it. As long as you assume control properly after the cutscene and can circle strafe, the boss is a cakewalk, assuming you don't bump into anything and end up getting caught in its tongue. Immediately following his death, you're treated to a fly-through of a facility far more interesting than the playable area, which acts as an end-game credit sequence. When it finished, the game crashed.All in all, it's an experience best left alone. Use the half hour you save on knitting, watching the Demented Cartoon Movie, or smashing your♥♥♥♥♥♥with a hammer. All the above are more productive than the time you will spend playing Half-Life: Before.			"

												10/10 Best Game 2013The boss fight, the quality of the graphics, it was all there. I don't think I've ever played such a puzzling game. The amount of skill required for me to open up console and type sv_cheats 1 to finish the game was huge. It was quite a puzzle to google that. Not to mention the old man that kept following me around... he puzzled me too.Overall this game was amazing. Hours and hours of gameplay, more than Skyrim as far as I remember. And it never gets old.Also this game had so much detail in its map I had to look away for a bit. The massive freight ship took hours to navigate. I almost gave up. But then I was like, NO, I MUST DO THIS. And so, after going to navigation school, I was able to do it. Then I came to the Elevator, with a capital E, because this game had a lot of purposeful typos. Speecal thanks, by the way for those. Anyways, after the elevator I met my best friend, Sir Old Man or something. Accidentally shot him and lost the game though. Then he just was like ""oh thanks for waiting 10 minutes for me to open this gate"" and he gave me a healthkit, which he had been saving in like a Sentry Safe for like 10 years. And then after that I walked out and jumped into a black hole which just turned into a room and the credits came in and the game was over and it crashed so 10/10 best game.This game definitely deserves a MetaScore of 102. Yes, over 100. The detail and quality of gameplay brought to me by this game was truly amazing. So much better than those other games... and it definitely beat the story of Half-Life with its gameplay. The amount of time this game has consumed is almost terrible. There were so many pros and so little cons in this game. They even managed to rig the settings menu so that I couldn't turn off the soundtrack that amazingly mixed with this game.Overall, I love this game. Although there's one thing it's missing. It needs killstreaks. With only zombies and guns, you can't have a game. You need killstreaks, zombies, and guns. It's the only way to be successful. Oh, and it needs an in-game Twitch streamer as well as YouTube uploader and editor with lens flares built in. How else can I add my amazing frag videos for this game? I've gotten so good at it.Anyways, this game was amazing. And still is. And if you haven't tried it, then you should, because you're really missing out.			"

												Half Life:Before is an emotional journey of pain, laughs and tears. This game is really amazing and here's why.The game opens up with a cutscene, something we've always wanted in a Half Life game, and despite a big♥♥♥♥♥cutscene, we get no insight on what our goal is, who our main character is, what purpose he has in the Half Life universe, this is good because it makes the game more cinematic. As we progress through the cargo ship which is the only level in the whole game, we fight our way through vortigaunts... but wait! Isn't this game supposed to be taking place before the first Half Life? Well it is you dumb ♥♥♥♥, those vortigaunts are there to pad the game out so we can experience more of this masterpiece. But we venture further on through a poorly designed level to reach an easy elevator puzzle which I wish I could dwell on but that was way too complex that even writing more about it would hurt my brain too much for me to pass out.We then climb up the ladder and come face to face with a group of... enemy soldiers? Why are they here? How the hell should I know like I said this game is way more inticrated than you might expect. So we still get no explanation, again making it more enduring and cinematic. After we defeat three enemy soldiers we then come across an NPC. Who is he exactly? He doesn't explain himself, but in theory this stays consistent with the game's convuluted tone which is great. We then backtrack all the way to the other side of the boat again and come across more enemy soldiers and monsters who magically teleported onto the boat. After we defeat them easily like every other enemy in the game we have to take a leap of faith.  The boss battle is easily the best part of the game, another cutscene takes place showing us something that could've easily been seen by the player in a control state. He chases us around in a massive circle with an awkward idle animation. We defeat him without breaking a sweat and the game ends, and I'm not ♥♥♥♥ing around when I say this, but the effort has all been put in the end credits, I'm not ♥♥♥♥ing joking.Also the game has typos.10/10			"

												I normally don't make any negative criticisms, but I guess there's a first for anything. I like to point out that whoever made this mod made it too hard to play, even with the easy difficulty. I also think that the boss fight in the end is ill-conceived.Anyway, down to the story, or should I say a lack of. A character dressed in an HEV suit appears from a bolt of lightning on a cargo freighter. Also, the creator of this mod was trying to create an origin tale as to where the Black Mesa Research Facility had gotten their hands on the Xen crystal. Well, it's nice to see that you added G-Man in the beginning and end, but there's still no story. I thought the HEV suit was only worn by scientists. Scientists! This looks more like a mission for black ops! Also, who are the characters? You failed to mention that. And how did the aliens appear before the Black Mesa incident? Wasn't the crystal supposed to be the cause of their whereabouts?If anyone is going to come up with ideas involving an unofficial prequel for the first Half-Life, it should be with a clear and more explainable plot. There should be more of a narrative and a better improved development of characters. I appreciate the amount of hard work that has been done; but sadly, the effort is not enough.			"

More like an insult to a game I enjoyed when I was a young brat and still do to this day.From the spelling errors and horrible scripts that cause the game to crash, it feels as if this mod was made by a ten year old.But if you're a die hard Half-life fan, then try it out. It's simple yet quick. The boss fight ... i'm not sure if it was a fight since he died via two shotgun blasts on hard difficulty.The intense action was lacking ... intensity.The soundtrack cause me to throw my headset out the window.The high definition models lacked high defintion.I guess i'm nitpicking the mod to death. So, i'll give it a 3/10 just to be nice.			"

												I honestly can't believe this wasn't on Steam sooner. Seriously. This has to be one of the best games of this generation. After playing through it once, I went back and did a speed run. Then I went back and did another speedrun. I kept this up for about 15 hours until some family members got concerned and turned the power to the house off. It didn't matter, I had enough information about this game to keep replaying it in my head for weeks to come. Do not listen to the other reviewers. This is the only game you need (except for Half-Life 1). The graphics are like an old school throwback to the good ol' days when graphics were good. Lets talk about the story for a bit. It's like Plato, Shakespeare, the person that works at my local McDonalds, and Skrillex all came together and made this story. It'll blow your mind. You are just put into this world with a handful of Cherrios and you are forced to fight for your life and figure out the mystery of the boat and why it even exists. Last but not least are the physics. I can imagine what happened. Someone thought, ""You know what, I don't like this real life physics, I like physics version 2.awesome and a half."" And, you know what? I quite like it. I give this game 3 chickens out of 6 cows. Totally recommended. Also, if you thought any of this is serious, well, it isn't.			"

												Half-Life: Before is absolutely awful and how it possibly warranted distribution on Steam is beyond my powers of comprehension. Everything about this mod is tedious, generic, cheap, poorly designed, stupid, and generally unpleasant. The levels are poorly built and have very little in the way of cohesive structure or remotely functional Half-Life design: it's a shooting gallery, and not a very good one at that.The game places you in the shoes of ""Andrew Winner"", a scientist who inexplicably materializes onto a poorly built, blocky cargo ship where he kills lots of aliens to obtain some kind of an artifact that'll help Black Mesa... do something. This is objectively unfun and makes me seriously wonder if Steam's endgame of offering free and open entry to all games/mods is such a wonderful goal after all. If it results in more expansive, jaw-dropping game experiences where I play as ""Andrew Winner"" on a boat then I'd rather play Call of Duty for the rest of my days.In conclusion, I recommend that you be an ""Andrew Winner"" by not playing this horrible mess of a mod. Ever.			"

												I looked at this and wondered ""How the hell does a free mod get a ""Mostly Negative"" user rating? It just looks like a generic single player Half-Life level.""Boy was I wrong.The dialogue of the story is in awkward ""Engrish"". The sound design is horrible (the rain is louder than the enemies, gunshots, and music). The final boss is a Nihilanth titled horizontally with a barnacle for a mouth. Imagine a Half-Life barnacle being able to chase you as fast as snark, it's so weird you can't help but to laugh but also be disappointed at how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is.This mod is so bipolar. On one hand the author seems to be a very inspired Half-Life fan. He even put his favorite science fiction books in the lockers, like in the original Half-Life. I think he really enjoyed making this mod. On the other, it is not polished at all and it seems like he rushed to finish it. It's only about 20-30 minutes long. He put more effort into creating the ""spacial"" credits level than the two levels in the game combined.So why am I recommend that you play it still? Because it's so bad it's good. It's so weird and quirky that you can't help but to laugh but also be appalled at it's poor quality. This monstrosity something you have to experience. Also the protagonist Andrew Winner is pronounced Andrew ""Weener"". Weener hehe.Download this mod with the same attitude you would have buying a toothless paraplegic hooker. You know it's going to be bad, but you're still curious as hell.			"

												Well. I've got to tell you that my expectations jumped real high when I saw a new Half-Life game in the Store. Turns out it's actually a Greenlighted mod. ""Oh well, it's free and it's a mod for one of my favorite games, why wouldn't I try it?"".40 mb downloaded later I was in the main menu of this thing. I pressed that magic ""New game"" button. The game starts and I see a poorly-made cinematic of a camera (that seemed controlled by a player with shaky hands) flying over a ship, to a point where there's a helicopter landed. You know, I seriously expected this to have something like that 30 epic minutes of running around in the original HL. I expected some backstory. When I saw the helicopter I thought ""Hey, maybe I spawn in there"". Nope, nope and nope. After the cinematic the game makes you spawn in front of the helicopter, like if you had been teleported, with no story or anything like that. Those 30 minutes in the original game made you get used to the controls. Here you don't have a single second, since as soon as you're given control of your character, a headcrab attacks you. I opened my way through the headcrab and all the zombies that were in the area in less than a minute. Comparison time again: Battles in HL were long and difficult at first because you only had a pistol and a crowbar. You were given more guns gradually and you had time to get used to every single one. As well as the enemies, they all didn't appear in the same level, within the same 10 minutes.Here 5 minutes after I started I had a gun, a rifle and a crowbar. I killed all the zombies without spending a single bullet because inside of the helicopter there was a mounted machine-gun. The kind of machine gun that you only get to see like 10 hours in in the HL campaign. The kind of machine gun that won't run of ammo, deals a lot of damage and literally makes you feel like an overpowered turret. The kind of machine gun that here I used to make my first encounter with the enemies last less than 30 seconds. I run towards and find a shotgun. Then two new enemies appear (new as in the first time they appeared in the mod). With one of them I find the alien bugs that you can throw and use as bio weapons. To get to the next part I had to solve a jumping puzzle! A jumping puzzle 10 minutes after I had started playing. Of course that new players would have no idea of how to move boxes. I only figured it out minutes after running around aimlessly, feeling like an idiot. So you're supposed to drag a box, jump from the stairs (jumping from the stairs is extremely hard, as usual) and crouch to get on top of the box, then jump even further to get on top of a container and keep on moving. How the hell is a newbie supposed to know that? There are cringe-worthy moments as well. The dev put a newspaper-like page that can be found in the floor, kind of advertising himself. On it you can read ""Interview with Andrii Vintsevych. This guy is a ♥♥♥♥ing genius. You should learn how to do maps like this guy, ok?"". On the outfit of the corpse you find when the mod starts you can read ""L337"". And there are the un-forgivable typos you'll come across while trying to play this. Seriously, at some moments it makes you worry about the mental sanity of the people you're talking with. I'll quote some: ""I think it cose escape of other monsters"" and ""It has escape"". And in the credits it says ""Spacial thanks"". Yes. Spacial. What you just read. I don't want to make this review much longer. You could read reviews by other people and see the same I want to tell you; I highly recommend you doing so. This is a short mod for one of the best games ever made that won't even reach the knees of HL. But of course, maybe you don't believe all of the people who are giving it negative reviews and may want to try it for yourself. It's free (if you own Half-Life) and you don't lose nothing. I'm just saying that I didn't like it and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.			"

												I was concerned when I saw this game in the steam library having mostly bad reviews. ""Hmm,"" I said to myself "",a Half-Life fan-made mod that has bad reviews? Surely these reviewers are too picky."" Well the picky reviewers were right, Half-Life: Before was bad. It's not like, 'unplayable' bad, or the 'spit-shine-on-game-release-shelves' bad that Call Of Duty does, it's just, bad. Creashock Studios, you could have made something cool out of this 1.5 level map (the map-count being one of the problems) but you didn't. The one thing awesome about Half-Life is everything isn't given to you in the first five seconds of game-play. As said erlier, this could have been really cool, telling the story of how the Crystal that was used in the first Half-Life game was discovered, it's power, etc. etc. AND answering the question of how the Crystal was aquired (without going to any lore videos and/or articles). Also, I was confused how Mr.Winner (I now realize why he was given that name) got onto the ship to begin with, a lighting bold hit it, and Poof, he's there. The map count could have been increased, the boss could have been more than a moveless shell with a barnicle as it's wepon, and the list goes on and on. I think what was supposed to happen is they were trying to make Half-Life a (do not quote me on this) Spunk-Gargle-Wee-Wee game, like Call Of Duty. But over-all, it was bad.			"

												Oh god, I knew this was gonna be bad from the reviews, but nothing could have prepared me for this.It starts out OK enough, the camera starts in the captain's area of this nice looking cargo boat (well nice looking for HL1 anyway) in the middle of the Nonspecific Ocean, with Gman looking out towards the helipad. Fine, helipad on a cargo boat, little weird, but artistic license, right? And then once the camera gets to the helipad, you see a Zombie, a headcrab, and a bloody soldier leaning on the rail (presumably the former two wrecked him something fierce). It all looks like the soldier's gonna get up and be your player character, right? WRONG. Your player character is a guy in an HEV suit, who literally lightning bolts into existence like he's Zeus onto the helipad. Already starting to lose credibility.The guns aren't anything mentionable, just standard HL1 weapons. And as near as I can tell, standard HL1 enemies too. There's probably supposed to be another level or something where they introduce something, but get this - about five minutes into the first level, I reach a complete dead end. I've searched the entire damn level up to that point, there is absolutely no way I can advance. I can't crowbar my way around, I can't push a box and jump somewhere, there's NOTHING.However, what I could get through of this first level played exactly like those ""kil al da bad guys"" missions I made when I was six. Medkits every four feet, a bunch of quasi random enemies in a room, a wide complement of weapons before I've had time to sneeze, and I could see each obstacle coming from a mile away. This is something I'd introduce to a small child to get their opinion on FPS games, not something I'd play as a 20-something looking for a good time.Short version: NO.Longer version: NOOOOOOO NONONONONONO NOOONO NO.

												It's just one of those days - AnonymousTHE GOODThis is a sad case here. The soundtrack is really very good, and while getting repetitive, it makes this game almost worthwhile. They also reskinned the pistol to make it look nicer. And the likes touches like a scientists tie swaying as he walks are cool to see. Also, the map is similar to a map in TTT, which gave me hope when starting it up, which was the only hope I got from this game. It's short, but it's better than having an 8 hour mod which takes up more time than you're willing to invest.THE GREATIf you own Half Life already (Which you do, because you are a GOOD boy who bought Half Life when it came out) then this mod is free and doesn't cost you anything.THE UGLYThis was based off the Half Life engine. That is fine. Using the same enemies, weapons and skins is less so. I would have liked to see a little more change with the weapons, the enemies, or even the skins. Sadly, most of these are just copy and pasted. The only encounter with a friend in this game is a scientist who claims to know what you want, opens a crate which contains a medkit and presses a button which allows you access to the next level. While this may have been a nice idea on paper, glitchy AI prevent you from moving too quickly, which disrupts the flow. You can open this crate and push the button faster than he can, making him redundant. And when he talks, he talks in text form. No problems here, except it is unpunctuated and misspelled. This is lazy. And then the boss. The Nihilanth plus a barnacle is NOT a good boss idea. The boss fight is a cheap idea. It scatters your weapons around the (Small) arena, drops a snark in with you and has a whole lot of ammo in a metal container which provides no escape route when cornered. And after beating him, a black screen and the entire game crashing sours the experience.THE VERDICTI do not enjoy saying that this mod is bad. I've actually had a bit of fun with it, but framerate issues and a lack of direction just makes this experience not worthwhile. Sure, it's only two levels and it's free, so there's not too much to complain about, but it feels like a waste of potential. And that really is a shame. Oh, to all of the people who hate this game so much, this was Greenlit, so a great number of you are probably to blame for this ending up on Steam. Not that it's bad that fan-made mods end up here, but some of the complaints and comments that have been said to and about the maker of this are unneeded. Cut it out guys.SIMILAR GAMES-Nothing is really very similar to this gameFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview "

												Despite being made by a supposedly devoted Half-Life fan, this mod misses pretty much everything that made original HL  good. It is hard to lay down any criticism though, when the mod is completely free to play. In my humble opinion, I think Half-Life: Before is a below average shooter, that could have been better if all textures and character models would have been made from the scratch, and the game would have been completely detached from HL universe. Now the title misleads into expecting quality.The pistol model looks and feel good though.			"

He will also avtivate the lift so you can get the artifact/artefact. After that, you'll fight a giant barnacle physically equal to the HL1 boss without animations and get CTD after the credits, all of that in 10 mins max.Spacial thanks to the dev team.			"

												Games like this make me wonder why Greenlight even exists.Set in ""another world"" of the Half Life universe (which seems to be just an average ship), you play as scientist Andrew Winner, who must go to this new world to find an ""artifact,"" as the title screen says. The story feels like some terrible fanfic, complete with a nonexistent plot and terrible grammar.The actual control/feel of the game is good, mainly because it's Half Life (aside from a few areas where you can get stuck and must reload a saved game). But don't expect anything new or exciting. The store page of this game says that there are a ton of new features, such as new levels, soundtrack, and ""high definition models."" After playing through this game twice, I can safely say that the store page is a gigantic lie. While it does have a new soundtrack (which is decent at best), the other new additions are barely noticeable. The ""new levels"" consist of going to the back of a small ship, talking to a guy with broken English, going back to the front of the ship, and having to fight the final boss from the original Half Life. The ""fight"" if you can call it that is just you shooting in the air while running in circles for about a minute. By the time you realize it, you'll have beaten the entire game in about 10 minutes. As for the ""high definition models,"" they are no better than Blue-Shift's updated visuals.Of course some may argue that it's a mod, and that it isn't going to be high quality. But if you do some searching, you'll find some amazing Half Life mods that were made years before this. The fact that this even got greenlit still baffles me to this day. On the bright side, it's free, so you can at least play it just to see how bad it is.			"

												!!SPOILERS!! THE WHOLE PLOT IS BELOW !!SPOILERS!!This game started off ok but got bad quite quick.First off you get almost every weapon in the first area. Not that bad but you also face almost every single monster in the game in the same stage.After this fight you get to the tower. In my case I was below half health. You encounter a room with 3 soldiers in it. Ok. Kill them and begin to explore the room. Now after this fight you're probably low on health. So what happens next? The room is flooded with snarks. Took me several attempts to survive.You get through that and go into a room in which you encounter the first living other person. You get the crossbow and he opens a big door. Really thinking of Jurrasic Park. Apparently theres a big scary monster in the hanger. So we open the doors.You are then forced to back track all the way to the begining. Which has magically been repopulated with aliens.You eventually reach the hanger and face a really glitchy cutscene. Which is unskippable. The ""big scary monster appears"" which is really a reteaxtured barnicle attached to a ragdoll of the final Half Life boss.You get into the fight and realise that you have NO weapons. They are lying around you. This means that, no matter how conservative you have been, you combat the boss with next to no ammo. The boss is not even that hard. Although if you get caught on the barnicle tounge its almost an instant kill. If you die you have to go through the cutscene again.You kill the boss and take the crystals. End of the game. Thats it. Its meant to be backstory but its just a shoot em' up. The final boss is just a bit stronger than the rest.The best bit of the game was probably the final, non glitchy, cutscene.			"

												What the ♥♥♥♥?This mod is not long at all, only about 10-15 minutes. It has cheap reskins (at least, I think the blue HECU were part of the mod and not a skin I have). This was incredably easy, and i could even beat the boss with a magnum clip and 16 shotgun shells. I couldn't save on the boss fight or the game wouldn't load and it crashed while dropping back to the main menu at the end. This is honestly a disappointing mod and I have no idea how it was greenlit. Someone should check for 10,000 accounts under one email address. If you want a good, short HL1 mod, Someplace Else is my recommendation, not this broken, uninspired mistake of a mod.Positives:*Music wasn't bad*Quitting & uninstalling it*The pistol model (unless that's a custom skin I have as well)Negatives:*Everything elseNot worth 600MB to download			"

												Welp. Here's the deal.This Mod. Had potential.This Mod. It had decent scripting. Just enough to make you feel the game for what it is instead of guiding you thorugh the story.This Mod. It talked of going to the Black mesa complex. Of being a winner. Andrew Winner. of a special artifact.It had Weapons in it. It had new skins. It did have New Levels,a nd new textures. The ingredients for a possibly good mod- the possibility of good gameplay, and a new story.This Mod. it was not that.It took thirty eight minutes to complete. The battles were not stunning. Rather, they were forced. Rushed. It was artificial difficulty. I felt like I was playing a sea-based Half Life: Uplink (We all know that terrible movie...)This mod. There were not true puzzles. Just small ""hit this and it falls over"" periods.This mod. It did not have -true- new weapons. Merely reskins.It had potential.But it was not great.If you seek a small run-and-gun, then go ahead... Add this to your list of games. but if you want a true half-life style challenge... this is not it. I can only hope this is just the first part of a larger thing.			"

												This is honestly the worst excuse for a ""mod"" I've ever had the misfortune of playing. How did this get Greenlighted again?The gameplay is mindless, the puzzles are stupidly easy to figure out and the shooting isn't really fun because you're being swarmed constantly, when you first load this game up the first thing that happens is a headcrab attacks you, the final boss is also mindless as all it does is follow you and will NEVER attack you. Oh and don't even get me started on the broken English present in this game, so many inexcusable typos such as ""artefact"" and misplacing the word ""you'll"" The soundtrack is good, but very repetitive and can be very droning after about 10 minuutes of gameplay, this is probably the only good thing about this game and the artist of the soundtrack should feel proud. It's quite reminiscent of the original Half-Life soundtrack and seeks to capture the same vibe but somehow falls flat just like the rest of the mod.Overall, the design is extremely poor and the game feels unfinished. I do not recomend this mod for anything other than showing people how not to design a video game. It also should be an example of when NOT to Greenlight a game for release. The only good thing I could think about this game is that I didn't have to pay anything for it and that I was able to finish it in around 30 minutes.			"

												Let me make it CRYSTAL ♥♥♥♥ING CLEAR that I am recommending this product only because it is FREE.  No other reason.  Well, that and the fact that it uses up less than 100mb of your hard-earned data - maybe more, if you haven't currently got Half-Life installed - and considerably less than an hour of your precious time.      It's hardly the worst Half-Life mod ever made - hell, it's not even the worst Half-Life mod recently released onto Steam (Wilson Chronicles, stand up and take a bow!) - but it's also a darn sight from the best.  But is IS FREE.  And it has gobsmackingly inappropriate ""metal"" music during its fiendishly♥♥♥♥♥♥poor end boss battle...which is either a plus or minus, depending on whether you're the kind of person who chooses to laugh at this sorry excuse for a world, or cry at it.  Better than several small kicks to the groin, if only by the smallest of margins.    Verdict: 5/10.			"

												This mod is a fairly well constructed mod but it falls short on multiple areas.Before I get to those points let me discuss what it does well:1: Remodels nearly all weapons2: Nice setpiece of the boat3: Challenging, this game actually is HARD. I played it on normal and I barely survived the mod with about 14% health left.Now that I discussed how this mod is good let me discuss how it falls short:1: Little to no story. Seriously the most story you get is from the title screen. Everything else is either hidden away or non existant.2: Very short. If you are a skilled player of Half-Life you can probably breeze through this mod in about 20 min or less. The boat is the ONLY level.3: Boss fight is lackluster. Just circle-strafe the motionless (And by motionless I mean it has no animations except the grabber tongue.) Nilanth trying to get you like a Grabber and unload all of your bullets into it. Done.4: The flying enemies glitch into the sky when you kill them. Maybe this was a problem with the original HL as I have only played up till Lamba Labs.5: Box puzzle with the elevator could have been a bit more obvious as most people don't know you can grab sliding objects with their USE key. I sure didn't and that's the first time I have seen that in action and boy does it not want to go into the spot you want it to.Overall if you wanted a quick mod to breeze through mindlessly then go for it. Otherwise just don't bother as it is just lackluster.			"

												That's probably one of the shortest mods I've ever played. My first playthrough lasted about 20 minutes... then I found out, that you don't really need to kill everything, except for the boss. And the bossfight is hilariously bad. It's enough to run around in a circle, constantly firing at that thing.It's sad that this mod is how it is, because it would be a really nice idea if you think about it: Jumping from World to World with different themes, grabbing the crystals. If worked out correctly, it would be a great mod to play, with huge variation in gameplay. Therefore: Wasted potential right here!This mod is very easy to speedrun though. You know how to bhop? Well, then you can beat the game in under 3 minutes. Congratulations!!			"

												Hahaha! Oh, wow. Sorry, I was reading the reviews. Even the positive ones are negative. I've had more fun reading reviews than playing this eight-minute mod.Little to no enemies, little to no puzzles, little to no storyline. The only thing it has in quantity are the bugs, I lost the count of how many times I had to open a saved game. I managed to make a box dissapear, I managed to prevent the soldiers from blowing a door open, I managed to make the boss hover through the walls, I managed to unbind the bosses' barnacle mouth from the body.What is this? Why did it got greenlit? It's an okay mod to have in other places but... in Steam? I don't think so.Maybe the creator had put some effort in it but it's just not enough to be here. The only positive thing I've heard from this mod is that it's free. You know what's free too? Several other games and mods. Go play Underhell, Alien Swarm, Team Fortress 2. Hell, go play anything else.			"

The pistol and other models look great. The game gets slightly harder at the end and you gain new weapons around every new corner. I enjoyed the addition of the cutscenes as well as the music. The boss was interesting but I felt like it needed more.Also, its free!In short, I DO recommend that you get this and have a hλlf hour of fun.			"

												While I absolutely love the idea of more GoldSrc mods being available on Steam, HL: Before is nothing but a mess. Two small, uninspired levels with no cohesive enemy placements (why do marines and aliens both want to kill you at the same time?), a couple of crate-pushing 'puzzles' so simple I wonder why they even bothered, weapons other than the shotgun being relatively useless, a choppy and inconsistent framerate (inexcusable for a game on this engine that reuses HL1 assets) and a terribly easy final boss encounter make this feel like a waste of 15-20 minutes instead of something that should be more exciting; a new HL campaign. Even little things like not being to adjust the terrible and droning in-game music volume, said music abruptly starting and stopping upon entering a new room (which really isn't necessary), and being able to see where the level stops into the skybox is very amateur and embarassing to witness. There's little-to-no polish, and it's just not worth the bother.			"

												Mod quality: Adam.No, seriously, who thought it was a good idea bring this mod to Steam? It looks like it was done by someone new to GoldSrc:*There are three maps, when all of them can fit in one.*TOO SHORT (10 minutes, probably I could even beat it in 5 minutes).*Poor optimization, there are constant FPS drops.*Only two push crates, those can't be considered as a puzzles.*Weird scripted scenes. With more work on those, it would look better (and being a way to tell the story, don't use the background menu for that).*The mod hangs when loading the maps or the menu.*The mod uses custom content (I gonna believe they got permission for the pistol, and the rest of props are made by they), yet it doesn't use voices (If you are going to use game_info as subtitles, at least make sure it doesn't have typos!).However, the look of the ship and the credits level is good. I wanna believe that this is an incomplete mod, which their autor put it here to continue working on it (which is not an excuse), but the fact that is not even bug less, and it made it on Steam, it makes me mad. There are many legendary/excelent GoldSrc mods like They Hunger, Azure Sheep, Residual Life and many more that deserves to be here rather than this mod.			"

												Short Review: This is the worst HL mod ever. Avoid at all costs. Long Review: You begin the game being thrust into the world knowing absolutely nothing. Then, they throw a bunch of enemies at you and practically every weapon in Half-Life. You don't know where you are or what you're doing, and you never do. After you stumble upon the only NPC in the game that isn't trying to kill you, he quickly explains that they've created something, it went wrong, and then says something about an artifact. You jump down into the second of two maps and then this face-down Nilanth with a barnacle tongue attacks you. After you shoot it with all the weapons you were provided earlier, the game just ends without any explaination of what just happened. The ten-minute journey has absolutely none of the features the mod promises. I'm not even convinced that it occurs in the Half-Life universe, but I don't know. Complete with terribly done cutscenes.Rating: 2/10. Avoid playing.			"

												This mod isn't terrible,  but it certainly isn't good either.First off, it's ridiculously short. About 10 minutes through the game, you already have all of the weapons in the game. Then the game gives the ultimate ""f*ck you"" and takes them all away. You can pickup a few guns from the enemies, but they're useless. It takes about five shots to kill you,but for them, it can take 8 or more, and they're smaller than you! How does that make sense?Next, there are few maps. Very few. Only 2 maps exist in the game, and nothing else. It would really be nice to travel to other places in the game, but you're stuck in this dinky boat the whole time (which is somehow infested with Houndeyes and Headcrabs? What?).Then when you got everything done, you have to BACKTRACK TO YOUR SPAWN POINT AT THE VERY BEGGINING OF THE GOD DAMN MAP. You have to climb over cargo crates, kill more aliens, and get useless junk to get back to the spawn point. The aliens respawn in higher numbers, too, so good luck trying to kill all of them without dying. Then you fight the final boss...this must be good, right?No.Not even close.The final ""boss"" is a huge dissapointment. It's just Nihilanth with a Barnicle in his mouth and floats around, and jsut takes grenades to kill him. He isn't event hat hard to beat, he just floats in the air, like he just wants to die. And after that? The end.It's over.Just ends.I'm so happy.The best part is that you never know what happens to the crystals. Not that you would care, anyway.			"

												TL:DR It's 15 minutes of Half-Life combat on a boat. Absolutely 0 story. Go play Missing Information.+ Looks fine. Good textures. It's built on the Sven Co-op engine.- Only puzzle was pushing a box to climb something. Twice.- Minimal platforming, see previous point.? (Spoiler I guess, but who cares) The final boss is a combination of barnicle and Nihilanth. Not the most beautiful sight to get grabbed by a tentacle and get a face-full of a stiched-toghether octopus alien baby, allright?-It's 15 minutes long.It gets a half recomandation from me, because it delivers what it promises. But it's just that, a 15-min map of Half-Life on a boat.Final note: Go play Missing Information, a recreation of HL2 beta, with all the combat on boats, Dr Freeman in a ""Stealth"" Gimp-suit, child-slave factories and wastelands it brings.

												I'm sorry, I know it's a free mod but that doesn't mean it's good.Just a quick list of what's wrong with it:- It's short. You will need less than 30 minutes- There's no real story- Enemies are absolutely bullet-spongey. Seriously, you have limited ammo supplies as it is and then even a headcrab takes half a machine gun magazine?- It's running on the HL1-engine. Why? We've seen with Black Mesa (which apparently doesn't get greenlit in contrast to this mod) making perfect use of the Source Engine.			"

												Sadly, I did not like this game because it had too much music usage, and the boss was just a frozen model floating around the map with a barnacle alien inside of it. The pistol was a good model, and I thought the ship was a good map as well, but everything seemed overrushed and cliched.			"

												This mod requires ownership and installation of Half-Life. This review also assumes you already own and have completed Half-Life, my review of which can be read here.Mod: Half-Life: BeforeFor the game: Half-LifeDeveloper and publisher: Andrii VintsevychReleased: 4 December, 2013Genre: First-Person ShooterCanon status: Non-canonSetting: 2003, Black Rock, the middle of the ocean, EarthSpoiler-free plot summary: Sometime before the events of Half-Life, you, Andrew Winner, are teleported onto a research vessel of Black Mesa's called the Black Rock. You are tasked with eliminating the alien hostiles and their military handlers, and to retrieve an alien crystal.Full review: Half-Life: Before is a half-hour-long prequel to Half-Life about how Black Mesa retrieved the Xen crystal. Other than that, there is no story. This mod is also incredibly easy.You've got your basic Half-Life gameplay with only a few new things:* Custom HD animations, models, skins, and soundtrack have been added.* NPCs (or the one and only non-hostile NPC in this mod) have subtitles, whereas Valve didn't give any to the NPCs in Half-Life.However, this mod is filled with more negatives than positives:* The AI of the hostile humans is incredibly dumb, not reacting when being shot or when their allies run past them or die, and only react when you're in their field-of-view.* What few ""puzzles"" that exist require very little brainwork. * The soundtrack, though good, plays at random, inappropriate times.* The boss is an unanimated copy of the Nihilanth from Half-Life with a Barnacle tongue that chases you around a square room.Do I recommend Half-Life: Before? No; it has very little to give to your valuable time, and there are far better mods out there on the Internet that are far more enjoyable and of higher quality.			"

												While I like that there are Half-Life mods still being developed and now released on Steam (for free I might add), I'm pretty sure the only reason this is even on Steam in the first place is Greenlight. Before is short: only 3 levels long and that's including the credits. It has its good points, but it is very extremely obviously an amateur product.The plot is explained in the main menu background. It is a bit strange and laden with typos, but from what I can gather this is how Mr. Winning (presumably related to Charlie Sheen) 'acquired' the Xen crystal used in the last experiment Black Mesa would ever perform. I don't know why they'd tell him so much about it other than to inform him of how to get back to his dimension, and I think it's handled pretty damn quickly and unceremoniously, but I guess it's not an unworkable plot.I found the atmosphere mostly great, with the rain and the storm and everything. More background information/flavor about the parallel universe Mr. Winning is in and what's happening on the ship (other than CONTAINMENT TEAM and ICKY MONSTERS) would have been great, but alas I didn't find much.The music was also pretty good, the custom textures and scripted events weren't bad, and the new pistol is superb - probably one of the best things about the mod.Now, the bad news.There are some obvious graphical glitches: bodies of Controllers that you kill in the first level float in the air, and hitting certain crates with the crowbar actually colors them white. I should also mention that every level (all three of them) needed to rebuild their node graphs when I first loaded them.The game gives you a good number of weapons early on, but you don't exactly have a ton of ammo. I'd say it can't be helped considering how damn short this mod is.Not to mention that some of the ways to advance in the first level could be made more obvious, including where the weapons are lying in front of you when you first start. The first level is good aside from that - it remined me of the ship level from Counter-Strike Condition Zero's Deleted Scenes - but the boss battle is just stupid and weird: the first time I tried it, the boss just traveled through the wall and eventually the level restarted. Turns out you just have to shoot it a lot while dodging enemy attacks.After it died, the game ended and I got to see the 'Spacial Thanks' in the credits, which were otherwise nicely scripted.I'd say give this a try if you really like Half-Life and don't mind playing a seriously weird level with a great custom pistol. Otherwise, there's not much to recommend about Before in comparison to the multitudes of other, superior HL mods. I really wish there was an option between 'yes' and 'no', because I'd use it here.At least it's free.			"

												For a mod of Half-Life, it isn't really that good. Which begs the question: why did this mod get greenlighted on Steam instead of better Half-Life mods? We will probably never know. Since this game is so terribly short, I'm going to some up the story on this one review. I'll try to figure out and explain it as best as I can.You magically get teleported onto a boat by a lightning bolt (no, I am not kidding). After appearing on said boat, you find out that most of the crew of the boat are dead or tuned into Zombies, with other different creatures blocking your way. After killing them and getting through some weird and confusing level design, you find a man on top of the boat that's ""guarded"" by some sort of soldiers, who instantly attack you (why? I still don't know. As for the man, we'll just call him Bob). After ""rescuing"" Bob, he tells you that they (whoever ""they"" is) have made a ""very smart genetic modified creature"". He gives you a medkit and activates the cargo lift at the front of the boat that has the creature inside. You leave him and go back to destroy it. But you also have to get through one of the more stronger enemies from Half-Life, which is still pretty easy since it gives you almost all of the weapons from that game. After plowing through them, you jump into the cargo lift which triggers an unskippable cutscene (which is gonna be very repetitive since everytime you die from the boss, you have to sit through this cutscene over and over again). The cutscene shows the ""very smart genetic modified creature"" eating some sort of yellow crystal. The yellow crystal might have been the artifact that Bob was talking about while you were talking to him. But why does the creature eat the artifact? I STILL DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING KNOW! After the cutscene, you are greeted with both the first and final boss of this game, the creature. The boss is... interesting. It's the same final boss of the original Half-Life only smaller, has an instakill attack, and spawns Snarks. I found a glitch where the boss kept going through the walls and didn't attack me at all. Anyway, he is kinda easy to take down aside from the instakill attack. After killing him, you are greeted with the credits. And that's it.I got this game because I was curious, and it was for free. If you wanna try it out, then go ahead. However, if you don't wanna waste your time, then just don't bother.			"

												I'll make this short. You start off dropped in with no backstory at all, and you are instantly given all the good weapons like a rich kid that gets what he wants when he wants. There are two levels, TWO LEVELS. The whole game is about 200mb bigger than half life according to steam, so why is it so big when it holds TWO LEVELS?! So the game boasts about having ""HD Graphics"", nothing is HD about them, sure a model looks cleaner but that does not make it HD. The game also boasts about having ""Intense action"", you know whats really intense? Jumping on boxes while trying not to fall off, real intense. I had to restart numerous times because my autosave would save while I was stuck under a staircase, or it would save when I had no health and if I moved my toe I would be killed. The review by City17.ru says that it will ""appeal to people who like high challenge"". First, work on your grammar. Second, high challenge? Are you joking right now? The only thing hard about this game is deciding if you should play it or not. I got stuck on the elevator part where there's a ladder on the side of the wall, but how am I supposed to see it when it blends into the background? I honestly thought it was just part of the background before I figured out that it was a ladder. The people who made this game could work on their grammar, also the guy being held prisoner could just grab the crossbow right next to him and kill everything aboard the ship. The final ""boss"" is a poorly retextured barnacle that is made to look white, it also has a Nihilanth model pasted over it. To beat it, you shoot the barna- I mean, Nihilanth in the mouth and then it explodes. The model was so badly pasted over that the ""Nihilanth"" glides around like a sloth on its belly on a very slippery patch of ice. I was really looking forward to this mod since I had never played it before and it looked pretty good, if anyone asks me if they should play this I'll give them a simple one word answer: Don't.

												If it wasn't so short and for free I wouldn't have any reason to recommend it. Don't play it unless out of pure curiosity. It has no story, bad gameplay and looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The only really good thing in it, that doesn't come from Half-Life 1 itself, is the music, and the way it was implemented. Few of the stupid things I've noticed:- if you shoot the guy you find on the bridge (who is apparently a ventriloquist), he won't die, but you will still get the ""mission failed"" message, even though he's needed only to push a button, an action which the player character could've done by himself;- the boss  is just a HL1 final boss, facing the ground, with an instakill attack, moving at ridiculous speed, the only technique to defeat him being running backwards in little circles, at the same time shooting at him from all the few weapons you have;- the said boss has a poster of himself on a wall in the first level;- at the begining of both (!) playable maps in the mod you get attacket by enemies almost immediately after opening cutscenes without a chance of avoiding damage;- during the credits, the author misspelled ""Special""...

												This mod is awful. It is short, incredibly boring and easy, and has no story or direction whatsoever. The only plus of the mod is the soundtrack, which is decent. I got to the end, killed the final boss (WITH 2 CROSSBOW BOLTS ~so difficult~) and then I could progress no further, so I only assmue I beat the game and the devs couldn't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to put an ending in, which wasn't really surprising, considering all the other negative feedback on this mod. In short, even if you have HL1, do not bother installing this mod, period. It may not be a waste of money, but it is a waste of time, and will probably drain a bit of soul from you too. 2/10 would not play again.			"

												Alright. It's pretty much been established that this is a crappy mod. So I'll just write in my two cents here.It's crap. Dunno how it got greenlighted. It was on Reddit's /r/HalfLife a couple months ago and a few people back there (Me included) thought it looked good, so I guess a few people voted for it. Well, that's a mystery that may never be solved. At any rate, the only things this mod has going for it are some decent custom weapon skins and animations and a killer soundtrack. I'm a huge sucker for custom skins and anims in mods so that scored it a couple brownie points. My musical tastes lying in the metal persuasion also made me view this mod in a slightly more positive light. Otherwise, there is a STAGGERING lack of enemies in this mod. I'd count maybe somewhere from 40-50 enemies total. There are two playable maps (Unless you console command yourself into the credits map for whatever reason, which seems to be a slightly modified HL1 Sector C), and playtime is about 30-45 minutes. The boss is ridiculously strange, and also ridiculously easy to defeat, and the programming as a whole is pretty terrible. (Seriously. They programmed you to lose all your weapons at the end of the first map and get them ALL back with a set amount of ammo in the second immediately afterwards. Did they think you'd have exhausted all your ammunition on the few enemies there were?)Anyways, my recommendation? Play it if you want. But otherwise I'd say just download it, rip the model files and the music for your own enjoyment, and leave this thing to rot in the recesses of Steam's underground where nobody goes and nobody knows.

												...how did this get through Greenlight again?It's basically not much more than a custom HL map, yet touted as a full-fledged modifidcation. Even if it's treated as the former, the abrupt start, overuse of surprise scares, lack of spelling consistency, and mediocre boss battle - not to mention how absurdly short this compilation is - make this a poor showcase of a map. Despite it trying to present a side-story, it seems to be poorly connected to the original Half-Life (the Gman and some Xen stuff are the only connections), and merely uses its name to draw in players.Devs should definitely think this over, possibly even ditch this current iteration entirely, if they intend on continuing this idea.

												You run the game. Title screen shows. What's this? The ""story"", already? With typos? But, a title screen shouldn't ruin a game, right?So, you press new game, and choose your difficulty. And boy, all of them are the same. Starting it is a mistake you will never undo.So, you see a cutseen, and it seems to be on a boat. The game is so bad that you won't even remember most of it.The camera shakes towards (yes, it shakes) what appears to be a solier, but in a blue-ish uniform. Okay. You think that you will play as the soldier, right? Nope. You instantly ZAP into existence, with little explanation (tittle screen) of what just happened.You are then attacked by a headcrab. What's this? You also have guns? Then you kill it. Wait, why are there aliens? Isn't this supposed to be before the incident? Paralell universe or not, this doesn't make any sense.You navigate the boat, only to reach... Sentries? Why are there soldiers? You defeat them, and go into this tower thing.Wait... what? A puzzle? Oh joy! But, it is... well... a joke. Just move a box to get up the hatch in an elevator, climb a ladder, and see... Soldiers? You defeat them, but then, SNARKS come and attack you! The only possible thing to do here is enable sv_cheats 1, and godmode. Then, you see this scientist, who only talks in text. Oh boy. Then, he activates something, which then goes into a (short) cutseen. So, you go the other way, and suddenly there are aliens. Once you do all of that, you fall into a black pit. Next level. Then, a NIHILANTH, with a barnacle thing starts to eat a crystal. You kill it, and BAM! Endgame. Oh, and did I mention that there's a (♥♥♥♥♥♥) soundrack playing, which you can't turn off? What about the climax? The credits. Simply.Good game if you want to blow some time, but seriously, even that time is wasted.Overall:Story:0/10Soundtrack:1/10Mod:0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000001/99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999Free or not, this mod is so horrible, that 40 mb + free is a waste.DO NOT GET EVER OMG			"

SpoilersThis game had potential. It had potential. First few points. This game is short with 2 levels, this game isn't hard on hard. Don't think there were any new models apart from the pistol? (I'll have to check that) and the marrines wearing blue. The bugs. In between the creates and the railings I got stuck. The second level doesn't load from a save. The boss didn't die the first time and flew through walls also I noticed that the game crashed around the credits and when I quit.(Beta test!).The music. It wasn't bad as far as repetitive music goes, I mean it's up from melodies.The effects. He lightning bolted onto the boat, he then returned by pressing a button on his suit. Really.... from a parallel  world, handy that. At least make us fight to the portal or something more elaborate. It felt like more work went into the credits than the game its self.The story. One thing I did wonder about was what made this a parallel world? there was such a big chance for a story there, I noticed the name of the ship ""Black Rock"" which I guess is the Black mesa in the parallel world. Maybe the ship was the Borealis but belongs to Black Mesa in the parallel world or am I creating the game I want to play? A acceptable story can save a game from its other flaws but sadly not here.Out of 10 I would say about 0.75. Sorry but I've seen better designed maps on Team Fortress Classic and Sven Co-Op than this game/mod. If Creashock-studios make any more Half Life mods/games please focus if nothing else on the story.			"

												** DO NOT PLAY THIS MOD** IF YOU CAN EVEN CALL IT THATThis was the single most shortest and lamest mod ever to have been made and played.All the action takes place on the deck of the ship. When you fight the ugly barnacle floating thing, you must use all your ammo and run around while looking up and firing to finally kill it. Once you do, the mod ends. Poof.i think it took me total game time of less then 20 mins.Which i will never get back.RECOMEND NOBODY DOWNLOAD AND PLAY THIS THING.** DO NOT PLAY THIS MOD** IF YOU CAN EVEN CALL IT THAT			"

												This feels more like a tech demo than a final release. The level design is good, offering clear goals and a mostly believable environment, while the new graphical elements and clever use of an enhanced physics engine help to modernize the experience and make the game feel fresh and original. It is far too short, however, and offers little in terms of replay value: most players will finish it in under an hour. The difficulty is low, the story is almost indecipherable, and I had to restart the level several times due to an assortment of game-breaking bugs. Better writing, and much more careful attention to plotting, pacing, and play-testing would help this release immeasurably. It’s a strong concept, but one that clearly isn’t ready for front page promotion on steam. Give it a miss, for now.			"

Nothing new at all.Just a little, stoopid, sensless & weird boss that has even it's own map (Remember: This mod has only 2 maps + credits),but which is just a room of around 64 m² size. Seriously?A lot of awesome games that don't get through Steam Greenlight but THIS mod gets through?!The only positive thing to say about this is maybe the soundtrack. They're okay. But that's all.Oh... and did I mention all the typos in the few dialogs and texts?Great! 10/10. Would play again. Because why not?			"

												This is one of the worst mods I've ever seen for Half-Life. A mod that can be beaten under 5 minutes (seriously, I beat it in 5 minutes) with a crappy ending boss. This literally took no effort at all. All it is is that you're on a ship, you kill things as you go to the other side of the ship and inside, kill more people, and then go back into the pit in the beginning of the game to fight a boss that's just a flying Barnacle boss that you have to evade by running around in circles and shooting up at. The soundtrack is also garbage. Completely forgettable and it's way too loud too. The only thing that's good about this mod are the weapons that you receive. How this abomination of a mod got past the Greenlight is way beyond me.Don't download this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Avoid it at all costs.			"

												Why was this released on Steam?PROS: - Cutscenes in a HL1 engineCONS: - Everything elseOVERVIEW:     Half-Life: Before is stupid. It puts you into the eyes of a completely useless character who apparently gets teleported to a ship when coming into contact with an element. That's all the game does. It drops you onto the ship all like ""HERE, SURVIVE"". The game just tries to make you feel like a badass instead of actually giving a story, or good gameplay mechanics. The one and only puzzle in this game is moving a box next to a bigger box so you can jump to higher ground. It's not fun, it's just a waste of time. This game has pointless backtracking and even the final boss is terrible, yeah that's how you know it's short, when I say final boss this quickly in this much text. I'm not gonna say anything about it, due to the fact that some people are just complete idiots when it comes to pointless spoilers.I don't recommend this game to anyone. It's bad and should have never been made the way it was.			"

												...it had good music at least...Honestly, this is just an odd mod.Plot:Legitimately speaking I think you play as a scientist who needs to get another something and the whole Half-Life thing happens on a ship because of some radiation [?].Gameplay:Remember those cool HL corridors and DOOM-style gunning?Did you enjoy that?Because its not here.You are basically shooting at either a bunch of enemies that pose no threat or a bunch of high-powered enemies.The guns are a bit skinned (well the Glock/M9 is...) and aliens are (for some reason) fighting along-side the military (?).Overall:Ok so it was bad, but it was honestly fun bad.  It wasn't what was expected, but I was smiling through the entire thing, it was better than people make it sound at least.I'm recommending this if you had a stressful day and need something to just smile at (yeah, its that funny)... but please don't play this if you wanted an immersive experience because you won't get it here...Its free... if I paid for this, I'd be suing left and right.  Yes, I wasted 30 minutes, but it was of my own accord.Download at your own risk... Overall it was fun, not good; it had some nice elements, but overall they were overshadowed by its problems.  Then again you can't go wrong with a free mod...... but, hey it had good music at least.~ Jason			"

												As a supporter of the Half-life universe I accept any addition to the Half-life family. In my opinion add-ons such as blue shift, opposing force, and decay were great games that helped to explain the world of black mesa. This game however does not deserve to be a part of this series or have anything to do with it. Besides the basics complaints such as bugs, freezings and crashes that are experienced by the game, this game fails to provide any sort of decent backstory (aka the purpose of this mod due to it being a prequel to the game ""Half-life"") and it is a failed attempt at an idea that could have been better executed. The idea of some kind of conspiracy in black mesa that deals with Zen before the events that occured is highly possible and it should be considered but... the clear sign of sloppy work and rushed game design prove to be this game's downfall. While basic game elements are avaliable allowing the player to progress through the game and.... ""Story"" .....I constantly find myself confused due to having no real motives for my actions in the game, something that I have experienced in all Half-life add-ons. Overall this game attempted something that seemed great in one's mind but failed to fully materialize into a proper story and was even further hindered by the skills possesed by the modder. Hopefully in the future this mod can serve as a purpose to be an inspiration to make a better game that actually cooperates with the black mesa universe allowing it to be worthy of being called a Half-life game.

												Honestly, I expected better. It was way too short, being literally two maps long.I also don't like how it forces you to use the 'HD' models which I sincerely hate. I'd much rather play a classic game and/or mod for that game with its original style, not some supposedly 'higher quality' component to it.You basically start off with all of the guns in the game, and it doesn't present a challenge whatsoever thanks to that. The boss, what appears to be some kind of mini-boss from HL1's ending, is far too easy. All you have to do is shoot, shoot, shoot, dodge, shoot. Perhaps if a little more effort was put into making this, I'd give it more appreciation. I literally beat it in about 20-25 minutes on the first try. I might even find a small mod like this excusable if it was released earlier, but this was made in 2009, 10-11 years after HL1 was released.			"

But there are too many down sides like poor level design, anoying enemy placement, and the worst, most rage inducing, kill you in one hit boss in gaming history. I give this game 3 out of 10 points. note to developers: Please uptate the final boss to either not kill you in one hit, move slower, or have some way of escape.

This is a salt-in-the-eyes insult to the modding community and the team behind this should be embarrsed. There is no story, generic ""kill everything that moves"" gameplay, takes 15, no, 10 minutes to beat and it all takes place in just two small areas that wouldn't even pass as Sven Co-Op maps. Even the end boss (if you can call it that) is terrible. It's literally a dead Alien Controller model superimposed as Nihilanth with a barnacle sticking out of it's chest that follows you constantly at your own movement speed and will kill you in 2 seconds if you stop moving at all. I'm pretty sure the end cutscene took more work than the entirety of the mod itself. The only redeeming feature is the okay soundtrack. I'll be honest, It's not the worst thing in the history of ever, but it's brutally bad. How the ♥♥♥♥ did this get on Steam, again?			"

												This has to be worst Half-Life (GoldSrc) mod to have ever existed! Where to begin? Well, let's say this barely has a story at all, it is just a map... and that's it! You have to navigate the sub-par half-a$$ed aforementioned map killing some numbed Xen monsters and a couple of insufferably under-trained soldiers. In it, you are supposed to retrieve a crystal, but little to no context is offered about its relevance to the Half-Life story arc, so a more proper name for this would be: ""Toilet Flush: Before"". To top it all it has two incredibly annoying flaws:1. Its ear-jarring generic soundtrack cannot be muted, so you will have to cope with this migraine inducing cacophony, which is not only excruciatingly annoying, but also drowns the environmental sounds and effects through most of the ""story"". 2. It is so poorly graphically implemented that it will stutter non-stop and make your computer feel like it is running Crysis 3 on max settings... How is that even possible? GoldSrc games are supposed to run smoothly on freaking netbooks!I know you should not look a gift horse in the mouth, but it is difficult not to do so if the horse has ""Predator"" like teeth and constantly bites you in the face!

You made a soundtrack for this? HOLY BALLS.High definition models- I dont even...Spirit of half-life technology to visuals- Yes since most of the aliens and enimies you encounter are all squashed into one ship which is supposedly the Borealis.Gotta love the reskined scientist acting as the xen crystal being sucked up by a grey barnacle attached to the dead half life final boss. -2/17 would indulge in again.

												When I saw this on the store, I thought it would be good, I thought everyone was just picky, but all of them are right. This is a bad mod. I thought my English skills were bad, but these people cant even spell 'Artifact'. The game just drops you in after (I guess) you hit the red button on your suit. It took me 20 min to beat this mod, the challenge comes from dumb placement of enemies. This game runs poorly on my PC, which plays HL2 with out a problem. Another gripe I have is you can't turn off the music, which can be annoying. Theres also no voice acting, just subtitles come up for the single non-hostile NPC. I recommend not downloading it.			"

												I played it after reading the comments on medium. It is not only super short, but it is also incredibly easy although I have to say it has pretty dinamic All-on-One battles. I think this is one of the worst mod ever pubblished but I think everyone should also spend 10 minutes trying it.It is a ""So bad it's so good"" even though it bugged the boss fights one time and a couple of section require you to injure yourself making it stupid to put a medikit there (you have to get injured AFTER getting the medikit to go back)			"

												Ok, to start things off it makes no sense. There is this, well, crystal thing that the 'Black Mesa' researchers have and for some reason I have to stop this Nihilanth-Baracle mix from stealing the crystal. It has subtitles that are meant to go with audio clips that don't play. It may be a bug for me though. Also with the subtitles they have some spelling erors. like a missing capital letter   or full stop What you're meant to do is very unclear, it is mainly pushing boxes and killing enemies. It only lasts about 10 minutes. Including the 'cutscenes'. There is even a tripmine half way through that you cannot destroy yourself, so you have to crouch jump over.Overall this mod is too unclear on what it is meant to be doing. The story is terribly bad and is not clear. Even for big Half Life fans it wouldn't be good.			"

												The game itself is short and not that great.  It just drops you in to the game with no clear objective unless you read the description on Steam.  There were some typos, and if they were natively english, then they need to go back to Kindergarten.  I would not recommend this game if you are expecting hours of content as it took me about 10 minutes, although it is good if you are bored and just want a quick action game before you leave for work or whatever.  The only thing I liked about this game was it's music.  The boss I don't consider a real challenge unless you are stupid enough to stop moving.  It is a one-hit kill boss, and like I said don't stop moving, they give you plenty of ammo to take it out thankfully.  But again I would not recommend this game.			"

												Jimminey Crickett.........If because of the title you think this is a prequel or has any relation to the original Half Life, think again. Never have I ever seen a ♥♥♥♥♥ier mod. This is a salt-in-the-eyes insult to the modding community and the team behind this should be embarrsed. There is no story, generic ""kill everything that moves"" gameplay, takes 15, no, 10 minutes to beat and it all takes place in just two small areas that wouldn't even pass as Sven Co-Op maps. Even the end boss (if you can call it that) is terrible. It's literally a dead Alien Controller model superimposed as Nihilanth with a barnacle sticking out of it's chest that follows you constantly at your own movement speed and will kill you in 2 seconds if you stop moving at all. I'm pretty sure the end cutscene took more work than the entirety of the mod itself. The only redeeming feature is the okay soundtrack. I'll be honest, It's not the worst thing in the history of ever, but it's brutally bad. How the ♥♥♥♥ did this get on Steam, again?			"

												This has to be worst Half-Life (GoldSrc) mod to have ever existed! Where to begin? Well, let's say this barely has a story at all, it is just a map... and that's it! You have to navigate the sub-par half-a$$ed aforementioned map killing some numbed Xen monsters and a couple of insufferably under-trained soldiers. In it, you are supposed to retrieve a crystal, but little to no context is offered about its relevance to the Half-Life story arc, so a more proper name for this would be: ""Toilet Flush: Before"". To top it all it has two incredibly annoying flaws:1. Its ear-jarring generic soundtrack cannot be muted, so you will have to cope with this migraine inducing cacophony, which is not only excruciatingly annoying, but also drowns the environmental sounds and effects through most of the ""story"". 2. It is so poorly graphically implemented that it will stutter non-stop and make your computer feel like it is running Crysis 3 on max settings... How is that even possible? GoldSrc games are supposed to run smoothly on freaking netbooks!I know you should not look a gift horse in the mouth, but it is difficult not to do so if the horse has ""Predator"" like teeth and constantly bites you in the face!

If you still love HL 1 and desperately want to cling onto your childhood download this mod have a good ten minutes. Hell if you want to have some fun screen share the boss fight with a freind as both of you laugh at the flying baby head hovering over you. Summary only download if you are really bored.			"

												Really? you push this crap to steam? I remember when back in the day, ""spiritual successor"" of half life were fully fleshed out episodes with 15+ maps, done with good level design at hand and tricky (sometimes) puzzles. And what is this♥♥♥♥♥♥ You run down the ship, you run back, you kill so called ""boss"". That's all. 8-10 minutes worth of time at max. And you push this short♥♥♥♥♥map as ""official"" steam release, supported by trailer? Like seriously? Hell even today Doom community has fully fleshed episodes, even with cutscenes,  (thanks to Zdoom engines and their deviraives like Zandronum (ex Skulltag)), some with dialogue routine (thanks to Strife dialog system), and modded up the butt with custom graphics, weaponry and sometimes game mechanics. Those worth far more. Why does those don't get blowed up steam release? Is it perhaps that there's such thing as humble-ness and authors don't want to ♥♥♥♥♥ themselves up by such mediocre means? Now, don't get me wrong - if something done good and it has it's potential - i'm fine with that - Action Doom 2 was a fantastic total conversion, and it deserved that large fame and spotlights.This thing does not. Because  Half-Life: before is a short, regular, mediocre and boring half life map which wrapped in stand-alone ""build"" with loud words like ""spiritual successor"". Ha. haha. hahahahahahahahah. Funny. P.S. come to think of it, i should probably revive my Total conversion idea of turning hl:s into contra force sequel, if steam gives such mediocre projects spotlight - maybe i have a good chance too...or maybe, just maybe I need to think about consequences of such time-waste and concentrate on delivering real entertainment products which have better features standing for them.

And the story... what story? It explains nothing, and it makes absolutely no sense. How are there even monsters if the resonance cascade hasn't happened yet!? HOW ARE THERE HEADCRABS!?

												(Edit: Not sure if this is happening for anyone else, but it claims I have spent no time on this game at all. This was also the case for Alpha Prime. I have spent exactly 21 minutes on Half-Life: Before, but the Steam Reviews don't want to show it.)Just take a look at the amount of time I spent playing this game. You might think, ""Wow, not even an hour through it? He must not have liked it"".An alternative reaction would also go along the lines of, ""Wow, he barely played the game, why is he writing a review? Nerd.""Believe it or not, I have beaten the game.When this mod was released, I marvelled that more brilliant HL mods were being released -- single-player ones, even more so! However I was sorely disappointed when I had used nothing but the pistol on the last boss that really took 21 minutes to get up to. The boss was deadsimple, as well, and only took about 30 seconds (if that) to kill.It's basic Half-Life gameplay, nothing new (other than gun models and all, which are alright), there's nothing that this mod changes. The level flow isn't something I'd call fascinating and I wish there were more levels than the cargo ship and the boss room.Overall, I don't recommend this game at all, but if you're bored or you really want to try Half-Life mods, give this one a quick whirl -- oh, and believe me, it will be quick!

												The Good - Its Free! Some of the characters models such as the Zombies and Marines seem to be improved from their originals. I especially like the Zombies chest mouth that moves and has a tongue. The weapon models for the Assault Rifle and Pistol are well done. Sound effects are classic Half-Life.  The Bad - Insultingly short; At the time I'm writing this review, I've blown through the game twice in under 30 minutes (medium & hard difficulties). The soundtrack has one good song, and the three others are range from forgettable or ear rapingly awful. The last boss fight is atrocious; you walk in a circle looking up and continuously fire your weapons and you win. The controls seem too slippery; though this is common complaint from the original Half-Life, but this mod seems to make it worse. There's a certain spot in the game that it's extremely difficult to dismount a ladder to get into a room, I consistantly jumped over the platform or landed on the plaform and slipped off to fall to my death. For calling itself ""Half-Life: Before"" and supposed to cover events before the Black Mesa incident, it has absolutely no story. You're teleported onto a cargo ship, you kill some aliens, and then some guy tells you to kill a ""GENMOD"", you backtrack to the beginning and kill it.. Done. As a last point; the game doesn't even shut down properly. You press ""Quit"" and it hangs indefinitely at the main menu screen until you open Task Manager and close it down manually.. OVERALL - I do not recommend this to anyone, even Half-Life fans. There is very little to enjoy from playing this game.			"

												Well, here's the rundown.You are Thor, God of thunder. You flash onto the ship of dreams looking for your hammer or somthing and you immediately get all of the guns in HL1. ""This weaponry is of crap"" said Thor out loud for all of the zombies to hear. The zombies were displeased, and started attacking. He charged through the ship until he came across the most difficult thing ever seen in a videogame. Three turrets that shoot pure death. ""Silly rabbit, trix are for kids"" said Thor as he pranced all around like a ballerina until he came across an elevator. ""I have the power of lightning at my side, but I might as well just push boxes."" So he pushed boxes around for 10 minutes untill he came across a scientist. ""There is scary monster!"" Scientist exclaimed at the top of his lungs ""Save me oh honorable Thor!"" ""No"" Thor replied then he proceeded to backtrack throughout the ship because his wig fell off or somthing and he fell down a cargo hold where he found a giant baby eating a questionable urine-colored crystal using only his tounge. ""That's impressive"" said Thor. The baby proceeded to float towards him in a very un lady like fashion. Thor was offended by the baby's foolishness so he decided to ctrl+alt+delete out of there out of pure disgust, then uninstall the game. Thus ends the story of Thor.Honestly, all jokes aside, I appreciate what you guys were trying to do here. I understand that you were trying to capture the heart of somthing that we spent hours playing years ago. Even though I really liked the idea, The way the game was executed was a dissapointment. This had so much potential. With Black Mesa coming out sometime soon (hopefully) it would have been nice to go ""back in time"" and play somthing new that ran on the good ol' half life 1 engine. But, sadly no. I honestly feel bad for anybody who was really exited for this. I would really like to see you guys make somthing good in the future.			"

												Run... Run from this mod. It's not worth it. It can be beat on hard in 10 minutes. This is NOT a comprehensive mod, it is a TINY custom level that has about 5 room and about 20 enemies in all. There is NO story and I felt like punching kittens after playing it. 1/10. Greenlight ...

												If you want to find a real good mod, don't download this. This is a pure copy paste of HL (Okay it's a mod) with only 2 new maps and a mash up of a lot of musics. I finished it in 15 minutes, it was my first try and... I am really disappointed. This mod is a test mod with nothing new and if you have 15 minutes to loose download it but don't thing you are going to live a new adventure...			"

												You see those screenshots up there? Next to the description of the game? Take a look at that last one, pay close attention to it. Take in every detail, every aspect, of that screenshot.THAT'S NOT EVEN IN THE MOD.The problem with Half-Life: Before is that it's just too short. FAR too short. As in ""I finished the game before I finished my drink"" short. As far as I can remember, there is only ONE level change in the entire game, and that level change is only there to trap the player in the (frankly terrible) boss fight. Worse still, barring the aforementioned boss fight, you literally have to do a u-turn and retrace your steps ALL THE WAY TO THE STARTING POINT.The story of the game is also quite poorly thought out, as little as there is, which makes the whole thing seem like just an extra level that was cut from the original game. Despite the steam page stating that ""You're playing as a Black Mesa scientist Andrew Winner."", this is NEVER brought up in-game, and you could just as easily be Lord-High Sherrif Mafia-Don Charlie McFidget Pickle-Eyes VII and it would make NO difference whatsoever. Also, you never have to ""enter another world to find an artifact"", unless the developers consider ""another world"" to be the tiny, enclosed cargo deck of a ship.This feels like a demo - a tech demo, even - for something bigger that was never quite finished. While HL:B has polish, there's a difference between polishing a gigantic statue and polishing a tiny fork.			"

												This mod is way to short and with other mods out there using the orginial Half-Life. I see no point in downloading this.-Pros *It has typical Half-Life gameplay as in just shooting the guns. *Guns look cool.-Cons *There is no story to this besides the vary unorginial plot they say in the description and even that makes no sence. *Spelling errors. *Slugish animations. (Namely the final boss) *Stupid AI and not vary well placed or in a cheaply placed way so you loss health in a nonfar way. *Short game under 15 mins. long. -Verdict If you are just a die hard Half-Life fan and have to play every single thing about it then I guess try this, but even the most die hard of fans would laugh at this. I mean it is free so no loss of anything important, but still a waste of time and it is most definitely not worth your time.			"

But its free, it was well designed, it has a few good moments that really surprise you and it finishes off with a pretty intimidating boss battle. If you want something to just jump into, play to kill a little time and just have a nice moment of new Half-Life content for the older gen games then youll really like this.			"

												Blew me away. Half-Life: Before retells the final years of Caligula's rule over Ancient Rome, however, adds a modern-day twist, causing the game to be truly unique. The game's story truly proves itself to be the Citizen Kane of gaming (Eat your heart out, The Last of Us), forcing the player into moments where he can make decisions that can affect his entire life, both in the game and in real life. The game also sports a fantastic, emotion-filled cast of characters that are all incredibly written, and feel as if they're all living and breathing people, like the player. The player bonds with the characters and shares their emotions. The gameplay for this game is simply Shakespherean in its breadth, featuring hundreds of hours of diverse and unique gameplay, and is simply too good to summarize in a single Steam review. All of this is topped with an excellent soundtrack, making music from ex-legends such as Beethoven and Jesper Kyd sound like old, broken lawn mower. Everything about this game is perfect. The part when Caligula orders the player's brother to be executed still sends shivers down my spine. GOTY all years. Please download this game.			"

And the story is no where close to hl's-Pistol model is not shown in GUI-You get most of the weapons TO FASTLY AND EASLY-The boss is too easy			"

												I've played the original version and the Steam version, there is only one difference. In the original, the music is much more louder than the Steam version.The gameplay is bad and unbalanced, the music is annoying and loud, like the rain and the sounds from the weapons.The ""history"" of the mod is awfully written. The final boss is interesting and original, but not worth it.2/10PS: stopaudio in console will help you in this... thing.			"

												whell dont get you're hopes up. this game is nothing but short. i would guess there is about 20ish enemies in this mod.on my first playthru the game crached and i had to start over. overall it took me about 12 minutes on my ''first'' (1.5) run counting with how long i got on my first run. looking for secrets and so on. the level design is not so bad, tho its a bit ''clunky'' and does not feel so fluid at all times. for the first puzzle you dont even need the two boxes that you are given.  this game is easy and really short. ive tried it at all difficulties, and whell on hard ive only died 5 times.the story is really short. and its way to easy to do things. right away when you spawn you are atacked by a headcrab, thats nice. feels like a oldschool shooter. but after that you can just jump into the shopper right next to where you started, and go on a full rampage on every enemy infront of you. the only ''hard'' part. was to get thru the turrets in my first playthru.you dont get a lot of ammo, insted you get a ''lot'' of weapons, tho you dont really need to use all of them. the boss is nothing but easy to beat. just run and shoot him.this game made me not stand up from my pc and scream of joy.  but for being sutch a short mod, its pretty fun. tho way WAY to easy. but if you have Half-Life on your steam acc, and havent gotten around to try it.then you might want to try this mod. as it gives a small (werry small) feeling of how half-life feels. tho only in the shooting.did i like this game?

												I've played many HL1 mods and this one is pretty poorly made, the title of it is somewhat misleading. It's also very short and you can tell the lazyness of the creators from the fact that you walk to one point, and then you have to walk back through the same place all over again because nobody cared to create a more sophisticated map. And the crate moving motive is just pure absurd. Including lack of jaw movement when characters talk and monsters appearing from thin air.			"

I will pay Valve to make Half-Life: Abortion, and even 4 sequals. But half life before is nothing but a pure reason to hate half lifes future. Half-Life deserves a good spinoff, but not this one.

												I would like to be among the voices of positive dissent and say that this game has been given an unfair shake by many people here. You'd think by the ""Mostly Negative"" reception it's a broken, unplayable mess or something. No, the fact of the matter is that it's just a really short campaign (that could be said to be just a glorified map pack) using the same weapons and enemies as usual from Half-Life and with a hilariously tossed-together end boss fight. So, in short, it's Blue Shift all over again, only it's his much younger, shorter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin (though Blue Shift didn't have a boss fight) we're dealing with here. I did like Blue Shift though, and in general after playing through the honestly exhausting campaigns that were the original Half-Life, the great Opposing Force and even Blue Shift to some degree it's nice to play a small chaser like this that focuses on its action from the getgo without fussing over length or annoying platforming sections.So the game is intended as a fan's interpretation as to how the yellow crystal that caused the Black Mesa disaster was obtained in the first place. It's been found on a cargo ship of sorts when it's taken over by the Xen aliens killing everyone, Now it's up to you, another mute, hazard suit-bearing superscientist badass named Andrew Winner (so literally you can say ""YOU'RE WINNER!"" in this case) to be teleported to the ship and retrieve the ""artifact"" in question. The moment you start a headcrab attacks you, with an assault rifle over a corpse behind you to take care of it. And from then on, it's Zombies, Vortigaunts, one part with three annoying turrets (when aren't they annoying?), Houndeyes, Bullsquids, all your favorites, before you face tougher foes like the Alien Grunts and Alien Controllers (which can be safely ignored really) getting in your way. One part has a bunch of snarks busting out of a vent shaft which is an instant death trap if you don't get back on the ladder that got you there to begin with (I don't know if it's triggered by going near it or by defeating the other enemies in the room first). Oh, yes, you face off against some... military guys. All four of them They use Marine skins but they don't seem to be Marines. I don't know who they are or why they want you dead. Are they some special ops team tasked with retrieving the artifact for their own gain, destroying it, etc.? Like I said this is before we even get to the Black Mesa debacle so hostile human presence doesn't make sense here, story-wise. Anyway, the entire game is a relatively small, extremely linear cargo ship whose structure is going from point A to B and then A again where you face off against the boss, end game. You have to get to the captain who's holed himself up in a room at the top of the ship and get him to open up the cargo hold under the ship where the yellow crystal is. Then it's another firefight against your more deadly opponents until you face off against... ""Genome"" Blah-blah Number-Such-and-such aka ""Nihilanth with a Barnacle for a mouth."" It's one of the silliest boss fights ever. First you drop down the cargo bay, where you recover some of your health somehow, and also lose all your weapons, which you have to run around the arena to retrieve again(?). The boss has no animation to it whatsoever, it's like a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade float of Nihilanth chasing you around with a long tongue dangling on the ground (avoid the tongue or it's instant death). Where's the yellow crystal? He comes right in the bay in a  cinematic and... swallows it up with his tongue. Why? Just... because. All you do really is circle-strafe non-stop firing up at him as he floats around trying to get you with his tongue. It doesn't take long to finish him off really. I filled him with some magnum bullets, a few bullets from an assault rifle, a grenade shot and he exploded instantly... exactly like a balloon would. Oh yeah there's Alien Controllers above trying to fire at you but they're of no consequence since you're moving around so much they can't exactly hit you so they're not worth the bother. You get a cutscene where we see Gordon Freeman walk into a room where the yellow crystal is, and we know the happy fun times that comes afterwards.So, why do I recommend this game besides being short and free (which isn't really a reason to recommend anything, plenty of bad things are short and free)? Well, it's still Half-Life, it plays as such, and so it still fun and plays well. I like the tighter action focus here, a good break from Half-Life and its expansions' labyrinths, platforms and fetch quests. The action makes for a good coffee break on Medium difficulty, and somewhat challenging on Hard (this is the only Half-Life anything I've bothered with on Hard only because of the length - the other games were exhausting enough on Medium in my opinion), and though I did die a decent number of times most of those were from the turrets, the one REAL pain the♥♥♥♥♥on Hard (everything else is either just a minor inconvenience or something you can easily plow through, like the slow-moving Zombies). I like the sharper textures of the graphics and generally smoother, faster animation (it says to use the ""Half-Life 1.8"" engine, whatever that is) and little things like the new model and animation for the pistol. And the music too. The Half-Life games offered plenty of quiet moments in between its brief bits of moody music, here it offers more thumping electronic music that doesn't let up. It starts off with a catchy mid-paced track and for a brief time some nice techno/d'n'b for the section fighting the military dudes (too bad that doesn't last too long). The level design isn't the most amazing, it's just a stretched-out corridor essentially but for a cargo ship it gets the job done.I'd say if you're a Half-Life fan, haven't played this and wondering if you should bother I'd say yes, go ahead and form your own opinion on it. Like I said if nothing else it's short, free and very much playable with no bugs or game-breaking glitches that I could see. So now that you know that, what you think of the rest of the game is up to you.			"

Couple of different enemies and weapons keeps some variety and standard Half-Life box pushing puzzles throughout.I feel that if the developer had spent some more time on the mod and expanded the story, it may have been a lot better.

												This has been a tough choice weither or not it's to be recommended, But It would be passable if it actually had new maps along with a story rather than just jumping right to the game. But to be fair guys, It's an interesting story to see what they were going at, But the effort is just poor that it's possible to beat within 10 minutes, It's really short, The puzzling is way too easy to solve and the mouth movement is not even there when the person is speaking, The Boss is too easy, The game is not worth spending your hours on But this is not the worst, But it isn't the best either. It's free to play so If you dont have Half-Life 1, I would recommend getting it, but dont expect this game to be long.			"

												Half-Life:Before is a nice attempt to make like a prequel to the original half life, the idea is kinda good, the problem is that this wasn't developed so well, why?-The game is short, took me less than 20 minutes to end it.-Lame Boss, and i mean really lame, i just ran in circles and shoot to him, problem solved.-Laggy? Maybe it's my PC but there were some moments where my FPS dropped, and this didn't happen in any other Half-Life I own.-The map was nice, I mean, not in quality or graphics but in the place, A forgotten ship in a rainy day? Well that's kinda scary but again, it wasn't implemented so well, you barely see a part of the ship, and the ship seems to be huge! With a ship like this, you could do some puzzles or labyrinth or even a better boss. Again, and idea not so well implemented.The intention was really good, it feels like this could have been a nice prequel to the original one, but this only make me wanna play the original Half-Life.

												Pitiful excuse for a mod. Bunch of bad music and poor storyline coupled with overdone models, poor Barnacle reuse (with the Nihilanth as a reskin) and failure boss mechanic makes this deserve a 3 out of 10. There was not much proof-reading to be seen with the mod either, as the mod is riddled with spelling errors and bad English. Where are the proof-readers for this mod? Beta testers? Not much going on here. Sound effects are dull for the most part (save the original Half-Life HD sounds and textures for weapons -- compliments of Blue Shift), and the game will appear to be completed in a very short time span. You will find yourself hoping that the credits at the end are not the credits at the end.Guess what -- they are the credits.Avoid this crap.			"

												Half Life Before is a free mod for Half Life. Will you want to return to Half Life one for this mod or will you want to move on and dont look back ? In Half Life Before you play as Andrew Winner. He is a Black Mesa scientist that is dropped onto a Black Mesa vessel thats overrun with Soldiers and Aliens. Youre objective is to retrieve an artifact from the ship. So how is this mod ? This mod is awfull without a doubt. Theres not alot to say about it so ill keep it short. The game has no story what so ever. Youre dropped onto a ship and thats it. The game is literraly a reskin of Half Life and theres no diffrence in gameplay. The game is really easy and is no challenge what so ever. The game is also really short about 15 minutes. The only good thing about it is its free but thats about the only good thing i can say about it. Overall this mod is a waste of time and effort only play if youre curious about it. Otherwise just stay away. I give Half Life: Before a 3/10			"

												Let's Get this out of the way first: Yes. It is Short. Do I hate it for that? NO. It's a free mod! People speed run actual full-priced games in less time than it took for me to beat this. This game is really freaking fun, and the music is pretty sweet. There is a fair amount of challenge, with limited ammo and such. But, this  thing isn't perfect. Unfortunately, I got interested in the whole idea the game has, plus with a character with a name like Andrew Freaking Winner, you can't just let it sit there. I did have a blast while it lasted, which wasn't too long, but not too short (I mean, Journey on PS3 is only around 90 minutes, and even that cost money.) I can safely say this is worth a try (IT'S FREE, GO AHEAD!), and the makers of this definately need to add just a bit more or, hell, even make a full blown game outta it. We need a full game with Andrew Freaking Winner!!!			"

												Ten dollars. Only a few hours of gameplay. 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games.But... wow. Half-Life: Before blew me away. It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment. It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience.I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it. I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses. So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name. And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it. So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Half-Life: Before on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience. I'm sorry.Half-Life: Before's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive. Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing. If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you. It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced. You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss. The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards.On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it. If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend. And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple ""Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes"" moment... the weight of a dark choice is huge. It forever changes your playthrough. Reset the game, and the characters know. Events change. And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents. In the end, ignoring what Half-Life: Before sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story. Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing. There's very little reward for going through this route. Yet it is a choice you can do. Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game... It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route. Before its too late.It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world. And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you. It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice. The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired. Go clean, or go home tainted. The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending. The happiness you worked so hard to earn. And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again. That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice. Amazing.Yes, this game might not be for everyone. The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it. But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot. This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten.It is a sin to call Half-Life: Before a game. Doing that would categorize Half-Life: Before into the bland and consequence-free ""kill-em-all"" genres that a lot of games are falling into now.Half-Life: Before a story-driven, emotional experience.

If you happen to be on Steam and you don't know what to play, you should get this mod, it doesn't need a long time to complete (20-30 minutes) but is incredibly fun to play.I recommend this game to any Half-Life fan that can't get enough of the original GoldSrc engine.

												A fantastic mod for a fantastic game. This isn't a mod in my opinion, it's another game! Half-Life: Before is a mod for Valve's 1998 Half-Life, which is regarded as one of the greatest shooters ever. Half-Life: Before takes the intensity of Half-Life combat and puts it all in a short-fun first person shooter. Half-Life: Before succeeds in fun combat and also provides many puzzles that can take minutes to solve. The combat in Half-Life: Before is fun and quick. Half-Life: Before, dispite having many pros, also faces many cons. The game is very short, and some parts will annoy you, and the final boss fight can be anymore exciting? (sarcasm) Visually, Half-Life: Before is poor. This mod runs on an engine from 1998 anyway, so I can't blame it. The character models are spot on anyway. Overall, if you're a fan of Half-Life, pick this one up!			"

												I personally don't see why anyone dislikes this mod. Although it is admittedly short, it still provides a decent challenge. It has a few bugs, like the first time I fought the boss, the AI and hitbox screwed up, but after a reload it fixed itself. I also don't see what the grammar fuss and issues about backstory is about. I saw no grammar errors, and it did tell you some backstory. All in all, although short, this is a very fun and enjoyable mod, and I'd love to see another, longer, mod created by the same people. I'd give this mod a 8/10 overall.			"

												Only 15 minutes long, Well made though, Very well made for at that, There is basicly no story other than you are a scientist (yes a researcher not a combat armed soldier) and you are sent to a boat with guns to kick♥♥♥♥♥and chew bubble gum, But for some reason there are Xen creatures on this boat, So you go through this boat thats owned by BLACK STONE (not mesa) also you find Navy HECU grunts for some reason, Anyways you find some scientist guy and he opens the door to the bottom with text (no voice acting which is understandable) thats really poorly spelled out and no grammar, and you fight a giant floating baby that has a sticky tounge, After you gib the giant baby you find a crystal and you use teleportation tech to get off the boat such as how you got on the boat, Not really the best mod ever but if you own Half Life and want to play something short but sweet then download this.

												ok. I recommend it. But not for everything. Im half yes and half no on it. For starters, the beginning gets STRAIGHT to the point, a headcrab attacking you instantly to let you know that you WILL be fighting. its boss is not... well, not COMPLETELY satisfactory. the models look good, though the boss is basically a nihalinth slapped to a barnical... that instakills. yea. Not REALLY a good mod, but the music? oh boy. YES PLEASE. Map design is kinda nice. battles are nice. small puzzles, though the same each time, are kinda a nice breather from the constant fighting. its only two maps though, which is kinda sad, but wwhat are ya gonna do? so lets go over this one more time.Pros: AWESOME music. especially the boss.CONSTANT action. with small puzzles to break up the pace.gets STRAIGHT to the point.Nice level design.Cons: Bad boss design. Instakill AND keeps up with you with no animations? please rework...only two maps. erm... atleast its just a mod. right?... RIGHT?a few misspells heare and thaere.So yea. thats my review.			"

												NOTE: I originally reviewed this game approximately  80 eons ago, but it was very biased and, well... dickish. What you see right now is totally different from the original review. The thing is, and I'll say it right at the beginning, I don't think Half-Life: Before is a good game. But that doesn't necessarily mean I don't like it. This game is free, so you can't exactly call it a waste of money. Not only that, but in a very ""The Room""-esque twist, I would honestly say that Half-Life: Before is an educational experience.Y'see, a while ago, My friend told me about the ""New Half-Life game"", and you can imagine my reaction.FBWJKERUILHUEGHEUIEPISODE3WEJFHIOERGJIOI managed to not realize that this ISN'T an official Half-Life game, and ignoring the scathing reviews I happily installed it.Upon starting up the game, you'll see a whole heckuva lotta text. And in true 90's shooter fashion, this is the story. Relaying the plot on the menu screen isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in this case it shows off the first flaw with the game. The grammar is...sorta poopy. I assume that the creator doesn't speak very fluent English, which in itself isn't an issue, but seriously somebody could have spell checked. The fact that this game was released on Steam in its current state, with this doofy spelling, is sort of amazing. I'm not sure who to blame for this, but seriously what the crap?The rest of the game's flaws are pretty obvious. For starters, the main character is named ""Andrew Winner."" Okay, I get the whole ""Freeman-Winner"" comparison, but seriously, Winner? Freeman is a real last name, Winner just sounds... dorky.  I'm sure someone has that name, but... eh. Anyway, there's a headcrab that attacks you the second the intro ends, this ""alternate dimension"" looks awfully like Earth, and there's self promotion every dang where. Also, you lose all of your weapons at the load point, only to find them laying on the ground a second later. I've heard that the idea is you dropped the weapons, but why? It's useless and is executed awkwardly. The final boss of this game... It must be seen to be believed. I don't know what the hell even happened for that last 2 minutes of gameplay, but it was both beautiful and horrific.And that's the thing. Half Life: Before, in my opinion, is a bad game. But it's sort of a work of art. Like I said in the beginning of this review, this game is like ""The Room."" If you're an aspiring modder, this game is actually great as an example of what NOT to do  at a stop light in a mod. It's so wonderfully bad that it's become educational. If you want to know what to avoid in a mod, or you're just looking for a laugh, this free game is for you. ""You're tearing me apart, Andrew!""			"

												This game is okay at the beginning because it has puzzles that require more thinking then just shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥ It goes more and more downhill when you reach the tower. You have to fight three soldiers who get you down to low health and then about 20 snarks burst into the room and kill you. I had to redo this part about 7 times. Next you go back to the ship but all the enemies magically respawned and you have to run back to the beginning and jump into a dark hole. When you jump into said hole the glitchiest cutscene shows a flying barnacle with a Ninhalith (i dont know how to spell it) model attatched to it. I don't think it has any animation at all. Anyways you have no weapons and there are weapons all over the floor so you don't even need to conserve ammo to fight the boss. You shoot him about 50 times and he explodes. After this a cutscene plays and it says ""The End"". This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and has no effort put into it. Even the levels are terrible. The only thing good was the puzzles at the beginning. I r8 0.8/8 I dont appreci8 the h8, m8. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME EVER!!!UPDATE!!! I have to say this. There is a HL2 mod on the Steam Workshop called Prospekt. The creator got help from Valve making it and it is even worse than this. I thought this was the worst mod but Prospekt definetley takes first place. I recommend this awful game over Prospekt. I'm actually gonna redownload and replay this game to make sure it is better than Prospekt. Pray for me.			"

												I have to agree with the large amount of others here on this mod. I was actually very interested upon seeing this on the front page, but then I saw the original release date and it made me wonder why I never heard of it. I still wanted to play. Its ""difficulty"" is mainly cheap enemy placement and level design. For example, the moment you start, a head crab jumps right at you, and you can BARELY see it in the opening cutscene because you are too focused on everything else like the friggin ship, Machine gun on the helicopter, zombies, aliens, etc. There are just enough health kits to get you by(If only enought to keep your health under 100), and honestly its still cheap because they fill ten health per kit and enemies can do large amounts of damage. And while I commend the limited ammo feature in the start, its barely utilized to its full potential later on.You have enough ammo to get you by, as long as you don't use the worthless machine gun here (Except the Grenade Launcher), the magnum and crossbow only have one magazine and are both dumbed down in damage, so that previous knowledge of those weapons being useful? Gone. Then there is the soldiers you encounter, the first one is behind a door that can bug out and flip out in mid air (check my profile for a pic, I am not joking), where he has supplies that YOU MUST GRAB, if you don't, the door shuts later and you can't access the supplies for future use. Then there is the soldiers you duke out against up above who take a ludicrous amount of damage compared to the HECU troops back in HL1 and love spamming grenades and grenade launchers. I must give the dev credit though, the AI is smart enough to throw a grenade down the pit you came up from if you run away, but they spam them so its quite ridiculous. Then there is that infamous scientist who DOES have a voice actor who reads the lines EXACT WORD FOR WORD, but sometimes the game bugs out and only plays a few clips or none. Then the final boss, which I did not think was too bad, but jeez. Remember all those supplies and battery pick ups you saved up?

An event to how you lost everything would have justified it, but as it stands its pretty lazy how its handled. FYI, no stretegy to the boss, just run and gun. Like good ol Doom. Just don't get caught or you have 2 seconds to escape. After that, its over. And yes, it will crash back to the desk top after the credits. For a Steam release, its a bit underwhelming. If the modder has difficulties with certain aspects, he should have gotten help, end of story. It may be harsh, but when people voted for this to come onto Steam, shouldn't there be some shine and polish and some fixes for present issues? Well time for the generic run down listPros:+Sweet sound track+SOME cool fast paced moments of combat+Decent final bossCons:- Not a whole ton of explanation on Half Life background explained here( I know whats going on, but does a random schmoe playing the mod who is new to Half life know?).- Terrible way of item tracking with weapons, ammo and suit battery.-Terrible enemy placement does not make a challenging game.-Poor translation that could use some major improvement.

												So unlike all the reviews out there that are like, ""NO! I WON'T GO BACK TO HL1.8!  I WON'T DO IT! I CAN'T DO IT!"" I actually enjoy the engine, and what you can still do with it.  I do not like, however, what has been done with it here.  This is supposed to be a short, fun, run-and-gun that can give kind of a back story to what happened in HL, specifically, the origin of the specimen.  This is a terrible representation of what could have happened.  First off, why is it on a boat in the stormy seas?  The crystal came from the Xen universe, and was recovered during exploration using the teleportation technology in Black Mesa.  There's no reason for this boat story.  Why do you get off a helicopter with the military, and then the Navy (in their modern uniforms and not the uniforms used during the proper year (and with dumb tribal tattoos on their forearms which would be out of regs today (you can tell because the sleeves are rolled up which are out of modern regs))) tries killing you. Why do they have containers of these creatures, when the Black Mesa compound already has free access to these specimens?  The creatures were made able to teleport AFTER the crystal was exposed to high radiation.  So why is it that these creatures can just teleport as they please?  Also, there's on attempt at a physics   puzzle which makes no sense if you're thinking about it sensibly.  There's an explosives crate next to a light pole (on a boat?) that you have to blast, which makes the light pole fall 90 degrees the wrong way from what you would imaging the pole to do, and it falls as though pushed from the top.  Nothing about this game makes sense, and really no one can even try to justify it being any part of the series.  It doesn't fit any way you try to plug it.  Overall opinion:  Story blows, gameplay mechanics are nothing fantastic and new, and there's almost no redeeming quality to this game.  If you want to play a run and gun for about 30 min and you can ignore this trying to be part of one of the biggest game stories of all times, here you go.  Otherwise, it's pretty cringe-worthy as an attempt as a marketable game.			"

												I have to agree with the large amount of others here on this mod. I was actually very interested upon seeing this on the front page, but then I saw the original release date and it made me wonder why I never heard of it. I still wanted to play. Its ""difficulty"" is mainly cheap enemy placement and level design. For example, the moment you start, a head crab jumps right at you, and you can BARELY see it in the opening cutscene because you are too focused on everything else like the friggin ship, Machine gun on the helicopter, zombies, aliens, etc. There are just enough health kits to get you by(If only enought to keep your health under 100), and honestly its still cheap because they fill ten health per kit and enemies can do large amounts of damage. And while I commend the limited ammo feature in the start, its barely utilized to its full potential later on.You have enough ammo to get you by, as long as you don't use the worthless machine gun here (Except the Grenade Launcher), the magnum and crossbow only have one magazine and are both dumbed down in damage, so that previous knowledge of those weapons being useful? Gone. Then there is the soldiers you encounter, the first one is behind a door that can bug out and flip out in mid air (check my profile for a pic, I am not joking), where he has supplies that YOU MUST GRAB, if you don't, the door shuts later and you can't access the supplies for future use. Then there is the soldiers you duke out against up above who take a ludicrous amount of damage compared to the HECU troops back in HL1 and love spamming grenades and grenade launchers.

												Two small maps, one of which is just a boss room. Has the worst kind of fake difficulty; hidden enemies, enemies that spawn out of nowhere, and horrendous enemy placements. You are not given a chance to get a bearing on your surroundings whenever you take control of your character at the start of the game or at the start of the boss fight and are attacked immediately. This is more problematic for the bossfight as it has an unskippable cutscene right before the fight that you have to watch each time you die.			"

												This mod has received a lot of negative press. It's not great but also not terrible, especially for a freebie.The biggest problem is the short length. It's basically a small-ish map with a liberal dosage of enemies, a puzzle or three and far too much ammo. The whole affair, which includes a separate boss fight, can be completed in about 15 minutes.It feels more like a short demo than anything else. I'm not sure how or why this got greenlit, or why Steam pays so much attention to it when there are objectively far better mods available for Half-Life, but that's how it is.However, If you're itching for some classic Half-Life action, give it a go. You could do a lot worse.			"

Altogether it is a great, short mod (which used to be a mappack) that looks realistic in comparsion to the original Half Life. If you have finished half life 1 and want more, get it, it's free and it takes about 30 seconds to download it being on the GoldSrc engine.			"

												half-life: ebefore is similar to toher mods made by similar modders because it is a mod that is very short and ends disappointingly but really every mod is like this so it shouldnt come as a surprise that htis mod is the sam  way. half-life before starts out before the original black mesa incident and doesnt really it into the lore, like, at all. for a lot of reasons. it make s sense that rationalizing the xen crystal would make sense but xen is the reason they're able to teleport in the first place and by the time of events of half life 1 they already had a lot of xen crystals and youyd nown this if you actually played the agme.plot aside, the rest of the game is very hit or miss. like many reviews are qiukc to point out, the mod is only about 15 mins long and comprises only 2 maps. one is the main map and te second one is where the biss boss battle is. now this would noramalyll be acceptable but the mod istself isnt real ly that good either. the new models are good and the sound effects are tooo but weapons are just scattered about serving no real purpsoe and nothing really catchts the palyer off guard. eve nsnak rk snark enocounters are very nonthreatening and having to backtrack vfelt more like a chore than anything. the final boss too is the absolute biggest offender. esides having to pick up everything you just dropped tat the very start of the fight, the boss is a one-hit kill an snakrs come out of nowhere with alien controllers overhead for no real reason. the boss also chases you around and once you're caught, there's no way to escape. its very obvious no real effort went into making this mod good besides having a lot of polish adn a fancy credits sequence. play a real mod like sweet half life or they hunger. 4/4 not a good score			"

												Two small maps, one of which is just a boss room. Has the worst kind of fake difficulty; hidden enemies, enemies that spawn out of nowhere, and horrendous enemy placements. You are not given a chance to get a bearing on your surroundings whenever you take control of your character at the start of the game or at the start of the boss fight and are attacked immediately. This is more problematic for the bossfight as it has an unskippable cutscene right before the fight that you have to watch each time you die.			"

												Noclipped the whole game and unless including combat, didn't miss a thing.To beat the boss you just have to run backwards in a circle and shoot upwards.I played this on a laptop that doesn't even have a working mouse1 yet finished it (yes, this is a FirstPersonSHOOTER) in under an hour.Personally, although being released over 10 years later, this game somehow has worse graphics than the first half-life.On the plus side of this game I would actually LIKE the story.. if the fact the creator didn't understand that there isn't an ocean in Xen wasn't being shoved in my face the whole way through.Overall, if this is some student's first full game, good on them!But if this game took more or about 5 people to make,if this game took more than 2 months to make,considering this is a 2009 release...not even having to consider the standard of a game on steam, big thumbs down.

												To say that the game is poor is an understatement. Having read other people's reviews I decided to start a stopwatch and measure time for my playthrough. It took me exactly 30 minutes and 45 seconds to complete the game. It would have probably been shorter were it not for the fact that the game is bugged - I got stuck a number of times and had to use the ""load"" option. I cannot also understand why the frame rate is so low. Low frame rate? In a game based on an engine from 1998? Really?! I can run ""RAGE"" smoothly, but ""HL: Before"" left my computer gasping a couple of times. I also think that the boss battle is one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in video game history. Last but not least: grammar mistakes and typos... how can you release a product without checking these first?I know the game is for free, but I think it's unfair that such titles are released due to Steam's ""Green light"", when such superior FPS games as ""Warsow"" await their turn.

												I had to check this out based on the amount of negative reviews it was getting. I've played some terrible mods in my time and I have to say that HL:B isn't TERRIBLE. It's still not great however. One of my MAJOR gripes is that there are models here that I recognise but no credit has been given to their original creators. That and the music issue. It was far too loud, I couldn't turn it down and have to use console commands to turn it off!? Then there was custom voice acting which was way too quiet!This simply isn't polished in any way shape or form and I'm sorry to say that after all that, it's just going to come down to another negative review.

												This mod has received a lot of negative press. It's not great but also not terrible, especially for a freebie.The biggest problem is the short length. It's basically a small-ish map with a liberal dosage of enemies, a puzzle or three and far too much ammo. The whole affair, which includes a separate boss fight, can be completed in about 15 minutes.It feels more like a short demo than anything else. I'm not sure how or why this got greenlit, or why Steam pays so much attention to it when there are objectively far better mods available for Half-Life, but that's how it is.However, If you're itching for some classic Half-Life action, give it a go. You could do a lot worse.			"

I couldn't believe that there are so much negative reviews about this HL1 mod.I saw this mod on moddb.com and wanted to download it, but then I saw, that it has been greenlighted. So I waited some days for the steamversion of the mod.This mod has really good quality, but a short playtime. I finished the mod within 24 minutes on difficulty hard.What could the modder have done better? After the fight with the last boss, please don't stop the gameplay!I had to fight still some monster, but the gameplay was interrupted. Also it would be nice to escape from the ship by his own. This would be very cool and give it more life.After all it is a very short mod, but it has quality.A nice shortstory as a prequel to the original Half-Life from 1998.			"

												Waste of time. Takes 10-20 minutes to beat and I've played much greater single player HL1 mods. To name one that is immensely superior to this would be Half-Life Redemption, at least in Redemption is has an awesome carnival level.This mod/campaign is lazily done, all flash and no substance. All sizzle and no steak.			"

												I think that's the way one guy doing such a great work like that, and you're asking for more than two levels? If this guy had a team of 10-12 people, he probably did a very good game. Think of this like a demo, or something like this, one reason for that - it's free.  I spend about 30 minutes playing this, very enjoyed, so, you shall try it if you like Half-life, just to remember the old days. 9\10			"

												As a ""curiosity"" or a ""demo"", it can be considered good. However, this mod is far away from deserving its' place on Steam Store. Doesn't have any story at all that would make any sense. Doesn't even build a tension. It's bland and tasteless, like the storm and the ship in this game. It also crashes at captain's room no matter what the hell I do, and that's about 5 minutes of playthrough.Whoever made this mod - shame on you. It's not necessarily the worst mod I've seen (there were worse for Postal 2, heh heh...), but even my grandma could make a better game for GoldSrc.			"

												I totally liked the mod and had a good time playing it. The only problem I experienced was something with performance, the developers seemd to do something advansed with the graphics, and I had low framerate, but that didnt bother much. Also its short, but not as if frustratingly short, just as decent mod/custom map. I think it is fairly smartly done, looks nice and has its atmosphere. I wonder why these 'people' hated it so much, apparently developers did nice work. Seems like these 'people' are actually freaking kids who got this game when it apeared in their suggestions due to playing their crappy cs or whatever. Wonder if these 'people' ever did actual mapping or modeling, and are they familiar with goldsource engine. Because if they arent, then how can they really estimate the work! As to understand art, u have to know art. And I wonder, what games actually mean to them. 'fun'? Well, if so, some♥♥♥♥♥♥of men they are. It just indicates that they are childish, ignorant people, seeking some decrepit pleasure. U are to blame urself, not developers, that u cant enjoy a game, when fairly good means provided.Totally recommend the game.Sorry for english, not home language.			"

I recommend playing hard mode if you have played the original half life but the best part about this mod is even if you dont want to play hard mode for a challenge you can just play easy and experiance the amazing story. its very inspirational and makes you think about the half life universe. I dont think i have much more to say, just an amazing mod to play to have a good time.			"

												This is really bad. The devs should be ashamed they pushed something like this through the door. Did they even play it? Spashul thanks to greenlight. So many spelling errors, and just bad bad stuff. Like others have said, a custom map this could easily have been. I just played it to laugh at how bad it was. Took me 26 minutes to beat it mostly because its glitchy and horrible. Its only one map pretty much, you go one way, talk to a guy after killing some marines, he rips himself to peices and throws himself down a elevator shaft then you back track and defeat the final boss which is just HL1s boss but sideways and with a tongue. Still better than whatever the VGAs say is best.			"

												it was all nice until the boss thing which is terribly difficult and funnily weird at the same time. this is obviously an unfinished demo. when you play it seems like the dev had the idea to make a rich story in this demo but then it all end with killing that thing and it stops.  i recommend it only because it's free and can be funny for those people who like challenging games  but the  incosistency of the story is laughable.

The mod's new skins for guns and enemies where something I liked, The Boss Wasn't too exciting, but the overall fighting was. The short time, while not holding my weekend up, was kind of nice. The game did have some hard bits that seemed more like mob rush bfore the final boss, and the first part could be skipped entirly, as the enemies just respawn.

												Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off - then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me. There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs - commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there. Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall northward. What do you see? - Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster - tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here? But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand - miles of them - leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues, - north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither? Once more. Say, you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent- minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries - stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever. But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.Game is bad, don't actually play it; runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥and only about half an hour long at best.

												For what it is and being a free 30ish minutes of fun it is a blast. The difficulty by the end actually scales pretty well considering how short it is. I would have liked a little more insight as to what is actually going on seeing as you only kind of know well that is unless you've beaten Half-Life itself. In which case you can more or less understand what is actually happening. If you already own Half-Life and you should grab this for about thirty minutes or so of fun. You can probobly beat it faster but I was trying to find hidden things and died due to my own mistakes. Definitely worth the grab.			"

												This mod like child who dropped on head.  It not work right with many crashes if you try to reload level.  Also, game has short life which is less than half life.Game basically mean you start on ship crossing channel trying to get 5 bedroom house after war in Syria.  You need to push boxes around full of cousin Mo's Adidas shirts.  It is crazy!  After climbing over and getting into ship you play mini horror setting with swinging doors.  Lift broken so use more boxes to climb into roofing and up ladder.  You kill many marine which is only good part then save man who do ship controls.The next part you need to go back across ship again to start.  This is much like Halo game where levels are made to feel massive by having you walk back across every part you already seen.  After getting to end of ship you fall into pit then have boss fight with Tim Henman's ego.After fight you get water boarded and then credits crash on you.Spoiler alert.This mod like eighth wife.  Do not play.  It is not good.			"

												This game started off ok but got bad quite quick.First off you get almost every weapon in the first area. Not that bad but you also face almost every single monster in the game in the same stage.After this fight you get to the tower. In my case I was below half health. You encounter a room with 3 soldiers in it. Ok. Kill them and begin to explore the room. Now after this fight you're probably low on health. So what happens next? The room is flooded with snarks. Took me several attempts to survive.You get through that and go into a room in which you encounter the first living other person. You get the crossbow and he opens a big door. Really thinking of Jurrasic Park. Apparently theres a big scary monster in the hanger. So we open the doors.You are then forced to back track all the way to the begining. Which has magically been repopulated with aliens.You eventually reach the hanger and face a really glitchy cutscene. Which is unskippable. The ""big scary monster appears"" which is really a reteaxtured barnicle attached to a ragdoll of the final Half Life boss.You get into the fight and realise that you have NO weapons. They are lying around you. This means that, no matter how conservative you have been, you combat the boss with next to no ammo. The boss is not even that hard. Although if you get caught on the barnicle tounge its almost an instant kill. If you die you have to go through the cutscene again.You kill the boss and take the crystals. End of the game. Thats it. Its meant to be backstory but its just a shoot em' up. The final boss is just a bit stronger than the rest.The best bit of the game was probably the final, non glitchy, cutscene.5.5/10			"

												Honestly, I see no problem with Before.Half Life: Before takes place before HL1, and you play as Andrew. Andrew is supposed to tkae a cyrstal from a ship, then check out this parrarel universe. It' fun to play, and not too hard. This game really deserves more attention.Along with that, this game has better graphics than HL1, better storyline, and it looks better than Counter Strike!Overall, this is one of the greatest reviews of all time!

												You really need to play this game to understand the reviews, comments and everyone else.No words can do this.... thing.... justice.Recommend as: What not to do as a game developer or publisher... I think ?In short, 0/10, merely an abandoned GLDSRC mapping homework project, VERY FALSELY advertised with extremely misleading description.I don't know where to start with this game.It's not a mod, it's just three custom maps, with custom models, textures, music and a voiceover.The map quality is severely unpolished, as if the developer quit his tutorial at 30% completion.I beat it in ""0.3 hours"" on HARD, three cramped up maps, one of which was a credits map, which was full of typos. There's no AI nodes, so you're stuck for 5 minutes at the start of each map ""Rebuilding node graph"". It had only three interesting gimmicks, one of them was TELEFONMAST!!Also, the game exited on its own after I beat it, glitching it open in the background and had to task-manager it.It was all over so quick, that I don't even remember anything, nor do I feel emotional connection with anything of what happened.

												I would say it isn't a game worth being on Greenlight. It's a very rough mod, it' more like a very good university project, rather than a published mod. Half Life fans can try it out, but maximum what you can get out of it is about 10 - 20 minutes.I'm barely giving this a recommendation, as this can be little bit of fun for some hardcore Half Life fans.

Difficulty is odd, with the boss at the end being a run around in a pin while you use the guns you only have for that moment and not the previous 15 minutes. But it's freeokay/10			"

												I generally try to enjoy games like these, as I am a big fan of the Half Life multiverse, its story, its characters, its social commentary. I believe many of these themes are present in this game, on par with such giants of the saga as Half Life 2, Half Life 2: Episode 2, and Portal 2, which by the way is part of the Half Life saga as said by noted Half Life writer, Mark Laidlaw, and accepted by the official canon, and wikia. This game offers many a social commentary on the themes of the age, such as the setting of a boat, fitting in with our current shipping problems. The character (the numerous one of them) is also witty as he helps you and is killed, showing how life can end at unsuspecting moments, a poetic metaphor. The story is relevant to most proto-typical post-modern story arcs, as it explains where the Xen crystal came from. I absolutely adored the witty satire and Communist metaphorsThat being said after playing it, I got a knife and slit my wrists until my pancreatic fluid flew out, then I pulled my lungs out from my chest and performed a vivisection on myself without anaesthetic and then threw myself to the wild boars.

												If you have Half-Life 1 on Steam, you might as well give this mod a whirl. Its a very short mod that can be finished in about 20 min as it consists of only 2 levels. It certainly isn't the most graphically advanced mod (it's Half-Life 1, man) but there are some fun elements in it. It keeps up the pace, which might not be hard with only 2 maps, but a lot of modern games fail in exactly this department. There are some funny sequences (which might not be intended to be funny, but whatevs). And in the end, this mod is FREE, so I really don't see a reason to complain about it.tl;dr: If you're bored, try this, it is 20mins of good fun. I also recorded a Let's Play of me playing it here:

												This was just awful. Not only was the story absolutely lackluster and paper-thin, the grammar used was god-awful. I never really got to 'finish' it, because it completely locked up my computer 3 times. First time around I started straight out of the chopper and my FPS promptly dropped to single figures, then locked up completely, which for someone running an AMD 7770 and an i5 is unacceptable. I restarted, and opened up Starcraft 2, Crysis, and Guild Wars 2 to check they worked fine (and they did). I approached it again carefully, lowered the resolution and clicked 'load'. I selected the latest 'save', and it completely locked up. I then free-fell through the boat, and the game froze again before dropping me INTO THE FINAL BOSS FIGHT. All this was, was running backwards and spraying it with shotgun shells. When it died, I walked to the crystal, and the screen went black (again) and my PC froze (again). Absolutely poor, no effort, left in his OWN ♥♥♥♥ing save-games. Horrendous compatibility issues for a crappy mod. Save yourself the fuss, it just isn't worth it.			"

												I played through this and it gave me very mixed feeling.Some gameplay and design ideas are cool, but the rest feels like rough work.I had to replay some parts repeatedly because I played on highest difficulty, also the balance is seems to be changed compared to original HL so I got confused by low damage of one enemies and higher damage of other. But why don't reduce marines' health? You meet few of them in a tiny room and it ruins the gameplay, forcing you to camp behind cover and use AI flaws.As a plus, It feels like some explosives weapons are situated on the map as neatly as you should use them (satchel to take out marines and tripmine for snarks). It's like in a tactical shooter. That's something I'd like to see in other mods!The final boss was very annoying and that was the worst boss fight experience ever. It's too fast all you do is grab the weapons, run in cirkles and shoot at that thing. It's worse than DOOM is.There's plenty of stuff that could've been done so much better. I see big potential in this mod, accurate work on small props, but there are other problems like wrong chosen materials for som enteties or bad gameplay design.			"

												I played the game. I am scarred. My character, forced against his will was teleported to a boat. Zombies appeared on the bottom of the staircase. He saw a soldier, who had commited suicide after playing this mod. I pushed on and killed the zombies. I felt a shiver down my spine. I found a shotgun. I killed a bullsquid with my shotgun. I paused the mod and got a coke. The coke tasted delicious, sweet and hydrating. From the middle of frikkin nowhere an alien grunt bursts out of a box (What idiot would store one in a box? What idiot would store one anyway?) I killed it. Then a weird bit happened where I jumped onto some crates. The for no reason I collapsed a stone thing. The was a box of houndeye so I shot them. I found some grenades. Then there was some sentrys that I threw my grenades at. I forced myself threw the door. And then I stopped playing cuz I got stuck on a bit where you have to crouch jump really high. I closed the game and went to my desktop. I went instantly to write this review. The coke had gone now. I drank it all. 10/10 - Good time killer. And soul killer.			"

												This is like HL: BOOM, only a bit more coherent and a bit more sane. And that's actually the problem. BOOM is art-house, abstract, creative and crazy. This is just... meh. I mean, that's the worst part - there's nothing to point your finger at and scream 'OMG LOL WHAT?!'; nothing memorable - it's just bland and okay. Disgustingly, unforgivably okay.The only teeny-tiny gimmick I liked was a helicopter turret at the beginning - I gotta admit that's pretty clever.Wish Before and BOOM had a crossover at some point!

												I sped-run the game in 6:22 minutes, and that includes THREE crashes, which I had to start again and resume my game,  about a minute of cinetmatics, AND the fact that the action that is supposed to happen to let you return to the beginning part of the map DIDN'T happen so I had to restart to a checkpoint again which costed another about 20-30 seconds.If all of those were removed, you're looking at a 3 minute time waster. But it is free, and it's still Half Life 1 gameplay, so it's still fun. You can still play more. I guess I reccomend it fi you don't have anything to do for a few minutes.			"

												This game has a few problems.  For instance, the staircase near the beginning beside the large pallet of crates;  if you jump off the side (which would be a common reaction to the monster you see coming up the stairs) you will get stuck.  The music was WAY too much for this game, and though this may just be a minor issue on my part, I found that I was unable to turn the music off, or even turn it down (without turning my computer volume down, of course).  I got stuck just trying to walk through a doorway near the broken elevator.  I had two random, unexplainable deaths while returning to the platform.  Overall that isnt a whole lot of problems, but for a 10 minute game, thats almost the entire experience.This may be nitpicky, but I feel that it was in bad taste that as soon as the game starts (which is after a brief introductory session to the environment), you immediately get attacked.  During any sort of loading screen, or non-interactive session is when most people are drinking their drink, eating a snack, scratching some part of their body, or some other passive activity to go along with the waiting period... so to be doing this while the game instantly transitions to a headcrab jumping in your face would be a major irritation to anyone in the middle of say, chugging a bottle of water, or something of the sort.The only real saving grace is that it was free.  This is no surprise considering how short it was; I am pretty sure it took me longer to write this review than it did to beat the game.The game is, at best, only worth playing to satisfy your curiosity.

												What you see there is rather a simple mod for Half-Life 1. It consist of a very short simple level where you travel from one end of ship to the another and then backtrack to the beggining, while being encountered by the enemies placed here and there with no pressure on you. Once done with it, you will be transported to the boss level, where you have to fight a rather easy boss, from who you just need to run away and shoot.Now, the quality of said mod. What it looks like to me is that it was one of those small mods that amateur modders would make, quitly post on moddiing forum and then get some feedback from it. It's short, it has some strange looking things, it puts you in linear path, giving you random new models and music, which probably were taken from somewhere else. With some stuff not making much of sense. Hell, the boss looks a lot like it was done using the tricks in level editor, looking more like a hack job. It even makes me nostalgic about times when I was part of Russian Serious Sam modding forum, where no one could truly make new elements or edit old ones, and just were abusing whatever level editor would allow them. Yet this one was taken much futher, being few years old, it suddenly surfaced on the front page of Steam, probably managing to get pass the Greenlight, and gained a lot of attention, having presentation of more promising mod that what it actually is. As a result it gave people a sheer dissapointed and is being viewed negatively.While if this would come out quietly on the forums or workshop, it would have gotten mostly positive responses, for it's still enjoyable. So I guess as a small mod, I can recommend it for bored half-lifers.It all surely brings a lot of question about reasons why Steam Greenlight exist when stuff like this can easily get past it. And the reason why the ""mods"" section in Steam exist, when there is now a workshop in most games. But then again, Valve didn't implent Steam Workshop to any of Half-Life games, so I can see why this thing had to appear on the front page. Which brings us to question why it wasn't implented to HL series...Funny thing, it's the only mod on Steam for Half-Life 1 that it still downloable through Steam.			"

												It was alright, and it had some things going for it. Enemy soldiers (Who humourously had ""1337"" on their radio.) had laser sights on their guns, and the sentrys also had lasers which looked nice.  The textures, while extremely bright and almost cartoony for the bright blue soldiers was goofy. But all in all the mod was short. The final boss was iffy as hell. If he eats you your game sort of crashes and you can't even save mid-boss either. The custom pistol model looked nice. I don't know if the author made it or if it was taken from somewhere else, but it was decent.Alltogether the mod was short, and it had pretty much no real storyline. It's free, but I don't really reccomend it. It's worth  just one playthrough, though as the author geninuely looked like he tried. If he ever makes another half life mod, he should hire more people, more voice actors, etc. The sotryline doesn't seem to flow anywhere. What is the alternate universe? Who is the guy on the ship? Why am I in a helcopter even through I'm a black mesa scientist? etc.I give this a thumbs down.			"

												I played this mod because i beat both opposinf force and the original HL1, I wanted to see what had happened in the beginning of the story(how they ot the artifact).I was very dissappointed to find out that you can beat this in 14 minutes,MINIMUM. The skins and the AI are pretty cool, but I only died like 2 times throughout the game, where as when i played half life 1 and OF, IT TOOK ME 500 deaths just to beat the game each. I'm sorry developer, but the boss is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY too easy to beat(Spoiler: just go in a circle and shoot with a shotgun). If you want to find out what happened, that's fine, but do it on wiki or through a lore, not this garbadge.			"

												As a fan of the Half Life franchise, this was a sort of enjoyable mod made for Half Life. While it is enjoyable, this mod has major problems. The biggest problem is that this is made by a company, and the mod's quality is not so high. If the logo ""Creashock Studios"" never came up while loading the game, I would have guessed these maps were made by one or two people. The reason I am saying this is because of the fact that there are major grammar issues everywhere you look, the ocean looks completely half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥along with the boss animation, and it is almost impossible to hear the scientist's voice with the sound of pounding rain playing in the background the whole time. These problems are gigantic because they detract from the story. The boss is not nearly as badass as the mod states it is, and I had to load the scientists lines over and over again to understand him because of the crappy subtitles plagued with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grammar. Some other minor gripes include the level design being pretty amateur at the beginning, any flying monster getting killed will clip in the middle of the sky, and the skybox dropping off clearly in the background. Also, this is not difficult. I never died besides purposefully killing myself so that I can load in order to hear the damn scientist. Do not advertise the difficulty if it is not difficult. The last boss can be beaten by a monkey, and I did it on my first try.			"

Since the map design is pretty slopy, it took me a while to figure out where to go and how to get there. Another thing is why the heck are there aliens guarding this magic crystal on a cargo carrier or whatever? I know there where some military guys in the control room but why aleins too? Are they suddenly working together? Also why is the end boss just Nihilanth trying to lick you from Half-Life and if this takes place before Half-Life then when you travel to Xen shouldnt he be dead? I guess he's Nihilanth's twin brother. One thing that was strange is that I beat the boss, saw the credits and saw ""The End"" and guess what happens next....the game crashes. Like what kind of ending is that? Enough about the stupid story and the crash or whatever. The one thing I really do like about this game is the music. Like holy crap who ever picked the music for this mod made a good choice atleast in my opinion. Anyway over all its not the worst thing I've ever seen but its pretty bad.

												There isn't too much to say. Keeps most of the same formula from the original Half Life, but offers just as much explanation as to what's going as the original. Pros: A few new character models and guns. It also offers an unusual setting for Half Life fans, which is well done in it's own right.Cons: HL:B is incredibly short (maybe 20 minutes if you explore everything). It also didn't look very polished in some areas, as solid blue textures appeared in many places and obviously weren't meant to be seen. None of it was game breaking though.Although the mod doesn't add much, it's free, easy to install as it's intergrated into Steam, and I did have fun playing it. I never felt like I had to try to have fun. There really isn't anything to lose. I'd recommend to people who liked the expansion packs.			"

												This game is quite entertaining, however I wish there was a more in depth story like there was in the First Half-life that this mod has. It was kind of cool to board a ship and acquire another crystal from Xen, but the final boss battle was very strange. It takes all weapons to take down this Nihilanth look-alike but it wasn't as satisfying as defeating the Final bosses of several games or that good feeling you get inside when you take down a strider with nothing but a gravity gun and a sticky mine. On a positive note I did enjoy the range of enemies and the limit of ammunition in this mod.Final verdict: If you're a Half-life fan like myself it's an entertaining 30 minutes of alien killing and simple puzzle solving.

There's only one 5-20 minute map to play, and you kill a 'boss' which itself is glitchy as ♥♥♥♥, then your screen turns black, and it crashes. I think we can all agree Bioshock Infinite was a good game, there's a reason this is not Bioshock. 0 / 10 Cold Sores			"

												It's ok.New levels ? Where ! In my opinion it was well crafted . We have a new background ,new characters ,cool brightly colored water animation ,and a new voice ! Though when I exited I had to use Ctrl Alt Delete . If you like half life and aren't pickey with minor problems like bad voice acting (not saying it did but thats my opinion) then you got yourself a game !!!!!			"

												Great game! Absolutely Fun! 100/10 For all aspects! Wait what? Im reviewing this game?  Ohh... Thought i was reviewing another ^^'This game gets a .... -2/10!I couldnt hear anything in this game, what so ever.It was massively short, took less than 10 minutes to beat.The enemies were easy, and the ""puzzles"" i kinda slept through.The typos were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly simple.I spent more time trying to fix the sound than playing the game.The only way to ""beat"" the boss is to run in circles while looking up and shooting with whatever gun you picked up.So, all in all, this heap of trash, or ""mod"", sucks.

Only solution is to run in circles look at the sky and empty your entire armory at The Nihilanth with a big♥♥♥♥♥tongue. A tongue that can slice through a shipping container, should you get the daft idea to hide in it.

												Very, very short. Contains all of like 3 maps, including one specifically for credits, and could likely have been accomplished with only one or two, given the small size of each map. AI is very static, probably because creatures are spawned in very confined areas with few travel options, if any. Ammo feels scarce, but really you only need it for a handful of ranged enemies, you can pretty much crowbar the rest.			"

												This poor excuse for a Half-Life mod does everything contrary to what its store page description says:""Intense action"" - Hardly. The most intense part of this mod is watching a random person in a dark, broken down elevator get eaten by a Barnacle.""Set in Half-Life universe"" - I have a hard time believing that as well. This doesn't fit into the Half-Life canon whatsoever. Why are creatures from Xen roaming this boat BEFORE your character finds the ""artefact"" (this mod is full of typos as well) that opens the portal to Xen? Furthermore, why are you on this boat in the first place? Why is there a military presence on this boat? Why was the Ninalanth in the boss fight flying around in a fixed pose with a Barnacle tongue? So many unanswered questions...""High quality soundtrack"" - I found the soundtrack to be extremely annoying. I tried turning the mp3 volume all the way down in the settings, but my ears were still violated by repetitive synthesizer beats. ""Spirit of Half-Life technology to enhance visuals"" - Spirit of Half-Life technology? What does that even mean? The visuals were by no means enhanced; rather, they were exactly the same as they were in the original Half-Life.""High definition models"" - It actually DOES ship with what the original Half-life defined as ""high definition"", but it really wasn't HD.Overall, I'd have to say my most recent bowel movement was A) more intense B) more true to Half-Life's canon C) of a better quality soundtrack D) more visually impressive and F) more HD than this mod.2/10, would much rather have played some sort of old text based adventure game.

												Well, I have to be honest... I'm at the part where you rescue te one guy that opens the main cargo lift... I don't really see anything wrong about this mod, and I'm being honest. People who say this game has no story is ignorant because it says the mission details in the start menu... and it may be 20 to 30 minutes, but it's pretty good for a free mod. So that's why I recommend it. My review may change due to me not finishing the mod yet.			"

												It is honestly a genuinely good MOD. many of the people here who play this MOD obviously expected a well made GAME, produced by professional game designers, not a bunch of guys with alot of free time and devotion. it is a good mod that has all of the spirit of half life in it. a difficult boss fight. a logic puzzle. lots of enemies that require you to think of new strategies on how to beat them opposed to just charging at them with a shotgun (in most cases) and i can see you've even re-done a gun. and the scenery isnt that bad. the story isnt the BEST thing there is. but ill take it over call of duty any day.

												This mod I can really say, wasnt really worth attention. I can say it was fun, but completely fails to attempt to fit into the Half Life Universe, though I will say it was well made for the most part, it isnt really worth the play. The easiest way to discribe the mod is, kinda like a playground. Theres no logic to the story or really any story at all. Also I think your character can ride lightning or something because he appears and disappears in literal flashes of lightning. So really give it a play if your currious, its not bad, just not really worth taking seriously.			"

												It's okay. It's good if you wanna just shut off your brain and just play for the camp factor. But, yeah.. It's quick to beat, drops you right in the middle of it with no back story, and if your going to have the guy pick up the weapons then why in the middle of a headcrab and a zombie? So, anyway [warning spoilers ahead] you're dropped on a ship with one goal in mind: Shoot stuff. That's really it. You gotta go through the aliens and military again, never explained. When you get to the boss fight, its the gonarch with a barnacle mentality. You gotta run around in circles and shoot shoot at it while avoiding the fire from the other aliens. It's not that hard to kill, oh and also don't go into the crate with the ammo. It will kill you. Once you kill 'lil gonarch, just wait 10-20 seconds and the game will end. All in end, it's meh.			"

												First time I saw this I was hyped as hell but after playing it I was like uh.... ok. I'll just cut straight to the point.-Not much story (even if there is a story, there are things that clashes with the original HL storyline)-meh gameplay (not much interesting gameplay to it (I loved HL's gameplay) just like playing a trail version of a fps)-if you're a HL fan you WILL be disappointed in the game and your mind will explode from asking so many questions that doesn't seem to have an answer.graphics wise, I don't judge a game on its graphics at all. I actually LOVE HL1's graphics probably because of nostalgia. If you have a thing for good graphics then sorry, playing this game will rustle your jimmies.In conclusion, fun to play a half life 1 game once in a while but this game could've been done soooooooooo much better not with its primitive graphics but with its story and gameplay			"

												The mod is indeed pretty bad. I do however have only a few positve things to say about it, those being:A. Has within the range of ""ok"" soundtrack, abliet only 6-7 tracks.B. All of the enimies are in HD and even a few are are shown to have custom textures, though this is far and few from only zombies and HECU soldiers....But other than that, this mod is mostly a trainwerck full of garbadge. Let me elaborate:For starters, there is no story line whatsoever, other than you are playing as a scientest, being order to retrive a crystal to open another world. Since when the crystal is a XEN crystal, it is implied that you are opening a portal to Xen. But then how the frick did a crystal get to Earth from Xen without traveling to EARTH, before the Resonance Cascade incedent occured due to a Xen crystal!? This even brings more into question about THIS topic because there is even already Xen wildlife on the game's maps! Most of which range from Headcrabs to even Alien Controllers!!And it gets worse, the final (and really only) boss of the mod happens to be none other than a screwed up-smaller version of the Nililanth, (the final boss of the orignal Half Life) with a reskined version of a barnacle attatched to it's mouth! I really don't think it is needed to be said why that was put into the game...Because the awnser is right in front of you....BAD. GAME. DESIGN.To top it off, the gameplay is about 15-20 minutes long with a no-death cap!!! What a fat load of BS stained over a thick polar bear rug that basically is saying that: ""Yeah this mod is free, but even then you won't get a lot of enterainment hours out of it!"" Well, basically that is 100% right about the entertainment hours part.Avoid this game at ALL costs. Unless you are looking for free time or speed run reasons, go for it! But I will say this, this game could have been so much more.....what a big dissapontment......			"

												   Half-Life: Before is a Half-Life mod that takes place presumably the Borealis (seen in Half-life 2 episode 2 and mentioned in portal 2)which contains the xen crystal used in the first Half-Life game made by Valve. First the graphics are amazing and the soundtrack was really killer for a modification made by i guess several people. The gameplay is about 15 minutes long and for a speedrunner could be 10 minutes long. The game doesn't really explain much to you ,but the way interpreted is your name is Andrew Winner from Black Stone ( a puppet of Black Mesa) and you just got done with sabotaging the Borealis' Portal technology powered by the Xen crystal making the Borealis pass through seveal dimensions including Xen and get the crystal. out of 10 i would give this a 7. 7/10			"

												CONS: Level design looks amateurish; some music choices were not good... felt like goat simulator music at some point... instead of half-lifePROS: (SPLOILER alert) The break at the ship's bridge was a good decision story and pace wise; The final boss is awesome.... it really looks scary even if it is a barnacle in a nihilant suit... it is a gigantic ugly baby that would chase you forever untill it sucks you wih its ugly barnacle mouth and devours you... ugly fast chasing killers are always scaryFINAL THOUGHTS: In the past 15 years, I have played a lot of half-life mods. This mod may not be the best of them, but it is a good effort. This is the first review I've written in the past 25 years. I decided to write this because, in my opinion, this mod does not deserve all the negative reviews it has gotten. It is NOT that bad. I don't understand how people who have never created anything in their lives, who have no idea of the effort and passion required to create anything can so easily talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about something just because they didn't like it, specially if they were not even charged for it nor forced to try it in first place.

												Well, I have to be honest... I'm at the part where you rescue te one guy that opens the main cargo lift... I don't really see anything wrong about this mod, and I'm being honest. People who say this game has no story is ignorant because it says the mission details in the start menu... and it may be 20 to 30 minutes, but it's pretty good for a free mod. So that's why I recommend it. My review may change due to me not finishing the mod yet.			"

												Half-Life Before is well... REALLY REALLY short. Like mabey 15 minutes. But this doesnt take away from the fun of the game. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good time but doesnt have much of that time to their disposal. (Btw i think there is an issue with the paths because steam thought i was playing before when i was playing deathmatch.)			"

												Everyone is writing reviews as if they expected this free mod (made without money in mind) was made to feel like a whole new Half Life game, and they probably do.This is a mod, it's free, it's made in someone's free time, and it has badass dynamic music and there's always a song playing. I first played the moddb version without realizing it was on steam, as well. I replayed it just for this review.And let me tell you, this is a fun, short yet sweet mod. As I said before, music is always playing and it's hella badass. Nearly all enemies are introduced in the beginning and that's okay because this is a free mod, not a life changing experience like the original Half Life game. Having all the weapons at your disposal (that don't use energy) immediately gives a great sense of freedom in disposing the enemies in front of you. I will admit that the final boss is cheap, but it tries something new and I commend that.8/10 good mod, remember it's not a AAA game			"

												I honestly don't know why this mod gets so much hate. While it is pretty short and yes, the boss battle is just as terrible as everyone says, keep in mind that someone took the time to make this. This is a mod that took actual effort to make possible. If you think this is a terrible mod for Half-Life, then you try making one. And if you're still are somehow insulted, just remember that this is FREE. No cost, no problem. So yes, with about an hour of gameplay, decent map design, and an interesting addition to the story; I do recommend this mod as a cool little addition to the Half-Life universe.			"

												You are Andrew Winner a Black Mesa scientist and you are flung onto a massive expansive boat in the middle of Xen to stop the resonance cascade and you are met with many memorable and likable charachters while under the deck of the boat and you are given so many emotions by playing through this mod and there are many moral choices you make as Andrew Winner and then the Military start teleporting in and you meet many friendly soldiers who also want to help you reach your goal and much is explained about Half-Life's deep lore and what made the military cover up the Incident you also meet friendly Xenians two and they revial why they are attacking Black Mesa, and you also meet many headcrabs and stumble upon their villages and learn the struggle headcrabs face and I'm just going to say I felt bad for killing so many headcrabs in both HL1 and HL2 you lean this all while travling in your ship the Black Stone aswell as upgrading it aswell. After a long jorney you finnally confront the boss of it all and without spoiling mutch you will feel bad for killing it. I await the sequel that Creator Shock studios are most defenetly making. Infact they are so generous for letting us experience this for free. I will never know how this all happened in the GoldSrc engine			"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern.

												Fun short lil story. It's only 3 maps long but it is still fun and the boss is somewhat challenging at first glance, however I was hopeful of more indepth portions of the story, more seceret locations for bonus gear (there are at best 2 I've found so either they're too good or there's too few), and just a few more helpful NPCs. Its a shame that hl1 wasnt good on graphics, I'd enjoy seeing this mod put into HL2 for the great graphics ^.^			"

												It's poor. It's not just plain ol' poor, it's♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. First of all, you get thrown in with exactly zero background or in-game story aside from the title screen blurb about some artifact. Second, the mod somehow manages to run at about 20 FPS - my machine is plenty, PLENTY powerful enough to run a modern game smoothly, let alone a mod of something from 1998. Third, there's none of HL's series trademark, the physics puzzle. All you do is push and jump a few crates.Last but not least, the music.What the HELL is that discordant, loud, ear-grinding abomination of a background music track supposed to be? More importantly, what is it doing anywhere outside a garbage can? It's extremely distracting and can't be turned down for some idioitic reason - I got about 30 seconds into trying to ignore the same jarring chord over and over and decided I had better things to do with my evening.Skip this mod and go fire up the original HL.

AI is very static, probably because creatures are spawned in very confined areas with few travel options, if any.

												Quite posssibly the greatest game I ever played. It starts you out on a boat in the middle of an ocean, seemingly boxed in by a badly-placed skybox. It's a parallel world obviously, so I let it slide. The first thing I see is a headcrab attacking me before I even have a weapon. As far as games go for inspiring you to get up and fight, this is genius! The music was even better, drowning out all the action and just adding to the atmosphere.I didn't finish the boat part. It was too scary. The genius level design of walking forward and getting killed by wonderfully-placed enemies was just too much for me.Overall, I give this game an 11/10. The $0 price tag is a bit steep, but it's well worth the investment.			"

												This game has a few problems.  For instance, the staircase near the beginning beside the large pallet of crates;  if you jump off the side (which would be a common reaction to the monster you see coming up the stairs) you will get stuck.  The music was WAY too much for this game, and though this may just be a minor issue on my part, I found that I was unable to turn the music off, or even turn it down (without turning my computer volume down, of course).  I got stuck just trying to walk through a doorway near the broken elevator.  I had two random, unexplainable deaths while returning to the platform.  Overall that isnt a whole lot of problems, but for a 10 minute game, thats almost the entire experience.This may be nitpicky, but I feel that it was in bad taste that as soon as the game starts (which is after a brief introductory session to the environment), you immediately get attacked.  During any sort of loading screen, or non-interactive session is when most people are drinking their drink, eating a snack, scratching some part of their body, or some other passive activity to go along with the waiting period... so to be doing this while the game instantly transitions to a headcrab jumping in your face would be a major irritation to anyone in the middle of say, chugging a bottle of water, or something of the sort.The only real saving grace is that it was free.  This is no surprise considering how short it was; I am pretty sure it took me longer to write this review than it did to beat the game.The game is, at best, only worth playing to satisfy your curiosity.

The skins and the AI are pretty cool, but I only died like 2 times throughout the game, where as when i played half life 1 and OF, IT TOOK ME 500 deaths just to beat the game each. I'm sorry developer, but the boss is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY too easy to beat(Spoiler: just go in a circle and shoot with a shotgun). If you want to find out what happened, that's fine, but do it on wiki or through a lore, not this garbadge.			"

												It was alright, and it had some things going for it. Enemy soldiers (Who humourously had ""1337"" on their radio.) had laser sights on their guns, and the sentrys also had lasers which looked nice.  The textures, while extremely bright and almost cartoony for the bright blue soldiers was goofy. But all in all the mod was short. The final boss was iffy as hell. If he eats you your game sort of crashes and you can't even save mid-boss either. The custom pistol model looked nice. I don't know if the author made it or if it was taken from somewhere else, but it was decent.Alltogether the mod was short, and it had pretty much no real storyline. It's free, but I don't really reccomend it. It's worth  just one playthrough, though as the author geninuely looked like he tried. If he ever makes another half life mod, he should hire more people, more voice actors, etc. The sotryline doesn't seem to flow anywhere. What is the alternate universe? Who is the guy on the ship? Why am I in a helcopter even through I'm a black mesa scientist? etc.I give this a thumbs down.			"

It never took you out of the game and had incredible pacing. On here you are introduced with a simplistic cutscene and 5 seconds into gameplay, a hedcrab is jumping at you and you've got an assault rifle. Not to mention, the music is insanely repetitive and takes you out of the game.I cant recommend this on, sorry.			"

Half-Life was a top-of-the-line game back in its day, and it was awesome getting a good reason to fire it back up again. :)Half-Life was always awesome because of its extreme flexibility. You could make any mod you wanted out of it -- from Day of Defeat, to The Specialist, to Natural Selection, to Counter Strike, to Earth's Special Forces, and the list goes on. Really good stuff.

												When I started playing, I had high expectations, really high expectations from a game bearing the name Half-life. Did the game deliver, hell yes. This game is phenomenally well crafted, It looks fantastic (For a game made in '98, but that is when the classic came out so it is a good thing), It sounds fantastic (Again, for '98 and again a good thing). The gameplay is perfect, using the same things that made Half-life great and getting the amount of each thing just right.I only have 2 problems with this game, the first being cutscenes, it has them. When I saw the cutscenes, even though they were only about a second long, it didn't feel Half-lifeish, meaning I wasn't seeing what was happening as I should in a Half-life game. The second problem with this game was fairly minor, as soon as you walk through the door to the ships control tower, there is a small rat,  just a rat, but a rat that keeps repeating a dying animation.If you can, play this, it's a fun, well crafted game, despite having some things I didn't like, they were minor and barely bothered me when playing the game. Game devs, well done.			"

												Ok well this mod isnt THAT bad but there where a lot of flaws (and I mean a lot) and things I hated about it. One thing is that they just teleport you into the game and then its like ""OK heres some weapons now figure out what to do yourself."" Since the map design is pretty slopy, it took me a while to figure out where to go and how to get there. Another thing is why the heck are there aliens guarding this magic crystal on a cargo carrier or whatever? I know there where some military guys in the control room but why aleins too? Are they suddenly working together? Also why is the end boss just Nihilanth trying to lick you from Half-Life and if this takes place before Half-Life then when you travel to Xen shouldnt he be dead? I guess he's Nihilanth's twin brother. One thing that was strange is that I beat the boss, saw the credits and saw ""The End"" and guess what happens next....the game crashes. Like what kind of ending is that? Enough about the stupid story and the crash or whatever. The one thing I really do like about this game is the music. Like holy crap who ever picked the music for this mod made a good choice atleast in my opinion. Anyway over all its not the worst thing I've ever seen but its pretty bad. Also since this game is a free mod why not give it a try I mean you have nothing to loose I guess. It will only last you about 10 to 20 minutes and I'm still not really recommending it but if your that bored why not?			"

												I played through this and it gave me very mixed feeling.Some gameplay and design ideas are cool, but the rest feels like rough work.I had to replay some parts repeatedly because I played on highest difficulty, also the balance is seems to be changed compared to original HL so I got confused by low damage of one enemies and higher damage of other. But why don't reduce marines' health? You meet few of them in a tiny room and it ruins the gameplay, forcing you to camp behind cover and use AI flaws.As a plus, It feels like some explosives weapons are situated on the map as neatly as you should use them (satchel to take out marines and tripmine for snarks). It's like in a tactical shooter. That's something I'd like to see in other mods!The final boss was very annoying and that was the worst boss fight experience ever. It's too fast all you do is grab the weapons, run in cirkles and shoot at that thing. It's worse than DOOM is.There's plenty of stuff that could've been done so much better. I see big potential in this mod, accurate work on small props, but there are other problems like wrong chosen materials for som enteties or bad gameplay design.			"

												Major Problems:-The ""story"" did not exist. If there was a ""story"" it could not exist in the Half-Life universe if this happened ""Before"" the Black Mesa Incident, otherwise there would be no aliens, and the Marines would not be trying to kill you; if the map took place in Xen, why would Marines be there and why would Black Mesa send you into a hostile environment without a weapon?-The game obviously did not go through a quality control filter considering that the pacing was bad, the English was terrible, and the game crashes constantly.Good things:-The music was ok (for the first two minutes it was played)-The new pistol model is good			"

												There isn't too much to say. Keeps most of the same formula from the original Half Life, but offers just as much explanation as to what's going as the original. Pros: A few new character models and guns. It also offers an unusual setting for Half Life fans, which is well done in it's own right.Cons: HL:B is incredibly short (maybe 20 minutes if you explore everything). It also didn't look very polished in some areas, as solid blue textures appeared in many places and obviously weren't meant to be seen. None of it was game breaking though.Although the mod doesn't add much, it's free, easy to install as it's intergrated into Steam, and I did have fun playing it. I never felt like I had to try to have fun. There really isn't anything to lose. I'd recommend to people who liked the expansion packs.			"

												This contains a whopping 20 minutes of gameplay that progresses in quite a shoddy fashion. The guns are acquired at a rate of basically one every twenty seconds, enemies seemingly pop out from behind every corner, and the mod forces you to use the HD pack graphics and will not allow the default Half Life models. There is basically no story to this mod, just go kill a bunch of Xen creatures and a few Marines mixed in for no reason at all. There is constant misspelling when it comes to the credits, and subtitles, and the dialogue (what little there is) is poorly written. The game culminates in a boss battle with what can only be summed up as the Nihilanth with a Barnacle attatched to its mouth. The boss fight is simple and involves running in circles and shooting upwards. This mod at no time ever makes the user think, you never feel as if you're in any real danger, and it entirely misses the essence and feel of the original Half Life. [4/10]			"

												It can literally be finished within 10 to 20 minutes. I thought the other reviewers were being hyperbolic, but it's the truth. It is, in essence, a simple fan map that was made to establish the origins of the sample used in Gordon Freeman's test chamber... which appears to be some random cargo ship that's filled with Xen creatures. It has some simple box puzzles, and some enemies to shoot. Really. That's all I can say without giving away the rest.Okay, twist my arm: a guy who speaks with poor spelling and grammar points at a poster of the final, scratch that, ONLY boss and says ""Watch out for this guy!"" AND THEN YOU FIGHT HIM.Worth a look? Maybe if you're studying level design and want an example of good intentions with sub-adequate execution. Or maybe to pick apart in Hammer to see how to create a bullet-sponge creature with a barnacle as its means of attack. But considering the size of both Half-Life and this mod, and remembering that it's 2013 (or later) and broadband Internet is basically the norm, it's a good way to kill a half hour or so on this trip down memory lane. That is, if you get nostalgic about the amount of custom maps for HL1 that used to come out, good, bad or otherwise.			"

												As a fan of the Half Life franchise, this was a sort of enjoyable mod made for Half Life. While it is enjoyable, this mod has major problems. The biggest problem is that this is made by a company, and the mod's quality is not so high. If the logo ""Creashock Studios"" never came up while loading the game, I would have guessed these maps were made by one or two people. The reason I am saying this is because of the fact that there are major grammar issues everywhere you look, the ocean looks completely half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥along with the boss animation, and it is almost impossible to hear the scientist's voice with the sound of pounding rain playing in the background the whole time. These problems are gigantic because they detract from the story. The boss is not nearly as badass as the mod states it is, and I had to load the scientists lines over and over again to understand him because of the crappy subtitles plagued with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grammar. Some other minor gripes include the level design being pretty amateur at the beginning, any flying monster getting killed will clip in the middle of the sky, and the skybox dropping off clearly in the background. Also, this is not difficult. I never died besides purposefully killing myself so that I can load in order to hear the damn scientist. Do not advertise the difficulty if it is not difficult. The last boss can be beaten by a monkey, and I did it on my first try.			"

												No offense to the creator, but this was terrible. It was very short and barely modified. I can tell the person who made this was lazy. *SPOILER ALERT* The Nihlanth at the end was impossible to beat and the model for him had no animations, and the tongue that came out was just a barnacle attached to him and was re-textured to have the same skin color as the Nihlanth. Plus, the game tries to say that the resonance cascade happened on the ship. It happened at Black Mesa. Also, only like 2 weapon models were changed and the rest were the same. Even the grammar was bad. Don't get me wrong, i love the Half-life series, absoulutely LOVE it, but this was terrible, and it's not even part of Half-Life, it's just a poorly-made fan mod. There are so many better fan-made mods out there trying to be greenlit. I don't even know how this one was.			"

												This is like HL: BOOM, only a bit more coherent and a bit more sane. And that's actually the problem. BOOM is art-house, abstract, creative and crazy. This is just... meh. I mean, that's the worst part - there's nothing to point your finger at and scream 'OMG LOL WHAT?!'; nothing memorable - it's just bland and okay. Disgustingly, unforgivably okay.The only teeny-tiny gimmick I liked was a helicopter turret at the beginning - I gotta admit that's pretty clever.Wish Before and BOOM had a crossover at some point!

												I played this mod because i beat both opposinf force and the original HL1, I wanted to see what had happened in the beginning of the story(how they ot the artifact).I was very dissappointed to find out that you can beat this in 14 minutes,MINIMUM. The skins and the AI are pretty cool, but I only died like 2 times throughout the game, where as when i played half life 1 and OF, IT TOOK ME 500 deaths just to beat the game each. I'm sorry developer, but the boss is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY too easy to beat(Spoiler: just go in a circle and shoot with a shotgun). If you want to find out what happened, that's fine, but do it on wiki or through a lore, not this garbadge.			"

												I wanted to try this mod out because is it quite literally the only Half-Life mod available for download and play through Steam, and also because I was hoping it would be a new Half-Life game experience I would enjoy.  Unortunately, I was thoroughly disappointed.  For starters, this mod has no real storyline, no intro, no prelude beyond ""You are Black Mesa scientiest Andrew Winner, sent to retrieve an Artifact from Xen.""  another that bothered me about it was that it dropped you straight into gameplay, and never gave you any indication of what you must do next to progress, meaning you are pretty much in the dark.  Finally, there is the fact the Intereact key binding is actually the Alternate Fire key binding, which is quite obviously a frustrating curve to get used to.  All in all, this mod just was not engaging or enjoyable for me.  Also, it froze my computer upon clicking ""Quit.""			"

But it is free, and it's still Half Life 1 gameplay, so it's still fun. You can still play more. I guess I reccomend it fi you don't have anything to do for a few minutes.			"

The text on objects seems unprofessional (for example, too many exclamation marks, inconsistency with ""artifact"" and ""artefact"", etc.). It seems like development was very rushed.It felt like a singleplayer version of early Counter Strike custom maps.All that being said, it's just a mod, and it doesn't cost anything, so there isn't much of a detriment for playing it. Honestly, give it a try, and 15 minutes later you'll be able to form your own opinion.			"

												Ten Minutes Of Trash.The game starts you off with little to no explanation, throwing the player, controlling protagonist Andrew Winner.You are on a quest to get a rare, untested Zen-native gem, on a transport cargo ship, holding a manner of Zen creatures.The game makes literally no sense. Why the name 'Ten Minutes Of Trash' i hear you cry.Because not only did i beat it in under ten minutes, i beat this pathetic attempt at a game that some how made it through steam's quality control system without dying. I can count multiple times where i walked off of the ship, and not being killed, but instead falling into the dark plain beneath the ocean, claimed by the death zone of the abyss. That pathetic rehash of a boss at the end was laughable, I killed it by walking in a circle, only shooting upwards, and what does it greet you with after collecting this anticipated jewel?A ♥♥♥♥ing black screen followed by credits i could top in microsoft's packaged movie maker.This game is a waste of megabytes, and a stain on half life's golden history.Don't even try it.

												This contains a whopping 20 minutes of gameplay that progresses in quite a shoddy fashion. The guns are acquired at a rate of basically one every twenty seconds, enemies seemingly pop out from behind every corner, and the mod forces you to use the HD pack graphics and will not allow the default Half Life models. There is basically no story to this mod, just go kill a bunch of Xen creatures and a few Marines mixed in for no reason at all. There is constant misspelling when it comes to the credits, and subtitles, and the dialogue (what little there is) is poorly written. The game culminates in a boss battle with what can only be summed up as the Nihilanth with a Barnacle attatched to its mouth. The boss fight is simple and involves running in circles and shooting upwards. This mod at no time ever makes the user think, you never feel as if you're in any real danger, and it entirely misses the essence and feel of the original Half Life. [4/10]			"

												It's free, and it takes up hardly any space on your computer, so it won't be an issue if you decide to install it.But honestly, it doesn't make any sense. Why is Nihilanth there? Didn't Freeman kill it?  OR  Won't he kill it in the future? That REALLY got me confused. I get that it's a mod not a full game, but still, very poor. Nothing is ever explained is my point.Not to mention the gameplay time. Just over 8 minutes. I'm sure that if I replay it now, I could be done with the game within 2-3 minutes. "

												The game is okay.... If your not  a die hard fan of Half Life then play it once and just beat it for the heck of it but you could beat it in like 15 minutes im glad its free because its terrible if you compare it to all the other games.... but i think it shouldnt have all this hate cuz its not that bad. im glad it runs through the half life launcher and its not  like a mod... but give it a shot its not that bad			"

												Despite reading all the bad reviews for Half Life: Before, I decided to give this a try. Before I start criticizing anything, I want to point out some of the good about this mod.Nice soundtracksNice credits sceneDecent actionThats it, now the bad.Took 15 minutes to complete, HL2: Lost Coast took me way longerToo easy and not challenging enoughSpelling errorsDidn't understand the storylineAnd lastly, the final boss was a disappointmentSo you spawn on this cargo ship and instantly get bitten by a headcrab, then you will go around killing mindless zombies and aliens in order to get to the Captain's deck where this dude ""Avtivates a cavgo lift"" So when you jump down it, kill the Nihilanth Barnacle that lies flat in mid air with zero animations by running around in circles like a psycho and that basically finishes this game! It even crashes on you.			"

												Upon installing the mod, it was a very small file, and took only half a minute to download even when my internet connection was derping about. This mod is short and sweet. combining improved textures, a kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack that kept me at the edge of my seat, and some pretty well thought out map design. However it has some flaws. One it was a bit too short, it kept me wanting more than what it had offered. Two I feel the final boss was a bit copy and paste with some slapped on mechanics. Lastely It just seemed a bit too underdone, and left many things unexplained, such as ""how did i get here?"" ""why are then xen aliens here?"" ""how is this in the half-life story?"" and it just left me with those questions. However this game was enjoyable, and its free so there isn't really much to complain about. Sure it's not that replayable, but it was an experience that I enjoyed. I recomend this to any half-life fans and modders.			"

												If you have Half-Life 1 on Steam, you might as well give this mod a whirl. Its a very short mod that can be finished in about 20 min as it consists of only 2 levels. It certainly isn't the most graphically advanced mod (it's Half-Life 1, man) but there are some fun elements in it. It keeps up the pace, which might not be hard with only 2 maps, but a lot of modern games fail in exactly this department. There are some funny sequences (which might not be intended to be funny, but whatevs). And in the end, this mod is FREE, so I really don't see a reason to complain about it.tl;dr: If you're bored, try this, it is 20mins of good fun. I also recorded a Let's Play of me playing it here:

I love half-life but this does nothing to the original game.it's so many short and stupid ideas crammed into a tiny game.It is free yes, but I feel ripped off.Being molested by a T-Rex would be more pleasent than playing this.Animations are bad, spelling in the subtitles is bad, the game as a whole is just horrible.-1/10, will never recommend anyone plays this.

												You start the game. You shoot aliens for 5 minutes. Then you waste a minute or two on physics puzzles that only exist to pad out the gameplay. Then you go in a door. Then you shoot a couple more aliens. You climb an elevator. You kill three soldiers. Then you backtrack, making sure you kill all the monsters as you go (because if you miss even one, you'll die falling down the pit instead of fighting the final boss for some reason). Then you fight a barnacle attached to the HL1 boss with no animations. By 'fight' I mean look up, run backwards in circles and mash left click. Then end.Good thing this is free.

												When l downloaded the mod, l expected it to be a simple, fun and alternate version of Half-Life. Boy, was l wrong. How did this blob of crap (no offense) get from Greenlight to a full game?! I agree with the ratings on this mod.Don't judge me yet, l love Half-Life. But the games are supposed to be challenging, full of puzzles and the plotline is and always will be different and creative, if not sometimes mysterious. This modification sadly was not good enough.Although the NPCs were good at attacking me here and there, once I got near the bridge of the ship, I got a little bored. Killing aliens and enemy soldiers can be fun, only if they aren't placed in most expected places. Now, you can tell me that the same thing happens in other games like Half-LIfe 2, but those games didn't give away expectations about what will happen at the next moment, when this game unfortunately, did, in many different ways.Another problem is that these modifications for the franchise should be, in my opinion, longer than at least than fifteen minutes. Any chapter of Half-Life, its sequels, its spinoffs, or mods can take up mostly 25-40 minutes of your time. I ran from one end of the cargo ship to the other and back in almost eight minutes (not speedrunning!).Fortunately, for you, game-creator, there was one one thing l thought was interesting -  THE BOSS. I thought when jumping into the final level, ""okay, grab the artifact, end the game, play CS:GO next"". But then when the giant beast broke through the vent, 'stole' the crystal, and wanted to eat me, trying to kill it was a hard challenge, mind you. I died four times before finishing the game. (The whole time l was playing in HARD mode)Well, that about wraps up the negative nitpicks for this game. Don't call me harsh, or call me a bully, or even a dumb f**k who doesn't know what gaming is all about. Because those insults are not true. All l'm saying is this game..no, sorry-MOD, could have been a little better.			"

												When l downloaded the mod, l expected it to be a simple, fun and alternate version of Half-Life. Boy, was l wrong. How did this blob of crap (no offense) get from Greenlight to a full game?! I agree with the ratings on this mod.Don't judge me yet, l love Half-Life. But the games are supposed to be challenging, full of puzzles and the plotline is and always will be different and creative, if not sometimes mysterious. This modification sadly was not good enough.Although the NPCs were good at attacking me here and there, once I got near the bridge of the ship, I got a little bored. Killing aliens and enemy soldiers can be fun, only if they aren't placed in most expected places. Now, you can tell me that the same thing happens in other games like Half-LIfe 2, but those games didn't give away expectations about what will happen at the next moment, when this game unfortunately, did, in many different ways.Another problem is that these modifications for the franchise should be, in my opinion, longer than at least than fifteen minutes. Any chapter of Half-Life, its sequels, its spinoffs, or mods can take up mostly 25-40 minutes of your time. I ran from one end of the cargo ship to the other and back in almost eight minutes (not speedrunning!).Fortunately, for you, game-creator, there was one one thing l thought was interesting -  THE BOSS. I thought when jumping into the final level, ""okay, grab the artifact, end the game, play CS:GO next"". But then when the giant beast broke through the vent, 'stole' the crystal, and wanted to eat me, trying to kill it was a hard challenge, mind you. I died four times before finishing the game. (The whole time l was playing in HARD mode)Well, that about wraps up the negative nitpicks for this game. Don't call me harsh, or call me a bully, or even a dumb f**k who doesn't know what gaming is all about. Because those insults are not true. All l'm saying is this game..no, sorry-MOD, could have been a little better.			"

												I went into this mod after reading some comments and I thought I would hate it, but it actually turned out to be pretty fun. The levels have lots of detail and are quite pretty for goldsrc, and the level design rewards thinking outside of the box. The final boss was also better than I expected, which is a plus. My only complaint is that theres no real indication of how you should progress through the level, and it can sometimes be difficult to find out what you have to do to move forward. If your a fan of half life, and you just want to play some more of it, this should keep you happy for about half an hour.			"

The text on objects seems unprofessional (for example, too many exclamation marks, inconsistency with ""artifact"" and ""artefact"", etc.). It seems like development was very rushed.It felt like a singleplayer version of early Counter Strike custom maps.All that being said, it's just a mod, and it doesn't cost anything, so there isn't much of a detriment for playing it. Honestly, give it a try, and 15 minutes later you'll be able to form your own opinion.			"

												It's short, but what were you actually expecting from gold source. it's a lot like a classic doom map in the fact that the enemies are practicly just the only thing there and a few sections are just tedious like the section with the alien insects (I forgot the name Feel free to rage in comments) in the main tower just to keep the player somewhat mentally stimulated from the lack of puzzles in a half-life mod which the number one thing you had to do in that game are puzzles. I know the creator probably put time into it, but the final boss is just the final boss of half-life pasted onto a moving barnicle (persumably the baby version of nithalanth or whatever that bosses name is anymore). I think that this is just a bad mod that somehow made its way onto steam greenlight or not and the devs realized they are not ready for steam yet can't get this off steam.			"

												While its not THAT BAD, its still pretty bad.If you're expecting a story like the other Half-Life games, you aren't going to find it here. The story in this game doesn't make any canonical sense. It implies that before the events of the Black Mesa Incident, there were places where these aliens could be found beyond Xen, and that humans had been turned into headcrab zombies before. The physics puzzles in this game are annoying as hell too. You have to push these really heavy boxes while you're getting attacked by at least 5 aliens so that you can climb to the next area, its annoying as hell. On top of that, there are also soldiers that are apparently helping the aliens to make sure you don't get the crystal, as if it didn't get any more confusing. Oh but it gets better, the final boss is apparently supposed to be a younger version of the Nihilanth from Half-Life 1. It has the laziest AI I've ever seen - it just chases you in circles and it has a barnacle tounge that you cannot escape from, and if he gets you, you have to watch the entire cutscene where he spawns again. At that point I just said ♥♥♥♥ it and stopped playing.TL;DR - Don't play it.			"

												I saw the reviews and tried giving this game a chance, I really did.  Its just not good.  The story is unclear you gain weapons too fast enemies are scattered in random places boxes move too slow and the list goes on.			"

												The game wasn't very fun, unless you play half-life just for the shooting and not for story or small puzzles. It doesn't have a story, or atleast one that is mentioned, and you just get thrown straight into the game. It was way shorter than most other mods. Before you download this thing, try other mods to see how they did it.			"

												I mean it's free and the texture's are amazing no doubt! The grunts new model was to die for and the  scientist and what ever else there was (barney aliens ect) but the boss sucks change that make story longer and I see why it's on the boat maybe the boat is transfering the crystal to black mesa or something and the aliens want it back idk just needs some work give the dev a break.

												Was hoping for Xen exploring as the Survey Team but instead got 5-10 mins of kill 30 enemies on a boat just to fight a reskined barnicle with extra health. Was disapointed in this mod,could have been alot better judging from the name of it.Wouldn't recommend playing unless you want to kill 5 quick minutes. Other then that don't bother			"

												I spent longer downloading the mod than the developer spent putting effort into making it.			"
