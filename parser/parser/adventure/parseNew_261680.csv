												Journals are personal things; housing our thoughts, experiences, and deepest secrets as we pour our hearts out into their pages. In a similar way Journal the game is also deeply personal to its developer, Richard Perrin, being kicked around for nearly a decade and only just coming to fruition after passing through numerous different forms and surviving setback after setback. It's a passion project that needed to see the light of day regardless of how long it took to do so, but as any artist should know, after spending so long with your creation it's easy to lose sight of where it's headed and what it has become. For all the time and devotion put into it, Journal is not the masterpiece its creator no doubt envisioned it to be, unfortunately materializing as something far less profound and memorable.Journal is the story of a girl. A girl having a very hard time attempting to come to terms with the recent upheaval of her life, as well as the general pains of youth attempting to find who she is in the world. It's a melancholy tale that attempts to deal with heavy problems in a realistic, relatable manner, but for all its endeavors to tell a more down-to-earth story than you often see in games, it overplays its hand by throwing its character through far too many hardships without ever elaborating on any of them. It comes off as disingenuous and almost exploitative, like an outsider trying to explain someone else's troubles without anything more than a surface knowledge of what someone experiencing them actually feels like. It's hard to feel empathetic when events unfold like those of a soap opera; without any explanation or justification, only serving to move the narrative onto yet another contrived moment.The cliches extend to the characters themselves, all of which encompass some form of clique or extreme to better fit into their role of providing the protagonist with a wall to bounce questions off of, with the answer being largely insignificance. One of my biggest issues with the characters and narrative on the whole is how it presents an illusion of choice with no real changes or consequences to speak of. Something you say may affect a handful of lines of dialog (usually not beyond the immediate scene) but the plot itself remains the same, with the most important moments being completely out of the player's control despite the dialog options continually alluding to something more, as if you actually have some control of the outcome.The worst of these moments are those that retain pertinent information until after you've had to make seemingly important decisions, without being given the facts to do so. For example, early on a friend of your character is accused of breaking a window, an act she denies and you are inclined to agree with, only later finding out that you were the one who accused her in the first place (and as is soon revealed, actually broke the window and were hiding the blame). These revelations come too late though, as you are forced to choose a side prior to being made aware of what actually transpired. It's like walking into a play during the second act; you're expected to already know the characters, their motives, and the the events that have occurred. By the end of the game I was thoroughly detached from the protagonist, as her actions became more selfish and out of character as the game progressed, and I was helpless to influence any of it or even be clued in as to WHY she was doing what she was. For what is essentially an adventure game with the puzzles and exploration removed, for the dialog and characters to be so uninteresting and half-baked made for an experience that felt hollow.It might not seem it, but this was a hard review to write. I wanted so badly to be drawn into the beautiful artwork and somber soundtrack which seem so ready to compliment a deeper story than we've become accustomed to, but it all fell flat. Perhaps it's a side-effect of Journal's tumultuous development process, but something went awry and the end result is less than amazing. It's hard for me to pan something that was obviously close to its creator's heart, but when it is flawed at such a fundamental level I can't write it off as something that can be overlooked, but instead have to dismiss it as a whole. Like the journal from the title, it's almost as if large portions of the game simply vanished, leaving you with a shell of what might have once been.Full disclosure: this game was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												I can appreciate games with more focus on storytelling rather than gameplay (I even like Gone Home which a lot of people hate), but I did not like this game. It's not a bad game, the voice acting is good and sketchy artstyle is really appealing but I could not sympathize with the unnamed protagonist nor did I have any interest in her. She's a troublemaker who lies, cheats, and steals... and breaks windows. Even if you pick the positive moral choices, it doesn't affect the outcome of the story and as a result, she's still a ♥♥♥♥♥.Throughout the whole game, you're left wondering what it is that she's going through that has caused her to behave this way. I felt like the story was a bit of a muddle and that it wasn't really going anywhere as they leave out details for pretty much everything, such as her parent's divorce, her grandmother's sudden change of behaviour, and the package you have to pick up from the post office. They don't really contribute to the story as the ending explains why she has been acting out.The ending (which I won't spoil) was very cheesy and it was clearly meant to be sentimental but it just happened so abruptly. Nothing in this game has lead to the events of the ending, except for the carnival interludes maybe. I feel like I would've sympathize with the character more if they told us this in the first place rather than trying to make it into a huge twist.Is this game trying to tell us a story about the life of a teenage girl or was it meant to be deeper? Either way, the disjointed narrative structure of the game just shoehorns more mysteries and it was all pointless. They try to tell so much story within the short legth of the game. I bought this game with my disposable income of £1.74 as the game was 75% off. You can complete this game within an hour and a half and the achievements, as well as the game of course, is very easy. Unless the game is at that price, I would avoid. It's a love it or hate it game but one with no incentives to play it through the second time.5/10 - AVERAGE			"

""Memory is not particularly linear - it is associative, repetitive, subjective and porous."" - Dana SpiottaThis whole little game that Richard Perrin was working on for 10 years is actually about memory, and how definitely subjective it is. Any event, any occurrence that we either live ourselves or solely witness, will be retold through a certain perception. There is no such a thing as the truth once an event is recalled from the memory. There is only our own experience, thus, any narrator is eventually an unreliable narrator. Journal is a perfect example of this notion.The narrative centers a 5 day period in a nameless teenage girl's life when she's been trying to deal with both expected troubles of growing up, establishing a character, making choices, learning hard earned truths and living consequences; and a specific, singular disaster fundamentally too heavy for her young being to deal with. Through detached and off dialogue options, abhorrently selfish exclamations and numbing expressions, we take a walk. Journal is an interesting, yet eventually surreal and nettlesome experience.The artwork is hand drawn, picking a thin balance between beautiful and creepy, and that many would basically define as being eerie. A melancholy, water color environment combined with slender, faceless characters do create our setting. The whole display screams detachment and an inability of adaptation with the world. A failure to emphasize is written all over the artwork. The music changes as our heroine change places within a side scrolling environment from ""feeling blue"" to ""something's off"" any minute. We are given short stories told with shadow plays between chapters to declare some bitter life lessons now and then, and complete a whole playthrough within 2 hours.I do adore story driven or narrative games mostly. But defining Journal to be either story driven, or narrative would be an understatement and probably even a completely wrong definition. In this collection of personal expressions, the narrative is completely subjective with little to no room for diverse character progression. Contrary to player expectation with the choice options presented in game, our protagonist already displays a precognized set of actions. Her mentality, her actions and reactions are not actually alterable. Any and all events that we encounter within the game, are already lived, thus categorized and concluded within the mind of our heroine. We are solely there to witness her personal recognition of events rather than having a gameplay. She is a bitter, troubled, detached, numb child; stuck in an existential crisis.Is this a bad thing for us to witness in a game? Quite possibly not. This game was one of the best examples of ""unreliable narrator"" in any game I've seen before. Yet, it also comes with the direct obstacle of constantly misinforming the player, making him/her walk into dialogues with semi-truths, wrongly presented information and endless defense mechanisms, evading for any kind of truth to be discovered. Being trapped within the narration, you are doomed to make wrong choices inconsequentially. Thus, there is no immersion, no character sympathy or even empathy, no control over any outcome. You are forced to witness endless apathy directed through stereotyped declarations.The game is most definitely a great art project, and managed to accomplish what it has come to aspire: an ode to memory, perception and illusion of understanding. Yet, I find myself failing to recommend the game in the end. It is not fun to play. It is impossible for one to actually emphasize with the setting. It all is fleeting, surreal and numbing... as it was probably intended to be so. I most certainly appreciate it, yet fail to recognize the beauty of this kind of existentialist numbness as gameplay. There is no hate, no love, no fear, no bravery... ""Nothing"" wrapped in pretty colors. Pick it on sale if you'd like to take an unusual experience with the grand illusion of choice.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												To debate whether this game has artistic merit or if it is worth buying seems almost pointless. The game is currently 80 minutes, and even then it is where the game has you make all the choices you can achieve before proceeding. It is not a game like Gone Home, where the details to every little thing are incredible. The game has rough edges where the main character would often clip at edges or I would go through a door twice due to tapping it once and going to the left slightly. But...I feel like it is a game that needs to happen for the continuation of the medium of games.The character goes by unamed, and the first few minutes are rather naively optimistic. You are exploring why the pages of your journal are missing! It will be a intriquing journey of mystery and investigation. But the game hides what your character did and did not do, thus leading to misenterpretations where you make a choice that you regret instantly. But, the game benefits from these choices. It is a very truthful game where the main character is not a vessel or a blank slate for the player, but is truly a confused young girl who is unsure of what is the right or wrong thing to say or do. Gone Home is where you view the experiences of a confused girl, while Journal is more about BEING a confused girl. I am really glad that my character doesn't agree with my own stance on the matter, even when she makes a choice I would have made because I am a seperate person from what her life is.The art, while getting a lot of praise from people, to me is very simplistic and helps achieve a children's story feel that betrays the true meaning of the game. You do not help people in this game, nor do you make lifes better. It is what a child would feel when going through such a painful moment in their life, and I really do respect and admire a game that can achieve such clarity on the subject of childhood innocence and even if it is possible.I say that it is a important step in video games is because this is a really personal story for the writer and artist. It is not a game where there is any power trip nor any sense of accomplishment, and is really not about finding the truth or letting go of things. It's about a normal person dealing with things that can never be undone or fixed. To spoil the ending or even the moments within it would ruin the experience of actually going through it.Would I recommend this: YESIt is a very close and personal game, where the length or technical lack of polish does not ruin or even bring down the honesty and bluntness Journal has brought. I wish I could say specifics, but to do that would ruin your own experience with it.Suggestion for developer: I believe more polish to the game would be benefical, and more stories from the writer and artist would be greatly appreciated.

												This is a quiet, lovely story about grief, remembrance, loss, and adolescence.  I'm sure a lot of people in the ""this is not a game"" camp would be quick to dismiss it, but I know I rather like games that have a great narritive and are more of an interactive story.  I'd most compare this to a visual novel...there's no puzzles to solve but rather just choices in responses to questions.  The visual style is really interesting...the entire game takes place on pieces of paper, which flip as you change scenes and everything looks like a drawing.  The game is rather brief though...it took me about 2 hours.  It can probably be done in far less if you don't take the time to talk to everyone.  I'd say to definitely wait until it's on sale, the full price isn't worth it, but it IS worth getting.			"

												""A little schoolgirl of divorced parents livethrough a phasis of regrets and sorries""From the creator of ""Kairo"" comes this nice little point&click adventure. The story is well told and the graphics are handdrawn. Once when you have started you can walk inside your opened journal (that's a diary with graphics and written). You speak to your school collegues and ppl from town. It's completely controlled over arrow keys + space. At the end of each chapter there comes this shadow puppet theater. It's introduced over an awful looking 3D animation in your bedroom. Mostly it tells you a fairytale related to your actual life. I would not say the game is bad. But it looks like a cheap flashgame and feels quite overpriced (still 1.79 EUR on sale).			"

												I will admit it: at first, I didn't like Journal. The main character comes across as an unlikable narrator. As other negative reviews have mentioned, she steals, lies, and hurts her friends. It's hard to find anything to like about her as you begin her story. But then the experience broadens, and you begin to see some of the reasons why she is making poor choices. One of the girl's regrettable experiences hit home so much that I was emotionally jarred. Perhaps because I was also once a teenage girl, I found myself relating heavily to her story. You watch as she struggles through the realities of divorce, relationships, death, and the daily nonsense of life. It is an extremely personal tale, and I was floored by what the game achieved. I could have easily been that girl, through some of the ways she related to others and the choices she made. I didn't like myself then, and the girl in the game doesn't like herself now. Journal is in some ways a tragic work. How much you like the game will possibly depend on how much you relate to her and her journey. There are some minor flaws in the experience. It can be difficult at times to determine where the next conversation trigger is, so that you may talk to some individuals multiple times fruitlessly, trying to figure out what you're supposed to do.  You will wander over the same settings again and again, although this is accomplished at a pretty brisk pace that never feels too cumbersome. Some of the dialoge choices could be clearer; at times, I was unsure what my character was getting ready to communicate by the options. Still, for the flaws, I absolutely recommend Journal. It blends painful realism with touches of imagination that create a story that can stun you in the accomplishment of its narrative arc. I applaud Locked Door Puzzle for what they've made: Journal is a piece of art.			"

												As much as I really wanted this game, and even wanted to give it a good review I just can't. I am sitting here fresh after playing it, feeling terrible after the game. Most of the time I can review games with a better manner of my feelings. This game however even though it made me feel terrible, it was for all the wrong reasons.You have absolutely no influence in this game what-so-ever. When I found out this girl was a bit of a trouble maker I thought I could just make the right choices and avoid it. To no avail though. And decisions were able to be made before you even knew what was going on. Like the broken window, your friend is upset because everyone thinks she did it, you tell her you know you didn't do it just to hear from someone else you were the one saying she did it.You also steal from charity, but not by choice, and you're not even aware of it until your stopped by a police officer and your character admits she stole. Then you can't even take it back by first choice, you have to admit it to your mother. The character is very very selfish and by the end of it I just hated her, and this game. The circus ""cut scenes"" were completely comfusing and I feel so terrible because I wasted money on this. It had been in development for a long time, one would expect better gameplay from it. I just cannot reccomend this game, because as much as I love games with stories, this just isn't a good one.			"

												There isn't enough detail to make the characters feel alive.  It's all very surface. Telling, not showing. For a narrative based game, that kind of thing is vital.I don't have the same problem with the main character's moral choices other people have. I like that she wasn't perfect but from the player's perspective, there's little to no fallout from her actions. For instance, at some point during the game (minor spoiler) she totally messes up her relationship with someone she's close to and NOTHING HAPPENS. There's a brief moment of ""oh, that's a darn shame. I probably should have acted differently there, huh?"" I don't think the character is ever mentioned again. It's really frustrating.Overall,  this game feels more like a piece of personal writing someone wrote as therapy, rather than something intended for public consumption. The carnival interludes are especially awkward.			"

												7/10 - A Heavy Offering of Nostalgia; Blast from the past!My girlfriend caught me playing this game; It's the same feeling as being caught masturbating. I was embarrassed and a little defensive. If you really wanted to engage in this activity... it should be done in private!This game hooked me in and kept me interested mainly due to the fact that I felt as though I was reliving my past. If you are at least 20 then you probably at some point utilized AOL instant messenger. This game takes place entirely within the confines of your computer. The game spans several years through college; you begin talking to a girl from your past and each year the dynamic of the relationship changes. Things get real pretty fast and the path you choose may differ from time to time. Just when you think you have this one figured out... You may be wrong.Worth $5 or so; it’s better than I thought it would be, but grab on-sale!  Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												This game I quite enjoyed. First off, I was surprised that it was by the same developer(s) as crafted Kairo, although in retrospect, it made sense storywise a bit. Definitely demonstrated some variety in their ability to craft games. The secret ending is something they like to do, and it seems to be more about their whimsy than about being part of the actual game, which I appreciate.Anyway, as to the actual game. This is a curious blend of interactive novel and point and click adventure. It was very well written in my opinion. The 2-D design was fairly perfect for this game. The artwork itself was very cool, in that it seemed to be sketchbook art given life, which I thought was pretty neat.So, in the game, you play as a high school teen who seems to be having some issues in her life. Her friendships are strained, her family relationships are strained, her schoolwork is suffering, etc...As you explore this world, more is revealed, and it leads you on a bit of a path to self discovery. However, what I thought was even more interesting was the Sixth Sense (movie) approach to story telling in this game, which is to say that everything that happens in the game has a greater prupose that, upon finishintg the game, will all fall into place seamlessly and present an entirely different picture after than you might have thought was happening during the course of events that led you through this experience. I thought that was particularly well handled, especially considered that this was obviously a cathartic experience for the games writer as wellAll told, I think this game deserved about a 7.5 out of 10, but I also think that depending on your real life circumstances prior to playing this game, the ratings could easily be higher. I was glad to be given this window into the writers mind a bit. There are also some very nice film reels at the end of the game that also give some real life perspective to the in game story....and that secret ending....make sure you see it. It's really easy to accomplish and will only take you about 5 minutes longer to take the necessary steps (which can be found in the Community Hub if you dont feel like exploring...but basically finishing the game unlocks new dialogue towards the beginning of a second playthrough which will allow you to unlock the secret ending without having to play through the entire game again).

												The game provides us with some interesting situations, ranging from the social interactions with peers, to conversations with a priest, the deceased and a homeless person. We get a more or less subtle view into each of their lives, which adds up to a bigger picture. A bigger picture of life as a hardship. The human condition, if you will. Especially in the time as a teenager. Insecurity, stress, insufferable amounts of complexes and general frailty - when it comes to the need of being accepted by the people around you - are things which are prominent in the years of being a teenager; in the years of being at all, to be honest. Where the desperate attention seeking can spring into action actions which in retrospect can be seen as abhorrent. But with a little bit of care, consideration, empathy, with a little bit of knowledge and insight into a persons motivations, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THESE THINGS, understanding these idiosyncrasies can be much easier. The person being a ""♥♥♥♥♥"" can at the same time at home deal with angry parents, destructive parents, alcoholic parents, whatever concoction of behaviorism you can imagine and thereby themselves become a person like their parent, for the simple reason of learning behavior from your surrounding.A depressed, absent-minded mother who blames you for her stress and angst, and a father who left you stranded with her will surely make you desperate for attention, in whatever way possible, especially when you're falling out with your friends, or the people you assumed were your friends. This is the case of our protagonist. Making her actions understandable, as I've seen people think otherwise. We follow our maincharacter through a hodgepodge of a timeline, where we often get to see the consequences of something she'd done wrong. As in cheating on a test, stealing a snow globe and breaking a window and blaming it on her friend. This is where we need to get the notion of what a game ""SHOULD"" be out of our head. We don't have a say in these things, we are merely a witness. Sure, we control everything but we're not really in control. We are watching everything unfold in front of us without any say. For once I find this positive. It's a personal story, why should the player interject their own personality, morality or will? Why plaster your face onto a character when it's clearly not meant to be that way? Why forcefully demand the relatability of everything any character does, that's why the personality of most gamecharacters are nonexistent. Why are we afraid of people not being like us? Let this game be an expansion of your view of people. Why not let a character be itself, and then the analysing could be of interest. And this is where my point is to some critique I've seen for the game. This game is not about trying to let you choose how to handle a situation, it's showing you the situation of this particular teenage girl. It's showing you the aftermath of some regrettable actions. It's showing you how it affects a person, how guilty a person can feel because of a mistake they barely had any real reason behind. And how your peers and upper echelons shame you because of these mistakes. It show's you the protagonist being shunned by friends and family because of silly mistakes, and the fact that you feel the need to steer her actions lets you know that the game is doing what it intends to do. The stereotypical feel of the characters in this game is because they are real characteristics of real people. They are very common issues, personality types, and very typical scenarios for people to be in. The thing about putting this in a game is to illustrate it somehow, and get an outlet for these things you think about, as you do. To get past things. To put things into perspective. It's all there, you just need to look close enough. The game doesn't hit you in the face with its messages, or it's insights. But it's all there. From the carnival stories, the distorted mirrors of better times, memories being forgotten of the people that passed, the lying lion who did anything just to get another bite of food - in reality a metaphor for attention? I need to play it again, you should play it, think about it. Discuss it. I wish I wasn't as tired as I am right now, I don't think I can do the game justice. It's not the most beautiful game, not the most intricate, not the most interesting, but it has its moments. It's a game that tries to give us something, more than just a couple hours of time spent. I will always pay for a game with a good concept, a game that tries to do something interesting. This game certainly did, even though it may have been too much to actually get across in the best way possible. But I think most of it is already there, the teenage hardships, the tragedy of selfishness, the selfish social interaction, the shallowness of sociality, the subtle character motivations which can be parallelled with our lives. It did what it set out to do, a shame it didn't get more leeway to express this in a much grander and more beautiful way, but what we see is what we get, and what we got was good enough for a purchase, also for probably more than one playthrough. I think I got across what I wanted to say, albeit clumsily and badly, but I did it.			"

The Good: This British choice-driven youth drama has plenty going for it. * A solid premise -- find out why the teenage protagonist's journal is suddenly filled with blank pages. * Goreous art direction -- hand-drawn graphics; clever use of real-world design elements to put spatial limits on the levels, as the story goes on; paper-cut shadow plays during the cut scenes between days (chapters)* Believable, well-realized characters -- fun fact: without even trying, I unlocked all of the personality-related achievements without a guide during my first playthrough, just by asking ""What would Angela Chase (from My So-Called Life) do?""* Intriguing setting -- a surreal, dream-like version of an otherwise unremarkable British small town during the bleak early days of the Tony Blair era.The Bad: Lack of options, maybe? You explore the town, talk to people, and figure out who you're meant to interact with next. Not a lot of variety in terms of gameplay. Theoretically, it would be possible to port the whole game into Twine, using hyperlinks and text descriptions to move between locations. (Thankfully, the characters and the central mystery are compelling enough to keep going.)Also, if you're not into family drama or coming-of-age narratives, you should probably avoid this.The Ugly: Awkward, buggy controls for such a straightforward game! There were a few crucial moments when it was obvious that you're meant to speak with a character but the positioning doesn't let you launch the conversation option.			"

												There's a lot I love about Journal: it looks pretty, it's not very long, and there's no difficulty to speak of. Instead, you get to walk through a few days of a young woman's life and see how she interacts with the people she cares about. I was occasionally put off when the character revealed important information in past tense - information I should have known when I was choosing how to steer conversations, like learning I had been the one spreading a rumor - but there's a reason for that and I'm not going to spoil it. The final day will surprise you for sure.Also, there's trading cards.			"

												Honestly, I kind of liked it at first. But soon it started getting boring, since your decisions don't actually change anything. The only thing that actually changes something is if you complement Anne or Catherine to Keith. There is also a bug, where you go to the end, but it doesn't say anything. But the main reason I'm giving this game a thumbs down is because I thought it was cool how I make desicions that affect the ending, but that's not the case. They give you descisions, yes, but only one actually does something. And even that decision didn't affect the ending. But desicions aren't the only feature that I dislike. It's the story. Throughout the story, no matter if you try to act nice, your still a selfish teenage girl. This is going to go back to the decisions, but they're practically useless! I like it when I can be the one who decides the ending, not every single ending the same, so replaying is pointless!Overall, I didn't like the game.			"

												Journal is a very enjoyable inde adv game, It requires no real skill other than a willingness to explore the world and converse with the NPCs in it.  Journal tells the story of an unnamed women, looking back on a difficult time in her child hood through her journal, which you are helping her write as you play.  The unusual premise and the beautiful hand drawn children’s story book graphics are worth the price of admission alone.  The story elements (divorce, death, friendship, coming of age) are never handled to deeply, but it was enough to cause me to think back on my life more than once as I played which is something very few video games have ever accomplished, its more like a good novel or movie in that way.  The only game aspects are how you chose to answer questions (aggressive, guilty, positive, pessimistic), how much of the world you interact with, and how that changes your relationships along the way.  None of this ever really changes the outcome, which will make sense once you play it and the story even addresses this at a point.  If you enjoy adventure games and can have some empathy with a main character in fiction then you will enjoy Journal.  Oh, and it plays great with a gamepad too.			"

												Pleasantly surprised.I launched this game only to collect the trading cards, but something in me got me to stay put and try this game out.  I honestly thought it was just another adolescent trash story, but, no, it's not that at all.  It's actually a mature story.  Basically, you control a young female who goes around wondering where her journal pages went.  As you begin to ask people about this, you begin to discover there are other more important things going on.  You quickly discover that all bad things that happen is your fault.  Eventually, I began to question what the heck is going on?  Why is the character I control doing these things??  By day 5, it all comes out, and wow...  I was moved.  Truly, the writer did an excellent job presenting this story in the manner she did, from the perspective of an older woman re-telling the story of herself as a  young person who is shielded from a very dear and important truth, and acting out because of not knowing.  I was deeply moved.This is a gem amidst♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  If you can overlook the simplicity of the gaming aspects, and take this as an interactive novel more than a cheesy game, then I highly recommend this.   It's a very good story for anyone of any age, from pre-adolescent on up.  I was moved.  You might be too.			"

												A very, very short game (1 hour max) about a teenager going through the past five days of her life, where you realise that this girl's life gets more and more tragic the more you play the game. Well it feels more like a visual novel. There are different dialogues you can choose, but they seriously don't seem to have any effects on the actual game. The story feels like a mess to me, where there is so much going on that are not related at all to each other and it is hard to connect everything together. Although on the flip side, this may describe the turmultuous life that our protagonist is experiencing right now. I felt like the only part that mattered in the entire game was the final day, closer to the end. Everything else before felt trivial to the story. Tl:dr. Story gets more ♥♥♥♥ed up the longer you play. Story that just jumps everywhere with no connection. Lovely artwork and music. If you got a few bucks to burn, get it. It's still a good game (or visual novel) and there is proof that the game creators put time and effort into it to make this a quality piece.			"

												Journal...how do I describe Journal.Journal is a game that focuses on the story. The only keys you use are the right and left arrow buttons, and then the space bar. It's more than enough.Journal...is something different.When I first started playing the game after buying it on sale, I'll admit. I wasn't that impressed. I thought it was a bit odd, and I liked the art style. The story was simplistic and seemed to have no point. Then a window got broken. Then you find out YOU broke the window. You make all sorts of descions in the game that all pertain some sort of importance, though some are miniscule and others are...game changing. Literally and metephorically. You change the course of the game with each move you make, and then you also change the story itself, to a point. At first it isn't all that interesting and honestly a bit confusing, but then things fall into place. it's like a puzzle and you have to put it together. Piece by piece, word by word. You'll have to stop a couple times to figure it all out, though it isn't an inconveinance. Little puppet show stories are between each...chapter? Page? In your journal that sort of help you understand, while also delivering a seperate lesson and helping piece things together.The most remarkable thing about this game is the ending. The ending made me think, made me sit back and stare at the screen. At the last sentance for a good ten minutes, just wondering. Wondering, thinking. Appreciating. This game gets a whole lot of credit for its ending; you realize what the whole game was about, why you did what you did, what your motiviations and everything else were for your actions and the truth behind the puppet shows. This game is more of an experience, and it's a real good one. I reccomend it to anyone who wants to be surprised and enlightened, and who doesn't mind contomplating things. Amazing ending, art, and style. It all ties up and is just...beautiful. Buy it. They earned the money.			"

SummaryEnter the pages of the hand painted world of Journal. A journey through the life of a young and troubled girl as she tries to face up to the choices and responsibilities that come with childhood. An experience that questions the reliability of how we choose to remember events and explores the truths hidden within our dreams.Journal is a narrative driven adventure game by Richard Perrin, the creator of Kairo and the white chamber, with art and writing by Melissa Royall.Tags: Indie, Adventure, Female Protagonist, Walking Simulator, Interactive Fiction, Hand-drawn, Casual, Visual Novel, Singleplayer


Journal 
A Screenshot of Journal
By: Snowfox




ReviewAs the summary says, in this game you play as a troubled young girl, facing her responsibilities and the consequences of her choices.The game plays relatively well, aside from the controls. It feels like they made this game, intending it to be a point & click, but instead decided to use keyboard controls half way through development. I really think the game would be better if, instead of keyboard controls, they used point & click mechanics. It would even go really well with the game; in its current state, you have to navigate with the arrow keys (which are a little too responsive) and space to talk to people or interact with the environment. So, naturally, point & click controls would help with the over sensitive arrow keys and also allow you to simply click on a person to walk over to them and talk to them.The story is a really well made one, despite it being only around 2 hours long. The premise is that suddenly, the pages of your diary are blank and you need to find out what happened to them. By playing through each of the 5 days, you collect the information that has disappeared. If you like games where the character has a mild case of amnesia, or is needs to find pieces of his/her memories as they progress, you will enjoy this game. The secret ending that you can get after you play through the game once is worth your time to find ;)Has beautiful hand-drawn visuals and a soothing soundtrack. The perspective of this game is strange: you (as the girl?) are sitting at what seems to be a desk in your bedroom, looking into your journal, playing the game, looking for the missing words of your journal (journal-ception?!). When you complete each day, the perspective changes, and you are greeted by a shadow puppet show that tells a unique story. The main part of the game consists of wandering through your British town, talking to people, completing tasks, resolving troubles, and taking part in school life.Some actions are influenced by your decisions, but I think you get the same ending no matter what choices you make during your first playthrough.There are 10, easily unlockable achievements that took my 2.3 hours to unlock (one is sitting at the menu screen for 10 minutes xD). The price is high for only 2 hours of content, so I recommend you buying this game on sale for under $5, unless you really want to play it. Overall a really enjoyable game that plays sort of like a visual novel. I got it for $1.39, and I couldn’t be happier.My implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10Handle with caution… 3-4/10Buy on sale: 5-6/10Every day purchase: 7-8/10Must buy: 9-10/10This game's rating: 6.5/10. A little expensive, but well worth the cost on sale. Read the full review here on our website: {LINK REMOVED}http://giveaways.pl/reviews/journal/

												If you're looking for a chill experience while being bundled up in your bed, this game might just do the trick. It takes aproximately 2 hours, and it's a quite interesting experience. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but I would recommend it to ME so I guess that's what this is all about in the end, right? The graphics are enjoyable, I loved how everything remembered me somehow of the little town I grew up in. You start by being a quite forgetful young lady, in highschool, not knowing what she said a few days back and most of the times being an annoying little brat. I didn't like the main character specifically, but it turns out she was actually having a lot of STUFF going on. While you talk to your friends and family, things seem to unravel and you get some clues that there may be more to this story. You hear that something's wrong, but WHAT is it? There is actually a story-within-a-story too, as between chapters you get small bits of the life in a carnival,  that will tie all the loose ends in the final chapter.The music is pretty enjoyable, and the whole game has an ""old"" feeling to it, like something happened in those days you weren't born, but you see on postcards in your parent's keepsake drawer. The only thing I would've wanted is more voice-overs, as only the girl's monologue is actually spoken, the rest is written. This game does go into that niche, weird, hipster game zone, maybe more than other indie games. But I really enjoyed it, and I hope you will too. P.S. I wouldn't pay 10 euros for it, but 5 and less are an ok price.			"

												I bought it at 75%, and I don't regret it. Interesting concept, nice visuals, good voice acting that was not used enough (only important parts, which are written in the Journal, are spoken by one actress), short story with a very funny alternate ending (that reminded me of Portal 1 and 2's ending songs).The bad part? The story is not very well written, so the ending feels like it was thrown in for dramatic purposes.If you are looking for something different and short and don't mind a flawed diamond, make sure you buy this (on a sale).

												It took me an hour and a half to finish the story twice. Though I generally enjoy story-driven games, the personality of the protagonist in Journal made it hard to commit to the story. She was generally a rude person who acted selfishly. I understand she was (without spoiling anything) going through a lot, but she is just not likable. This made it difficult to really get into the game. It's not something I would spend money on if I had played it before buying it.			"

												At first, you probably won't like the main character. She's a mess: manipulative, lies a lot, steals, mean to her true friends and gets manipulated by a jerk classmate.As the story goes by, you'll see some reasons that explains why she's making poor choices. Also, she'll notice her own failures and start to feel regret. If you were once a teenage and have dealt with some complicated experiences like death, divorce, confused relationships... you'll for sure relate with her story and be touched by it.Journal is an unique and heartmoving experience. Give it a try!P.S.: Don't forget to find the secret ending in your second playthrough. You'll love it!			"

												I feel certain aspects of Journal didn't quite ""fit"", Catherine was a bit obscure...her transformation from ""popular girl"" status to ""caring girl"" didn't flow well.  Also, messages such as ""honesty is the best policy"" were not implemented in the greatest way. With that being said, Journal has a relatable story that includes beautiful artwork and decent voice acting. The plot is a huge mess until the final day, but that sums up the entire theme of the game...life is a mess, filled with mistakes and regrets.P.S : Journal is a bit overpriced to say the least, make sure to pick it up on sale.

												Brown Beard’s JournalMonday, January 12, 2015I played a short, albeit exceedingly bright & colorful visual novel today, titled ‘Journal.’ The nameless, female protagonist lost pages from her treasured journal. The adventure begins on her journey to reclaim her lost pages or so she believes.On this journey, I met her friends, parents, a love interest & other colorful folks, all in her wistful hope to locate what exactly happened to her journal pages. And surely, the pages, the words themselves start to come together. As the days pass, the journal starts to re-assemble itself.The more I learn of the life surrounding the nameless protagonist, the sadder I feel. Maybe she isn’t trying to remember at all. Maybe she wants to forget & create something anew…End of entry			"

												I was interested in playing this game for two reasons initially: 1) I really enjoyed playing Kairo (also made by Richard Perrin, creator of Journal), and 2) I found the way in which the protagonist was being negatively described in various reviews to be intriguing. More often than not, I enjoy games in which I cannot fully sympathize with the main character because it helps you to understand things from new and unique perspectives. That being said, due to my own life experiences I was actually able to empathize with the character in this game in some respects,  which actually  made my experience all the more personal. This is a fantastic game, deeper than most. The game reminds me of interactive fiction, in a lot of ways. It's telling a story, a very complex one, using both stunning visuals, beautiful music and powerful written word. But unlike a typical visual novel, this game allows for freedom of movement within the world of Journal and more variance in choice of responses. The main story is juxtaposed perfectly along with a shadow puppet play which acts as a sort of philosophical intermission between chapters.  There is a sense of doom lingering throughout the game that hints toward something tragic, which is also expressed via a gradual shift and general sense of unease in the atmosphere and setting of the game.  Nothing you do changes the outcome, however, and this was the hardest thing for me to accept. Nothing leading up to the end can truly prepare you for it, and it's quite a heavy conclusion to deal with.I can see why some people might view the main character in this game in a negative way. She's young, has been through a lot, and makes many mistakes. But she's trying to come to terms with it all, and you are right there with her the whole time. None of the mistakes I mentioned can really be prevented by you, although you can gently guide the main character into more apologetic or thoughtful responses. Sometimes it's truly painful and cringeworthy to witness the main character going through such turmoil or causing it, but it's that brutal honesty that makes the game what it is. Journal is a journey, a dreamlike one that slowly transforms into a nightmare right before your very eyes.			"

												Journal is a narrative-driven adventure game presented in a very unique way - the game itself takes place inside a diary and while it can be found in a 3D room the stages within are presented in 2D, hand-drawn pages. As you go from one ""screen"" to another a page is turned revealing a new area. If no further progress can be made the game just puts a post-it before you to see that particular area is yet to be revealed.Basically, each chapter consists of exploring the surrounding area and conversing with the individuals encountered. The basis of the story is your protagonist's problem: suddenly, all the things she'd written down in her journal disappeared. She sets out to find answers but then the game focuses on things such as friendship, love, family issues, problems in school and things that eventually make you reminisce about your life and your childhood. Some of the conversations can feel eerily nostalgic - but then again you have to be in the right mood to play this game.The game is, unfortunately, quite short, but tells an interesting story with memorable characters and great accompanying music. Again, I would like to emphasize the presentation - this hand-drawn world with its faceless characters can be very intriguing. The only downside for me was that when I was presented with a choice during some key dialogues I did not really feel the result of my selection. These choices can be the polar opposite of one another: you can be nice to your counterpart or can hurt your relationship with that person picking a more harsh response. Still, in the end it didn't matter, at all.As much as Journal looks like a game for children it is actually for adults. It is very difficult to categorise it - to tell who it is for. I can easily imagine most people will find this uninteresting or quite the opposite - it can evoke emotions that will eventually make you uncomfortable and quit the game. Nevertheless, I like giving such games a chance and I think you'd better do the same.			"

The game has no difficulty or challenges, pretty much just walk through as you find out peoples different personalities and how they get along/clash with her.

												As I started to play Journal, I thought it would be just a quick VN about a typical angsty teenage girl ""growing up"".  Instead I found a story of a girl experiencing multi-faceted emotional distress who, instead of directing her anger inward to be a more sympathetic character, raged against the world and acted out.  By the end of her story though, I was in tears.   Admittedly, I am kind of a sentimental slob anyway, but her situation hit home to me, I think because of the strength of the writing, dialogue choices, and art that were all beautifully done.  The music also enhanced my journey through the game.   A journey I'm glad I took.			"

												Journal is a very simple game that tries to give you some food for thought in regards to depression, social anxiety, loss, friendship and how things change through life.While not completely successful and lacking a certain cohesion it is still a very interesting, albeit somewhat limited, experience.PROS:-really nice art style-good classical soundtrack-touches on several interesting themes-the sudden change of mood made the last chapter very emotionalCONS:-divided between a simple, somewhat ham-fisted, storytelling in the first 4 chapters and some deep, sometimes cryptic, narration during end of the day cutscenes and day 5-pretty short and linear-when using a controller the stick feels very sensitive while choosing conversation options-I couldn't advance the ending scenes using a controller and had to fall back to keyboard


Journal 
A Screenshot of Journal
By: stranger1982




Journal seems to be at an empasse on what it is trying to do.The first days are full of day-to-day teen problems and simple musings on the problems the character faces: the conversations are pretty simplistic and somewhat trite in dealing with how everyone feels.The cutscenes at the end of the day start as somewhat cryptic, almost philosophical takes on the feelings that were simplistically addressed during the day: story wise they are explained after the ending but I was left with the feeling that they were designed as a more detailed take on the events of the game.Without spoiling anything, the ending presents a sudden change in mood with a good sense of urgency paired with a good view on loss and the scars life puts on us: it might seem an unoriginal view overall but it was still emotionally powerful.I guess different players'd appreciate the game in different ways...people in their teens'll probably sympatize with the problems and fears the character faces but might feel the cutscenes and ending shift too much into a deep and dark territory. More mature gamers'll probably feel the daily chapers are pretty boring and unoriginal in the way they represent teen problems and will be more interested in trying to understand whether the cutscenes act as metaphors for something deeper: they'll also probably feel very connected with the ending.Despite the problems regarding its identity Journal was a meaningful experience for me, one surely worth its sale price of 2$.

												Was this game what I expected it to be? No. Is that a bad thing? Maybe not necessarily.I can definitely say that the game struck me on an emotional level; it pretty much nailed how much it sucks to be in middle school, having friendships go down in flames, a parent abruptly bringing someone new into the picture, and trying to handle the loss of a loved one. It addresses how we can do stupid things in the heat of the moment and not be able to take it back or undo it, and the way that can leech onto your life going forward even if you try to make amends. It also confronts the conflict of selfishness and feeling that you're expected to perform to a certain standard but not being able (or not wanting) to satisfy it.Part of me does wish that there were more distinct consequences for each of my actions, but on some level I kind of appreciate that there aren't. One of the themes of this game is that some things just can't be changed no matter how hard you try, and I caught myself experiencing that on a personal level as I attempted a second playthrough but got similar outcomes. I still think unique consequences would've made the game better, but I don't think it's completely pointless for the game to be without it.Overall, Journal gave me a lot to think about, and even made me cry a few times because it stirred up some incidents from my own past that I too wanted to redo. The controls are a little clunky and it's a bit short, but I'd still give it a go if you're looking for something a little more contemplative. I definitely don't think this game is for everyone, but for those that get invested in a narrative, I think it's worth a play.			"

												Interesting concept and story. If you like visual novels and story-driven (as in, you're not keen on the puzzles) adventure games, this is for you. The biggest down side it is a lack of polish.Pros: Good writing. The storybook, child-like art is really nice. Original concept, not something seen in games much.Cons: The pointless 3d UI, it's glitchy and adds nothing. The interaction is clunky. Not as polished as it could be.			"

												I found the game’s concept interesting. BGM was lovely, but the game itself… It was annoying. I’m not talking about the art style (I actually liked, I found it very different), but both characters and gameplay were quite bad; I couldn’t feel sympathy for any character, and the gameplay is annoying… Having to walk all over the scenario just to trigger scenes, casually leaving the screen when you don’t want to… What a pain. VA was okay. The animated scenes were also good.3/10. This game is just really expensive for what is offering. I don’t recommend unless you can get it on a good sale.			"

												I was in the mood for a quick, single sitting, interactive narrative experience but I couldn't even make it to the end of this short game.I'll start with what I like about this game. I like the storybook graphic design, music, voice acting and general story delivery.What I don't like is the story itself or any of the characters. At best, the story is excruciatingly boring. At worst, it's frustrating to witness all the schoolyard drama play out in front of you.As a big fan of walking simulators or interactive narratives or whatever you choose to call them, I would not recommend this game to anybody.

												A very fascinating game that puts that shows you how games can be made to create a deep story narrative. It's an example of video games being an art form to teach a narrative. It focuses on the story of a school girl who is going through her own issues, but going any deeper will be spoiling it.You go around solving the interesting mystery of your missing journal pages and though it seems you don't have too much of a issue, for some reason I felt a real disconnect with the character. I'm not sure if it's just I can't connect well with the narrative or characters, but later on I started to feel a real connection and got to understand her and what she was going through.Again I won't spoil it, but it's a experience you can only have by playing it yourself.

												6/10+ Unique art style+ Great cut scenes between each day (each act). Many people dislike these ""carnival interludes"", but I loved them. + Story picks up in the last act and helps the game leave an overall positive and memorable impression+ Protagonist walks fast (yes, slow walking can be annoying, play Dear Esther if you have doubts about this one)- Choices don't really matter. There's practically one ending. You can get another ending if you replay the game and follow instructions posted in the forum, but don't expect too much from it (I won't spoil with specifics).- Story is slow and not very interesting throughout most of the game- Minimal voice acting (but what's there is good)- No way to exit an already cycled through dialog- Difficult to empathize with the protagonist; some of the dialog options don't represent anything I would say in real life. Recommended with reservations. Get this game if it's is on sale or is included in a bundle. I won my copy in a giveaway (thank you planetoide!)			"

												I don't know. I really don't know.It's hard to say whether I enjoyed Journal or not. Like Omikron: The Nomad Soul, there were certainly a lot of things I did like, but just as many things that I just didn't enjoy.""Journal"" is a game that follows a young girl suffering problems after an emotionally traumatic and pivotal moment in her life, and you proceed to play as her for the five days that follow.For starters, I really enjoyed the visual aesthetic... to a certain degree. I love the hand-drawn look (reminds me of ""Close Your Eyes"", which I played and beat very recently). I like how you actually play in a 3D journal, and as you unlock areas, the items that cover their entrances are removed and set beside the journal. I like the little shadow shows that describe the different carnival members between the days. It feels like I'm going through someone's actual journal and looking at their personal thoughts. It seemed strange that the world looked all cracked and broke when I was played, but after being revealed the big spoiler and seeing the ending, it actually made a lot more sense that in the girl's imagination, the world would look that way. So good on the designers for making that.However, I'm not a fan of the characters' art. They all lack faces and proper voices to make them feel real. They just look like puppets. Perhaps another layer to the way the girl perceives the world, but it was one I didn't enjoy. I felt like I could have been immersed more if all the characters had voices.I also found the portion where you control the girl walking off the pages and across her room a little goofy. It's just weird to see this tiny hand-drawn girl walking across a 3D rendered world. I found something funny in it. And I didn't enjoy how preachy the game got about it's point. I like the little subtleties that support the underlying point, but I also believe that underlying point should be something subtle. Something that you let the player discover for themselves.Along with that, the music was just... okay. It wasn't memorable. It felt like a person hitting different keys within the five-finger space he had for each location. Even the big, momentous, reveal feels mundane and ordinary because of the music. Along with that, the sound on the girl's voice is terrible. It sounds like she's in a recording room with a mic in front of her. The guy who talked during the carnival shadow shows sounded great, so it seemed odd that her audio quality was so low.While the world and the character designs did follows the mentality of the girl after this big moment in her life... it doesn't feel like the story relates to it in anyway. It just seems like you walk around and talk to people with little consequence, because the game ends with a text crawl and a montage of a family that had no signigicant important to the writers, it seemed (as their last names are different. But who knows? Maybe Melissa Royall's last name is marital.)Along with that, the controls just suck. You slide too much to the point that you might leave one area and slide into another one right after without intending to. And there were a host of glitches in the game, from conversations cutting off randomly, to the interact button appearing over things I couldn't interact with, to certain text just being a ton of random letters (Although, I think that was intentional, but I don't know. It was never explained in the story).I can't say I hate Journal. I just feel apathetic for it, but within my apathy lies just a little bit of sympathy. And maybe you can find some empathy within me for that. I just hope there is no antipathy between me and you, dear reader.What I mean by that, is that this game has some good stuff that outweighs its flaws, but it just didn't do much for me. However, I know it could be effective for anyone who's gone through a traumatic event in their life and can relate more. I never went through anything similar to the girl, so that might be why my heart doesn't go out ot Journal that well. I can see people loving this game, but for my money I just didn't. I'm giving Journal a 6/10			"

												First, comparing this game, Journal, to Richard Perrin's previously popular game, Kairo, is to compare fire to ice. Not as opposites so much, as simply defying comparison. Beyond an obvious regard for thinking-gamers, please consider them seperately when deciding on the selection of either.If at first we think to compare this (apparently unnamed) protaganist to our own experiences, we soon find out how wrong we are. While there are, no doubt, some young lives closely matching that in this game (perhaps every life has some immediate comparisons) what makes this game MOST remarkable is that it starts out to seem anything BUT. Just a young girl, misunderstood as are most people. By gradual steps (or more frequently, sudden starts and stops), we find out she is NOT us, and therefore, if we expected validation, we may begin to lose faith in this game. But if we continue, we find out in surprising reveals (conversations, experiences & titular journal entries) that inwardly she may be almost exactly like us, no matter our age, background or gender. NO life is truly ordinary. Or easy.But this game's real theme is regret. Choices have, not so much results, but consequences. Our ""heroine"" frequently laments her choices, while other characters, in word and act, confirm the irreversable, often heartbreaking, permanence of ""The Wrong Choice"" made. There is no SAVE.The artwork was strategiclly minimalistic, changing to become more haunted to match our protaganist's life. I don't recall much sunshine (if any, but this IS supposed to be the UK.) Rain was part of the story, as were the gritty streets and coffee-cup rings on some ""pages"". Temporary barriers between locations were made ""young girl's life"" obvious, including a band-aid. The ""busy"" dialog was effective and amusing. Aesthetically, a very pleasing game.The stories built into the game were a wonderful, welcome touch, though never explained specifically. Did they even exist ""in story""? Perhaps leaving them, and their source (mostly) ambiguous, except quite probably from our heroine's subconscious, was more interesting in retrospect. Particularly if they were driven additionally by interest in her friend Trevor and his oft-mentioned comic. If indeed retrospect is to be considered in our analysis and/or appreciation, we may find this game to be absolutely filled with subtle (and not) hints and clues. Dare I say, almost in a David Lynchian sense? (Please understand, ""Journal"" is NO ""Mulholland Drive"".) This game, like many great ones, may truly be better appreciated AFTER completion.It had some moments that, at the time, felt like minor flaws in the game. Now I'm not so sure. Is something that only SEEMS like a flaw less a flaw, despite having taken us momentarily out of the game? I can't go into detail about either of the two (spoilers) I noticed, but they were moments where cause and effect were reversed. Something happened that, at the time, made no sense. But when the reason was learned minutes later it seemed that, if characters had been encountered in a different sequence, actions would have felt to have occured normally. Having finished the game, I just don't know anymore, except that it seemed unfortunate at the time. Perhaps it was nothing more than a plot device. Foreshadowing maybe, or a jaring of our comfort zone. Or I got the game sequence reversed by selecting the wrong topics from the wrong people in the wrong order.There was one instance that seemed otherwise flawed. The protaganist went to talk to a teacher about a family member, but when that person is selected as the ""topic"", there was no discussion available. But as far as I could tell it had no major impact, except to (regretably) draw notice. Perhaps the intent WAS to say nothing, but that might have been better indicated.Also, I wish there had been a way (other than rapid spacebars) to avoid repetative dialog, if desired. (Perhaps a color change if nothing was different since prior selecting.) And I'm not sure why we were allowed to continue going into places that no  longer had importance (particularly the Post Office, which had its brief moment of signifigance.) Perhaps simply to intensify the game-critical feeling of ""choice"". The promised opening of the package never happened, and as such felt forgotten in the story. A contrivance, essentially, but relatively minor (not even important enough to be considered ""spoiler"".) Perhaps other player choices would have had more satisfying, or complete, results. Another was far less minor (i.e.: ""spoiler"" level), but just as abandoned. Also, there may be players unhappy about the lack of a SAVE feature. Well, life is like that. I'm glad I played it. As with MANY Steam games, offline play and/or play-time is ignored. PLEASE offer corrections as appropriate.(4NQfam)			"

												Short, choose-your-own-adventure-ish type game. As with many indie games, this one has a heavy ending that slaps you in the face with drama. Sometimes that works, sometimes not. Here, it works.I say ""choose your own adventure"" but that's not quite right. You don't really influence the story outcome that I can tell, at least in any significant way. I'd have to do a second playthrough to know for sure, so take that for what it is.The game and artwork are as presented in the screenshots - you play the role of a girl with missing journal pages, and the story itself fills out over time as you learn more about what is going on.Gameplay-wise, I only ran into one bug: when streaming, the gamepad would not work on my Steam Link unless I unplugged the gamepad from my streaming machine. Once done, it was fully playable with the gamepad.The story is more interesting than it first lets on. I did have an urge to stop early on because it seemed a bit dull, but I'm glad I stuck it out. As time went on, I thought ""hey, I'm playing a truly bad girl who doesn't realize she's bad"". I would frequently be given choices that were, in a manner of speaking, all bad choices. That would have been a unique twist, but it wasn't the full story. In the end, it all made sense and I'm glad I stuck to it. My only complaint, I suppose, is that the game did feel a bit repetitive and long for what little gameplay and story there is.This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it was a nice change of pace for me.

												Journal is a narrative game about a girl trying to cope with multiple problems in her life . Gameplay is limited to walking and text choices so it is kinda like 2D walking simulator. The story and drama is very down to earth so it won't appeal to everyone . I usually stay away from a game with no gameplay but good writing and fantastic music won me over . Choice consequences ?Journal is like writing your own story . Your character is innocent unless you decide otherwise . It seems that not everyone likes main character but I think the point of the game is that you create who main character really is .According to some reviews the choices have no weight to them because they have no impact in a long run . I don't think you can change the ending but you can change side events before that  .Sometimes our choices have impact on us but perhaps can't change certain things in our lifes. If you pay attention to a story it would not make sense to have multiple endings do to subtext of the game .When I played this game I genuinely cared about the characters . There are some multiple choice answers that will effect your relationships and it will have impact though this short journey . You will have to play the game about 3 times to collect all extra story cookies .  Immersive settings created by Music   Honestly as soon as I herd the music I knew I would love this game . Infact the further you get in this game the more suspicious you get about the plot do to increasingly sad music . From a sound desing point of view eveything was flawless from sound effects to music and voice acting . Not only music was good but it really was used in way that complemented the game .Voice acting is good but only about 10% of the game is voice acted from a perspective of main protagonist . Personally I prefer games not to be voice acted completely because reading makes me more engaged . Text walls are not too big but If you do not like reading there is no point in buying this game . Enjoyable Art direction and Unique presentation  . Obviously this game has Kid's drawing vibe to it . When you walk to another screen it flips the page which gave me a wird nostalgia of Sega's Comix Zone ( not related in gameplay in any way ) It is a simple presentation and yet very powerfull . Backgrounds have a bit of a surreal take which makes you wonder if the world is real . I guess you could argue that animation could be more fluid but I think it was made clunky on purpose .I am not saying this game has impressive graphics but the arstyle is used in a way that makes story more impactful  . Score 9/10 .  I enjoyed this game a lot because I could relate to the story but it is not for everyone. If you usually skip text walls and looking for actual game you probably won't like it . Journal has a good message backed up by good music,creative looks,solid writing and good atmosphere . I would estimate the game around 3 hours if you actually read it but it gives you a reason to play it twice . This game made me tear more than death of Mufasa .I felt that a lot of heart went into making Journal , something that only few video games get across.			"

												For a game that took under two hours to experience, this was remarkably well-done. I may have spent 1% of the time in Journal that I did in Skyrim, but I have a feeling that these characters and this story will stay with me for just as long. It's hard to say what the game is about without ruining the experience. Journal won't test your reflexes or puzzle-solving ability. The game is difficult. Which isn't to say it's hard to win -- it's difficult in that it forces you to grapple with a very personal and affecting story. Highly recommended if you're into interactive narratives that couldn't be accomplished in any other medium. Beautiful soundtrack.			"

												I've just finished this game. And i have mixed feelings. In this game you are taking role of young girl, who has diary, has problems, etc. First day (the story is divided into 5 days), you can walk around a little bit, talk to 3 people. So far, so good, and i was trying to pay attention to dialogues, names, also choices while talking to those people. Second day, new locations are available, with more people (every day will add new locations and new people). Yeah, you can see the relationship between them, you can interact with them, but nothing really matters. Your ""choices"" can change only few lines of text, nothing more. And in the end, none of those interactions really matters. It is there just to fill some time, or just to show you that girl has some serious problems. But those problems are actually nothing to worry about, everybody has some problems in his life. What is really important in this game, is actually Day 5, the last ""chapter"" of this game. Change of atmosphere will tell you that something is not right, your mum will send you to a special place, and you will uncover the truth. The main problem of our protagonist. Well, the ending was really hard and strong, and also started some processes in my head (because as i said, everybody has some problems, and i have some now), but after finishing game, i realize that most of the game was useless, and it should not be there as it gives you nothing. But yeah, without content, it would be more shorter, and also price would be lower, and maybe that's why developers put everything in. I don't know, it is already short enough (and ask 10 euros for that is really ridiculous, real gametime is around 2-3 hours. Yes, i have 6 hours on record, because i actually fell asleep for a moment).But let's summarize it. Soundtrack is not bad, it is actually good, even as backround music, it helps to create the right atmosphere. The controls, well, you need only 3 keys (space, <- and -> ). Animations, well, there are not any real animations, maybe those ""carneval"" things (short stories between the days, not really related to protagonist - maybe a little). Hmm, graphics. You can see screenshots from the game, that's all. It is probably hand-drawn, so it does not look bad, but as i said, there are no real animations, so it feels cheap. And for 10 euros, it is really sad. I know, it is an indie game, but still.There are also some achievements (i've got most of them after first ending, but for 1-2 achievements, you have to play game again. And as there are zero replayability, you can just ignore dialogs), and also trading cards, if anybody interested. But you can't buy that soundtrack. As i am looking at game's price, i don't want to see soundtrack's price (it would be probably 10 euros too).I don't know, i still don't think it is a good game for 10 euros. Maybe 2-4 euros at max, but no more. So if you want this game, you'd better pick it on sale (-75% or even -87%, then the price is right and that's when i can recommend this game). I still have that bad feeling that developers just wanted to grab money from people, who loves these kind of games, especially with that description about ""A journey through the life of a young and troubled girl as she tries to face up to the choices and responsibilities that come with childhood. An experience that questions the reliability of how we choose to remember events and explores the truths hidden within our dreams."". Well, yes, it is there, they are not lying, but i was expecting something more, that's all. I am not saying that this have to be same for everybody, it is just my feeling about it. I have played much better adventure games, with better stories, gameplay, soundtrack, etc, and for less money. And only good thing about this game is just that ending, which nobody sees coming, because the game keeps it as an secret. It will show it to you only at the end. I don't know, do as you want, it is your money :) I just wanted to warn you, as lot of people (80% of them) are recommending this. Maybe they can see something special about this abstract game, or it just helped them in hard times. Yeah, maybe. But there are many alternatives :) Just saying.			"

												In my opinion this game was a success. Im not going to tell you certain details of the game as I feel reviews shouldnt contain spoilers becuase many people buy games based upon the reviews and so will read them before hand. I can tell you that this game is worth getting. Although journal is a short game its certainly worth the 6.99! A tale of a girl going though a hard time in her life is told in a very interesting and engaging fashion.The artistic style is very simple and are crude scribbles relating to those a child might do, linking in to the main character, This i feel helps pull you in and make the story more immersive. The other style is a sharp animated puppet show at the end of each chapter in the game which breaks the game up into sections well. The two voice actors featured are very good. The voice of the girl is done excellently and really makes me believe what she was saying, The character doesn't voice all her lines which i like as when she does choose to speak it has more of an impact. The voice over the little puppet shows is also brilliantly cast, they have a natural narrative voice that put weight into the stories they told.The controlls are simple and the overall game is simple and uncomplecated to. Its good for when you want to just relax and get involved in a hearttouching story. The message really came through for me and I can tell you I cried the first three times I played it. I'm not saying it's perfect and of course its not everyones cup of tea, If you like stratagy shooters then you will find your self very bored very quickly. However if you're into indie games or games with a strong story then this is for you 100%			"

												Follow a troubled teen who is trying to remember how her journal got erased, and fill in the blanks by just being alive.It's a visual novel if thats what you were wondering. No puzzles or anything to worry about. This means its very slow paced and relaxed, good for casual play.Simple controls, this casual game follows a young woman talking to friends, family and strangers to fill her journal with the missing information. Atleast, that what your objective starts out as.The art is simple and colourful, easy on the eyes and suits the game very well. Soon after finding your journal blank, you begin finding trouble and relationships are pushed. Depending on certain things you say, characters will treat you differently. The story seems to lose its focus and gets slightly confusing, having philosophical meanings and other behind the seen interpretations. It can be boring for the first 30 minutes or so until you get into the game and start progressing much faster. Has plenty of dialogue. Lots of reading too.Its easy, its casual and its simple. Grab it when its on sale, cause the price is pretty high for the very short 2 hour length and zero replayability. 10$ is incredibly overpriced. I got it on a 80% sale for 2$, I say do the same.Personal Rating: 2.5/5			"

												Journal is a very difficult game to understand and that is mostly due to the fact that the game is left open to interpretation, especially regarding your own feelings on certain subjects in life or in very specific situations. I've played games before, such as Serena, where you go through an emotional rollercoaster, based these interpretations but Journal was certainly the most difficult rollercoaster I have been on so far. I went from confused to sudden anger, not towards the game or the characters mind you, to confused again. Only to be met with a sudden calmness when you think you've figured it all out, just to be thrown back in this huge loop. At least that's how I felt and you might feel different emotions when playing the game. The story is about a young girl who's trying her best to understand the hidden meanings in life, about the interactions with complete strangers and people who are dear to her. You, as the player, are given several choices to respond, giving you the illusion that the story is adapting based on your answers while it simply doesn't. Of course, there are some options that will make you lose a friend, or not, based on your answers but the overall story will never change its course. After the majority of interactions, the girl will write down her thoughts in her journal. While this gives you some knowledge of the adolescent, you're still left with a handful of questions. At some point, it feels like there are two separate stories, which only makes your confusion grown but the stories blend together at the very last day. Out of all the possible explanations I had in my head, there was no way I could have foreseen the ending. It left me with a mixture of feelings and I swear, I thought I felt a tear.The graphics look far too immature, almost as if they were trying to weigh down the heaviness of the story itself with puerile artwork but I have to admit that I grew found of it. In fact, I started to miss being in the sketchbook every time the secondary story was explained in the form of a puppet-show. As far as the voice-acting goes, I didn't find any real issues except that certain words seemed to get lost. Mostly these were the first words of a sentence but this could also be due to the fact I am not a native English-speaker which made the puny British accent slightly more difficult to understand. Other than that, the voice-actors did an incredible job by making their raw emotions heard. Final ConclusionThe best word to describe Journal has to be 'bizarre' because that's the first thought I had of the game when the credits rolled down my screen. However, beside being an odd game, Journal is truly amazing. It lets your explore emotions and situations you, and possibly many others, struggle with on a nearly daily base and that's what makes it a great down-to-earth storytelling game that you should play.This review can also be found on nearlyenoughdice.com and I would like to thank Locked Door Puzzle for the review copy.

												I recommend this title but ONLY IF YOU READ MY WHOLE REVIEW.The protaginist and story are unenjoyable until about 80% through the approximately one hour long story. The art style convinced me to buy this but it didn't look that good during the actual game. There are no rebindable keys or real options besides resolution and fullscreen.With that being said, the remaining 20% of the game brings much needed character development to the protaginist as well as some of the other characters. The ending makes up for the beginning part of the game and is worth a purchase (unless you like angsty teenage drama, then you will like the whole thing).			"

												This is a very strange game.  When I first started I thought that it was a game with a decent narrative that was very poorly executed.  You end up being confused and it seems like information that can even seem irrelevant is being shoved at you in the wrong order.  It turns out that this is exactly what Journal is trying to accomplish.  I think that if you go into this game with an open mind, try not to play it like an RPG but rather an experiencial narrative, and know that everthing that seems confusing is intentional, It's possible that it will bring you a very personal and emotional experience that only certain Indie games are wont to do.  To the Moon is the other game that comes to mind as a personal and emotional journey, although the two are drastically different in execution; just like To the Moon it is best to play this game in one sitting so as to experience the entity as an undisected whole.  I don't guarantee that you will love this game, but take a chance and you just might.  It's definitely not for everybody, but if you enjoy the Indie narrative subgenre(or adventure game without the obsessive clicking as I like to think of it), I would suggest giving it a try.			"

												Journal is an incredibly personal story that reflects upon life’s greater themes through the eyes of someone who is not yet equipped to deal with them. The concepts are great however the game falls short of delivering a good experience with the main character obliterating any sense of relatability early on and the story remaining utterly confusing until the very end. Journal is a game that I want to like a lot more than I do but it’s incredibly hard to look past the faults even if the story will strike a chord with many of us. I bought Journal on the back that it was made by the man behind Kairo and, honestly, I can only recommend you do the same if you are also a fan.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/02/28/journal-an-emotional-coming-of-age/ "

It did confuse me at points as well, but all in all it had a nice story. I also rather liked the side part with the homeless man. (You'll know what I'm talking about if you talked to him multiple times through out the game I believe) I'd rate this an 8.5/10. The gameplay is nice, and the story is also pretty good. Most everything is good besides the parts where you go into her 3D room, I found that a bit unpleasant on the eyes. I also did not see the point of the circus stories, but they were still interesting.			"

I found that the story was poorly written and revealed to you in the worst ways. Everything was confusing.The cutscenes dragged on, and on and on and it was just too boring. The ending was touching, a story of grief, but it doesn't make up for how boring and bad the game is. Since it was 2D, the way you progressed was really strange, sometimes counterproductive. Lots of backtracking, and little choice as to what you did as a character even if there were dialogue options.I don't recommend this game.			"

												This game was a little too confusing for my taste. I didn't know what was going on most of the time, and then♥♥♥♥♥♥started to hit the fan. I wanted to end the game to judge the whole story, but it just didn't add up for me. The twist was just so random and didn't have anything to do with the rest of it. Not to me, anyway. I personally didn't like the artstyle or the shadow theater part, but some people might love it. The characters felt shallow and I found it really hard to choose the right dialouge option. The voiceacting was nice though. I have definitely played worse games, but I didn't enjoy it that much to be honest. 4/10, Catherine needs a beating.			"

												Journal was fairly disappointing.The attempt to create a plausible yet unreliable narrative character is a rather difficult accomplishment, and Journal just didn't manage to get it right. Firstly she constantly tells you what she is doing wrong, there's no guessing the ambiguity of her statements and the final twist to the tale, comes as completely unexpected, there are no hints, or eureka moments of ""Oh this is why they included that!"" In short the game does not encourage reflection, or analysis, it (like so much other modern material from films to books) hamfists you with the truth it wants you to realise rather than allowing an individual interpretation, or playing to multiple meanings through ambiguity. This is no more clearly recognised than when the characters speak in a sequence of randomized letters, that conveys their dialogue without conveying meaning. It's an opt out of revealing subtle clues to the player and feels lazy on the part of the writers rather than illustrating her mental blocks or incapacity to handle her situation. The art style is very childlike, in fact it seemed a bit too childlike considering the adolescent phase the protagonist is portrayed as going through. Yet it has a certain charm, the blurring lines of movement, the overall conceit of playing or moving her through her life as she writes her diary is clever, and the transferral of blocking objects to background desk additions after each daily diary entry is completed are innovative. The support characters are completely unoriginal, from a stay-at-home Mother, who does nothing, to the cliched cast of school characters, it again felt somewhat lazy on the part of the writers, not one character feels truly original or effectively offsets the protagonist, so that her character is actually revealed, not even her selfish interactions with her primary friend Elena as this is contradicted by her opposite interactions with others.As an unreliable narrator we would expect her opinions and interactions with others to be offset by  actual scenarios in the game, but this does not occur at any point. It is also not helped by the stereotypical character designs employed to illustrate these other people, faceless or not. We are shown her perspective and all the events tie in to her persepctive rather than show her to be a delusional liar, which would make far more sense considering the psychological condition of denial they attempt to portray her as being in.The bridging story of the Carnival, intrigued me at first, although I cringed through the monotone of the male voice-over narrator for these parts. I wondered at first at the symbolic significance that they were attempting to use with the portrayal of the carnival, and although it does serve this in a minor capacity the ultimate integration of the carnival into the main storyline, simply destroyed any symbolic function it could have served and denigrated it into a literal truth. The gameplay itself is fairly smooth and reliable, and area transitions occur quickly without any long delays or interruptions allowing the story to continue at a fairly rapid pace. The only issue is that once the story is completed there isn't much replay value, as interactions don't seem to affect the outcome at all, in fact the only reason to replay would be to try achieve a 100% completion of achievements. In short there is not much longevity to the title.Overall I don't recommend Journal, it's not as poor as I make it out above, but neither is it actually good. In short it is fairly average title, without replayability that means you're probably better off spending your money on another title or buying this only when it's on sale.			"

Posted: December 1, 2014
												Very hard decision, But 51% of me would not recommend this game.I don’t want to spoil the game, but for me, at the start, it's normal to get confused in games or stories, ""it'll make sense later on, don't worry!""(What I said to myself). But in the middle to the near end, I was still confused about the divorce, in fact, it was only until the middle-end I found out it was a divorce(I was that confused) and had to infer to figure out that the protagonist’s mum cheated on her father with John(I think that was his name, but he was a farmer guy).But maybe that’s just the 12ive perspective. Speaking about that, when you had to make the decisions, I had to search up some of the words so i knew i was making the right decisions: /.I had especially been confused with the about the carnival cut scenes. At first, I thought they were like her dreams(since the cut scenes would start when she came home and a new day would start after them) and then I thought of them having a meaning into what you would choose, like you had to learn a lessons from the cut scenes to be successful in the game. I turns out *Minor SPOILER* that it wasn’t something random, but it was to intensify the happy place the carnival was before the closing. But what i hated the most about this game, was the fact that it was intentionally un-organised. The creator told you a major event at the very end of the game, to show you how cowardly she/he was, and how she didn’t want to face it, and ran away from her past. This part made me think and say to myself ""This game was telling everyone how depressed she was, as she lived a life of a girl who chose so many wrong mistakes in her early life and causing various problems, but most importantly, showing everyone how she ran away from everything. But at least the moral was to not end up like her, so selfish and heartless.""On the bright side, this game had an art style that I wish more games were like, which lead me to why i bought the game. I also liked the idea of the creator making us the troublesome protagonist, because was it not only unique, but interesting in a way that it would make us feel irritated and regrettable in the decisions that we were forced to play with, so we could see the creator view in wishing we would regret the actions done.Overall, I think this game would be a nice game for people who want to play a different game, a game where you will lose, possibly feel heart-stuck(if your a softie like me) and have most of the storyline make sense at the very, bitter, end. By this game in like the Christmas/summer sales if you are up for the experience. "

												I want to recommend this game, I really do, but the gameplay detracts from the story too much to actually make me want to tell someone to sit down and play it through. First off I bought this game for maybe $2 on a steam sale. It was something I'd seen a few times and passed up because it didn't look like my type of visual novel. But it was; it was just executed poorly. First off your decisions barely matter. Only if you want the losing a friend achievement does it matter what you choose along the way (and I just so happened to toss myself down that road in my first playthrough) and even then losing a friend doesn't change the outcome. The ending is pretty much disjointed from every event along the way. Sure the ending explains her rotten mood, but the ending is more of a 'this is why I'm acting so sour' kind of backstory than it is 'these are the consequences of my actions' which is what you would expect a series of choices to lead you to. I could live with that (even though the completionist in me wants to truck through and read all the dialogue for every option) if it was the only downside of the game.What really gets me though is not the lack of options in the game. It's the feel of the world itself. The MCs voice is very nice and I can appreciate the music of the game, but switching from page to page is a bit of a headache. The pages seem to shift in a very awkward manner looking like it's flickering between the two pages before you finally settle on the second screen and half of the time the MC jumps when she gets there. If she was at the edge of the screen when it was flickering all of a sudden she's in a middle as if the game was trying to disorient you. Day 3 was the worst of it due to a bug that can jump you into the journal pages of Day 5 (except you can't interact with anyone and then you get kicked out of it and think you were doing something wrong and kicked yourself out of Day 3's plot). Overall I felt like I was tussling with the journal pages more than working with it to immerse myself in a story line.On top of the bad scene transitioning is the disjointed day transitioning. Each day ends with a screen shift into what looks like a puppet show telling you a 'story' that is supposed to connect with the main story line. On most days it feels as though the author of the game forgot where we was going with the story and abruptly cut it short before the final conclusion. At first it seems like an isolated event, but once you get to the end of the game you realize that the end of day stories are like most things, cut off without a proper end. There is never an explanation of the package, or her grandmother's behavior, characters like Heather are briefly mentioned and treated as if they'd been there since day one but are really never there at all. The whole incident with John is never flat out explained either-- it's the only piece of the plot that it seems as if the author purposely avoided saying and yet it is the only piece that you can logically draw a conclusion to because everybody knows what really happened.On top of that the game forces achievement hunters to go back through day one all over again looking for a secret ending that adds no depth to the story at all. As if the gameplay wasn't frustrating enough the first time they developers make us take a motion sickening gander across day one all over again to try and 'cheer us up' with a whole bunch of nothing.If you get it on sale, the story (despite it's holes) is cute and will leave you feeling a little heavy, and the achievements are easy to get if that's all you're looking for, but the interface and scene changes just aren't worth the story in my opinion.

												Currently as this game is right now, I would not recommend it. I cannot even get it to play, it automatically shuts itself down due to 'monitor resolution'? And if I turn the volume up or down, it will shut off as well. Very frustrating as I was looking forward to this game. But cannot currently recommend due to the issues with the game itself. :'(			"

												I played this game on a rainy day in lieu of a good book. I loved it. I think this game would be good for people in MSW and LPC programs. It's a very interesting perspective on adolescent grief, and behaviors potentially caused by grief. It is not a long, complicated game, but it hits you hard in the ""feels"".			"

												First and foremost, this isn't a game. It's a series of stories that involve intteraction to progress. If you view this as something to be played, then you won't find anything interesting here. However, if you view this as a story, an experience, then you will come away with, hopefully, at least a few feels. I thought this was quite good actually. A small gem if you go into with an open mind, and not the expectation of it being some kind of action packed, super graphics, baby you the whole way kind of game. And yes, you have to read a lot.

												The premise is cool, but the game's just bland. You can beat this in one session(for those of you thinking 'OH GOD HE HAS SO MANY HOURS LOGGED ON IT SUCH A HYPOCRITE' well i actually just left it up after falling asleep, which, for this game, isn't exactly a strongpoint since I found sleeping more appealing than finishing it.), and get all the achievements fairly easy. There's a twist that really captured the true potential of this game, and I admire the idea and concept behind it. Alas, it falls short of expectations by just being...Very dull, I guess. If you're looking into buying this, get it when it's on sale. I got it for like, 1.99-2.50 or something, so it's not that big of a waste, but I have to say....It's not worth 10 dollars. It's a good game, the elements are in place, but it just falls too short to be worth 10 dollars.			"

I had hoped of a different world, deep characters, twisted storyline.. no. nothing creative, nothing different. yes, it has a story and it really tries to do something with that unbelavably boting story, but no. I was expecting such a different game out of this, but what a waste of time. some dialogues may carry some wise words but still it doesnt reach up anything ""good"" in my opinion. do not buy this game before watching it videos on youtube or something like that. not just the clips, watch the whole game play I suggest.

												The game is kind of terrible- the choices don't really spell out what your response will be, so often your character is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you don't mean to be. Also, your character makes terrible decisions and the game doesn't tell you. For example, your character breaks a window, and blames it on thier friend. The game doesn't even indicate this, so I offered to talk to an adult and find out who did did it, and, surprise, it was you all along!  The game does something similiar with a stolen snow globe. Frankly, it's annoying. On a side note, the art is lackluster and the ending tries too hard to be deep.I bought this game for $2 and I still regret the purchase a little.			"

												Where to begin with this game? Well the pros:1. The game is different to anything I have ever played.2. The voices are actually pretty good.3. The graphics are interesting.Now the bad:1. The game follows a strict story line no matter what you do.2. Much of the game history has already happened and it isn't explained to you until the end.3. The character you play as becomes a self obsorbed, lying thief.4. The cut scenes don't really make a lot of sense to the game.5. The game is very short and very repetative. It has no replay value.I got this game on sale, I feel disapointed at the price I paid. If I had paid full price I would be devastated. I suggest watching game play videos and trying to find a demo before purchasing this game.			"

												This game was actually somewhat frustrating for me to play. Maybe this experience is my own, and nobody else has had any of these problems, but I felt that I should share nonetheless. The story is definitely the most appealing part of the game, but the design behind it is really lacking. Most of it is played through text, and sometimes you'll have to respond to what people have to say. You'll normally be given a couple of choices. Sometimes it's hard to know what choice you pick is going to result in what actually happens. The options are sometimes just vague one word descriptors, and aren't the easiest to follow as to what your character is going to do or say next. This isn't like Mass Effect where it'll give you a diagrahm showcasing which ones are your good and bad choices, which makes it a lot easier to know which route your going in the game. Instead, the options in this game are placed right next to each other with no kind of color indication or anything to specify which one's your 'good' choice, and which one's your 'bad' choice. Maybe I'm just spoiled by how other games have designed their games, but it felt like there could have bee some kind of implementation of that in this.This game also has its fair share of backtracking. You have to talk to everyone (or at least it feels like you have to talk to everyone) if you want to advance the game, and sometimes if you do things out of order (like I guess I must have done...?) then this results in you going around and talking to EVERYBODY AGAIN and going through all the dialogue options AGAIN until you finally find the right person you needed to talk to. Even then sometimes it feels as if you have to talk to some of the characters twice, because for some reason it seems as if there was a dialogue option that wasn't there the first time, unless I'm just mistaken.Also, there was a point in the game where I made a mistake in my choices, but I couldn't go back because the game doesn't have a save system. You can't save and load from wherever you want, instead the game saves and loads based on checkpoints. It would have taken me a few minutes to get back and make the change I wanted by replaying that certain section, but if the game utilized a normal save system, that mistake easily could have been avoided.There was also this strange graphical glitch where the entirety of the text was replaced with these rotating and shifting characters that looked like the text was glitching out to the n'th degree. I don't know if this was intentional or not, but it happened in a few areas of the game, and with dialogue that I don't think I was supposed to miss, so it must have been some kind of glitch. Game breaking, no, but definitely something that was very confusing, and ultimately just led to more frustration.All in all, this game feels very sloppy and poorly designed which broke my immersion into it about halfway through. This made me frustrated and not really care much about the story, which is what the game is all about. Don't get me wrong, I'm fine if a game is all story (I loved Gone Home), but this art style and engine were not the best route to accomplish the story they wanted to tell. There could have been a much better way to tell this story. Overall, if you think the game looks like it has an interesting story, pick it up when it's cheap. Otherwise, give this one a pass.			"

												Teenage Girl Problems: The Video GameFirst of all, I do NOT recommend this game if you're having a hard time in your life, or if you are looking for a game with lots of explosions and difficult puzzles. That having been said, I DO recommend this game to people who have a fondness for interactive storytelling. Journal deals with growing up and making mistakes, as well as suffering the consequences. It's gameplay is very simple and easy to figure out, but dealing with EVERYONE'S issues makes it a little emotionally draining. Some people you can make ammends with(such as Mr. Collinsworth), but with others(like Elena the Abominable Super♥♥♥♥♥) it seems like no matter what you do, they just won't accept your apologies. It's a lot like real life, and helping your character through her problems can be both rewarding and frustrating.			"

												First off, don't buy this game if you're looking for a fast-paced adventure experience, because you will not find that here. Instead, you'll find a visual novel with a boatload of symbolism and some interesting concepts. The story is slow-paced, but it's deep if you can read between the lines, and even more so when you reach the end of the game.I love Journal. There's a LOT I can say about it, but not so much without spoilers. So I'll talk about the aspects I liked about the game briefly and generally. You make decisions on the protagonist's attitude towards other characters in the game. Now, that on it's own might now seem like much. There are tons of games that let you do that. These decisions don't even have much affect on the game in the long run. It's a linear storyline. Still, that was just something I liked about it.Some decisions do affect the game, and these are probably the biggest reason I love Journal. In one part of the game, the protagonist faces a challenge that she can choose to accept assistance in facing. I think that's a lot deeper than it may seem. Really, it says a lot about human nature. We don't like to reach out for help sometimes, but in reality, it would make the situation so much better. Then, immediately following that choice, you get to choose whether or not to let your mother know that you had trouble completing the task, and whether or not you seeked help for it. That's another interesting tidbit on our nature. Even if we choose to accept help on things, often times, we don't want it to be known that we did so. I suppose we just want to make ourselves look better by making it seem as if we've done everything on our own.The thing that impacted me the most in this game was the choice of whether or not to fess up to something you have done. I played through this part twice, and I know both of the ways the story could go from there. Of course, I'm not going to say it for respect for those who do not appreciate spoilers, but I thought it was a very deep decision, and it really impacted me and really made me love Journal even more.I also love the soundtrack to Journal. I just find it to be beautiful. The art style is attractive as well, featuring a hand-drawn feel to the graphics. It suits the game well as it is supposed to be inside of a Journal.By now, if you've read this far, you can see pretty clearly that I'm a huge fan of symbolism. So another thing that I really appreciated in the game was the shadow puppet shows after each chapter. At first, I was confused, and I didn't like the shadow puppet shows. I thought they were fillers with no meaning and no input to the developing story. They just seemed meaningless and unnecessary. However, as I progressed through the story and thought deeply about what each character may have been thinking or feeling based on their actions in the game, I realized that the shadow puppet shows were symbolically linked to the main story. In fact, if you really think about the stories presented, they're surprisingly easy to link the symbolism. I realized that, really, the shadow puppet shows are a brilliant addition to the experience. If you are patient enough to get through the slow story, you will not be disappointed.			"

												This game is a masterpiece and I cannot recommend it enough. I was mostly drawn to this game due to the artistic style, and that certainly didn't disappoint. Journal has an aesthetic that I've never really seen anywhere else, and it makes good use of it throughout.While I came for the aesthetic, I stayed for Journal's narrative and writing. It's a game where the character you play as is an actual character: she does things you don't want her to do, she says things you don't want her to say, and she keeps secrets from you. Constantly. It also is a game about choice, but also not. It's really just a game about life and living and how consequences will always be there, no matter how hard you try to outrun them or erase them.Journal is, at its essence, about the human experience of storytelling. It's about the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves to try and make sense of ourselves, our worlds, and our lives.			"

												""Coming of age"" has always been one of my favorite genre/theme in a story, whether it's from a medium of a book, a movie or a game.   Now I'm happy to see more of these type of themes in a game, and thus made me more appreciate of these indie games.The only thing that I find it dissapointing is that the game wasn't as emotional as I hoped it to be.  However, this game is unique and beautifully illustrated.  Also, the option of being able to play with a controller is always a plus in my book.  The gameplay may feel a bit slow with some backtracking.  At the end of every chapter, or day in the story, you are presented with this little cut scene, that basically translates to ""so the moral of the story is …"", I thought this is a nice touch to the game.The overall feel of the game seems very genuine.   Even I haven't been a teenager for a long time, or never been a female for that matter; I still feel like  I can relate with this teenage female protagonist of the story. I like the ending, it concludes very well.  I would recommend it even the overall story lines is quite plain; however, playing it does feel like a special and somewhat bitter sweet experience of reading one's journal.			"

To start with you wander around being a ♥♥♥♥♥ to everyone you know, you have a limited amount of decision making input into just how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥ you are to the people you meet but the game does come together in what I thought was a satisfying ending.

												I gotta admit, I didn't expect much from this game at my first glance. Simple hand-drawn 2D sprites on 2D backgrounds, weird linear walking physics with janky scene transitions and a pointless jump button, lots of text about serious life stuff, music by Kevin MacLeod (AKA incompetech AKA the royalty-free guy); there are so many things in this game that raise many red flags in my book.However! I'm glad I played through it, since it is a heartfelt, simple game that manages to escape the mediocrity those qualities are often associated with. The music is an original composition, for one. The story about coping with the unexpected difficulties of life resonated in a way I did not initially expect it to. It felt somewhat enriching. I still think about this game every now and then, months after last playing it.Oh, also: it's got Steam trading cards. It practically pays for itself!			"

												The way the game tells the story of a journal THROUGH a journal framed setting is kind of cool and end really wraps up the story and the story itself is okay- but that's about is as far as positives.The story line (until the end) is very simplistic, the mechanics were kind of rusty (having to press Space at such random times), the dialogue was kind of tedius and repetative, and MOST importantly the characters were a tad shallow. Honestly, I can't even tell you the name of the main character- if there even WAS one. The game also seemed to skip key pieces of the plot where it seemed like a decision could have been made: (spoilers) for instance, you steal something and have the option of confessing, but you aren't even TOLD you stole it until you talk to a specific person. It made the gameplay choppy. Honestly, it's best to look up a let's play or buy it on sale, but do NOT spend $9.99. Not worth it.			"

												Just an FYI, I'm going to be spoiling story stuff in this review, so for the spoiler-free review, all I have to say is:Journal is a story-based game with good voice-acting, music, and art assets, but I found the story to be muddled and confusing, which is bad for a story-based game like Journal, as there is nothing else for the game to fall back on, and for that I can't recommend this game.Spoilers from here on out.I was drawn to Journal because it is a story-based game, and in general I tend to like story-based games like this. Other than that I came into Journal with no other preconceptions, so I was essentially walking into it with an open mind with very few preconceptions about what I'd find.I went through the first couple of days of the game and for the most part enjoyed myself. I enjoyed walking around the town, meeting new people and having conversations with them and piecing together information about this world. However I did not enjoy having to take certain actions before I had all the information about the situation, which I felt was the case many times when dealing with the bad things the character did. In the story, we discover that the main character broke a window at school and blamed her friend for it, cheated on a Math test, and stole a snowglobe from a charity shop (what I'm assuming is the UK version of a Goodwill), and every time I had to make a decision about the situation only to have the revelation of what had happened be revealed after I had made those decisions. Day 4 takes a darker turn as you find out that your parents are going through a divorce because your mother was caught sleeping with the park groundskeeper, and you come to this realization while your mother is pressuring you to say something at your grandmother's grave, with whom you had a shaky relationship with before her death. The fifth and final day drops the big whammy that your sister was critically injured on a carnival ferris wheel, and the fifth day is the day you say goodbye to her for the last time. This is the point where I'd say that story fell apart. Day 4 already felt very disconnected from the 3 previous days, and Day 5 was even more so.To sum up my feelings of the story of Journal, is that it left me both confused and bored. At the end of the game, I did not really care for our protagonist, she came off as a bratty teenager, and that is not a character type that I enjoy or empathize with. As such I did not care that her sister had died, and I did not care that she had attempted to re-write her journal to remove the pain of losing her sister from her memories as part of her journey through the grieving process. All I could think of is that I would be one of those people who would say ""I'm sorry for your loss"" that she expressed frustration with.The main creative force behind this game is Richard Perrin, who had previously done the game Kairo, which is a game that I had played for a little bit, but I can honestly say that I didn't ""get"" that game, and that seems to be a trend for me with his games. I don't ""get"" Journal. Maybe Richard Perrin is pretentious, or maybe I'm not the kind of person who can understand his games, but either way, I don't ""get"" Journal.Because of how lack-luster I felt the story was, I can't recommend this game. It wasn't a bad game, but it certainly wasn't a good game either, and if you went your whole life not playing this game, I wouldn't say that you missed much.			"

This game is very basic: you walk back and forth across a dull background and have dull conversations with uninteresting characters.Also, for a game not very graphically intense, the lag that happens when you change location is quite a surprise.

												Just an FYI, I'm going to be spoiling story stuff in this review, so for the spoiler-free review, all I have to say is:Journal is a story-based game with good voice-acting, music, and art assets, but I found the story to be muddled and confusing, which is bad for a story-based game like Journal, as there is nothing else for the game to fall back on, and for that I can't recommend this game.Spoilers from here on out.I was drawn to Journal because it is a story-based game, and in general I tend to like story-based games like this. Other than that I came into Journal with no other preconceptions, so I was essentially walking into it with an open mind with very few preconceptions about what I'd find.I went through the first couple of days of the game and for the most part enjoyed myself.

The graphics and voice acting are good, but it's the story that makes this game shine.However, how much I liked this game, it's just too short to justify it's full price.

												I gotta admit, I didn't expect much from this game at my first glance. Simple hand-drawn 2D sprites on 2D backgrounds, weird linear walking physics with janky scene transitions and a pointless jump button, lots of text about serious life stuff, music by Kevin MacLeod (AKA incompetech AKA the royalty-free guy); there are so many things in this game that raise many red flags in my book.However! I'm glad I played through it, since it is a heartfelt, simple game that manages to escape the mediocrity those qualities are often associated with. The music is an original composition, for one. The story about coping with the unexpected difficulties of life resonated in a way I did not initially expect it to. It felt somewhat enriching. I still think about this game every now and then, months after last playing it.Oh, also: it's got Steam trading cards. It practically pays for itself!			"

												This is great conceptually, but I wouldn't exactly call it fun or relaxing to play.  It is less of a game, and more of an interactive story about a young girl coming to grips with the more unpleasant things in life such as accepting responsibility for her actions, dealing with hard truths, acknowledging her limitations, and accepting that sometimes bad things just happen.  It's a well-told story, and it was trying to accurately portray human brokenness, but after a while it kind of felt like ""Empty Apologies: The Game.""Gameplay involves simply walking around town and talking with people.  (There is a jump button programmed into the controls, but you never actually do anything with it.)  Occasionally you will need to interact with an object, but for the most part you will be dealing entirely with dialogue.  You are only able to marginally impact the outcome of events, however, and many of your ""decisions"" are merely for flavour.  This makes sense story-wise, but as a player it is a bit frustrating.The art style is interesting.  It is made to look like the animated pages of a child's sketchbook, with office supplies like post-it notes and paperclips blocking off unavailable paths on the map.  I thought this presentation was clever, and added to the immersive atmosphere of the game.Additionally, the voice acting was strong, I liked the secret ending, and I enjoyed the silhouette cutscenes between chapters (although I wish I'd been able to skip them on subsequent playthroughs).  Overall, I found this game to have high production values and an intellectually stimulating premise; however, it was taxing to play through, involving heavy-handed doses of both school and family drama, and only minimal gameplay.  I would rate this game a 6.5/10			"

												I bought this game for the story and for the unique lined-journal art style. It made me think about my own childhood and the journal writing I used to do. Buy this game if you ~ like walking simulation games and interactive fiction~ are patient and willing to watch a story enfold gradually~ like journals and can appreciate the fine line between truth, memory and fiction~ prefer short games The game was very short, which was fine because some of the walking simulation began to get a bit repetitive after a while and I was looking forward to the ending. Unfortunately, the trajectory of the narrative is such that it totally does not prepare you for the ending, which felt rather forced and hurried.  "

												At first I was like ""oh great, another indie game which looks so artsy and nothing more...""Bluntly, I judged the book by it's cover first until I tried it out. First, it haven't made me to suck in it, but later on, the story did managed to dig up feelings towards itself until the point where we could say, this isn't just a game, but something more. And at the end, it shocks the player by it's plot twist.The background looks nice, the child's drawing is correct, the faceless characters are okay, but the protagonist's movement animation could have been better or another one. It was really disturbing to see it moving, and sometimes the keyboard press-sensor is over-reactive, so sometimes you'll find yourself a screen far away where you would want to go.			"

I reckon it's worth somewhere in the middle of the two prices.The game itself has a very unique art style that grew on me quickly. I liked the main character (And her adorable beret, despite what one of the ending songs might say about them) and found the gameplay smooth with no pacing issues. I completed the whole game in one sitting, and picked up the last 2 or 3 achievements the morning after. In 2.4 hours to 100% the game it's relatively short, but hey it does good for a lazy sunday or a wind down before bed.The story itself was quite interesting, the characters were believable and it really helps to get the perspective of a chid who is going through stressful and hurtful times. I felt like the end plot twist came out of nowhere, but that was all then explained and also worked very well.Definitely pick this one up if it's on sale, or if you want some easy trading cards/achievements. :)			"

												The way the game tells the story of a journal THROUGH a journal framed setting is kind of cool and end really wraps up the story and the story itself is okay- but that's about is as far as positives.The story line (until the end) is very simplistic, the mechanics were kind of rusty (having to press Space at such random times), the dialogue was kind of tedius and repetative, and MOST importantly the characters were a tad shallow. Honestly, I can't even tell you the name of the main character- if there even WAS one. The game also seemed to skip key pieces of the plot where it seemed like a decision could have been made: (spoilers) for instance, you steal something and have the option of confessing, but you aren't even TOLD you stole it until you talk to a specific person. It made the gameplay choppy. Honestly, it's best to look up a let's play or buy it on sale, but do NOT spend $9.99. Not worth it.			"

												Ugh... so many thoughts after finishing this game.  The truth is, I'm not sure how to feel about it.Do I recommend the game?........... Yes.  I think it's worthy of recommendation.  This recommendation does, however, come with a caveat.The game, to me, was very disjointed.  It was as if every day's journal entry was completely unrelated to any others.  It also seemed that despite the choices made and what was said during some of the many conversations throughout, the outcomes seemed a bit unexpected and almost illogical.  I found I was often confused when, as the protagonist I would be having a seemingly pleasant conversation with someone only to find I was suddenly forced to defend myself over something that was not apparent.  But I guess, after thinking about it more, maybe that's one of the themes of this game... not everything happens as expected.In the end, you do sort of find out, in an abrupt sort of way, the premise for the game itself and why some things happened the way they did.  It still doesn't explain everything of course.  I was still very moved (to tears) by the ending as it comes almost out of the blue and it hits you like a ton of bricks, but I was also still a bit confused with some of the prior events since they did seem very mashed together.Aside from the story, I like the graphic style used.  The voice acting was top notch and helped me connect a bit more with the main character.  The music was also very well done.So once again... I do recommend this game, but you really do have to play it without expectations.  It is still a touching story.			"

I found it quite clever that the areas in the game where blocked off by real world objects like band-aides and stamps.

												This game is a masterpiece and I cannot recommend it enough. I was mostly drawn to this game due to the artistic style, and that certainly didn't disappoint. Journal has an aesthetic that I've never really seen anywhere else, and it makes good use of it throughout.While I came for the aesthetic, I stayed for Journal's narrative and writing. It's a game where the character you play as is an actual character: she does things you don't want her to do, she says things you don't want her to say, and she keeps secrets from you. Constantly. It also is a game about choice, but also not. It's really just a game about life and living and how consequences will always be there, no matter how hard you try to outrun them or erase them.Journal is, at its essence, about the human experience of storytelling. It's about the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves to try and make sense of ourselves, our worlds, and our lives.			"

												First thing I would like to highlight: (conclusion at the bottom)If I had gotten this game at it's normal price, I would have flipped out because it's NOT worth it. But since I had gotten it at SGD$2.62 (75% discount), I won't complain.I was kinda lost/confused throughout the game about what's going on with the girl. The plot was there, but it felt like it failed to fully translate itself sufficiently into the gameplay. This game would have scored more if more details were there to intrigue me into being more absorbed in its world. Because I feel that the plot is actually much deeper (but it just failed to convey fully through the game), I'm giving it a thumbs up (i.e. recommend it).Conclusion:If S$2.62 is disposable to you, and you have spare time to lose, get it. If not, move on to other games like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons; got it during a sale for approx. S$2 and it was WELL WORTH IT.			"

												I wasn't terribly fond of Kairo, but I liked my time with this game. The presentation is interesting and well thought out. There is some very well thought out dialogue in this game too. The only downside I really have to the game is that the ending is telegraphed way in advance so it kind of takes some of the impact away. I like how they did it. I just wasn't at all surprised when I got to the end. The secret ending on this one is great too. I really liked this game and I would recommend it to people that liked things like To the Moon. If you don't want to do a lot of reading this one might not be the best option for you, but even then it might do you some good to play this one.			"

												Lovely, poignant, and at times distressing, Journal is perhaps most interesting because of the way it reacts to your decisions. Sometimes it feels as though the game, or the protagonist herself, is fighting against you. The tension created between what you want the protagonist to do and what she actually does, often in spite of the choices you make as the player, neatly underscores her own internal conflicts and the feelings of helplessness no doubt experienced by anyone going through a lot of rough stuff at home. It seems that you remain a troubled youngster no matter what you do.			"

												You play this game feeling you must have control because you ARE the main charactor and you get to decide what she decides to say, to a certain extent. You soon see you have little control over her actions, however, and its confusing and a bit frustrating to try and understand why she doesn't seem to listen to you as you play as her. The game is a fairly eye opening symulation that makes sense only at the very end. Its short and simple with a few extra acheivments.  On sale, I believe it was totally worth it.			"

												I was very interested in this game when I read the reviews and heard about story in the game, but as I went on, I realized that the story is something very personal(as if it already happened) and you don't really have choice over what the character do, I think what goes in the journal is the only difference and the game felt like a book, I couldn't finish the game because I lost too much interest in the process.

												Journal takes you into the life of a troubled young girl. It kept me on the edge of my seat, yearning to understand the reasons behind her actions. The artwork is perfect for setting the atmosphere of the game, and toes the line between beautiful and brilliantly unsettling. All characters have a lot of depth for such a short narrative. My only complaint is that the narrative may have been better handled if the illusion of choice had been left out in some places. It leaves the player expecting to have more control than they do.			"

												I enjoyed the overall story and think it captured the confusion of being a child well. I was less enchanted by the vague choice descriptions that I think were somewhat misleading. For instance, When I set Keith up with Anne, I chose supportive options, but the main character was half-hearted and obviously regretted what she had done. She regretted it more openly than she regretted breaking a window and blaming her friend, and that disconnect between me and her was very jarring because it was something I never would have regreted in any way. But, then, maybe that was the point, since she was not a blank slate.			"

												Journal is not a video game, there is no actual ""game"" involved: no puzzles, no skills required, no choices. It is just a mildly long story -  nearly 3 hours - that unfolds as one clicks endlessly the same button and travels the same places.The story is not great either: It starts in a terrible way and gets mildly more interesting as it approaches the end. However, dialogues are quite boring and sometimes they feel inconsistent.Journal could probably be transformed into a decent comic book, but it is not a good video game. This is somehow sad to realize, because it seems to me that the game means a lot to its authors for personal reasons.			"

												This game sat in my library for a few months. I totally forgot why I bought this game, and got distracted I guess. Anyway, while alone for a short time, I finally decided to see it.I was happy with what I found, and I wish I had played it sooner.I guess what was so interesting about this game to me was the themes of a child growing up, and family torn apart by distrust and loss. I come from a normal family, unbroken by divorce or any loss of close relatives or family. Even more so, I know people who do suffer such experiences, and I try to console them, like any person would, but never understand what they're feeling. When I played this game, I actually got a small look into that experience, that loneliness, that confusion and frustration. I can never understand that, and I can never help anyone like that in any meaningful way. But playing this game, I feel I have gained a new level of empathy for those families.Thank you for the game. 10/10			"

												Journal is a game that can't be fully explained with words on a review page. It is a game that's better to experience for yourself. Just to be sure that someone wanting to buy the game is reading this, I will include no spoilers whatsoever.The summary of the game states: ""Enter the pages of the hand painted world of Journal. A journey through the life of a young and troubled girl as she tries to face up to the choices and responsibilities that come with childhood. An experience that questions the reliability of how we choose to remember events and explores the truths hidden within our dreams.Journal is a narrative driven adventure game by Richard Perrin, the creator of Kairo and the white chamber, with art and writing by Melissa Royall.""Well, it certainly is everything stated right there. This game is something that hits hard with reality. It doesn't put anything unrealistic or stupid in it, but rather truthful and depressing subjects that hit hard with many who play it.The story, the ending and the characters are all brilliant! The only thing holding this game back (Which lots of people have mentioned already) are the slippery controls. You know every ice level EVER on a platform game? Where you're sliding all over the place and the controls are so sensitive? That's this game for the entire thing. But after about an hour into the game, I stopped paying attention to the slippery controls and fell in love with the story. Another con would also be that the games too short for a $10 game on Steam. I got this on sale for $1.39 and it was a bloody bargain.If you, the reader, aren't aware of my rating system it goes like this.BURN IT! (1-2/10)Refund it politely then wonder why you ever played this game (3-4/10)Buy it if it's on sale (5-6/10)Buy it anytime and complete it (7-8)BUY IT THEN REPLAY IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN! (9-10/10)So, this game is totally worth buying and it only take 3 hours to complete, but I think you should probably get it on a sale. This game also has a secret ending so, there's more for you.I rate this game 6.5 depressed children out of 10.			"

												Ugh... so many thoughts after finishing this game.  The truth is, I'm not sure how to feel about it.Do I recommend the game?........... Yes.  I think it's worthy of recommendation.  This recommendation does, however, come with a caveat.The game, to me, was very disjointed.  It was as if every day's journal entry was completely unrelated to any others.  It also seemed that despite the choices made and what was said during some of the many conversations throughout, the outcomes seemed a bit unexpected and almost illogical.  I found I was often confused when, as the protagonist I would be having a seemingly pleasant conversation with someone only to find I was suddenly forced to defend myself over something that was not apparent.  But I guess, after thinking about it more, maybe that's one of the themes of this game... not everything happens as expected.In the end, you do sort of find out, in an abrupt sort of way, the premise for the game itself and why some things happened the way they did.  It still doesn't explain everything of course.  I was still very moved (to tears) by the ending as it comes almost out of the blue and it hits you like a ton of bricks, but I was also still a bit confused with some of the prior events since they did seem very mashed together.Aside from the story, I like the graphic style used.  The voice acting was top notch and helped me connect a bit more with the main character.  The music was also very well done.So once again... I do recommend this game, but you really do have to play it without expectations.  It is still a touching story.			"

Although the concept has potential, it is poorly executed, and you are left with an experience that doesn't feel complete. This is another case where the gameplay does not match the high quality of the aesthetics.			"

												At first I was upset with the actions and choices of the main character however that is because I was playing under the perception of innocence of the art style. The ending makes the game. The ending makes the game. Gameplay is pretty straight foreward and it's not hard to know where you are suppose to go. I found it quite clever that the areas in the game where blocked off by real world objects like band-aides and stamps. The only issue with the game is that there is one rock in the graveyard where the outline flahses white.Great game. Trigger Warnings though. Not much replay value but I would share it with friends.

												First thing I would like to highlight: (conclusion at the bottom)If I had gotten this game at it's normal price, I would have flipped out because it's NOT worth it. But since I had gotten it at SGD$2.62 (75% discount), I won't complain.I was kinda lost/confused throughout the game about what's going on with the girl. The plot was there, but it felt like it failed to fully translate itself sufficiently into the gameplay. This game would have scored more if more details were there to intrigue me into being more absorbed in its world. Because I feel that the plot is actually much deeper (but it just failed to convey fully through the game), I'm giving it a thumbs up (i.e. recommend it).Conclusion:If S$2.62 is disposable to you, and you have spare time to lose, get it. If not, move on to other games like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons; got it during a sale for approx. S$2 and it was WELL WORTH IT.			"

												     Journal is unique. to start off simply. The story of a teenage girl going through her life day-by-day. There isn't much to speak about really. She goes through her town, interacting with people in her life, school, etc. The main character isn't the greatest person. In fact, I would normally be telling people to not buy this game. I felt she was handled terribly and I felt no sympathy for her. That is, however, until the ending. I won't say anything more but it made me change my mind slightly. I do recommend this game, but only if you find it on sale, in a bundle, or are shared it through someone's library. That's how one should play this game. Play, enjoy, move on, as easy as that.			"

												Why do choices always have to matter? Why do the player always have to be allowed to chose things? In this game, you'll be confronted with the mental breakdown of the protagonist, and while you have some options how to approach dialogs, you'll have to realise that you're unable to change anything that has already happened a long time ago.I felt way more immersed and touched by the story than by the oh-so-hyped Live is Strange, despite both having a somewhat similar setting to start with and presenting quite stereotype characters.It's not like most visual novels or Telltale games offere more meaningful choices, but they hold the illusion up somewhat longer. If you're looking for that, this game won't work for you. If you want just see a story unfold, you should give this game a try (maybe when it's on sale since 10 Euro for ~2 h is quite harsh).			"

												I think explaining the mechanics of the game is SPOILERS, but many of the negative reviews talk about them anyway, so here are my thoughts:Many of the choices in the game will seem irritating to people who are used to games granting them agency. Similar to Bioshock Infinite, the point here is that the player character has no agency in the situations affecting her, or even in how she reacts. The player is not in complete control of the main character: she is not even in complete control of herself. The best you can do is ride the waves.Making decisions based on incomplete information seems unfair. I think this could have been an interesting mechanical framing if it had been driven home harder in the narrative expositions: if it had been made clear that the narrator was changing her mind, and not writing the whole truth.This game was an interesting experiment, and while it left me frustrated immediately after finishing the experience, I'm starting to come around to it a few hours later.

 Simple Yet Profound Journal is a very deep, interesting, story driven game that revolves around a teenage protagonist's life struggle and it's up to you to help her get through them by interacting with other characters, learning more about them and herself as you progress and choosing what happens next. You can be supportive and understanding or bitter and resentful, which means you make decisions that affect the narrative. How much of an impact it has on the final outcome is yet to be seen as I have yet to replay the game and chances are I will. I very much enjoy the story, the characters and the overall presentation of the game and I'm having a lot of fun with it. I can't say more without spoiling it for others, but  I really recommend this game for anyone remotely interested in a good story.  "
