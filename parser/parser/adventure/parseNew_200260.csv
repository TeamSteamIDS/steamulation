												Arkham City is everything that Arkham Asylum was but improved in almost every way.  Rocksteady kept true to their excellent action, stealth, gadgetry and puzzle-solving formula and made improvements only where they were needed.  The freeflow combat and silent predator systems also make a welcome comeback.  Where Arkham Asylum was a bit more rigid in it's story telling, Arkham City makes the improvement of creating a more open world and adding well-integrated side missions that have some meaning to the main story and makes the game feel less linear.  Again the voice acting is top-notch and the pacing and progression of the story is a high-point of this title.			"

												Largely fixing the control problems of Arkham Asylum on PC, Arkham City takes you and throws you into a large environment that allows you to explore and fight in many different interesting and entertaining ways.Control problems out of the way, you are largely free to play the game without concern for what is happening next, you can just go with the flow and not worry about a lack of gadgets.  Of course, Arkham Asylum's silly idea of RPG elements are still around, and shouldn't be, but the developer needed to shoehorn in a reason to collect things - other than just it being an entertaining set of puzzles.Unfortunately it does have a problem with game design, Batman does not fight armies of men in hand to hand combat...  He fights small groups from time to time, but it is quite rare to see Batman taking on 50 men.  Yet in this game, it happens on several occasions, as though the developers wanted you to feel super badass for doing this amazing thing that Batman would think is incredibly stupid and a waste of his time.  Batman does not take down armies, he would use a clever gadget to take down most of them, and then mop up the rest.The game is fun, the story is a bit contrived, but that is kind of standard for Batman stories.I could easily recommend this game to players.

												Batman: Arkham City is the 3rd person beat em up, open world sequel to the Arkham Asylum game where once again you play as not only Batman, but a few missions as Catwoman. There are so many criminals in Gotham City that someone decided Black Gate prison and Arkham Asylum can't house them all, so now there's an entire city district now being used as a prison / asylum. With that logic out of the way, this is an open world game unique unto itself. The city is gorgeous, every part of the city is a vista no matter how grimy areas are, they're all so beautiful. Every locale oozes personality, from a frozen police station to a clown infested steel mill. No exterior seems copied and pasted and that says a lot. There is an amazing attention to detail and the game still runs silky smooth.While the city (district) is big, it doesn't feel huge, there are missions that will have you from one end of the city (district) to the other in about two minutes, because Batman knows how to get around. You'll glide from place to place, dive kick enemies and use your grappling hook to quickly get from rooftop to rooftop. Not only that, but just holding the run button has a lot of functionality, it'll let you jump, climb and even glide. So you never miss a beat. Catwoman has a whip to get around. She can also cling to walls and ceilings.The streets are still dangerous, that's where most of the enemies are. You can keep to the rooftops or stealth around them. You can take out enemies stealthily one by one by using gargoyles to hide in the shadows and floor or wall grates to move through from point A to point B all to evade enemy detection. You'll hear them talk about things and when they find one of their comrades down, they'll be more alert and eager to shoot down gargoyles so you won't have that one to hide on. Once you get far enough in the game, you'll unlock challenge rooms which revisit previous locations, but with more challenge that you need to take out the enemies using stealth.Almost all of the major villains are back from Arkham Asylum, proving Batman should really start killing his greatest foes. Not just that, but there are new villains and almost all of them have their own gang. This gives the goons more style, but really, the goons are all the same for the most part resorting to just brawlers and gunmen. Eventually the game amps things up with long range snipers, armored brawlers, shielded brawlers, knife wielders and stun batoners. If a gun or weapon gets knocked out of the hand of a gunman, someone else can pick it up. The brawlers will pile on you, sometimes two dozen at a time, and as Batman, you can easily if not tediously defeat them. Batman: Arkham City is essentially a beat em up with a lot of traversal. Batman really just has one attack button to spam and Batman will do all of the punching, kicks, sweeps and brawling himself. When enemies telegraph an attack, you have a counter button. There are other enemies that require you to use a stun maneuver, but you might forget you even have it. The gunners require a lot more finesse to deal with, since Batman can easily be murdered by anything with a gun, even when you start upgrading your armor. The AI of the gunners is great, they'll patrol, warn others when they find a downed ally. While the enemy variety is very limited, they all seem very smart, so that makes up for it. Why have specific enemy types when they're all smart enough to do anything?Other than brawling, Batman has other tools and a quick switch menu using the D-pad. You'll start out with everything you earned in the previous game. Multiple batterangs, remote control batterangs, a zip-line, explosive gel, a grappling hook to rip down high up grates, a new smoke bomb to hide when you've been spotted, freeze grenades, which are good for freezing one enemy at a time and floating through the sewers. You'll quickly find a new electricity gun for lack of a better term that will power devices like garage doors. Everything in the arsenal can be used for combat or traversal.Making its return is also detective mode that lets you see hints, such as highlighting enemies, seeing them through objects, lit up gargoyles you can grapple onto, doors, grates, footprints, sniper rifle trajectories and the Riddler's riddles. Speaking of the riddles, in the previous games they were just collectables. At the most you had to blow up a wall using explosive gel to reach them. Now you'll need to solve puzzles to get them. It is amazing the level of detail that was put into this game, even just for these common puzzles. You'll come across them often.Speaking of the level of detail, the side quests aren't just quests, but they feel like extra storylines. Everything is fully voiced. Every NPC, villain, thug, Batman and Catwoman. You'll hear thugs discussing things, along with radio transmissions every so often. In the previous game you were taunted by the Joker who is voiced by Luke Skywalker for those that remember the old Batman: The Animated Series. Kevin Conroy reprises his role from the series as Batman, and they're both excellent. There are plenty of other major voice acting stars such as Tara Strong, Nolan North and Maurice LaMarce.With the actual game out of the way, there is the 'Riddler's Revenge' mode, which are challenge rooms like the first game had. Combat rooms where you get a high score beating up waves enemies. Then there are 'predator maps' that require you to take out gunmen in specific ways to beat the challenges. There are even downloadable challenge rooms, mini campaigns and even a make your own challenge map where you chose a map and select goals. You'll also get to select your character from Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing. Since this is Game of the Year Edition, you'll have plenty of costumes to chose from.The Game of the Year Edition comes with the Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC that has you playing as Robin and Batman in an extra hour or two mission. It has a good quick story and quality voice acting, but it won't expand that much. Robin plays mostly like Batman and has the same tools as he does with a few exceptions. Its nice to have, but I couldn't imagine it being worth the purchase price outside of getting it free in the Game of the Year Edition.To top that off, there is a lot of extra content for players and Batman fans. Profiles on every character with detailed information. Challenge rooms to unlock and play through for high scores. This is an amazing game that feels and looks completely different than anything else out there. It is really enjoyable as a game, not just as a Batman fan.There is a ton of content in Arkham City. Well worth $20, unless you can find it on sale or in a bundle like I did. I just feel bad for any game that has to follow this up. Not only another game in the franchise, but I feel bad for competing games. This game makes great use of the Batman mythos while new superhero IPs like Infamous just don't have the fleshed out characters to draw from. This is an amazing win and a crushing defeat to any other super hero game.			"

												Arkham City has been sat in my library since it pretty much came out. Although 99% of people who will read this review will probably already have City, it will just be a case of trying to persuade you to finally dust it off and complete it.I have poured thirty two hours roaming around Arkham, it's a stunning looking game, even for current standards. The Arkham style combat system is at its best again, similar to Asylum, you can pretty much master the system when you can work out how to time your attacks perfectly, but you can add in plenty of combos to keep things interesting. The main story is only one of the features here, I thoroughly enjoyed the main plot, with lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing right till the very end. Like most open world games, there is plenty to do apart from the main story though, tons of side missions, collectables and challenges that will keep this wonderful game going. If you have the Game of the Year edition, you'll also have all of the DLC too, while some of it is useless in my opinion (the  challenges) the story side of it is well worth playing through as well. Basically, if you don't have Arkham City...well, where have you been for the past few years since it almost always goes on sale for at least 75% off, and if you are part of the majority who have it, I highly recommend you put aside a few days of your busy life and play this amazing master piece.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

INTRODUCTION:Batman: Arkham City is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Arkham Asylum by Rocksteady Studios.  It is an 'Open World Action-Adventure game that incorporates one of the best blends of action and stealth mechanic on any game on its genre to date. It was first released on the consoles and made it's way to the PC. It included the Catwoman DLC which lets the player use Catwoman who has her own special move set and gamestyle.PLOT (No Spoilers):The game follows the adventures of Batman approximately one year after the events of Arkham Asylum. A large portion of Gotham City has been walled off and turned into a maximum security prison called Arkham City which is placed under the supervision of Dr. Hugo Strange. Bruce Wayne starts a campaign to shut down the prison but was subsequently arrested by orders of Dr. Strange and thrown into Arkham City. There, he is greeted by a massive gang war between some of the deadliest super villains Batman has ever faced. Survive within the walls of Arkham City as the Batman, discover the prison's true purpose and learn something called 'Protocol 10'.PROS:+ Open World Map: As opposed to Arkham Asylum which was semi-open.+ Improved Graphical Fidelity: Animation is more fluid and has excellent use of PhysX technology+ Immersive Atmosphere+ Sound: To be specific, this game has some of the best voice acting I have ever seen. (with Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy and Tara Strong, what did you expect?)+ Replayablitiy and end game content: Side missions, New Game Plus, Challanges and more will keep you occupied+ Easter Eggs with History and Lore of the Batman Universe+ Humor: The inmates provide some very humorous conversations which makes for a refreshing feel to the otherwise dark and serious tone of the game.+ Character diversity: Granted you can only play Batman and Catwoman in the main story, Nightwing and Robin can also be played during the challenge missions. They come with their own skills, gadgets and play styles.CONS:- Main Campaign is too short if you skip all the side content.- PhysX, although a great addition, only benefits Nvidia users, and AMD users might need to put a little more effort in order to benefit from its features.- Games for Windows Live shutdown caused some users to loose their save files when the game was transferred to Steam. (If your just buying this game, don't worry about this CON)- Too little screen time for the main villains- Some frustrating Riddler / Augmented Reality Training ChallangesCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME! A worthy successor to Arkham Asylum. The game expanded the world in which the player can explore, provided a great atmosphere and setting with a visually stunning presentation and impressive blend of stealth and action makes this game a MUST BUY for Batman and action-adventure fans.WORTH IT?:FULL PRICE or a SALE, this game is worth every cent.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Batman: Arkham City is the sequel to Batman: Arkham Asylum.The game begins a while after Batman: Arkham Asylum. Arkham City is a big section of Gotham City which has been turned into a large-scale prison for its criminals, all constructed by Hugo Strange. Very early in the game Bruce Wayne is campaigning to demolish the institution when he himself is incarcerated under Strange's orders.While Strange prepares to commence ""Protocol 10"", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred, allowing him to become Batman. Now it is up to him to find out what Protocol 10 is. Along the way he fights several famous villains, among them Joker, Riddler, Penguin and Two-Face.The story is pretty well done. Many recognizable characters on both sides of the Batman mythos are along for the ride. Batman: Arkham City plays and controls much like Arkham Asylum. But one thing you will notice is that the game takes place in an open city, rather than in a single area. Arkham Asylum was by no means a small game, but in Arkham City the player is able to get the full Batman experience by gliding around the city in a much larger scale.The combat system is pretty much the same as in previous game. You punch, counter, and use gadgets and finishing moves to subdue large amounts of enemies.Besides of the main story and side quests you also have a lot of other stuff to do like solving Riddler secrets, Catwoman Missions, challenge maps and more. This game will last you a long time if you are trying to go for 100% completion.The graphics are stunning and all the characters look really good. Faces and facial expressions are brilliantly made.The soundtrack is literally Hollywood movie quality. The voice acting is incredible and everything else sounds great as well.Batman: Arkham City is a great experience for anyone who likes Batman or who wants to discover his universe. It is definitely worth to buy and to play.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Rocksteady, after reviving our hopes in superhero games with Arkham Asylum, have dreamt big: bringing the well established Dark Knight formula to open world. A task that first sounded too great even after everything the developer has given us in the first game. Fear not, they upped the ante.Our favorite detective is forced to Arkham City occupied by thugs, gangsters, super-villains and Dr. Strange's guards. Initially we only know that he is after Strange who is preparing an experiment, which he calls ""Protocol 10"". The main plot of the game isn't the strongest we have ever experienced, but diverse enough to keep our heads spinning in every half hour or so. Even if Strange isn't the typical main villain you'd expect from a game like this, the others keep the show running. Boy, and how well. Joker, Two-Face, Penguin are only the most famous ones to recognize. Even the minor villains give splendid performances that will make you feel you're in an action packed DC comic book. Only this time around you're the one who beats up the bad guys. The ending of the game will keep you scratching your head and maybe this time - and this time only - Rocksteady took on more that they could bear...The game has excellent graphical representation pushing the unreal engine to it's limits. The older engine sometimes shows it's limits with slowly loading textures and load screens in open areas. However, from artistic perspective it's breathtaking. You can read stories about the city or it's unwanted ""residents"", listen to crazy interviews taped by Strange with the greatest villains that will uncover some of their background stories and let us see what has happened before the place was opened. It's exactly this where the game comes to full circle, not just being a super enjoyable action-superhero game, but a true part of the Batman legacy. The music and voice acting are top notch. Listening to an well composed orchestral piece before hearing Mark Hamill's voice behind The Joker is true joy and no fan could ask for more in that respect.The freeflow combat introduced in Arkham Asylum returns with an array of gadgets that can be deployed in combat. The combat is so well balanced that it will be easy for everybody to pick up, but very difficult to master as Batman has plenty of moves in his pocket. You can choose to hit or counter each enemy when you are attacked, but there will always be a second, third or eighth move to pull. It's a mechanic that will never get boring even after the 428th enemy. Of course the game will challenge you eventually with more powerful enemies that can't be put down with repeated hitting of one button.After you are done with the main campaign, which takes about 10 hour to complete, there's literally a dozen thing to do in Arkham City. For one you can explore the story based side quests which are not only cleverly integrated in the game's main story but they are also highly addictive. Of course Riddler made his mark in this game too, so you can try to collect his collectibles of which there is more than 300. If you have done everything in Arkham City (takes around 20-30 hours) there is a game mode called Riddler's revenge which is essentially a task-based-clean-the-room mini-game. You are rewarded with medals based on your successes, but cleaning every room and hitting high score everywhere will take you at least that much as the main game. That adds up around 50+ hours of gameplay for 100% completion. Really the only thing worth of complain here is that when you do everything and I mean everything in Arkham City there isn't anything else to load your save game again. The streets are empty except for some thug groups always spawned in the same spots. Arkham City feels empty; a thing that can be noticed even in the heat of the first walkthrough.Rating: 94/100; Replay Value: 4/5; To Beat: 8-10 hours (main campaign), 22-25 hours (campaign with collectibles); Played on: normal.

Arkham City didn't fail and in fact succeeded in suprising me more than i thougth it would. Combat is amazing, free roam never got boring being that you tend to get that Batman feel everytime you leap from one building to another and glide your way to slam over an enemy never gets old. The story is great, intense and the campaign is almost always thrilling. Boss fights are challenging and rememberable. Map size is rather big, but nothing special. Stealth feels rather real compared to most games. A.I feels amazingly intelligent and you get that hide for your life type of feel whenever you're taking the predator approach in a room filled with armed thugs.You can spend alot of time playing this game garrunteed, side missions are fun on thier own, and Catwoman being an editon to the gameplay as a playable character really only makes the experience that much better.

												Now here is a review filled with Batman puns. Why? Because I'm just such a JokerIt's Bat and better than ever. Good story, nice gameplay, Arkham City has Gotham all. Don't listen to those crappy negative reviews, they're just a Bane in the butt, and if you're about to post one of those reviews, stop right there Mister, Freeze! I hate people who are always Wayne-ing like that. Anyway, like Victor Fries, Batman is just ice, meaning that you get to put a Dent in the faces of those who think Robin people is a good thing. You'll find yourself playing this game way, way late into the Dark Knight. In other words, after playing this game it will be hard Two-Face the real world again. Trust me, Ivy played this game so much. I can Harley believe how good this game is. If anyone is unhappy with this game, then I ask you, why so serious?Oh gosh, Batman's probably gonna PUNch me now.			"

Posted: June 5, 2016
												Back in 2011, I first played Arkham City on PS3, and I thought it was a near-perfect video game. A meticulously-detailed world, where every building, wall, and street thug tells a story, incredible characters oosing with wit and personality, and an expansion over the gameplay mechanics that made the original Arkham Asylum a classic is just the tip of the iceberg of what makes this game special. I, at the time, was convinced that Rocksteady could not have made a better game, and rewarded it a perfect score. There were no stupid bugs, glitches, or any breaks in the pacing. It was a long, meaty game that kept being at the top of its class from beginning to end.Fast forward to 2016, and here I'm revisiting it again via the GOTY Edition on PC. I thought I was overhyping the game my first go-around, since it was brand new at the time, and decided to see if it still held up as highly as I once thought of it. Thankfully, good gameplay doesn't get old, and while the graphics have since been surpassed by the excellent Arkham Knight, the artistry still stands tall here. The GOTY Edition includes a variety of goodies, like costumes, new missions, and most important of them all: Catwoman.Catwoman wasn't in my original playthrough of the game, but her inclusion in this package extends the length of the overall adventure by at least a few hours. Her adventures happen during the events of the game, and the story switches perspectives between Batman and Catwoman at certain points. The Catwoman stuff isn't essential to the main story, but it is a welcome change of pace, since she controls differently and features her own set of moves. That would be the biggest reason to get the GOTY edition over the standard one, on top of a post-story mission that is also included.tl;dr Arkham City is the best Batman game I will probably ever play, and one of the best games of the seventh generation. Even half a decade later, the writing's on the wall. This is Rocksteady's magnum opus.			"

												This is one game I will never get tired of playing. I've played this game more than 200 hours (goty and non-goty combined) and I can see myself playing it again and again in the future. It is my favorite game of all times and I'll try to tell you why it is.Let's start with the story. From the beginning to the end, it never slows down. Specially the ending is among the best I've ever seen. Though you can easily lose track of what you're doing because the game does everything in its power to distract you. There are so many things you can do apart from the story. Collecting trophies, solving riddles, beating up inmates, side missions. There are also challange maps. These are seperate from main game and they are fun as hell. In fact they're so good, I spent more time in them than the game itself.Gameplay is expertly done. There are many different gameplay elements and none of them is less awesome than the others. Fighting is amazing. It is easy to learn but hard to master. You press one button to attack and one button to counter but the more you play the game the more you understand how strategic the combat is. Game throws all kinds of enemies at you and all of them require a different tactic to beat. Inmates with shields can only be attacked from above, ones who are carrying shock sticks can only be attacked from behind, armored inmates need to be stunned before they can be hit and so forth.Another big portion of the gameplay is predator encounters. These are so much fun. There are so many different ways you can takedown your enemies, you won't even notice you can do some of them. After you take out everyone but one, the real fun starts. The last guy just starts freaking out, shooting at his own shadow and so on. You truly feel like a predator in these moments, a non-lethal predator :)Visually, the game is stunning. It looks fantastic. In my opinion, this game has the best looking Batman ever. His appearance and animations are amazing. Even in combat you rarely see animations glitching. Soundtracks are just as good. They're truly epic and they make you feel like you're Batman! Voice acting is among the best. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill steal the show as Batman and Joker.I can write about this game all day but since I keep jumping from one point to another, I'll stop here.

												The game is very atmospheric and while the city isn't that big it scores by being very detailed and having many different and unique locations. The gameplay is phenomenal, the fighting is very fluent and responsive allowing you to have the best experience. After spending countless hours on this game I can definitely say that it is fantastic and an absolutely worthy purchase.			"

												""Could anything be better than being Batman and having a whole city to explore as well as solving a mystery in an insane asylum overrun by its inmates?""  /r/pcmasterrace Group  TL:DR Batman Arkham City as one of those games that is almost perfect in every way. You don't have to like Batman to love this game. Basically the point is: BUY IT! Now here for the full review  Story  I won't go into the story much as I don't want to spoil it but what I can tell you is that its almost perfect. Way better than its predecessor and possibly the best in the series. The main premisis of it all is that you are taken into Arkham City, a prison filled with batman's famous villians such as the Joker, Two-Face and the Penguin. Since this is the goty version, you'll switch between Batman and Catwomen throughout various bits of the game. While some argue that there is the occasional plot hole, to me, its perfect.10/10. Characters As mentioned before, Batman Arkham City has many of Batmans famous villians, but also people like Alfred and Robin. Batman is still Batman, (Duh!) being a badass and pretty much wiping the floor off everyone. The game also takes a unique road to fully understanding the villians. Different parts of the game focus on the particular villian but never makes it get old. Only negative point worth mentioning is, for god sake Catwoman zip up that jacket!9/10. Gameplay In my opinion its just as good as Arkham Asylum. Beat up one guy to another but with added moves that you can unlock as you level up. Grappling from building to building makes you feel like Batman! Or it did to me anyway. Gliding around the place is also fun. One of Batman's villians, The Riddler, has added trophies and riddles for you to find and solve. Plus with the gadgets such as batarangs and freeze grenades to add a twist when fighting, all of which can be upgraded when you level up. So really the gameplay is a lot like Asylum's but slightly better.8/10  Accessebility For me it wasn't that hard to grasp into the game. The gameplay mechanics are simple enough and since the game pretty much helps you when fighting by locking on one person to another it isn't really that difficult to get to know it. You can always make it a bit more challenging by increasing the difficulty but even then you get used to that pretty much easily.10/10. Soundtrack My favourite thing in this game is the soundtrack. One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Classic Batman music as I call it. Some tracks are intense and get you ready for combat, some are calm and tranquil, all fitting the right locations. Nothing more to say really. Just beautiful music.10/10. Pros - Excellent Story- Interesting Characters- Superb Soundtrack- Never Rushed- Amazing (  but sad  ) Ending- Sometimes hilarious knock out animations. XD- High Replayability Value Cons - Camera Positioning can be awkward sometimes.- Sometimes you can be in a posistion where you have no idea what to do but look it up on the internet. Personnal Recommendation I'd say, if you haven't already, buy this game! Doesn't matter if its on sale or not, buy it! You don't have to like Batman to love this game! One of my favourite games of all time. 10/10.

												After completing the first game and making a review on it and saying how brilliant it was, Arkham City completely SOLD IT after I beat its story.Graphics: Even though the graphics have not changed that much since its predecessor, they have definitely changed for the better. The cutscenes have also improved by a great margin as well. The character's faces, even Harley Quinn's, exceptionally worked very well and they had me engaged throughout the whole experience. What I really liked was as your character goes through the story your suits that you wear show tears and scrapes on the surface and capes of your character. The characters are a strong point in this game and it really helped the story at every vantage point.Story: The story was solid; I absolutely loved the story mode they set up in this universe. It was full of exciting moments where the game made you feel on edge at certain points where you felt like you had to rush things but you really did not. Without giving anything away let's ust say that the story has a couple of twists and the several collectibles that you find throughout the large map in the game make the story rather intriguing and mesmerizing. And without giving anything away to the story, let's just say that the ending of the game hit me really hard, emotionally in fact. It was more of an impact than the previous game, let alone any Batman game that I played. Overall, the story is what sold this game and I highly recommend it for everyone.Gameplay: Good f***king GOD there is a lot to talk about in this game: You get to play as two characters as opposed to just one character; Batman and Catwoman. Catwoman may take some time getting used to, but it is fun to crawl around on ceilings and using that whip, and for whatever reason they decided to add a ""timing"" element for Catwoman when jumping on walls, and for some reason that confused me. There are now twice as many Riddler trophies to get around the environment once Catwoman becomes a characters to play as. The combat has improved dramatically; there are lot more features and abilities than the first game. There are also several types of enemies, even ones with swords that you must dodge precisely to disarm them. Most boss battles are fun and very imaginative and exciting and memorable; soem can be frustrating but most of the time you'll find yourself amazed by how many moves bosses have during each battle. I found myself reacting and screaming to all sorts of attacks, and with humorous intentions. Completing the game to 100% will set you for a good 20+ hours depending on your playstyle.Overall: One of the best Batman games to ever release by Rocksteady and I highly recommend it to those who love being a detective, who love the DC universe, who love open-world games and fiding clues and solving puzzles.Seriously, buy it right now.

												The sequel to one of the best Batman games out there, Arkham City takes everything that made Arkham Asylum great, and brings it up a notch. The freeflow combat system that made Asylum so good remains here, and it feels somewhat improved with a few new special takedowns; the same goes for the predator system, in which you can really feel like Batman, taking down enemies one by one, and seeing how they become more and more terrified. There's also a lot of new gadgets, which, besides their use in combat, also help to open new ways to navigate the game world.As for the game world: it's huge. The game is set in Arkham City, a megaprison built after the events in the Asylum that took place in the first game. The ""city"" has a few different districts, each controlled by a different villain from Batman's rogues gallery, with their own thugs and all. The environments are really well designed, both for exteriors (the city itself), and interiors.The story is pretty good as well. It begins with Batman (well, Bruce Wayne, actually) getting imprisoned in Arkham City, after he was running for mayor in opposition to the prison. Once there, he finds out that the man in charge, Professor Hugo Strange, has a plan for the prison, named Protocol 10, and Batman must figure out what that plan implies. During the main story you'll also have encounters with other villains from Batman's history, like the Joker, Two-Face, the Penguin, the Riddler, and many more. There's also plenty of side missions for you to take on, each with their own style. And, as an added bonus, you also get to play as Catwoman at several points during the main story, who's in Arkham City following her own agenda, but still has some encounters with Batman.As for music, it's very good. The soundtrack really works for the game, giving you that Batman feeling when you're beating up dozens of thugs, or the tension in a Predator room when you're spotted. The main menu music alone is amazing.As for extra content, there's tons of it: first of all, New Game+. After beating the game, you get to play it all over again from the beginning, in a more challenging mode, as enemies will be stronger and faster; however, you get to keep all your toys! Then there's Harley Quinn's Revenge, which is a story DLC that takes place after the main events of the game, and you get to play as Robin. Finally, there's Riddler's Revenge, a challenge mode in which you can play as Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing, in several combat and predator challenges.So, to conclude this review, I can say Batman: Arkham City is an amazing game, especially if you're a big Batman fan.

Batman: Arkham City - GOTY EditionDeveloper: Rocksteady StudiosPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentIntroduction==========Batman: Arkham City (sequel to Arkham Asylum), in some ways, improves on the formula that was set forth in Arkham Asylum. How can a perfect game get anymore perfect? Well...it can't. Some things were improved, while some things made the experience suffer a bit. Overall, Arkham City does what it's supposed to do: Puts you in the shoes of the Caped Crusader and tells a thrilling Batman tale via the video game medium. Let's go over it and see how it compares to Arkham Asylum.Gameplay==========A lot of things have been added and improved in this title over Arkham Asylum. You are now free to explore Arkham City to your heart's content, adding Open-World to the iconic Batman universe (to an extent). Thugs roam the streets, easy targets for Batman to pick off and earn experience, which is still used to level up and learn new abilities. There are a lot of side-quests, each mainly tying into a specific villian from Batman's case files -- Villians such as Deadshot, the Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, Killer Croc, and Mr. Freeze...just to name a few. There is much more going on behind the scenes, though. And as the Dark Knight, it's your job to find out what's going on and who is behind it all!Batman still retains a lot of his signature gadgets, along with a few additions. Combat is more or less the same, but feels a bit more balanced and fluid. With how well the combat system was implemented in Arkham Asylum, it's hard to imagine it getting any better, but they somehow pulled it off! Chaining attacks together grants Batman access to finishing moves, and those who master the system are rewarded with bonus EXP and quicker battles in general.A new feature added in Arkham City are the crime scene puzzles, which are little more than just scanning pieces of evidence at a crime scene to piece together who or what happened, which will lead you to where you need to go. This only takes places in a small handful of segments of the game, not taking long to figure out and move on. A nice small addition, but ultimately little more than an obstacle to get through as you advance the story.The Riddler is also present here, with a new set of trophies to collect, new riddles to solve, and new challenges to overcome. Solving/collecting them all is a great challenge, and is sure to keep you busy for quite some time if you decide to tackle them all. Instead of secret maps laying around like in Arkham Asylum, this time you are able to spot Riddle informants in a pack of thugs. Taking down all other thugs around him will allow you to interrogate him, revealing hidden Riddler secrets on your map. Make it a point to interrogate them all if you intend to face Riddler's challenge.Graphics==========Arkham City does very little to improve on the graphics set down in Arkham Asylum. It more or less looks the same. That's not a bad thing, though. Arkham City looks as dark and dreary as it should, hiding all sorts of secrets in it's alleys and battered buildings. If you've played Arkham Asylum, you know what to expect here. Some smaller details, such as Batman's breath showing outside in the cold, are present and serve to add a small bit of depth to the graphical presentation of this game.Sound and Music==========Just as good as Arkham Asylum, the sound effects and music in Arkham City help to set the tone of everything happening in each area. Striking thugs sounds oh so satisfying, as well as the 'knock-out' sound when finishing one off. The soundtrack is just as ominous as Arkham Asylum, which definitely helps to immerse you in the game.Another excellent thing carried over from Arkham Asylum is the use of the same voice actors! Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy reprise their roles as the Joker and Batman respectively. Again, the Joker is the star of the show, owing to Mark Hamill's stellar voice work and performance as the Joker.  Performance==========I was able to maintain a constant 59-60 FPS during gameplay at all times. No stuttering, no framedrops, no lag...the game ran flawlessly. I feel like they improved the performance quite a bit from Arkham Asylum, despite it being more open and having more going on on-screen due to the open-world elements that were added. Draw distance was fairly impressive, showing buildings far in the background as Batman grapples and glides about the city.Final Thoughts==========Arkham City ultimately improves upon Arkham Asylum in nearly every way imaginable, only suffering from feeling a bit empty at points despite being a large city. If more things were added around the city it would have felt a lot better. Still, Arkham City is another near perfect game that should be in every fan's library. Gameplay Demo==========

												A must even if you are not into the Batman franchise. Great story and combat system, combined with an amazing open world experience. Maybe the most badass Batman appearance ever. The only boring parts are with Selina (Catwoman), because it follows its own story and doesnt interfere with Batman until the very end of the game, but at least you've got something to stare at, if you know what I mean. Overall it features one of the best combat systems and it's definitely the best Batman game ever made.			"

												Batman Arkham City was my first introduction to the Arkham franchise.  Being a fan of the DC and Marvel comic book universe's I always am loving a good superhero game.  This game I would say is not a full sandbox (open world) game but pretty close.  I do recommend Arkham City over Asylum any day of the week.  If you love a game you can turn your brain off and smash buttons this is the game for you.  Alway fun to see how high of combo score you can get.  The Story in Arkham City was so much better then Asylum.  I found the story very captivating and always wanted to see what was going to happen next.  And just when you think it ends and your disappointed it still goes very good put together game. You can tell its geared more towards the teenage crowd.  The $29.99 price tag is a litte high yet since this game almost two years old and the new Batman Arkham Origns is out for $39.99.  If you see this game on sale for 50% off well worth it I played it for over 20 hours and it has a lot of extra missions as Robin which were fun.			"

												The follow up to Arkham Asylum, and like any great comic book sequel, Arkham City doesn't fail to disappoint.  Proving that more of a good thing can make that thing great.  The amazing fight system which was implemented in the first game is back, with enough Subtle improvements to make the worlds greatest detective grin.  The story line again reads like something ripped from a comic book and brought to life for me and my fellow gamers to enjoy.  Doctor Hugo Strange who mysteriously vanished years before after finding out Batman's real identity is back, and he's running Arkham City, a high tech prison designed to replace Black Gate prison as the home to Gotham's most dangerous and insane inmates.  Strange has plans to enact something known as protocol 10, and as a start to his plan he captures Bruce Wayne and warns him against trying to stop his plan.Obviously Batman will not, and can not allow this dastardly to succeed, after a thrilling escape from Custody and a run in with Penguin you're off and running on a wonderful comic adventure to stop protocol 10, stop Hugo Strange from revealing your true identity and hopefully figure out the mystery of what ties all these events together.I'd recommend this game to people who love super hero games that don't suck, people who love beat em up's and people who love being the greatest Dectective of all time in one of the greatest super hero video games ever made.   Did I mention you get to play as Catwoman...			"

												Direct sequel of Arkham Asylum, this game now introduces some sort of open-world. While some people think this is a lame choice from the developpers, I personally think it serves the game right, even though the backtracking is still well present.Otherwise, not a lot of changes; the game plays the same and it feels the same: awesome and epic. Also looks very good graphic-wise. Completely changing everything would have been a big mistake anyway, as the original gameplay is not bad at all.If you liked Batman: Arkham Asylum and want to keep playing Batman in a kinda open-world environment, this is tha game for you! Even though the gameplay elements did not change one bit, this is still an awesome game to play and finish.7.5-8/10, great game.			"

												Batman: Arkham City is the sequel to Arkham Asylum and the spiritual sequel to Escape from New York. You once again take the role of Batman: The super hero with the world's deadest parents. But this time around, if you include DLC, you also play as Robin, cooler Robin, and Halley Barrey.I don't know how to spell Haley Baree. Batman brings with him his skills and tools from his last adventure through the planet Zebes. Like Spider-Man's web swing, and his combat blanket, and his ability to move like a jumping bean while still being built like a brick♥♥♥♥♥♥house. Seriously, look at him, he makes me question my hetereosexuality.  I once had a dream where he kissed me on the lips. In Paris, France. I don't think it makes me gay and neither does my therapist. But also, this time around, you get to go through story segments as Halae Bear-e. Who has the amazing powers of making you and excellent survivalmen with your tent pitching skills. Her segments aren't that different from playing as Dead-parents man, but this time you move around with grace instead of like a tank that just drove through an orphanage. The segments end very quickly, and are few in between, but one leaves Hallee Beree restrained by poison Ivy and you're all ""Woah! Damn! It just got all steamy up in here!"" The combat is much the same as the last game, only this time you don't swing around like an incompetant moron as soon as someone has the bright idea to bring a sharp object to the fight. You can now practically waste everyone and everything that moves without much effort because, well, you're Batman. The challenge maps return, only this time to bust your balls, like my uncle during the family reunion. It is a sad story and I will go into it another time. A good number of Batman's rogues gallery shows up, Including such memorable characters as.Clown guy, and Rich bird-dwarf, and Freezy-dude, burned face man, and of course, who could forget, Immortal geezer. Should you get this game? Well, I guess you could, but right now it costs about as much as a sandwich. Would you rather have a sandwich than a batman game? I would as well.4 out of 19 smiley faces. Still waiting for that Blue Beetle game, Rock Steady.			"

												I don't like Batman.  I'm not a 9-year-old boy, and never was I, and I naively thought this would be the only target audience of such a game (because when I was a kid, it was mainly boys who seemed to read the Batman comics).  As a result, Batman and I never really crossed paths other than the odd TV show when I was a wee thing in the Ice Age era.  I also don't like combat games.  All those buttons for punching and kicking and all that nonsense.  Pffft! But back to Batman.  There was some article in my fave magazine looking back at this game and talking about stealth-play (which I love) and a fantastic open-world city.  They recommended it hugely and the screenshots LOOKED incredible!  But it was still Batman ... so I figured I'd wait for a cheapy deal just to see what it was like anyway.  Checking that no-one else in the house was looking at my screen (I mean - Batman for chrissakes...) I loaded up the game - and my badly formed preconceptions were thrown in my face!  Now the entire household knows I'm raving about a Batman game....So what makes this game so great?Firstly, the game offers complete freedom of play (you can stealth much of the game or fight your way through).  Secondly, the controls are amazingly easy for a game with so many moves - very intuitive for those not blessed with controller dexterity (me included).  Thirdly, Arkham City is a HUGE open-world dark city of seeming unlimited places to explore, and finally, like Batman or not, the colourful personalities of all the caricatures you'll meet in a Batman game are fun, crazy and brilliantly done.  I found myself replaying the starting chapter twice over just to see Penguin again!There is nothing better than swooping down on an unsuspecting enemy from skyscraper heights (in-game tutorials help you with special moves in flight).  Control and precision are absolutely perfect.  Stealth is a joy to play (and encouraged in some missions).  The combat is easy too - taught gradually with on-screen prompts for buttons to press and when to make a high-scoring move.  Best of all, this GOTY edition features Catwoman with some extra missions - and her playstyle is entirely different but equally engaging.The dark city has depth and atmosphere, and feels like the crime-ridden snake's pit that it is.  It's all brilliantly detailed.  There are collectibles too, though some are pretty tough to beat.  They offer a good challenge so they aren't mundane busiwork unlike some franchises (Assassin's Creed to name one example).  There is a great upgrade system too - though a word of warning: your upgrade points are for Batman AND Catwoman separately.  By the time I reached the end of the main Batman game, I had a Batman armed to the teeth, but a neglected Catwoman who had little more than black leotard and tights(!) - so remember to share the points around a bit.In summary...A great story-led plot, fabulous characters and really polished gameplay puts this game at the top of my best-games-ever tree.  I really recommend it, even if you too find yourself grimacing and NOT ever having been a 9-year-old boy!  Don't make the mistake I did and look past this game if you enjoy open-world games where you choose how to play.			"

												This game received critical acclaim, particularly for its narrative, character and world designs, soundtrack, and Batman's combat and navigation abilities. It was tied for the highest-rated video game of 2011 according to review aggregator Metacritic, and was the recipient of several awards including: Game of the Year, Best Action Game, Best Action Adventure Game, Best Adventure Game, and Best Original Score from various media outlets, and it is considered one of the best games ever made.They ain't so wrong on this, to be honest, I was thinking in buying or not this game, because I have never played any of the others Arkham games. So I have a friend that plays Batman games and I thought he could help me out by telling me if I should buy it or not. He told me that I can play perfectly this game without playing the others, and besides that, this one is the best from the Arkham series. Maybe he is right, because I loved it! Such a story, so epic, such a gameplay, soundtrack, etc. Even if you don't like Batman movies/comics, you SHOULD play this game. No regrets in the purchase.Is an open-world action-adventure game that incorporates tactics from stealth games. It is presented from the third-person perspective, showing the playable character on screen and allowing the camera to be freely rotated around it. The game is set within Arkham City, which is open to the player from the beginning of the game, allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries. The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to sneak up on enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving downwards and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to out-of-reach ledges. While you're playing and reaching ""points"", you can grow up your skills and get improvements! Enough. Great game. "

												Batman: Arkham City is the high point of the Arkham franchise. The characters, the atmosphere, the story, the combat, the music, the visuals – all come together in a way that few other games achieve. Marred by some performance issues on PC (turning off DX11 features fixes most of the issues). If Batman has a place in your fandom, Arkham City has a place in your game library.Total size on my hard-drive (GOTY): 19GB+ All of Gotham’s criminals have been thrown into an old, walled-off section of the city. A great excuse to bring the entire rogue’s gallery together. Exactly who brought this about and how? There’s your story. Simple but effective. (Like Arkham Asylum, the story is the creation of Paul Dini, who was a major part of the classic ‘90s TV show, Batman: The Animated Series.)+ Batman, Robin, Catwoman, Hugo Strange, Penguin, Two-Face, Joker – there are many characters packed into Arkham City, all of them superbly voice-acted and visually realized. In addition to Kevin Conroy (as Batman) and Mark Hamill (as the Joker), Grey DeLisle brings perfection to Catwoman.+ Great world design. Though not as large as Arkham Origins or the follow-up Arkham Knight, Arkham City is full of rooftops and shadowy corners that bear exploring. A number of buildings can be entered, bringing another dimension to the exploration (entering buildings is not seamless though - there is a loading screen).+ The visuals look fantastic, if occasionally low-res. Light-shafts and shadows are particularly well-rendered, which play to Arkham City’s strengths. Lip-synch occasionally has issues.+ Ambient sounds of crunching snow, wind and waves are enhanced by superb mood music and deep shadows everywhere. Finding the best brightness setting for your eyes can be tricky, but there’s no denying the atmosphere.+ Soundtrack is superb. In contrast to Arkham Asylum’s more moody music, Arkham City immediately goes for an unabashed heroic feel. While the big heroic tracks are most obvious, the quieter tracks wonderfully fill the poignant silences.+ The best combat of any of the Arkham games. Easy to understand, difficult to master.+ Catwoman is playable in the open world. Awesome.+ A nice selection of challenge maps that add playable Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing, each with their own combat styles and moves.+ Harley Quinn’s Revenge DLC is included, and is a good two hours of supplemental gameplay material that happens post-campaign.+ The GOTY edition includes everything – all DLC, skin packs, and challenge map packs.+/- The Catwoman DLC has been folded into the main story campaign. Can create some jarring moments when Batman is at a crucial plot point, and the cut-scene switches the story to Catwoman.- Performance on the PC is spotty, even now. Try cranking all the settings up, and the benchmark will run without issue, but the game will be plagued by stutter, both in the pre-rendered cutscenes (a video streaming issue) and in-game as the game-world loads in. I installed Arkham City to my SSD drive, I have a Haswell Core i5, 16GB of ram and an RX 470. My system is not the issue. Search the forums and you’ll find many complaints about cut-scene stutter and generally poor stream-in performance. Turn off DX11 graphical features and most of the problems disappear. Still have some issues with initial load-in stutter, but otherwise the issues were resolved. Maybe you won’t have issues if you’re on Nvidia instead of Radeon, but don’t be surprised if you do.- Frame-rate is capped at 62 by default. Altering a config file reveals the real fps limit to be around 200.Without the technical concerns, Arkham City wouldn’t just be a near-perfect Batman game, but one of the best games ever made. Still, the technical concerns are assuaged by the fact that Arkham City frequently discounts to $5 (or less!) during sales, where it offers incredible value. Heartily recommended.			"

												Do you like superheroes? Buy this game.Do you like Batman in particular? Buy this game even more.Do you have no interest in both Batman and/or superheroes? Buy it on sale.Pros:- Some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a videogame (almost the complete voice cast from the animated series)- Intriguing story with a truly epic final act- Interesting and believable characters- Top of the notch gameplay- Immensely detailed and immersive world and level design (the 'Wonder City' part!)- Lots of extra modes and side missions to do after you beat the main story- Some of the best boss fights you've ever played- Fun enough for multiple playthroughs - Cameos and references from all over the DC universeCons:- Can sometimes be confusing for people who are not already familiar with the Batman lore- Some characters don't get enough screen time or feel left out9/10 Still the best superhero game out there			"

												Batman: Arkham City is my favorite game of all time. While many game today are criticized for lack of innovation, this game does the exact opposite and greatly adds from it's predecessor arkham asylum. All areas of gameplay include so much more. Combat now has multi-counters, quick gadgets are now more frequent, new takedowns and animations. More gadgets in general like the freeze grenade, remote electical charge, and the distruptor. It features an awesome story set in a walled off section of Gotham turned super-prison, where batman must uncover a sinister plot known as protocol 10. In the game you run into batman's most infamous adversaries like Joker, Mr. freeze, and Penguin through both the main story and side-missions. Pros:+All forms of gameplay: combat, stealth, and traversal+incredibly detailed, filled with easter eggs for batfans+side-missions+thrilling story+huge replay value, tons of riddler trophies, challenges, missions etc.Cons:-nothing of note, a few bugs here and there, but this is a solid port10/10, extremely recommended			"

												I said so much in my review of Arkham Asylum because I thought it was the best Batman game ever, I was wrong. Arkham City IS the best batman game there ever was, infact it's the best Batman story ever told and playing the game makes you feel like you are Batman not just in a movie, but in real life. It's grim, real, immersively addictive so much to the point you WILL have withdrawal symptoms when you stop playing. I NEVER expected a game to make me feel the way Arkham City made me feel, having played many AAA games, this one takes the place for the Best game there ever can exist.			"

												Alright. Don't do back-to-back gaming in a franchise but Arkham Asylum was too good to not jump straight into Arkham City. In short, great game with certain bad decisions. I am glad I didn't get burnt out by so much Batman lately. If I had Origins and Knight, I'd probably plow right through those as well.The story picks up shortly after the events of Asylum but with a bigger scope and more variety. If Asylum was an episode of a Batman cartoon, City feels like a season worth of adventures. I thoroughly enjoyed the many villains and their subplots. Gameplay-wise City adds a lot of new moves, gadgets and tactics to the playing field and it is mostly great. Some moves can be iffy to pull of. Perpetually gliding above to city is very satisfying. Just like in Asylum several buildings are harboring big levels and they were mostly well done. They are bigger and more complex now which coupled with the open-world feels like too much at the beginning but after a couple hours you'll feel very cozy and it becomes much ""smaller"" than at first sight. At certain parts of the story you take control over Catwoman. These were not bad. She lacks many of the gagdets and the gliding of Batman but I enjoyed the short bursts of change. The expanded universe of Batman available here is really awesome. Fascinating stuff like Wonder City alongside more traditional mob hangouts like the museum. The world and lore carried a great portion of the enjoyment for me.On the negative side they overdid it with Riddler Trophies. Plainly, there are too many. I did collect every single one of them, for Batman and Catwoman. None was satisfying to obtain. Every 10m there is a trophy. Most are easy to get, some take a little - very little - effort. Asylum did a better job. Not too many as to make collecting them a chore and tying the world-building in a fun way to them. It's the small changes which make it worse in City. No longer are there Cassette Tapes to collect, which automatically play. They were about a specific character and would be located around the same level in Asylum and as you were exploring the level further, you were steadily learning more about that character. Now, you collect certain amounts of trophies and once you open up your journal, you get a message on which cassettes unlocked. Then you go to the character tab, open one character and choose the cassette to play. A big step back. At the very end, after having collected all Trophies (plus Riddles and breakable objects), I went to read the Journal entries. Makes me think they themselves didn't realize why their own Journal system worked so well in Asylum, now that they went and made it worse. Then there's the little things like the charming drawings from the comics which were replaced with pictures of game models in City.One things which is absolutely badly done is tying Riddler's questline to the amount of Riddler Challenges obtained. After every 80 Challenges you proceed one step there. In total you need 400 Challenges to complete the quest, which I did. I don't like meaningless collectathon but I do play for stories, so I soldiered through. What a bad decision to set these requirements for Riddler's story.A short word to the Harley Quinn DLC. Waste of time. Lacks good design of the main campaign. Felt rushed and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's this kind of DLC which makes me only think about the wasted time and energy of the developers.Overall the game is a worthy successor to Arkham Asylum with a better and bigger story, better and more bosses, a deeper atmosphere and even better gameplay.Looking forward to getting my hands on Origins and Knight in the future.

												Another great game of the Batman Arkham series. Arkham City is such a big improvement over Batman: Arkham Asylum. If you played that one then you can expect all that in this one plus a few major things. This time the game is open world, if you wish to  call it that way, what I mean is that you can move as you please through Arkham City and eventually you'll hear inmates conversations or come across a secondary quest or ""random"" event. Every now and then once I'd pick one of the inmates conversations I'd just get to a safe spot and listen them talk, it might look like ordinary talk but I found that it sometimes contain some story elements and some funny stuff, I really like that they included some neat dialogue this way. Combat wise the game excells just like the previous one, it's satisfying and it feels great, they've added abunch of new gear and new perks to unlock as you ""level up"" which can turn the tide of the battle every now and then. The story is as good as the first one and it takes place after the events of Arkham Asylum as you uncover a ""conspiracy"", per say. I also wouldn't be lying if I said that this series has probably one of the best character designs I ever witnessed in a video game so if you're into that and really care about each individual character you'll certainly love this one. One thing I actually don't really like and couldn't care less are the riddles, I just don't find it appealing to go around the city looking for all the puzzles and solving, still,    I'm sure that some people are really into that. The last two things I'd like to say about Batman: Arkham City is that the soundtrack is bloody amazing, I love that as soon as you start a fight another track pops in to make it feel more intense, kinda. Last thing is the graphics, they're bloody gorgeous. Besides that I don't think I have anything else to say about Arkham City, if you loved Arkham Asylum you'll love this one and if you didn't enjoyed Arkham Asylum you might still wanna give this one a try because it's so much better in every possible way. Ladies and Gents, do play it! (THANK YOU CHIPPIES!)Oh also you play as Catwoman...			"

												Batman: Arkham City is an awesome Batman game, this is the sequel to Batman: Arkham Asylum and it is also the second Batman game in the Batman: Arkham series. This game takes everything that made Batman: Arkham Asylum great, and makes them even better! Personally, Batman: Arkham City is a great improvement over Batman: Arkham Asylum, which is already a good game in its own right.Similar to Batman: Arkham Asylum, this game features a great Batman story (the opening cutscenes were hella intense!), good Batman gameplay, beautiful Batman graphics, amazing Batman cutscenes, remarkable Batman combat, phenomenal Batman stealth, spectacular Batman gadgets, insane Batman villains and superb voice acting. From the number of times Batman were unnecessarily mentioned in the paragraph above, you can probably tell this game is definitely recommended for you if you are a fan of Batman! If you enjoyed Batman: Arkham Asylum, you will most likely like this game too! This game is also suitable for people that likes adventure/action game in general or anyone that would like to get to know the legend that is Batman better.Be the World's Greatest Detective. Be the Dark Knight. Be the Batman!			"

												The second game of the series which delivered something much more than just an open world Batman game. It immereses you with its shady and illusive atmosphere in combination with great characters from the DC universe.Arkham City is set in the aftermath of the events which occured in Arkham Asylum. Events that caused everyone to question the safety of Gotham in the eyes of criminal society. The game begins with Bruce Wayne  being captured by Hugo Strange and sent to his facility, the super prison of Gotham, of which he has full control over and plans to initiate a secret plan called ""Protocol 10"". Batman (Bruce Wayne) seeks to find out what Protocol 10 is whilst bumping into familiar faces from the DC universe.The main story line is solid, coupled with great side-missions that will keep you occupied. The fighting style is transfered from Arkham Asylum and improved upon whilst the open world is even bigger which promises a lot more content and playability. The characters are beyond amazing, they are sinister, funny, sarcastic and interesting. If you're a fan of the Joker, Penguin and Ra's al Ghul then you won't be dissapointed.This game is an overall improvement of the series; If you've already played the first one and thinking about getting this one, I urge you to hurry up and pick up this amazing open-world fighting game; You won't be dissapointed.

												I dare to say it is one of the most underrated games ever.Not because of the ratings from game mags or else.Just because it wasn't in the top ten of the game charts.Where it rightfully should have been.To me , this clearly is a system seller.Together with Arkham Asylum . It's such a huge world .. there is so much to explore and collect ..There's just no end to it . You grapple and glide flawless through Gotham , beat the hell out of the Joker goons or sneak up behind them and kill them silently ..Anyway you like it ..I can't stress enough how much i love this game . Now Graphics 9/10 Even as I don't have the new GTX card it still runs flawless ..That's how you can tell if it's programmed by experts .Sound 8/10 Fitting , Never clouds the experience. But not really epic or something . Gameplay 9/10VEEERRY entertaining i'd say i played around 40 hours and still haven't got all of the achievements (Riddlery Trophys, Solve Crimes ,and so on )And with the GOTY you can also play the Add On with Robin/ Nightwing . And you can play as catwoman .And you don't need Windows Live anymore ! All you need is STEAM !! Yay			"

												Almost as awesome as Arkham Asylum, but this time I wasn't so interested by story and plot, it's not so exiting as previous game. In spite of that game offers many new things, like open map. One of the best things you could do was playing as catwoman or robin and use much more weapons and gadgets. There is an option of some side quests which I consider as much more attracting than main story. You will meet many super villains lie mr. Freeze, Riddler in person, Hatter and many others. Riddle becomes indeed very great threat and you will need find and solve his riddles, which are much more difficult than in Arkham Asylum, to rescue his hostages. You have an option to play Zsaz's little booth game, save Nora Fries or meet mysterious watcher who keeps watching batman, there are many possibilities what to do after main line is done. The most interesting thing I consider meeting Ras al Ghul himself. Again I hated fighting system it's not for PC players in my opinion. This game totally worth playing.8/10			"

What I Like- The game adds on to Arkham Asylum. - Bonuses: Plenty of interesting bonuses, that require logic, and identifying them- Side Missions: Stories that involve other characters as well- Gadgets: Plenty of gadgets, with numerous uses and the ability to quily deploy them while in combat- Audio: Enjoyable soundtracks to match the mood of the respective scene- Choose Characters: The ability to play different characters, such asCatwoman & Nightwing. - New Game Plus: A mode which makes things much more realistic (and harder), where you start off withall gadgets, and previous upgrades, however - no tips and pointers - Combat: The hand-to-hand and melee system is one that's simple to use, but tough to master - a joy to use, and one that can be frustrating - but ultimately, rewarding. - Villans / Adverseries: A story rich cast, with boss fights, side missions and appearances, that include:The Joker, Harley Quinn, Bane, Dr. Hugo Strange, Rā’s al Ghūl, Talia al Ghūl, Mr. Freeze, The Penguin, Two-Face, The Riddler, Victor Zsasz, Clayface, Poison Ivy, Solomon Grundy, Deadshot and more :)- A number of different enemies, each of whom require a slightly different playing style.- The GOTY (Game of the Year) Edition includes all previously released DLCWhat could be different?- The save game mechanism is a bit frustrating at times - It saves at main events or when you enter a building. Saves are not automatically created after fighting smaller gangs, thus ""dying"" may lead to going back a bit.  I enjoyed the Tomb Raider (2013) system, where the game would remember the bonuses you had obtained as well as the enemies defeated, when going back to the last respective checkpoint.			"

												Plot: A section of Gotham has been fenced off to hold the criminals of Arkham Asylum due to The Joker's mayhem back in Batman: Arkham Asylum. Play as Batman to stop a mysterious plan called Protocol 10, and eventually stopping all major villains from the rouge list of the Batman. Batman gets infected with The Joker's blood, which is poisonous and if he doesn't retrieve a cure within 24 hours, The Joker and The Batman will die and Gotham will belong to crime and violence.Pros:-Amazing, strong story-Many mechanics have been improved since Arkham Asylum-Excellent voice acting-Plot is amazing, lots of twists that really engage the player-DLC characters (Robin, Nightwing, and Catwoman) are all great additions-Challenge maps are back, now with campaigns for each DLC character and Batman-Lots of things to do after beating the game (NG+, Riddler challenges, side missions)-Free roam is amazing and never gets tiresome-Lots of easter eggs that are fun to find-Excellent DLC skins-Visuals are pleasing to the eyeCons:-You have to exit the game everytime you want to switch skinsOverall: 10/10			"

												Still my favorite of the Arkham series yers later. Awesome story, non-tedious side missions, and huge replay value. The Riddler's revenge challenges could be a game all of their own. Highly reccomended.			"

												One of the greatest combinations of gameplay, narrative, and immersion ever featured in a game.  Compared to Asylum:      Arkham City not only lives up to the expectations of its predecessor, but easily surpasses them, featuring a wider array of gadgets, a wider cast of brilliantly voiced characters, and more to do in general.  Combat is improved, and doesn't feel quite so restricted, and each gadget has a wider array of applications, making all of them useful.  Detective vision in city limits what else you can see, unlike asylum's simple blue filter, so while each is equally useful to see what the bat sees, you are encouraged to flip detective vision on and off, as needed.  This change allows you to see much more of the extremely well detailed world of the arkham games, and goes a long way for immersion. Graphics are a fair step up from other games of its time, and even now (2016 when this review was written), they have aged very well.  The gameplay is timeless, and I can guarantee you'll spend more than a little time avoiding the mission just to grapple and glide your way around the city.  The combat of the arkham series is simple, and is probably familiar to a lot of you, punch/counter/evade.  However, Arkham easily does it best, encorporating gadgets and combos to make you really feel like you're the Bat.  Also helping in immersion is the absolutely phenomenal voice acting, featuring Mark Hamill's immortal joker, Nolan North's beautifully twisted Penguin, and the multi-talented Troy Baker as Two-Face, in addition to a few other Gotham inhabitants.  Under the Bat's cowl is Kevin Conroy, a veteran in voicing the bat, who provides a great counter to the off-the-wall performances of the rest of the cast.  Most games with excellent voice acting feature their talents as a side note to the rest of the game, but City, in particular, puts its characters front and center, and every line feels as real as it could be.  Overall:    This game will hold its place as a debated top-ten game of all time, and is firmly in the top three for me.  The story plays out as well as any comic line, up there with Death in/of the Family and the Killing joke in memorability , and every fight, particularly the predator encounters, is its own experience.  If you're new to the Arkham games, this is a great place to start, even though it's a sequel, (story doesn't hold too many spoilers from asylum, and you don't need anything more to understand this game's line.) and get sucked into the rest of the games.  This is a game everyone should experience.			"

Batman: Arkham City – Game of the Year Edition is a third-person beat’em up w/stealth. With the violence of Gotham’s “Supervillains” more uncontrollable than ever, the new head of Arkham Azylum, Dr. Hugo Strange, has an entire section of Old Gotham closed off to lock criminals away and have them keep their violence to themselves. Hugo Strange confronts Bruce Wayne about being Batman, threatening to expose his secret if he digs too deep into the true goals behind Arkham City.Pros: The already solid mechanics of Batman: Arkham Azylum are enhanced, allowing better control over gliding and using momentum to take off or maintain flight over a longer distance. Combat Mechanics also remain the same, although additional combo and special moves are available, as well as a greater arsenal of WayneTech gadgets or other tools you get or collect through the game. There is a much broader cast of characters, including a few returning ones from the previous game, some serving as fan service, others having a larger implications as sort of side quests. The Catwoman DLC happens in parallel to the main story, giving a greater diversity to the gameplay, while the Harley Quinn’s Revenge featuring Tim Drake’s Robin is a nice followup to how Batman is affected by the event of the game. There are many achievements and collector’s items to have those interested look into every nook and corner, while additional difficulty levels are available to encourage replaying through the game. Graphics are the best they’ve been prior to Batman: Arkham Knight.Cons: The combat can become a repetitive button mashing fest unless you really bother to explore the various attack/item combos. The map, although bigger than its predecessor's, is still a restrictive sandbox by today’s standards (perhaps as big as, say, the smallest city from the first Assassin’s Creed game). There is no day cycle: Although all the events are happening on the same night, there really isn’t any urgency and you can spend dozens of hours exploring every corner of the map.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!The game is fun, Batman feels like a badass, the Arkham continuity remains the perfect adaptation halfway between the visions of Christopher Nolan movies, The Animated Series and the comic books. Unless Batman isn’t your thing at all, in which case you wouldn’t consider this game to begin with, there really isn’t any reason not to get Batman: Arkham City – Game of the Year Edition.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												A great sequel to the critically acclaimed Arkham Asylum, experience open world gameplay with Batman's unique gadets and fight moves. There have been multiple improvements from the first game and a nice number of side missions to accompany that. Not to mention the challenge mode that lets you test the arena with Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing who have their unique fight moves and gadgets as well as the Harley Quinn's Revenge expansion pack that lets you explore the events that take place weeks after the game's ending.Overall this is a must buy for all those Batman fans out there. I'm sure that you won't be disappointed!			"

												This game is what every gamer needs and a batman fan deserves. It's what you could call: near perfect. The story, the gameplay and the open world makes it the Ultimate Dark Knight experience. Currently the best Arkham game to date, you'll get a great engaging story(11 hour campaign) with cool sidequests included, challanges to test your combat and predator skills, top line voice acting, a thrilling soundtrack and the visuals won't get old. The combat is strong, smart and like everything else in the game, very rewarding. You'll want to play it at least twice(the new game plus is a new experience) and the challanges will keep you playing. My score for this game is a 9.8.			"

												Batman Arkham City was the much anticipated and much beloved sequel to Batman Arkham Asylum. Taking place in a walled off section of Gotham called ""Arkham City"", Batman must defeat several iconic villains and solve a crisis yadda yadda yadda it's the same premise as the previous game.Something Arkham City does that really is different than Asylum was it features alternate playable characters. You can play as Catwoman during the main campaign, and Robin/Nightwing during the challenge maps. The alternate side content in Arkham City is really what makes the game stand out to me compared to Asylum. There's a lot of side missions, owing to the titular city the player gets to explore. Because of this the game is much less linear than Asylum was. The world of Arkham City is just breathtaking to behold and graphically it is an extremely impressive game.However where the game really falls flat for me is in the storytelling, characters and general pacing of the game. The returning voice actors all come across as much more disinterested this time around, especially Kevin Conroy. The storyline itself in-part rehashes the premise of Asylum and I felt wasn't that interesting. And the mission pacing was very weak, often I remembered getting stuck in numerous places because of how vague your objectives were at times. Where Arkham City excels is in it's presentation, but it's a much less polished game than Asylum. I would say it is a game worth experiencing and I'd still recommend playing it. But ultimately I spent a lot more time in the challenge maps and doing sidequests and less time trying to actually complete the game.			"

												Batman Arkham City is not necessarily better than Rocksteady's first Batman game, Arkham Asylum. It trades the tightly designed Metroidvania environments of the first game for a more open world and while that's certainly impressive it also manages to lose a bit of direction and focus. And because you're free to go anywhere you'd like you'll have to use your compass more than ever if you want fo find your way through the many streets and buildings. You have to move across the city both vertically and horizontally and it's not always clear where you have to go exactly. I frequently lost my way.And I understand the city is designed to make it more immersive, to make you feel more like Batman, instead of being caged on an island like the previous game. But if you do this then you better do it well. The city feels empty and there are hardly any civilians to be found out there. Yes, there are gangs and yes, it's night time but, come on, surely there must be people out there. The game also throws too many things at you too soon, so I became overwhelmed in my first couple of hours of playing it. After a while you'll know what to do and what not, but I can imagine that casual gamers might not enjoy that that much.Didn't I enjoy Arkham City you'll probably wonder. Well, I did, but as I said it lacks certain direction and it throws too many things at you without the right amount of build up and explanation. But once you know exactly what to do it's a great game. There's plenty to do and finding every clue and collectible will take you tens of hours.The fight with Mr. Freeze is also one of the best boss fights I've ever witnessed and played. Clever and unique. Well done !Arkham City is still one of the best Batman games around, but if I had to make a selection Arkham Asylum would be my first choice.[Rating: 90/100]			"

												Did you remember...Arkham Asylum? Well, Arkham City is the same, BUT BETTER OMG!1!!11Paul Dini is not alone now due to the colaboration with Sefton Hill (Rocksteady Founder) and Paul Crocker (one of the biggest comic Freaks that i´ve ever seen IRL), and this means that MY BODY IS READY. The main storyline, the sidequest, the environments, characters, npcs, even the simple details of the scenery are so good that its annoying, you have a lot of information to assimilate. For instance, during a boss fight, the stage has it´s own references for him, the weapons, the mechanics, dialogues, everything...thats amazing nowadays, because there are a few studios that want to make GOOD GAMES instead of Moneymakers.  And it doesn´t dissapoint in the dubbing neither. Kevin Conroy will give his voice to Batman again, same as Mark Hamill with Joker, Arleen was replaced by Tara Strong a good change IMO, Nolan North as Penguin and the Kid Lover Solomon Grundy voiced by Tatasciore.Lets move to the storyline. Bruce Wayne is incarcerated in Arkham City, a new massive prison located over the slums of Gotham City, founding out that there is a protocol named ""Protocol 10"" directed by Hugo Strange. And obviously you, AS BATMAN, must uncover what it is. During the main plot you´ll face different villains that are now settled in Arkham City.As i said above, the systems and patterns used with Arkham Asylum are here in City, but improved. For instance, the freeflow combat has been improved now you are able to counter more than one enemy simultaneously, create bigger combos, use aerial attacks or catch hurled items from the scenery. Also you can use almost every gadget during the combat in order to disable armored foes or set traps around you. The ""Detective Vision"" has been nerfed, which is a good new, now the visual effect obscure the game and doesnt highlight everything all the time.Besides, now with a bigger city the predator-hunter perspective takes a great advantage, now you can choose where, how and who. Let me explain this with a normal encounter, enemies are around a central square, armed-to-the-teeth so:-With the design of the city you can choose WHERE are you going to be, a rooftop, a beam, behind any object, etc...you can be literally everywhere.-The amount of gadgets that you are able to use during fights has increased, choose how are you going to achieve your goal.-The enemies now have different behaviours so be mindful of your target, choose wisely who should be knocked down/disarmed first.Moreover the IA is now somehow better. Enemies now are armed with a wide variety of weapons and armored with different levels of armors. Some should be disarmed in order to neutralize them, others should be stunned, etc... their patterns of actuation were enhanced too. They made squads if they feel danger or if some of them are nervous, pick up weapons from boxes, hurl items to the character, get weapons from the ground asap, etc...The skills have been mended too. Each category contains up to 15 unique upgrades according to your own combat preferences. Less percents and more useful skills to use during the fights. The worst part is that a lot of predator or hunter skills are already unlocked, but thats just my opinion.Furthermore the movements for Batman were expanded, in fact they add new movement and though about new ones, but the dev. team only took the ones who felt authentic with Batman.Finally Arkham City offers the same end-game content, trophies, riddles, combat challenges, etc... but all these aspects have been enhanced.If you dont have this game yet, buy it, cheap, funny and full of content.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recordáis...Arkham Asylum? Bueno, Arkham City es lo mismo, PERO MEJOR OMG!1!!!1!!1!Paul Dini ya no está solo, debido a la colaboración con Sefton Hill (fundador de Rocksteady) y Paul Crocker (uno de los mayores fridigo expertos en cómics que he visto IRL) por lo que significa...que va a ser la OSTIA.La trama, las secundarias, los entornos, npcs, personajes, incluso los simples detalles de la escenografía son tan buenos que es molesto. Tienes toneladas de información que han dejado los guionistas en estos lugares para que la asimiles. Por ejemplo durante una pelea con un boos, la fase tienen diferentes referencias hacia él, desde las armas hasta el propio fondo de la pelea, sus mecánicas, diálogos, etc... es un gran trabajo, y es lo que diferencia a un buen juego. Ni siquiera decepciona en el doblaje, y eso que el primero era DIFÍCIL de superar. Kevin Conroy va a volver a ponerle voz a nuestro Batman, al igual que Mark Hamill con Joker. Arleen fue reemplazada por Tara Strong, un buen cambio de voz en mi opinión, Nolan North será el Pingüino y el Amante de los Niños Solomon Grundy tomará su voz de Fred Tatasciore.La historia principal es simple, como la primera entrega. Bruce es encarcelado en Arkham City, una nueva prisión masiva que fue establecida sobre los arrabales de Gotham, encontrando que hay un protocolo en marcha (llamado Protocol 10) y dirigido por Hugo Strange. Y obviamente, tú, COMO BATMAN, vas a ir a descubrir de que va la cosa. Durante la trama principal te encontrarás diferentes villanos que se encuentran en Arkham city.Como dije algo más arriba, los sistemas usados  y los patrones siguen presentes en City pero han sido mejorados para ofrecer una mejor experiencia jugable.Por ejemplo, el Freeflow ha sido retocado permitiendo contraatacar a más de un enemigo de forma simultánea, crear mayores combos, usar ataques aéreos o tomar objetos lanzados del escenario. Además la cantidad de utensilios que puedes usar ha aumentado significativamente, ampliando las posibilidades de combate. La visión de detective ha sido nerfeada, y esto es una buena implementación, ya que en el primer Batman esta herramienta tan básica hacía superar el juego en cero coma. Además, al tener una mayor ciudad y mejoras en los sistemas de combate y aparatos se puede decir que, donde y como quieres combatir. Una situación simple, enemigos armados hasta los dientes en una plaza:-Con este nuevo diseño puedes elegir DONDE estarás, techos, vigas, gárgolas, etc... literalmente puedes posicionarte donde y como quieras.-La cantidad de utensilios a utilizar ha aumentado, lo que te permite elaborar más tácticas para afrontar un desafío.-Los enemigos ahora tienen diferentes comportamientos, así que se consciente de tu objetivo, a quien vas a desarmar/knockear y por que.Para más inri la IA ha sido corregida. Los enemigos están mejor armados, si no lo están recurrirán al escenario para enmendarlo, además de contar con una amplia gama de armas y armaduras. Sus patrones de actuación se han visto mejorados también. Harán cuadrillas si se sienten amenazados o si están nerviosos y no quieren ir solos.Las habilidades están mejor desarrolladas. Cada categoría tiene hasta 15 habilidades únicas dependiendo de tu preferencias en el combate. Menos porcentajes y más habilidades para usar. Aunque por criticar algo diría que las depredador y cazador vienen en su mayoría desbloqueadas.Lo que es más, los movimientos de Batman han aumentado y se han corregido así que no más Ortopedias Wayne. Añadieron más movimientos y mejoraron los antiguos, haciendo que quedasen naturales y fidedignos a Batman.Como colofón, Arkham City tiene un mayor contenido tras el juego que su anterior entrega además de mayores retos de combates y una historia acorde a Riddler.Si aún no tenéis este juego, compradlo, barato y divertido.

												With abominations of GFWL and Secu-ROM finally sent to hell where they belong this master-piece has no flaws.Well, almost no flaws. There are still some questionable optimisation issues, owners of newer configurations won't notice them, but still it drags a bit on max DX11 settings on machines on which it shouldn't. Also, in challenge modes, sometimes it happens that your character grabs some invisible wall if he jumps too high from the vantage point, or too close to some wall (grabbing mostly air), ruinning your escape plan offten ending in your death. Or opponents having unestablished attacks, even if you clearly see that someone is rushing to punch you he stops suddenly breaking your combo (which shouldn't concern you too much if you don't chase scores).But that's pretty much everything bad I can say about this game, really. Everything else is pure gold. Its unbelievable that it took only 2 years after first game for Rocksteady to develop the game which is in every way vastly superior to its already phenomenal predeccessor.  Incredible amount of love is invested in every detail: characters, story, gameplay, superior voice acting, writing, story-driven and optional missions, challenges,... Theres so much to do here. When you finish with story campaign you can throw yourself into challenge maps with one of the 4 characters (Batman, Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing), with their own gadgets, moves, and objectives on every map. Catwoman is satisfying to controll in the fight maps, but in predator not so good because she is lacking gadgets and moves, but you shouldn't have much problems with other characters in that manner.This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played, and a great fan service. The game which Dark Knight deserves.			"

Warning: this is a long review from a hardcore fan of the series, get ready to read for a while! Short version is below the long one!!!Long version: Arkham series is one of mine most favorite video games series I've played. Back in 2009 I got addicted to Arkham Asylum and 6 years later I'm still in love with the series. So let's begin.Introduction:Batman: Arkham City is a 2011 action-adventure video game developed by Rocksteady Studios and released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to the 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum and the second installment in the Batman: Arkham series. It was released worldwide for consoles, beginning in North America on October 18, 2011, with a Microsoft Windows version following on November 22.Plot The events of Arkham City are set one year after Batman: Arkham Asylum. Quincy Sharp, the asylum's erstwhile director, has taken sole credit for halting the Joker's armed siege, using this distinction to become mayor of Gotham City. Declaring both the asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary no longer suitable to contain the city's detainees, Sharp's administration orders both facilities closed and he purchases Gotham's most notorious slums, converting them into an immense prison enclosure known as Arkham City. This facility is subsequently placed in the care of psychiatrist Hugo Strange—who is secretly manipulating Sharp—and monitored by a rogue private military firm, TYGER Security. Strange permits the inmates to do as they please, so long as they do not attempt to escape. A wary Batman maintains his own vigil over the new project, concerned that the chaotic situation there will get out of hand. Meanwhile, the Joker is suffering from a potentially fatal disease caused by his previous consumption of the Titan formula, an unstable steroid serum which turns men into maddened monsters.At a press conference held by Bruce Wayne to declare his opposition to Arkham City, TYGER mercenaries arrest and imprison him in Arkham City. Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence ""Protocol 10"", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10.There, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease.Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin. Will Batman cure himself? Will he find out what is Protocol 10? Play this game to find out more!GameplayBatman: Arkham City is an open-world action-adventure game that incorporates tactics from stealth games. It is presented from the third-person perspective, showing the playable character on screen and allowing the camera to be freely rotated around it. The game is set within Arkham City, which is open to the player from the beginning of the game, allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries.The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to sneak up on enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving downward and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to out-of-reach ledges. As Batman, the player is able to use ""Detective Vision"", a visual mode that highlights elements of interest on-screen, such as character status, collectables, and clues; the mode is also used to perform forensic activities such as tracking the source of a sniper rifle round. The player has access to an in-game criminal database which includes forensic puzzles, as well as a network for hacking communication frequencies.Using an improved version of the Freeflow combat system from Arkham Asylum, the player can now counter multiple blows simultaneously, catch hurled projectiles, attack aerially, and administer a succession of consecutive strikes.As you noticed - the combat system is big improvement compared to the Arkham Asylum's one (Which, don't get me wrong, was insanely good too!).Verdict: This game is insanely fun and the plot is filled with action and intense moments, which keeps you interested. 10/10 hands down.Short version: This is a sequel to Arkham Asylum, in which we fight Joker and Hugo Strange at the same time. The plot is mind-blowing and the characters are unique and all of this is support by an insane combat system, that is so pleasing to use, that you will fall in love with it. Must buy for every comic fan / fan of Batman, those who liked Asylum this game is gonna be like a dream - nothing more, rather than an overall improvement. 10/10.EDIT: Since the game is often on sale - grab it, because it's worth your money :D			"

												Batman Arkham City takes the incredibly strong foundation created in Arkham Asylum and builds on it a magnificent skyscraper. Everything that made the original game a great experience has been expanded and improved upon, thus making this game one of the best action adventure games you could ever spend your time playing.The freeflow combat system that was so satisfying the first time around has been majorly upgraded and now features an impressive amount of ways to stun and cripple whoever dares to stand in your way. Batman\'s collection of gadgets has also been expanded, with each one having applications in combat and puzzle-solving scenarios. Predator encounters have also seen a boost in excitement as there are now a more ways to takedown your foes, but also more ways to be caught by them. The addition of more playable characters is also a great benefit, as each one plays slightly differently, yet consistently satisfyingly.You will also find yourself fighting a larger variety enemies this time around too, as the game introduces deadlier foes like snipers, armored goons, and blade wielding ninjas. And even more exciting is the larger variety of super villains that you'll find yourself at odds, and sometimes evens, with. A large portion of Batman's rogues gallery is on display here and the ways in which you\'ll face these enemies are as varied as they thrilling. Sometimes there will be a complex and intense battle that must be fought with hard fists, while other times a sharp detective\'s mind and keen puzzle-solving skills will be needed.The most obvious expansion to the game is of course its world design. Whereas Arkham Asylum saw you making your way through the interesting and somewhat linear titular location, Arkham City sees you gliding through the snow covered streets of Gotham City itself, or at least a decent portion of it. It is amazingly detailed and diverse in its depiction and thanks to all the riddles that need solving, those who wish to explore it will be rewarded with interesting stories that give each location, as well as the entire game\'s story, an impressive amount of context.And when speaking about the story I wish to say is that this one\'s is excellent. It starts with a flawless beginning that doesn\'t directly follow Arkham Asylum\'s ending, but provides enough information that you feel as though it almost does. This level of excellence then continues all the way through to the end of the main story, finishes off with quite the show. The characters, from the good to the bad, are each compelling in their own right and even though it\'s satisfying to be victorious over them, it\'s usually a bittersweet victory because your experience with them is over. Throw in the fact that Catwoman has her own separate storyline that weaves in and out of the main one, and you\'ve got a narrative that is varied in its perspective and tone. My only true gripe is that there isn\'t a concluding story moment that plays out once you\'ve completed every task that you can do. You\'re just left to free roam the map, wondering what to do with yourself. However there is an epilogue chapter which heavily features Robin, and while its inclusion does help relieve some feelings of story abandonment, it ultimately still leaves you wanting more.Batman Arkham City is simply put, a major advancement, in almost every way over its predecessor. Almost every functioning part of this game has been improved from the previous Arkham game, and it is undeniably apparent. It is also obvious that huge amount of hard work and reverence for the Dark Knight that went it to creating this game. And in total, I truly believe it to be a work of interactive art.			"

												One of the best games of all time. This game massively improved over its predecessor and personally, holds up against Arkham Knight (mainly due to a botched PC release). If you haven't played this game yet, you're sorely missing out.			"

												I'll start this review off by saying that this game is my favorite game ever (been gaming since the NES), and that says a lot about it since I'm not huge on anything with superheroes, or Batman for that matter - I don't like the movies, except the hilarious one with Adam West and exploding sharks, I don't watch Batman cartoons, I don't read the comic books, I don't even know Batman's true identity... (one of these is a blatant lie).The Arkham games offer a mix of stealth and action gameplay, and they make both of them work perfectly (at least Asylum and City do). I never played a 3D action game with fighting controls this tight, or stealth this fun, it's just a blast to play the combat challenges and predator encounters in these games (again, talking about Asylum and City), On top of that, the voice acting, music, controls, gameplay, story, everything is as good as it can get.So why is this one my favorite? Well there's just something about open world games with a ton of side stuff scattered around that gets to me, and this game definitely has it.From Riddler trophies/puzzles (440 of them if I remember correctly), to side quests that involve some of Gotham's and DC's famous criminals. These make Arkham City a pretty damn fun playground for our flying mammal.You also get to play some parts of the game as Catwoman. I know some people don't enjoy controlling her, but I personally like it, especially in combat. She's faster than Batman and has totally different fighting animations (I wanna say she doesn't punch as hard as the bat, but don't quote me on that).Not sure if I can say anything about the story without spoiling it, so I'll just say that it's pretty good, and Mark Hamill as the Joker, and Kevin Conroy as Batman did an amazing job bringing their characters to life.Again, I'm not a huge Batman fan outside of these games, and I absolutely love the story in this game, I've beaten the game multiple times, and I never skipped a single cutscene.This game is a clean 10/10 for me, it's just fantastic in every way possible.

												This game is one of the best AAA of 2012 and I recommend anyone to play this game. Rocksteady really delivered all that they could with this game and it's certainly a step up from their last game Batman: Arkham Asylum. The controls are amazingly comfortable and it this Arkham City makes me oftenly think about Just Cause 2 in a way. The voice acting is phenominal, especially Mark Hamill as The Joker and Kevin Conroy as Batman. Every time I read the Batman comics those are exact voices I wanna hear from these characters and that is what this game does so perfectly. The open world plays in North Gothem and it's closed off from the rest of the city. The open world aspect to this game is also very nice and detailed. The combat feels and looks amazing and I believe that their are hundreds of different fighting animations and it doesn't make it all looks too repetetive. Another thing that makes this game more creative are the gadgets. You need think of how to open or do certain things with these gadgets. If you're a mega fan of Batman, you might enjoy this game a tiny bit more than if you didn't. Fan or not, buy this game, you'll have a blast. It's sort of hard to point out the negatives but one of them is some of the random texture popins but it doesn't really bother me. I think one of the things is that you can spam press the counter attack button and Batman will fight for you. I'd give it a 9/10			"

Graphic is absolutely stunning, especially ambient occlusion that make it look like it was developed in 2016. To be honest, I wasn't expecting this to be open-world.

												Let me start off by saying that this is a fantastic game with tons of replay value. There are tons of memorable characters, and a story that will enthrall you to no end. The artwork in this game is astounding, and some of the characters are even voiced by legendary voice actors like Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hamill (Joker), The fighting mechanics in the Arkham series are unlike anything you've ever seen before, with tons of options for combos for beating the living crap out of your enemies.After 100 hours, I have completed the game on the three main difficulties and completed the game 100% on Normal. Currently, I'm working on a New Game + playthrough.The music is top notch; composed by Nick Arundel.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Batman, is a fan of beat-em-ups, or just wants to try something new.

												Phew! It's been a long month with Arkham City! Did I enjoy it? Some parts yes, some parts no. Story was great, a decent length for a game and really drives you into itself. It's a continuation game for Arkham Asylum so, make sure you played that one before playing City or there will be dialogues that you won't understand. Unlike Asylum, we have open world in Arkham City. We could explore the island in Arkham Asylum but it wasn't that big and because of it, it didn't feel like open world but in City, you have side quests and over 400 collectibles! Lots of new mechanics have been introduced as well! Another thing is you don't get to play as Batman only, you get to play as Catwoman in some parts of main story and challenges, Robin in challenges and Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC, and Nightwing in challenges only. Combat seems like it's been improved since Arkham Asylum. They added lots of new moves and gadgets to use. Only thing I didn't like about the game was challenges. You have to play them over and over again with 4 characters. Some challenges are not balanced so, get ready to punch your PC while playing them. Long story short, Arkham City was one of the best games I've ever played!			"

Posted: November 23, 2014
												BATMAN Arkham City Review! I almost forgot to do it after I beat the story so here it is.The story was pretty short but the fight system is pretty awesome. I kinda wish the fights lasted longer but I was playing on regular difficulty. Apparently the new game plus mode is really intensely hard, but I didn't care enough to go through it all again. I was pleased with the game on my first run through so I didn't really want to go back and collect all the craploads of Riddler trophies scattered throughout the game or finish any of the side quests.The overall story is pretty solid, but I was feeling like something was missing and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's good, but it just seemed a little too... cookie cutter Batman. There wasn't really anything that stood out or blew my mind. I guess that's what some people enjoy about Batman is that he's Batman and predictable. I don't say that in a negative way, just that some people might like that more than me is all. I had a few ""what a twist"" moments that mainly came from Batman's adversaries rather than himself. Basically Batman just beat the hell out of everyone to get what he needs. I liked how the story was like a few short stories end to end that had an overall theme. It's pretty cool the way Batman works his way through all the scum in Arkham City one by one with the same suit that shows wear and tear as the game progresses. The combat system is by far my favorite aspect of the game. At first I was really not getting it down, but once I realized it's not about button mashing and I have to time literally every hit after the first 2 connect. Basically Batman crits everyone after his second hit, and assuming you're targeting the right thug and not button mashing you can string together some totally mega badass combos. Not to mention the gadgets. They're all there including some new fangled things that wouldn't make it to the movies, but for the purposes of the game it's perfect. Lot's of different configurations of gadget use and combos make for some ridiculous fights. I never got tired of the slow-mo hits either, somehow they were always satisfying. Even if the stealth parts were fun, like hanging some random unfortunate goon upside down of the side of a building, or sneaking around in vents only to bust into the room and knock down a bunch of thugs. All in all the combat is what makes this game worth playing in my opinion.Some of the voice acting is really good and other times it's pretty lame. Sometimes it sounds like people reading to each other off a script with no emotion, then other times it really great and immersive. Joker is by far the best and sounds crazy as you'd expect. Batman wasn't all that great though, but Harley Quinn was spot on as well as a few others.The graphics are outstanding and that's probably my second favorite thing about this game. It just LOOKS really good. The devs really didn't miss much, lots of really fine details are everywhere and really add to the overall ambiance when necessary. If you're not into 3rd person combat, at least play it for the graphics. It's gorgeous. Batman AC: 6.95. Fine I'll round up. 7. "

The story has been slightly improved, with several stories tied at once, making the game feel huge, the combat is even better than Arkham Asylum and has the best combat system ever. The stealth is still very solid, with occasional twists making it harder and more interesting. All the supervillians tied in the game and the game's events fit in perfectly with the story.

												More expansive and populated than its predecessor, Arkham Asylum, it's also far less focused. I'm taken by the gliding and grappling, as well as the endless array of familiar (and startling!) Batman villains that show up, either for entire levels, or just for a brief cameo. The combat remains untaintedly enjoyable, though maybe the arsenal of new gadgets makes things a bit too complex, and the stealth is a fantastic mix of power fantasy and powerless tension. It's pretty much the best sort of modern sequel you can hope for, adding and refining the formula that worked so well in Arkham Asylum. It's lost the balance that made Asylum a true modern classic, though, which is a bit of a shame, but it's not to City's detriment, by any stretch.			"

Great graphics and great optimization makes this game amazing. Now, what about the story? Amazing too! The dialogues, the characters, the extra things you can do, the excellent voice casting, this and more make this game a master piece!

												Arkham City is a fantastic game. Great graphics, solid story. Right from the start you are shown Batman, villain after villain, after villain. It hooks you in and keeps you going. It's not an overwhelming combat system lots of typical button mashing for a hand to hand fighter but in this style of game it's enjoyable. The game focuses more on stealth combat not direct fighting. If you are a batman fan, read no farther go ahead and buy it. If you are on the fence read on.The game is solid, like I mentioned before it's some button mashing style gameplay and it's pretty basic gameplay in my opinion. Basic as in you don't have to be a seasoned gamer to figure it out and play. The graphics are great and Batman as always is awesome. Catwoman is a nice addition, I know Robin is supposed to be around somewhere in the game (not sure if I misread or not got to him yet or something) then all the villains all wrapped up into one story line! It's great, any of the new Batman games (Asylum, City, Origins) This one is my favorite so far but I've not got into Origins much at this time to decide. I recommend this game and think you will enjoy it if you buy it.I give it a 88/100			"

Thanks to Kevin Conroy's accurate and exact voice of Batman, the game exceeded in letting the gamers feel how ""badass"" they are. Highest level of points in Penguin arena is 756, 809. Highest level of points in Joker Carnival Arena is over a million.Strong recommendation for this game and its well created atmosphere and variety of tactics in gameplay.			"

Batman Arkham City	* 10/10The old saying about sequels being worse than the first seems less true in these days. In fact Batman Arkham City goes beyond Arkham Asylum.Arkham City takes place right after the ending of the previous chapter. For some reason Arkham has been extended to a large portion of Gotham (reasons can be found during the game and secondary missions of Arkham Asylum) and Bruce Wayne is trapped inside it. The moment he gets safe he can become Batman and investigate the situation of the new Arkham City. I don't want to talk about the story more than I did because I consider this the best until now, and I refuse to make any spoiler to ruin the experience.Gameplay is based on the previous chapter's combat system consisting of a very simple 3rd person action that easily allows you to fight against large quantities of enemies or use a stealth approach, but it has also been improved with moves and gadgets and most importantly, considering now you're in an open city, you can freely plane over the buildings all around the town which is simply awesome and fun.As the story takes place in a bigger ambience like Gotham you will have much more side missions, that will keep you busy for much longer. Once again the riddler will challenge you to retrieve his trophies (some of them are really hard to get), and most importantly in this chapter we see Catwoman for the first time. There are also some missions where you can impersonate her, and in meantime you can catch some riddler trophies specifically for Catwoman.Just like the entire franchise, Arkham City uses the Unreal Engine, wisely used by the developers to build the entire city and amazing closed sections. Besides the whole game is filled with references (subtle or not) to a lot of characters or situations from DC and Batman's story which, together with the incredible main and side stories, demonstrate the care and love for the game and characters by the developers.+++PROs+++ STORY.  It Goes On Exactly from where Asylum ended, and it's so well orchestrated, by involving many characters, old and new ones, and giving them their own situations and fitting context. The story is so great, full of Turning points with one of the greatest ends ever possible. GAMEPLAY. Absolutely fun, following the style of Asylum, this time we can also fly through the whole city... Absolutely the best. SECONDARY MISSIONS. Lots, nice and fun, they have some depth, some story, so you do have a good reason to play them. Especially the Riddler, one of the best villain in these games, in my opinion... Seriously (Why so serious? XD) CHARACTERS. It's amazing how many famous characters are involved in the story: old ones, new ones... And Being a Generic Comic fan And batman reader I admit I didn't know anything About Hugo Strange. This made me read more (and enjoy the game more, somehow) REFERENCES. Endless References, cameos and homages to batman's and DC's universe RIDDLER. Those damn riddles are more difficult in this chapter... XD CATWOMAN. Playable Catwoman Sidestory. It wasn't much, but it was a very nice addition that gave some variety to the game. SOUNDTRACK. This soundtrack makes use of a great title track, and some good support melodies.---CONs--- BINDINGS. Key Bindings in a pre-Game Window only? in 2012? Seriously? Again? This reminds me of Need For Speed... 3... 1998... and that was for graphic selection (software or 3dfx), the keys were editable ingame... 1998... Ridiculous considering the great results of the game itself. RIDDLER. Those damn riddles are more difficult in this chapter... XDI played this game on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 "

This series is the best representation of Batman I've seen(Atleast in Video games).He's badbooty, He's smart, has quick wits, Is skilled, resourceful, everything inbetween and more!

												Arkham City expands on what made Arkham Asylum such a classic. The plot is great, the visuals epic, and the combat flows. Most of the voices are those from the Animated Series (Arleen Sorkin was replaced by Tara Strong as the voice for Harley Quinn). The side quests are also grand. And then there is the dynamic between Batman and Catwoman, which is somethng that flows under the surface. The Game of the Year edition also adds all the DLCs, so you can continue the story into the next phase.And there are hints of something... else coming. Something much more dangeorus.			"

												Absolutely fantastic game! Captivating story, great gameplay, and characters that make the expirience even better! It gets difficult occasionally, but only to the extent that when you complete the mission/task/whatever, you achieve a sense of acomplishment. The plot is incredibly well thought out, with twists and turns at every corner. In fact, the only thing better than the story, is the gameplay itself. After a little getting used to, the combat becomes enjoyable. Whether you're taking on a few thugs, a titan, or both at once, i can guarantee that you will find it entertaining. The upgrade system has improved significantly from what it was in arkham asylum. I'm not going to lie, using the cryptographic sequencer was a bit of a struggle, but after more frequent use, became an exellent adition to batman's repetoire of gadgets. And then there's the voice acting. Absolutely amazing. The cast was perfect, and all portrayed the characters brilliantly. The only thing that i dislike about this game was that it ended. Game of the Year is an understatement. This is one of the greatest games ever made. Whether you're a fan of batman, or not, this game will prove to be a fantastic expirience that you will never forget. Thank you rocksteady, for creating the best supehero game ever made.			"

												Excellent game,controls are good but a controller would help as it can get quite painful during mellee fighting(lots of rapid left clicking)Typical batman storyline good vs evil and all that ! The game offers the freedom of zipping around an open world(limited in size) and dealing out lots of trouble for the bad guys.Many side missions to keep busy as the main storyline is fairly short,all in all a good game for $7.49.

												I have to say I'm not really fond of Batman, I could see the cartoon on TV but I wasn't interested by it.I started to play and the story gets you right into it like the first (Arkham Asylum), you just can't stop playing until you see the ending scene. This game is just a masterpiece, everything is made up for every batman fan and to make you become one.You can probably see all the characters in this, the story doesn't really follows the previous one in my opinion, maybe only with The Joker.When I was complaining of the lack of combat moves in Arkham Asylum, they added more here to create more techniques to make battles like so EPIC.However, they kept the challenges, they added even more with the Robin, Catwoman and Nightwing packs, the challenges are the same as Arkham Asylum, only the maps and the new moves change. For me, it's not really enjoyable, some challenges are too hard and require 1 hour of play doing nothing to get all the medals. Boring.The DLC Quinn's Revenge is quite good, a bit too short.If you're an achievement master, you will probably end the story campaign 99.50% with 3 Riddler's challenges that you can do only once in the middle of the story.To brief, this game has an awesome story that will get you curious of every single event in Arkham, The Joker is brilliant, I wonder what he's become in Arkham Origins. And if you didn't play Arkham Asylum, buy the triple pack.			"

												I do not read Batman (or any superhero stuff), nor have I played any other game in the series, yet I still find this game very likeable as an action game. You play as Batman, the ace detective / kung fu master, and fight crime around Arkham City.Most of the gameplay alternates between 2 kinds of actions: flying around and punching people. Then flying around some more and punching more people.The flying parts actually feel very natural. You hold A to run / glide, and push RB to fire a claw and pull yourself to top of buildings. Whenever there is something you can pull yourself to, the game gives you very clear visual cues, and pressing the button always gets me to the place I want to go, which feels great. And the claw has a really long range, allowing you to fly across the city swiftly.The fighting also exceeds my expectations. It starts very easy: mash X to punch, and whenever you see warnings on their heads, push Y instead to counter. However new mechanics keep appearing. There are knife guys that you have to HOLD Y to dodge. There are guys with guns that you cannot take on up front. There are info guys that you don't want to take out so that you can interrogate them. There are armor guys that won't get hurt until stunned. You can unlock critical strikes that require you to push X at precise times instead of mashing it. These mechanics keep the fighting fresh and challenge you to adopt new fighting styles.The tutorials are also done well. In the move list you can actually turn tutorials of individual moves on or off, anytime. If turned on, instructions will appear as soon as you are in the position to use that move. So never worry about forgetting a specific move again.Occasionally you also get to use some cool gadgets, such as a boomerang, a hacking machine, and explosives. I am disappointed to see there being no long range take-down weapons, such as a tranquilizer gun. But then such a gun may make the game too easy and not fun. And Batman probably won't look cool with a gun.Another complaint I have is the inability to pick up weapons dropped by enemies, such as bats. The wood stuff that you hit balls with, not the animal. But again, it would not be fun if Batman could pick up and use guns, so maybe that is intended.As for graphics, since this game is relatively ancient, it runs fluently on my 3-year-old laptop with moderate quality settings. The colors are always darkish and depressing, everywhere, all the time. I guess that's because the whole city and whole game is about darkness so it can't be helped. Think twice before buying if you don't like that.The music is decent and dynamically changes to match the atmosphere. The sound effects are pretty good, expecially the fighting sounds. They make your punches feel much more powerful, and carry information too.The storytelling is also good. Before playing I feared that not knowing Batman characters may prevent me from understanding the plots. However the game helps me by providing brief introductions to every main character, explaining what they do and why. As a result, I still don't fully know what happened before the plot of this game, but everything happening in the game can be clearly understood. The plots are highly straightforward anyway.In conclusion, this is an enjoyable action game. I don't know what Batman fans will think of it, but I find it highly satisfiable as a regular action game on its own. There are minor flaws, something that I think can be designed better, and so far I haven't seen anything that truly amazes me, but with highly fluent graphics, ever-changing fights, and a low price, this game is worth it.=============== Updates after finishing story mode ==================More praises and complaints.Near the end, the fights get much more intense than I expected. The complex formation of enemies force you to use all of ABXY buttons, and thus make it very hard to always push the correct button at the correct time. That's a great challenge and I love it.For additional complaints, first, the story is not complete. At the beginning we saw Joker poison himself, Batman, as well as thousands of people around Arkham. However at the end, only 2 cures are made, Freeze destroyed one, Batman drank the other one and survived, Joker did not get any and died. What about the people? Does Batman just see them die? Or are they already cleared out by Protocol 10? I feel that's an important question left unanswered and I don't like that.Second, Catwoman is much worse than Batman at bouncing around, which makes no sense. In a room with vantage points, with Batman you can pretty much put a vantage point anywhere in the camera, then press RB to hop onto it. With Catwoman this barely works: you have to stand in a specific location or RB does nothing. This difference makes it much harder than it should be to play stealth with Catwoman.Finally, game freezes once every few hours. Sometimes when this happens I cannot even start the task manager and have to sign out from Windows entirely. It's rare, but it shouldn't happen at all.==========================================================+ Play as Batman+ Fly across the city, horizontally and vertically, with ease+ Intense fights+ Variety of enemies+ Collectibles+ Friendly tutorials+ Fluent graphics- Flat plot- Unable to pick up items- Infrequent freezes8 out of 10, excellent.

												Batman Arkham City. Well to be honest i had my doubts for this game, didn't like Arkham Asylum all too much but Arkham City really did opened up the series for me. With Arkham City's being a free roamer really caugth my attention being that usually Free Roam superhero games like the Spiderman series really gives alot of potential on games for me. Arkham City didn't fail and in fact sucseeded in suprising me more than i thougth it would. Combat is amazing, free roam never got boring being that you tend to get that Batman feel everytime you leap from one building to another and glide your way to slam over an enemy never gets old. The story is great, intense and the campaign is almost always thrilling. Boss fights are challenging and rememberable. Map size is rather big, but nothing special. Stealth feels rather real compared to most games. A.I feels amazingly intelligent and you get that hide for your life type of feel whenever you're taking the predator approach in a room filled with armed thugs.You can spend alot of time playing this game garrunteed, side missions are fun on thier own, and Catwoman being an editon to the gameplay as a playable character really only makes the experience that much better. I'd give Arkham City a 9/10. Good story. Good combat. Good map and free roam. Spectacular campaign and only some slight character bugs.			"

												A fantastic game that everybody should try. It improves on everything present in Arkham Asylum to make it fell like a true sequel. No matter if you're just familar with the movies, the cartoons, the comics, or none of the above, there is something to appeal to everybody. I've beat it numerous times on the 360 and the PC and I still come back to it from time to time because of the addictive combat and Riddler Challenges, as you can tell by the number of hours I've put into it. The only negative things I'd have to say about the game would be that not much attention was placed on Nightwing and Robin in the game; an example would be that in the challenge rooms neither of them have any voice acting. But that's more of a nitpick (I love Robin/Tim Drake) becasue this is a game centered around Batman, and in that regard the game is perfect. This is my favorite game of all time, a title I hope will be replaced by the upcoming Arkham Knight. If I had to give this game a score it be 10/10. So go get it :p			"

												One of my all time favorite games. Batman: Arkham City took what Arkham Asylum did good and made it a whole lot better. The one thing that Arkham City does the best is that it makes you feel like you're Batman. It does so in a variety of ways, from giving you a large arsenal of gadgets to use, making the combat feel fluid and responsive with lots of different types of attacks, having you investigate crimes by searching for clues and trying to repiece the moments in your head, and best of all, it lets you glide around the city with your wings. There's no question why this is considered one of the best licensed games next to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena. The GOTY edition really does add to the game. It comes with a few extra challenge maps that are actually fun to play. They certainly are challenging and aren't just tacky add-ons to make the game longer. In fact, the main story is longer than most of todays games, coming in at around 15 hours, not including the side missions (I owned the GFWL version before the Steam version, and I have yet to complete it on Steam). With the side missions, I'd say total gameplay hours would be around 30 hours, since there are tons of extra stuff to do, not including challenge mode.So overall, this game is worth your time. Even if you aren't a Batman fan or don't know much about his character or the world, this game is fun for everyone who enjoys third person action games.My only complaint is that the open world can feel dead at times, with no one in the streets and nothing happening, and also how it takes a long time to travel from one area to another if you didn't unlock it already. Arkham Knight will fix this with being able to freely drive the Batmobile.My personal rating: 9/10 -  Gripping story, fluid combat, awesome graphics, and just downright fun to play. "

												Batman Arkham City is, obviously, the sequel to Arkham Asylum. I already said that Asylum was one of my best games of all time. However, Arkham City improves in every single aspect of the Arkham games. It has more content that is still of high quality, better mechanics, a better story that actually has a couple of twists in it (They will not be spoiled here) and some of the best downloadable content on the market.I'll begin by discussing the improved combat system. It makes the one is Asylum seem extremely outdated even though this was released only two years after Asylum. There are much more combat moves, a bigger enemy variety that includes armored enemies that can only be hit with the new Beatdown move and enemies holding doors which can only be avoided by maneuvering away from them or by pulling off the aerial attack move. Even the titan combat has been improved with two moves you can pull of on them. This makes the game harder, but not by much. Taking away the counter icons will give you a much tougher experience. The system will take a bit of getting used to, especially with the tougher moves like the Blade Dodge Takedown.The stealth has also been improved. There is a much bigger variety of takedowns that Batman can perform such as the Ledge Takedown, Takedowns through glass and walls and Double Takedowns which are very rewarding when you can pull one off. Again, the stealth has also been made harder. You will have to deal with armored enemies that can only be taken down with exotic methods and enemies that will be able to see you on vantage points if you don't have the right upgrade.Most of Batman's gadgets that were in Arkham Asylum have returned for City with a few new editions such as the Line Launcher (Which I believe is the most useful gadget it any game ever) and the Freeze Grenade. All of the gadgets are very helpful in stealth. Most of them are useful in combat and they help keep the variety in your combos.The game now contains not only Riddler Trophies as collectables, but it also has some challenges that are completed by Gliding for a certain length of time or using a certain gadget in a combo for example. Destroyable items are back too.There are also a lot of side missions in this game that each focus on a specific character. You can begin them at random points throughout the game or simply through discovery. Some of them can be completely missed out. They all have a lot of variety and some of them hint at things that could happen in Arkham Knight.Challenge Maps are back as well. The base game had 6 combat and 6 predator challenges with extreme varients. The extreme predator maps have been improved since Asylum. It is quite rare for you to ever be in a situation where the map has the vantage points with proximity mines on them which I think was just a cheap way to increase the difficulty. The maps are not too hard, even if you are aiming for all three medals. The predator ones may require a bit of trial and error for some of the objectives. I don't really see this as a problem as it reminds me of what Batman is: A detective. There are also a set of 12 campaigns which are a series of three maps which you must complete with modifiers that make some maps harder, but you are also given some helpful modifiers. A series of three extreme maps will test your skills to the limits.The port itself had problems and the abysmal GFWL integrated into it at launch. Now those problems are pretty much nonexistant. There are a couple of bugs with the A.I. and combat but these issues don't come up that often.The game runs pretty well after some configuration and it also includes all of the DLC. It wouldn't be a GOTY edition without all of the DLC, am I right?The extra content you are getting for Arkham City is all brilliant. There are a ton of skins that Batman can use from different storylines. Catwoman is playable with 4 extra story missions and two additional skiins. Her ability set is quite limited compared to Batman and she is intented for the more experienced players. Robin and Nightwing are both playable in the challenge maps. They come with some gadgets you will already be familiar with and new gadgets that will give you more unique ways to dispatch your foes. Extra challenge maps are also provided that try to do things differently. There are two survival maps and a sidescroller for example. The Batcave is also a predator map. Finally, there is the Two Hour Story Campaign, Harley Quinn's Revenge. It doesn't do much new, but you are getting more arkham city and extra playtime with Robin. What more could you ask for?You are going to get well over 100 hours completing everything this game has to offer (I played this on the PS3 so I rushed through both of my story playthroughs). If you liked Arkham Asylum, you probably already have this. If you haven't played a Batman Game before, wait for a sale and pick it up. You won't be disappointed as this is an unforgettable experience. The amount of detail put into the world is astounding and the mechanics have been polished even further than before. It is one of the greatest video games ever created. 10/10.			"

												The classic feud between Joker and Batman but emphasised with a dark, scretive tone that Rocksteady has tremendously done well in. Gizmos, combat skills, villains, all in a mosh pit in the everlasting war between good and evil. Arkham City also gives the good vibe of being the 'Dark Knight': silent but steady in being the hero of a dilapitated Gotham. Worth the buy, and definitely, no regrets at all.			"

												Arkham Asylum was a great game, and this takes everything that was great about it and improves on it while still retaining the basic formula that made the first game great. It doesn't stray too far to confuse you if you played the first but it definitely takes the game in a different enough direction that you don't feel like you're playing a rehash called Arkham Asylum 1.5.A bigger, longer game from the first with a much improved story, some good plot twists, a more conventional 3 act story and still has the great moments and voice acting from the first.The Riddler challenges in the first game were fun to do, and they've been improved drastically here. They can be wildly different from the first game and quite hard to figure out, but well worth the time doing so.The Catwoman sections are a lot of fun too. She plays different enough from Batman but you don't feel like you're weaker than him. In fact, I liked playing as Catwoman more than I did Batman. Her takedowns are slower and she climbs up buildings differently and it can take a bit to get the hang of, but it added to the game a lot.The Harley Quinn DLC was very short, but most DLCs are. It was fun, it was different and geniunely added to the experience. You spend a lot of time playing as Robin and he plays a little more like Batman but with some different moves on him.The challenges include Batman, Catwoman, Robin & Nightwing (formerly the first Robin) and they all play different from one another but still have the same moves overall, just different actions, different power and different speed.This was an amazing game and easily recommended to anyone who likes action games.

												One of my all time favorite games. Batman: Arkham City took what Arkham Asylum did good and made it a whole lot better. The one thing that Arkham City does the best is that it makes you feel like you're Batman. It does so in a variety of ways, from giving you a large arsenal of gadgets to use, making the combat feel fluid and responsive with lots of different types of attacks, having you investigate crimes by searching for clues and trying to repiece the moments in your head, and best of all, it lets you glide around the city with your wings. There's no question why this is considered one of the best licensed games next to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena. The GOTY edition really does add to the game. It comes with a few extra challenge maps that are actually fun to play. They certainly are challenging and aren't just tacky add-ons to make the game longer. In fact, the main story is longer than most of todays games, coming in at around 15 hours, not including the side missions (I owned the GFWL version before the Steam version, and I have yet to complete it on Steam). With the side missions, I'd say total gameplay hours would be around 30 hours, since there are tons of extra stuff to do, not including challenge mode.So overall, this game is worth your time. Even if you aren't a Batman fan or don't know much about his character or the world, this game is fun for everyone who enjoys third person action games.My only complaint is that the open world can feel dead at times, with no one in the streets and nothing happening, and also how it takes a long time to travel from one area to another if you didn't unlock it already. Arkham Knight will fix this with being able to freely drive the Batmobile.My personal rating: 9/10 -  Gripping story, fluid combat, awesome graphics, and just downright fun to play. "

												Batman Arkham City is, obviously, the sequel to Arkham Asylum. I already said that Asylum was one of my best games of all time. However, Arkham City improves in every single aspect of the Arkham games. It has more content that is still of high quality, better mechanics, a better story that actually has a couple of twists in it (They will not be spoiled here) and some of the best downloadable content on the market.I'll begin by discussing the improved combat system. It makes the one is Asylum seem extremely outdated even though this was released only two years after Asylum. There are much more combat moves, a bigger enemy variety that includes armored enemies that can only be hit with the new Beatdown move and enemies holding doors which can only be avoided by maneuvering away from them or by pulling off the aerial attack move. Even the titan combat has been improved with two moves you can pull of on them. This makes the game harder, but not by much. Taking away the counter icons will give you a much tougher experience. The system will take a bit of getting used to, especially with the tougher moves like the Blade Dodge Takedown.The stealth has also been improved. There is a much bigger variety of takedowns that Batman can perform such as the Ledge Takedown, Takedowns through glass and walls and Double Takedowns which are very rewarding when you can pull one off. Again, the stealth has also been made harder. You will have to deal with armored enemies that can only be taken down with exotic methods and enemies that will be able to see you on vantage points if you don't have the right upgrade.Most of Batman's gadgets that were in Arkham Asylum have returned for City with a few new editions such as the Line Launcher (Which I believe is the most useful gadget it any game ever) and the Freeze Grenade. All of the gadgets are very helpful in stealth. Most of them are useful in combat and they help keep the variety in your combos.The game now contains not only Riddler Trophies as collectables, but it also has some challenges that are completed by Gliding for a certain length of time or using a certain gadget in a combo for example. Destroyable items are back too.There are also a lot of side missions in this game that each focus on a specific character. You can begin them at random points throughout the game or simply through discovery. Some of them can be completely missed out. They all have a lot of variety and some of them hint at things that could happen in Arkham Knight.Challenge Maps are back as well. The base game had 6 combat and 6 predator challenges with extreme varients. The extreme predator maps have been improved since Asylum. It is quite rare for you to ever be in a situation where the map has the vantage points with proximity mines on them which I think was just a cheap way to increase the difficulty. The maps are not too hard, even if you are aiming for all three medals. The predator ones may require a bit of trial and error for some of the objectives. I don't really see this as a problem as it reminds me of what Batman is: A detective. There are also a set of 12 campaigns which are a series of three maps which you must complete with modifiers that make some maps harder, but you are also given some helpful modifiers. A series of three extreme maps will test your skills to the limits.The port itself had problems and the abysmal GFWL integrated into it at launch. Now those problems are pretty much nonexistant. There are a couple of bugs with the A.I. and combat but these issues don't come up that often.The game runs pretty well after some configuration and it also includes all of the DLC. It wouldn't be a GOTY edition without all of the DLC, am I right?The extra content you are getting for Arkham City is all brilliant. There are a ton of skins that Batman can use from different storylines. Catwoman is playable with 4 extra story missions and two additional skiins. Her ability set is quite limited compared to Batman and she is intented for the more experienced players. Robin and Nightwing are both playable in the challenge maps. They come with some gadgets you will already be familiar with and new gadgets that will give you more unique ways to dispatch your foes. Extra challenge maps are also provided that try to do things differently. There are two survival maps and a sidescroller for example. The Batcave is also a predator map. Finally, there is the Two Hour Story Campaign, Harley Quinn's Revenge. It doesn't do much new, but you are getting more arkham city and extra playtime with Robin. What more could you ask for?You are going to get well over 100 hours completing everything this game has to offer (I played this on the PS3 so I rushed through both of my story playthroughs). If you liked Arkham Asylum, you probably already have this. If you haven't played a Batman Game before, wait for a sale and pick it up. You won't be disappointed as this is an unforgettable experience. The amount of detail put into the world is astounding and the mechanics have been polished even further than before. It is one of the greatest video games ever created. 10/10.			"

												★★★★★ - ""Do not miss this game"" PROS:- Content, theres so much of it. A decent lengthen storyline with plenty of side missions and DLC story lines too.- Missions are varied, both within the storyline and side missions, including puzzles, stealth, gung-ho action and boss battles.- For the first time you can play as Catwoman and Robin, the former is awesome to play as and adds a fresh dimension to the game.- The storyline is great, thanks to incredible characters with superb voice acting and twists and turns to keep you guessing.- Roam the city, it feels great to glide around Arkham city with plenty to explore.- Combat is some of the best in the industry with some new moves and use of gadgets.- Batman, Robin, Catwoma, Joker, Harley Quinn, Bane, Mr.Freeze, Penguin..so many of the great comic book legends come to life in the game.- GOTY edition comes with all content including some rather cool skin packs for Batman and Robin.CONS:- On first play through on other platforms I found it easy to lose interest when wondering arkham city, often getting lost and mislead when navigating. I preferred Asylums more linear approach for a long time before I revisited arkham city.- Game mode plus, I hate this invention. Theres plenty of replay value anyway due to free roam after story completion, allowing you to revisit side missions but plus mode feels like a con. If there is an even more difficult mode have it available from the start as if your one to play for achievements you will need to play the game again.VERDICT? An incredible game which is high value for money.			"

												Arkham City - it's Arkham Asylum, multiplied by the ten. With Catwoman. Another notable reason not to sleep for a few nights, a huge poster print superhero in a black mantle, hang it in my private room and do not hesitate arrogant giggles ""type already matured"" peers, including girls. The most important thing for us is that Batman is still very steep and demand. Thank you thank you for it, Rocksteady!			"

												Arkham City is the Second installment of Rocksteady's Arkham Franchise. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, Legendary Batman related Voice Actors return as their normal roles.Now, on to the story. After the events of Arkham Asylum, Arkham Asylum was shut down. And Mayor Sharp thought that maybe a bigger prison would be better. So, They built a Wall around Old Gotham. Where we start this story, Bruce Wayne is giving a speech infront of the Prison. He's part of the Anti-Arkham City thing that some poeple made. Hugo Strange, The Warden of Arkham City, Orders Bruce Wayne's arrest. Now we all know that Hugo Strange knows Bruce is Batman. Bruce then escapes Strange's custody and calls Alfred to send in the Batusit. Batman's long Night, has Just begun. That's all I'll say about the story. You'll just have to see what happens for yourself. (I know in my Arkham Origins review I talked about the end, But, I'm cheap. xD I enjoy the story in this more and it really sucks you in. So I choose not to spoil anything) There are many different Batman Characters in this game. Such as Barbara & Jim Gordon, Tim Drake Robin, Ra's Al Ghul, Hugo Strange, Catwoman, Two-Face, Penguin, Nightwing, (Sadly only a playable character in the challenge maps. No voice actor untill Arkham Knight either) Joker, Harley Quinn, Riddler, Deadshot, Mister Freeze, and much, much more. Now on to what I liked. I did like that Tim Was In here at least. I also, LOVED the Story. The Detective vision has improved since Arkham Asylum. The Combat system is also good. I Really like that this game has more than Batman Beating up people. It shows that he truely is The World's Greatest Detective. Batman and all the playable characters have a variety of Takedowns, and Gadgets. One of my favorite passtimes in Arkham Asylum & City is Thug Bowling on the Line Launcher. I also really like Playing as Nightwing in the challenge maps. Now, On to things I didn't like. I really liked everything in this game! But one of the VERY few Problems I had with this game was how they handled Tim Drake. With the Buzz Cut, Damian hood, & Brooding! He acted more Like Damian! Plus Tim Always had Anime style hair. Then again they hardly had any development in him. He acted more like Tim in the Story DLC. Anyway, Tim is basically the only problem I had with Arkham City. Well, Besides the Ra's Al Ghul part. When Batman Talks To Freeze he knows that Ra's has been using the Pit for centuries. Freeze asked ""What will you do if he's dead?"" Batman then responds with ""Then I'll Wake Him Up"". BUT, After the Ra's boss Battle, Batman talks to Barbara and is like ""He's using some sort of Pit. He's been using it for centuries"". Batman Already Knew that! Continuity error there! I also didn't really like how Penguin was. He was supposed to be gentleman like he looked in his poster in Arkham Asylum. He just sounds and looks like a British Thug! But the reason for this is because this is Arkham City, the criminals really are at there lowest points. I really had hardly any problems with Arkham City. I give this Game a 9.5 out of 10.			"

 Batman Arkham City Review Much like Arkham Asylum, I fell in love with this game from the beginning. The story this time around certainly feels grander and the fantastic opener solidifies that, whilst capturing the tone of Batman and the atmosphere of the first game. We learn that Hugo Strange, who serves as warden of Arkham City, knows Bruce Wayne is Batman – oops, spoiler – and that he plans to execute some plan named Protocol 10 which Batman is out to stop. The Joker is also sick due to his obsession with Titan, resulting in an unlikely alliance between the two. This combination sends Batman on a myriad of tasks, which sees him meeting up with the likes of The Penguin, Mr Freeze and The League of Assassins. The narrative this time around, is surprisingly emotional but suffers from a few pacing issues, mostly due to the implementation of a Catwoman storyline. She serves as another playable character, and that’s not to say she isn’t interesting, because she is, Catwomen’s story just suffers from being placed between the most important moments in Batman’s quest.Aside from the main story, the open world this time features a few side quests involving Zsasz, Bane and even Deadshot. They vary in length, with some taking most of the game to finish and others taking less than ten minutes, but they’re a nice break from doing the main story missions and it’s fun to explore the rogues’ gallery of villains, Batman has to offer.The combat system has been slightly improved this time as well, offering a number of quick gadgets to use in combos and the ability to counter up to three enemies at once. The variety in enemy types is larger this time around, consisting of armoured and shield bearing thugs, that help to keep combat from getting repetitive. These combat overhauls are welcome and help to keep it varied and build upon the already great system. The same can be said for the predator sections – which like combat involve new enemy types, like the backpack wearing communication jammer and thugs with night vision goggles. As well as the new gadgets and environmental hazards which can be used to pick off said enemies. However like Arkham Asylum, the game suffers without varied and interesting boss battles with the exception of Mr Freeze, who forces the player to adapt throughout the fight. The other battles feel uninspired and lack the same creativity that Scarecrow had in the first game.Riddler is also back and has packed Arkham City tight with hundreds upon hundreds of collectibles, which to completionists might sound like heaven. The problem this time is that it becomes more of a chore than the previous game, in Asylum they weren’t absurd to collect and paired with the rewards, it just felt rewarding. Now it crosses into tedium, however the addition of Arkham City Stories, which are little lore pieces that you get from solving riddles are extremely interesting to read and add more character and depth to the world.The challenge mode with a mishmash of combat and predator levels also returns, amplified by four different characters, with over 200 medals to collect each. It’s much the same as the first, you pick a map and your character of choice – Batman, Catwoman, Nightwing or Robin – and fight for high scores on combat maps or complete tasks on the predator maps. The sheer amount of content around in challenge mode this time, will take hours upon hours to fully 100%, and with the gameplay being so damn enjoyable, it’s hard to become bored. A nice added feature for those who want to experience the main story a second time over, is New Game Plus. The mode carries over all your gadgets and progress from the main game and drops you into the story again, with amped up difficulty and all new enemy formations.Considering Batman Arkham City makes some welcome improvements to its predecessor, it’s a shame that its problems hold it back from being outright better that Arkham Asylum. Some finer tuning in the open world and Catwoman storyline would have made the difference it needed, but with that said – Arkham City is still a remarkable game and a worthy successor to Arkham Asylum. Batman Arkham City: Harley Quinn's Revenge Review Harley Quinn's Revenge is a small expansion for Batman Arkham City, that centers on Robin tracking down Batman in Harley Quinn's hideout.. The expansion is short, offering around 1-2 hours of content with all of that being the main story. No side missions or collectibles to speak of here.The expansion is also mostly linear, with the lion's share of it taking place inside a factory full of Harley Quinn's thugs, there is one free roaming part, but even that is limited to one area of Arkham City. It's the same type of Batman content you've come to to expect with - some combat, predator sections and puzzles.The standout of this entire expansion would be Kevin Conroy as Batman, due to the events that unfolded in Arkham City, Batman is broken. And it shows in Conroy's performance, it's fairly sublte, but his delivery is melancholic and damaged. You can hear the emotion in his voice, and it helps to remind us that Batman is human - he's not some superpowered god - but a man. I think it's an important study of Batman's character, one that makes the expansion worth any Batman fans time.It may be short, but Harley Quinn's Revenge is worth playing, it's more fantastic Batman gameplay with a performance from Conroy that shows us why he is the definitive Batman.

												Bigger and better than its wonderful predecessor. The new gadgets and the way that they can be used in battles give a lot of variety, making it a bore returning to Asylum. It's a blast to move through the open world _ it feels more like Spider-Man than Batman, but that's not bad. Riddler's trophies are not just hidden, you have to solve puzzles to get them (I didn't manage to get them all, like I did in Asylum, but there's no achievement for it, so I gave up after getting more than 90%). And, although they're way more limited than Batman, it was great to play as Robin, Nightwing and, specially, as Catwoman (she's sexy as hell!). This is a must play!			"

												There are those who prefer the original Arkham Asylum to Arkham City. Granted, Asylum does have much better music and a story that wouldn't sound absurd if you tried to say it out loud (although story isn't the same thing as narrative), but those are relatively minor considerations.Because Arkham City, with its beautiful open world design, pitch-perfect combat engine, and hugely varied but not too numerous activities, does something Arkham Asylum never could: It makes the player feel like they're Batman.In the end, most games - and most comics, for that matter - boil down to power fantasies, but what better power fantasy is there than being what is arguably the most popular fictional character of the 21st century?

Batman: Arkham City is a strategic brawler featuring polished mechanics and a brooding story that will entertain diehard fans and newcomers alike. Narrative:  Batman begins his journey with a violent ushering into the ""no man's land"" known as Arkham City, an Alcatraz-esque prison island where the world's most twisted criminals are now rampaging free. This is a decidedly bleak game, and absent are the saccharine clichés of other superhero plots. During his journey, Batman will encounter unlikely allies who have intriguing and oftentimes conflicting interests at play. But the core of the game's story revolves around the philosophical contrast drawn between the Batman and the Joker. Their constant struggle of opposing worldviews is executed to perfection and feels authentic and engaging. Minor quibbles aside concerning a character shift I felt was rushed, the general pacing of the game feels great. Batman: Arkham City has a compelling and concise script that will leave you wanting more. Gameplay: As the dark night spreads over the city of Arkham, the player must ultilize every tool at their disposal. The gameplay meat of Arkham City revolves around the ""glass cannon"" design of Batman and his arsenal of gadgets. When I executed my strategy with precision, I felt like the biggest, baddest superhero of all time. However, I quickly realized that even a few missteps would result in an untimely ending. The difficulty of the game is scalable (after initial completion) and lets the player dictate the depth of strategy they will need to employ to overcome obstacles. In addition to the main questline, there is a plethora of side content ranging from distress calls, augmented reality challenges and puzzles. Unfortunately for Batman, I did not encounter any bugs during my playthrough.I always felt disappointed when the game forced me to switch to Catwoman. Her character is fun to play, but I felt (in general) the swapping interrupted the natural flow of gameplay and I found myself thinking ""I just want to be Batman.""  Sensory: Batman rises above other similar games with an intricate soundstage, a powerful musical score and believable voice acting. The game designers have employed a stylized neo-gothic artistic aesthetic and incorporate interesting character design especially for bosses. Most of the time will be spent exploring the foreboding city, filled with depth of scenery and gritty recesses. During combat, punches and kicks sound delightfully crunch. The score is dark and undulating fitting the macabre mood of the game with razor-precision, accomplished with delicate plucking contrasted by stringed instruments and distortion. Mark Hamill reprises his role as the voice of the Joker and knocks it out of the park, bringing a video game character to life in a way I have never seen before. Conclusion: I came into this game with low expectations and left feeling a connection to the Batman franchise. If attempting to restore sanity and order in a dystopia filled to the brim with villains sounds like your piece of cake, then it's time to suit up.			"

												3 out of 5, fun at first, disjointed, repetitive and boring later.  I LOVED LOVED LOVED Asylum, but this game does not live up to the fun of the first.  This game takes place in a much larger world than the first game, however the world is boring and lifeless, and you will spend most of your time doing busywork to upgrade your character.  With all of the side missions this is a lengthy game, I wish they focused more on the core story.  The fun Riddler riddles from the first game have been replaced tons of boring easy puzzles.  It's not a bad game, but nowhere near as good as 1.  The boss battles are good.  In the first game you likely left detective mode turned on the whole game, in this game they made detective mode worse, encouraging you to turn it off.			"

												A slightly sequel to previous Batman's game ""Batman: Arkham Asylum"". Only in this game you get to play in a lot bigger area and with wider story, more to explore and more characters to discover. As previous game, it's done by Rocksteady, applying the same formula. Basically it's improved Batman: Arkham Asylum. Everything you got from Arkham Asylum is find here, only more. More villains, more missions, bigger story, more playable characters (as Catwoman, Robin) and more glitches (or bugs). But in this game those bugs will make you laugh more that be angry. I was able to see during a combat a henchman flying to the skys. Also challenges are more, but that is a minus. If you are aiming for 100% achievements, you have to do maps over and over and over and over again. And controls aren't places very well. I tried to play with a keyboard and with a controller, but I offen found Batman doing something I didn't told him to do ( like instead of running away, he took cover right next to enemy and got filled with bullets) And during a combat, Batman will attack to his desired enemy. But few bugs there and there doesn't make this game worse, it's forgivable since the story is very wide and there is a lot to discover.			"

												3 out of 5, fun at first, disjointed, repetitive and boring later.  I LOVED LOVED LOVED Asylum, but this game does not live up to the fun of the first.  This game takes place in a much larger world than the first game, however the world is boring and lifeless, and you will spend most of your time doing busywork to upgrade your character.  With all of the side missions this is a lengthy game, I wish they focused more on the core story.  The fun Riddler riddles from the first game have been replaced tons of boring easy puzzles.  It's not a bad game, but nowhere near as good as 1.  The boss battles are good.  In the first game you likely left detective mode turned on the whole game, in this game they made detective mode worse, encouraging you to turn it off.			"

												A slightly sequel to previous Batman's game ""Batman: Arkham Asylum"". Only in this game you get to play in a lot bigger area and with wider story, more to explore and more characters to discover. As previous game, it's done by Rocksteady, applying the same formula. Basically it's improved Batman: Arkham Asylum. Everything you got from Arkham Asylum is find here, only more. More villains, more missions, bigger story, more playable characters (as Catwoman, Robin) and more glitches (or bugs). But in this game those bugs will make you laugh more that be angry. I was able to see during a combat a henchman flying to the skys. Also challenges are more, but that is a minus. If you are aiming for 100% achievements, you have to do maps over and over and over and over again. And controls aren't places very well. I tried to play with a keyboard and with a controller, but I offen found Batman doing something I didn't told him to do ( like instead of running away, he took cover right next to enemy and got filled with bullets) And during a combat, Batman will attack to his desired enemy. But few bugs there and there doesn't make this game worse, it's forgivable since the story is very wide and there is a lot to discover.			"

												Personal Rating: 7 of 10If you haven't played Arkham Asylum, I highly recommend you to tackle that first as this is a direct sequel to the game. Arkham City gameplay is very similar to Arkham Asylum. You get to access to a part Gotham City infested with bad guys but unfortunately no vehicle. There are several buildings that are interactable and missions mostly take part in them.The City is very well design and the dark gloomy environment really set the mood. Also, do expect top notch voice actors (do a little digging and you might be surprised) like Arkham Asylum but personally, I prefer the voice actor for Batman in Asylum. It just feels like the actor for City is much subtle.Story is linear with a little bit of plot but don't really raise my eyebrow. Again, I would prefer Asylum over this on the aspect. There are much more bosses in this game but they don't gel together for me. Its like too much cook spoils the broth. Some of the villians sits entirely out from the main story line and to get to them you need to perform the same mission over and over again. Boss fights are not as satisfying as Asylum. Most of them are timing and button mashing.Level design in my opinion are not as creative as Asylum. Most of the time is jump into fight, clear them and move on. Certain places allows you to take the sneaky way but approach method are not that many. I mean I am Batman, I don't want to hang around some ledge of scurry around some corners to catch someone unexpected. I want something like swoop down or left to take someone off.There are some new gadgets, puzzles, enemies and other combat features but after these has been introduced, you will be using it again and again and again.Maybe because of the quest, huge city and repetitiveness, it makes me feel like I am Gotham's slave rather den its knight. Game works really well without any problems for me. Clearly, the designer really stick to the idea of not fixing what is not broken but I really think this could have been better. Overall, this game had much more feature than its predecessor but can be a little frustrating and repetitive at times but being a Batman or even a third person action game person, this title can definitely provide good fun.

												Great game, well worth the price for the hours of entertainment you will get out of it. The crazy number of Riddler challenges seems daunting at first but it was actually quite fun colecting them all and the H2H combat is much improved over Batman:AA. When this game was announced I wondered how could they improve on such an epic game, I was not dissapointed. Pays good lip service to the comics and contains the best voice over cast ever to do the Batman franchise, Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil in my mind are the best Batman and Joker combination ever concieved and they both delievered yet again. The gadgetry is well thought out and a nice improvement over Batman:AA The catwoman gameplay felt a little tacked on, especially the bonus missions, it just felt like they couldn't think of anything else to do with her. The revenge of Harley was actually a nice DLC add on that was a pretty good couple of hours, well worth the original price, and gives you a nice hands on with Robin. Robin definitely feels inferior to Batman in H2H which just adds to the greatness of Batman himself. Graphically the game is real nice running on the newet iteration of the unreal engine but nothing really ground breaking. Does the job and no real complaints, I just wish they would ditch Phys-X for something else. Sound wise the game is absolutely great, the atmosphere is fantastic and the sound track is fitting as always. Rocksteady has made a real masterpiece here and it is a great shame they have been denied the opportunity to do another sequel. I have played through both Batman AA and AC multiple times and enjoyed every moment of every play through.			"

												Rating: 9.5/10What is it?Third Person Action Adventure The Good:+The most important part of a Batman game is the 'feeling' of Batman. The way he moves, controls, gadgets and game play all facilitate towards that goal making you feel like you are in complete control of your surroundings. +The combat is fun and challenging requiring timing and precision to master. +Stealth is excellent, finding the right balance between fun and realism. The AI isn't so brain dead that you can kill them with ease nor are they super realistic that they will spot you a mile away.  +Solid sense of progression and upgrades. Gaining experience unlocks more powerful combat moves and gadgets. + Open World is detailed with lots of collectables and side quests.+ One of the few games that does collectables right. Some of the collectables are easy to get while other require a bit of thinking. The game also provides a way of unlocking collectables on the mini map so you don't need to use a guide to collect them all. Collecting riddler trophies unlocks new concept art, predator maps and helps you finish the riddler's side quest.  + Fantastic boss fights + Great cast of characters + Predator maps and combat maps further the replay value giving you extra challenges. You can play as Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing+ Great voice acting and sound + Game is gorgeous. + New Game Plus- Upgrades carry over. The Bad:- Some plot holes in the main story-Getting all the achievements will take a lot of work. Nitpicky issue, but going through all the maps with each of the four characters is exhausting. ConclusionThis is one of the best Batman games, this is one of the best action adventure games. You can tell Rocksteady put a lot of blood sweat and tears into this game to make it the best it can possibly be. The game is extremely polished and a joy to play with insane value. No matter what price you buy this game you will get your money's worth .  "

I picked this up on sale for 5 dollars for an amazing game. Wouldve payed full price for this. Only thing I didn't like that much was Penguin's involvement in the story. I wanted more joker, as Mark Hamill did a fantastic job. I know Im a little late for this game, but if you havent already, you should definetly pick this game up!

												Pros:    + Very large open world    + Great character dialogue    + Gadgets    + Decent enemies    + You're freaking BATMANCons:    - Fighting gets monotonous  Review     Batman: Arkham City - GOTY is a third-person superhero game with a large open world. Of course, you mainly play as Batman, although there are several scenes with Catwoman that were not included in the original console version.   Batman was placed in the city that is filled with tons of bad guys and he has to escape by defeating the bosses that include, of course The Joker. It is the second installment in the Batman Arkham series. I think that It's the best one in the series and strongly recommend it. Wait for a sale though because 20 bucks is a lot to pay for a six year old game.This game was curated and reviewed for PC Beta gaming, if you would like to follow, the link is here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG "

												Overall: 9/10Concept: 10/10Play as Batman and occasionally as Catwoman. Robin and Nightwing are available in DLC challenge maps. Explore, fight, and solve crime in 3rd person throughout Gotham. Has a solid story and even more solid combat system, aside from the occasional glitch.Graphics: 10/10I would say that for its time, Batman: Arkham City has top of the line graphics. The Batman character model is well done, coupled with the environment, this leads to some impressive views when sitting atop a roof or overhang. The game is well optimized too. With graphics on highest settings I never dropped below 60fps. Sound: 9/10The voice acting is very well done, significantly enhancing the experience. Most sound effects and background noise are spot on as well. What really bothered me in this category however, was that the simple thugs you're fighting 80% time, had really redundant dialogue that grated on my nerves after 20+ hours of game play. Playability: 9/10Most of the time this game ran very smoothly. I commend how well combat flows, not to mention the fun variety of side missions and overall story. However I did often find myself ""cheated"" in combat, with enemies sliding ridiculous distances to score a punch outside of my peripheral vision. The combat system is easy to learn, hard to master, allowing you to jump right in, but still enjoy the combat hours later as you learn to incorporate new abilities into your fighting style.Entertainment: 10/10I really enjoyed this game. The story kept me involved, and the side missions were interesting enough to give a breath of fresh air. With the quality voice acting and graphics, it's almost like watching a movie. The combat is satisfying, and entertaining. The freedom of movement throughout the city is great too, grappling, gliding, sliding, sneaking, and running between and to your foes.Replay: 6/10Although new game plus is implemented, allowing you to go through the game again with your upgrades and skills unlocked, there's not much more to be gained entertainment-wise. The story-line and game play albeit being very fun, have no real deviation from the first time through. There are a plethora of DLC additions and challenge maps adding many hours of additional game play, but I've found these to be extremely tedious after the first few hours. (If you're looking to 100% this game expect to spend close to 60 hours repeating dozens of challenge maps over and over with every character,)  "

The gameplay we've come to know and love from the Arkham series has been refined and refurbished, boss fights are more varied and combat was much improved, there are so many ways to knock people down, using hand to hand combat, gadgets or just take them down in stealth... The story and side missions will take a while to finish. Batman: Arkham City is an amazing game that ranks as one of the top games this generation.

												Great game overall. The map is bigger than Arkham Asylum, achievements and easter eggs are a bit harder to find and puzzle seem harder to solve which adds to the 100% completion time of this game. Combat is more swift than AA, even though it's a bit difficult on certain levels, it's better because of the variety of enemies and situations you face which adds to the whole feel of the game. Certainly not a waste of money, considering I got the GOTY edition for only $7.49. You'll know why this game has been awarded the game of the year when you play it.			"

												Best. Game. Ever.I will go over 5 topics in this review.Story, Gameplay, Graphics, Sound and Replay ValueFirst off The Story.It is around 12-15 hours all-up storywise and it is truely gripping and a great premise. Without spoiling anything, The game is set a couple of years after Arkham Asylum, and the newly appointed mayor Quincy Sharp Ex Warden of old Arkham Asylum has created a super prison dubbed ARKHAM CITY, Sure just throw all the bad guys in one place and throw away the key, Like thats gonna work!It's up to Batman to sort all this out, by punching every Super-Villan in the face!The Character list in the main game, not to mention the side missions is huge, more than I can say but from the trailers of course you have Hugo Strange, The Joker, Two-Face, Catwoman, The Riddler, EVEN Solomon Grundy is here, if you like the comics you will love the detail the devs have put into this game.Next Gameplay, what good is an amazing story without gameplay?You for the most part of the game play as BATMAN, the worlds greatest Crimefighter and Detective, Both of which are put to work as you Grappel around the place, glide, Throw Batman's Signature Batarangs and fire his disarming Bat-Claw, and of course the magnificent FreeFlow combat from the previous game upscaled and infused with more awesome. Double Takedowns, Counters (Or more if those thugs dare hitting you at the same time!) The combat is improved dramatically and encouraging more use of using your gadgets more than ever during your combat and it really pays to do so!Graphics: I am not one to judge a game by its Graphics usually... But this game, is really pretty! So much detail in the enviroments you fly around in and well rendered character models all make this game truely immersive!Sound:The games sound is standout both in its strong epic soundtrack and the Excellent voice acting brought to us again in both Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil repectively as Batman and The Joker, and the countless other characters from supporting characters like Alfred and Oracle to the complaining of the thugs you encounter on the street as Batman, this level of Voice Acting really makes the experience come alive.Replay Value:In addition to the main story you have a bunch of side quests, which are varied and interesting to play through and give Batman more time to show off his Detective Skills.The Riddler is the largest side mission, he has hidden large amounts of riddler trophies and created riddles all over Arkham City for Batman to collect and solve, and you won't turn a blind eye to this if you did in the previous game, the Riddler has hostages who he will kill if Batman doesn't solve enough of his riddles before the night is over. Also completing the Riddlers Challenges unlock Concept art and 3-D Character trophies for you to look at in the main menu which is sweet if you are into that!Aside from the many side quests there is a seperate gamemode called New Game Plus unlocked after you complete the game on Normal/Hard, which allows you to play the story again, With all of your upgrades! The Catch? No Counter icons in combat, and pretty much everything about the gameplay has gotten four times as hard. (Good Luck Beating Two-Face as Catwoman :P)Once you have done all of this to keep you entertained there is a mode called ""Riddlers Revenge"" a bunch of small levels usually of either Plain Combat or Predator rooms each of which you have to complete objectives for to get a High Score on that Leaderboard!

												Before I start this review, I would like to note that I REALLY reccomend this game. I got it last week and I have about 24 hours in it already. One of the best games I have played by far. Onto the review!  Batman: Arkham City is a 3rd Person Beat 'em Up game. Of course, there are more aspects to this game as well, such as the stealth, and the detective work. When you start out this game, you are shoved into Arkham City, a walled-off section of Gotham City that houses all of Gotham's dangerous criminals. The person behind this ""Arkham City"", Hugo Strange, has a plan labelled ""Protocol 10"", which Batman seems to be very suspicious of, and for good reason. Now, enough story, how does this game play? Well, first off, there is no jump button, something that I am used to, as I have played many tLoZ games, but that's not what we're talking about. Instead, there's a ""run"" button, which is space. You can run off of buildings and ledges and the game will make you jump then. That is the most obvious difference from other 3rd person games. Getting around Arkham City is quite easy, as you can grapple to far away buildings and ledges, and you can upgrade this ablility so that it allows you to get launched quite a ways from where you intended to grapple. The combat system is AMAZING, you could jump into a group of enemies, and take them all out because of how it works. It's really only a 2 button system, with the attack and counter button, but it works so well! I could keep going on and on about the positives of this game, but it'd be pointless. It took me about 10 hours to get through the main campaign on normal mode, and I'm replaying it on the hardest difficulty. There are sidequests and end-game DLC to keep you playing after the main campaign, and there are challenges you could do, such as taking out a group of enemies using stealth, or just jumping in and beating them up, there's so much to do. My only complaint is that there are waaaaay too many Riddler Trophies to get, and 100%-ing the game will take much more time. But that is just one complaint in a game full of positives, so I give this game a 9.5/10.			"

												The true and honourable successor to the original title: Arkham Asylum!This games brings everythings good to table from the previous game and adds even more awesome content! Fast paced and dynamic combat that no matter how many times you play through, you won't get enough of it. It somehow manages to build on previous game, that brought a lot of expectations, by adding the open world exeperience, more notorious villains and and a movie like experience that you won't forget.Truly a wonderful and mesmerising game, that I would reccommend to anybody, no matter what your favourite genre of video games is! A master piece, 10/10 from me.PS: Not to mention that you get a chance to play as a catwoman!PS2: I have finished this game 3 times, and I would do it again!			"

												Batman Arkham City- Game of the Year EditionNot as atmospheric as Arkham AsylumDon't be irritated by the 3 hours. I played it at least two times when it came out. In the following text, I'll be comparing it to Arkham Asylum a lot, so excuse me, if you haven't played it yet.First thing that got me when I started Arkham City were the graphics, definitely better than those in Arkham Asylum. And also the nice cutscene right at the beginning. Then I started playing it. It was and still is the exact same game, according to the gameplay. Only the story and setting are different, alas both above average. I enjoyed playing both, as I have loved Batman ever since I was a small kid. But I liked Arkham Asylum a lot more. It had this dark, gritty tone which Arkham City lacks most of the time. And it also had these crazy hallucinatory Scarecrow- missions. Ah, and also highly memorable, the moment when you thought the game had broken. To me, Arkham Asylum will always be the definitive Batman game. It may not have a world as open as in Arkham City, it may not be as long, but it is atmospheric as f**k.Still, I give Arkham City8/10enjoy it			"

The graphics, story, and voice acting are again top quality. More to explore, more villains to battle, more detective work, more stealth and combat upgrades, more Batman.

												Yes, it is Arkham: Asylum perfected in an open world environment. I’d even argue that this might be the pinnacle of the series with their tweaks to combat and use of gadgets. They did a tremendous job of hearing out their core audience, and did their best to gather up a bigger cast of characters, made hand-to-hand combat more challenging not in terms of more button mashing but actual strategy, and created grandiose environments that made for both stellar level design and screen captures (seriously - it was a beautiful game for its time).  The story itself is much more dimensional than its predecessor. However, as expected with such a large supporting cast, your favourite villians might not get as much screen time as you’d like them to. Well, except for Joker and Harley - they’re in it almost all the way through. It was neat to see them there, but there were points in the narrative where they definitely felt shoe-horned. However, this was largely overshadowed by the Series’ best boss battles yet. I will write that while I’m sure you’re only going to be looking at this when the next sale for this rolls around, do not go for the DLC. It’s a 30 minute quest that just feels like total and absolute filler. It adds almost nothing to the story, and truly feels like cut content pre-packaged for release later on. You’ll be happy enough with the 10+ hour story you have ahead of you. It’s pretty coherent on the whole, but the act structure is a bit of a dragged out middle game only to have your eyes glued to the screen for the last 2-3 hours. After you beat it, you unlock a NG+ mode where you’re just collecting upgrades and you have all of your gadgets at the start so it’s easier to collect items you’d have trouble getting at the start of your first playthrough. It was a nice thought, but it’s one of those once-was-enough kind of games to me. And that really comes down to mediocre writing and the repetitive style of combat. Gameplay-wise, you’ll be happy to know that they gave you more buttons and combos to stress on your controller (the preferred method of playing the series). There are a lot of filler sidequests that you might end up doing just for the sake of upgrading Batman. I don’t blame you, but the kind of quests they ask you to do really take you away from the story and offer little in return. That’s great for fans of the world, but not entirely necessary for people that just want to play it for its best parts and move on. Aside from its unlocks, the rest of the stuff they offer in return is pretty minimal - unless you care about character bios and concept art that’s not flatout presented in the narrative. It just depends on how big of a fan you are. You’ll also notice some significant upgrades in the graphics. That I can’t stress enough - right down to the game’s core meme of cape physics. You’ll find yourself twirling around simply for the hell of it. The open world environment is also nice when you’re being pulled to certain locations in the main story, but it was just so bleak and I was given little reason to explore its entirety. I would have liked for the narrative to take me deeper into the lore of Arkham city or try to somehow make me care about why the world is the way it is.The music was your typical omniscient superhero themes - its mood borders on consistently dreary, but it won’t hurt your ears. It just felt very generic. Same for the sound effects - they didn’t add much to the mood that the visuals weren’t already giving off. TL;DR: This was a just sequel to an already-phenomenal game, and should easily satisfy addicts of the Batman universe and quality action games for at least ten hours.			"

												Loved playing this game. The combination of open ended content along with story line was great. If I had any gripe it's that some of the combo moves are more difficult on the PC with the use of keys but there are so many extremely good things about this game it pales. The game play is so intense I actually had minor vertigo when climbing up high in one of the scenes!The main story line is long enough to seem like an actual full story but short enough that I managed to complete it & I'm often lead off course by side missions & rarely complete the main story 1st so the fact I finished it should say something.Yet, I'm still playing the game regularly afterwards which should say more.  Between the combat & the predator modes there's literally 2 different play styles you can either ""snipe"" or 'button mash' and progress either way.Definitely an awesome game and I mean come on you can even dress as 70's Batman!

												This game... oh this game... This is the perfect mixture of old batman comics, the batman cartoon-series and the new Christopher Nolan-batman. You start of as mr Wayne, thrown into ""Arkham City"", a city at the edge of Gotham, a city with walls around it, a city just for criminals. Why did you get thrown in? Play and find out. I'm not gonna give too much of the story away.Anyway, all your favorite villains are here! Two-face, Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy and of course, the joker! These are just a few of the villains. Me, I'm a sucker for the ""loonies"" so I was so happy when I noticed that both ""the Joker"" and ""The riddler"" were in the same game! This is the ultimate batmangame!But frankly, not everything in this game is great. Some of the puzzles are easy, most of the battles are rather easy once you get the hang of it, and the ending is a disappointment. This are just a few flaws tho, the game in it's entirety is brilliant.I would go as far as to say, this is the best licencegame since... yeah, I'm gonna say it, ""The return of the king"" (Lord of the rings)Verdict+Amazing graphics+So many cool villains+Open world+Really nice voiceacting-Rather short-Really varied when it comes to difficulty -The ending8/10Get this game!

												The true and honourable successor to the original title: Arkham Asylum!This games brings everythings good to table from the previous game and adds even more awesome content! Fast paced and dynamic combat that no matter how many times you play through, you won't get enough of it. It somehow manages to build on previous game, that brought a lot of expectations, by adding the open world exeperience, more notorious villains and and a movie like experience that you won't forget.Truly a wonderful and mesmerising game, that I would reccommend to anybody, no matter what your favourite genre of video games is! A master piece, 10/10 from me.PS: Not to mention that you get a chance to play as a catwoman!PS2: I have finished this game 3 times, and I would do it again!			"

												Not much to say except for: Amazing story with a great twist. Level design and graphics with love to detail - even on such a large scale. Great gameplay with lots of freedom in an Open World environment. Played over 300h, didn't encounter a single bug! Only small downturn: Except for 2, most of the side quests weren't up to much. Extra content is great, though. Fair price for the quality of the game; worthy ""AAA""-game. A real downer is changing the audio language settings: The reason might be due to some payment issues of foreign language voice actors, but you basically need to change 3 configuration files in order to set the spoken language.If you liked Assassin's Creed, you'll love it. Even though, I am not a fan of US-Superheroes, the game is captivating and is among my Top 5 games of all time.Edit: After playing all 4 Arkham games, this is still the best to me!My personal order 1, AC 2, AK 3, AA 4, AO.

												Batman Arkham City- Game of the Year EditionNot as atmospheric as Arkham AsylumDon't be irritated by the 3 hours. I played it at least two times when it came out. In the following text, I'll be comparing it to Arkham Asylum a lot, so excuse me, if you haven't played it yet.First thing that got me when I started Arkham City were the graphics, definitely better than those in Arkham Asylum. And also the nice cutscene right at the beginning. Then I started playing it. It was and still is the exact same game, according to the gameplay. Only the story and setting are different, alas both above average. I enjoyed playing both, as I have loved Batman ever since I was a small kid. But I liked Arkham Asylum a lot more. It had this dark, gritty tone which Arkham City lacks most of the time. And it also had these crazy hallucinatory Scarecrow- missions. Ah, and also highly memorable, the moment when you thought the game had broken. To me, Arkham Asylum will always be the definitive Batman game. It may not have a world as open as in Arkham City, it may not be as long, but it is atmospheric as f**k.Still, I give Arkham City8/10enjoy it			"

												Worth its glorious reputation in every regard. The game has great voice acting, a well-written story (looks like the movies but plays like a 15-hour episode of the '90s animated series), fun combat, tons of stuff to do, and plenty of gadgets to play with. It doesn't quite reach the atmosphere of Arkham Asylum (which benefits from having a more compact setting), but otherwise it's an improvement over its predecessor.			"

												One would think it is impossible for any sequel to be as good as Batman: Arkham Asylum. However, Arkham City lives up to the standard.

												If you liked his previous episode, this will make you enjoy even more the Arkham series.It's a little repetitive, since to procede in the game you always have to kick someone. So after a while it might look repetitive, if you played it many times (like me) to get all the secrets and trophies.About those, they will challenge you and make the game more full of contents.The game is also full of easter-eggs and references from Batman comics, for a big fan this game is going to be GREAT!10/10			"

												Where do I start? This is probably one of the best games ever made. It's a true gem that has little to no flaws whatsoever. The graphics are superb, the story is great, the voice acting is amazing, the gameplay is a spot on. In short, it's a true joy to play.The game revolves around a small section of Gotham City, known now as ""Arkham City"", where gangs and thugs seem to have free-run of there own little slice of Gotham. It allows much greater freedom than Arkham Asylum did - and is all the better for it. You start with all the abilities and gadgets that you picked up in the previous game, and unlock a ton more too. As such, it may have a steep learning curve for people that did not play the previous game, but once you get into it, it's fluid, responsive and great fun.Upgrades to your Batsuit and character(s) abilities are bought with XP, that is earned fighting thugs - and you are rewarded for slick moves, long combos and variety. You can also quick-fire gadgets during combat, adding another really cool addition to the game.If you are still not sure about this one, ask yourself the following questions (2 points for yes, 1 for no - and add up your score to determine if you should buy the game).1. Do you like Batman?2. Do you like games?3. Do you like gadgets?4. Are you still reading this?5. Just go and buy it. You will not regret it, will you?Score <= 5 : Buy itScore >= 6 : Buy itScore >= 8 : Buy itScore >= 10 : Buy itJimbo Rating: 10/10			"

												I'll start of by saying this game had the best superhero campaign I have ever played. This is the only game in which I did not skip any cutscenes and enjoyed all of them; the script was written so excellent that you feel like they are truly talking to you. Like how Joker tries to talk to you and makes you oblivious to the tricks he has up his sleeves, or someone like Two-Face who just yells at his henchmen to blow you to bits! The gameplay is flawless and smooth without any hiccups, and it's also easy to learn for anyone new to the game. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who likes to play video games, because not only is this a game for comic book fans but it's an game for every gamer out there. 10/10.			"

As cons, I would have liked the city to be bigger and the game to have some events like Crime alerts from Arkham Origins.

												First of all I want to say that Batman Arkham City is the best open world game ever made(honestly it falls on top 3 as others may like different games)I have only 60+ hours on Steam version of this game, before I bought a gaming PC I used to play this game on a cloud gaming service called Onlive, and there I have 250+ hours on this game. Played this game so much because I really like this game. The Arkham City Story is very interesting, the characters was played by a great cast with very good voice acting. As you progress you unlock upgrades for Batman, The side missions are amazing. The Mystery Watcher, Character Hush....Riddler Trophies are an interesting part of this game. Some of them require some thinking, I collected all 440 trophies. The best part about this game I like is the combat and beating up thugs. The challenge maps are so fun. The most 2 fun challenge maps are Iceberg Lounge and Joker's Funhouse. Iceberg Lounge has unlimited wave of enemies that you could fight as long as you survive. I once got a 1157 combo in that map.And Joker's Funhouse is also another fun map that makes you keep on playing on you start learning not to get hit and how to keep on going.I totally recommend this game, it has great graphics, very well optimized. Totally worth every dollar and penny you spend on it.			"

												Batman Arkham City is a fun game. It has an excellent story, and at the time of the first games release, a revolutionary fighting style. While it may be played out and stolen by now, it is still great to see the game that first created it, and how well they were using it. The plot of the story, while I will not give more away than the beginning, leads off of the first game:  Batman is kidnapped as Bruce Wayne by Hugo Strange, and thrown into a maximum security prison/city called Arkham City. Soon after arriving, he finds out that the Joker is sick, and after some shenanigans by the clown, he is made sick as well, leading him to have to find Mr. Freeze and get a cure. The game is surprisingly difficult, and has a strong sense of stealth, especially in the Predator missions, where you have to take out a room full of armed gunmen, who are incredibly dangerous to you. You can use a large array of high tech tools; Smoke bombs, batarangs, and grappling hooks being some of the simplest, to defeat them without dying. My favourite part, however, is the Riddler. He sets up a whole bunch of puzzles for you to find and solve, giving you missions to play outside of the main game, as well as concept art and character trophies. It is a very fun game, and earns a excellent score of 8/10			"

												Truly enjoyed this game. I've just finished the story game and unlocked the re-play with all gadgets mode but will try to solve all the first round puzzles and do the missions. It's an epic game and I say this never having played any other Batman game although I hear that Arkham Aslyum is awesome as well. If you've never played or owned a Batman game, then this could be the one to get. GOTY edition has a lot to offer and it has all the characters good and bad that make Batman an awesome game.			"

 Batman Arkham City GOTY review Batman Arkham City is another great game from Rocksteady studios. While they weren't able to recapture the atmosphere of loneliness, depression and madness of the asylum, it is still a very captivating experience. Combat The combat was improved, making the stun less useless and the special finish moves less useless. New enemy types are also a thing in this game, you have your standard henchmen, henchmen armed with guns, knives, stunsticks, henchmen carrying shields and MOTHERF*CKING NINJAS.The game now has an open world, it is now set in the northen part of Gotham that has been sealed off. Story The story is great but feels very short, and even though there are side mission you can do after finishing the main story, they just feel like the devs were lazy and just plopped these in to extend the playtime.The Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC is welcome addition to the story albeit a bit short. It nicely depicts the characters and the change they went through after Joker's death. DLC As stated before, Harley Quinn's Revenge is a great addition to the main storyline, however the rest of the extra content is forgettable at best. Same goes for the challenge maps (I didn't want to make another section for that :P), the over-abundance of them makes them feel very cheap and uninteresting (I personally haven't actually bothered to play most of the maps in City or even Origins).Overall, Arkham City is a great experience and a (weaker) followup to Arkham Asylum and I strongly recommend playing the games in chronological order as it helps to understand the story.

												Awesome game. Truly one of the greatest.The controls are sharp even though you still cannot adjust the mouse sensitivity as I hoped but the camera speed is fast enough. There is still some sloppiness and slight delay when it comes to moving around. For instance just like in the first game, there are preset points where your grappling hook works - you can't pick your spots. Initially, there are too many HUD oriented hints, and even though you can turn off some, you cannot turn them all off. The game itself doesn't have that much hud especially in-doors which is a good thing in my opinion because it helps the immersion.The city map is small. REALLY small by today's standards at least. It's at best 30 square blocks. But the good thing is that eventually you get access to restricted areas such as houses, mansions, sewers, etc. So you will be doing a lot of backtracking just like in the first game, only this time, you have an open map and not a series of large closed off areas to navigate in. Plus there is always something happening in the city and you will see the city change as you play. Barely anything is static.The gameplay (battle-wise). I feel like it changed slightly for worst in some areas. The first game would literally force you to watch your enemies and anticipate their movies so you could counter-attack. This time it's different. This time you will see several lightening bolts flash above enemies that are about to attack you. This warning throws me off because it decreases the challenge and realism. However, if you want to play the second time on hardest mode then these warnings disappear which is neat. On the other hand, the fighting is at the same time easier than in the first game because you can actually counter-several enemies who are about to punch you at the same time - something you couldn't do in the first game.More so, what's tedious is that this time you will be battling sometimes about a dozen of enemies at a time. You will rarely be able to finish off your enemies while they are on the ground because you will be overwhelmed for the most part. While playing the PS3 version, my thumb frequently got tired at the time of battling. But that problem when away because of simply mouse clicks which do not require as much energy as tapping a button, evidently. So I actually did not die as many times as I did while playing the PS3 version.Also, this time if you want to counter-attack CONSTANTLY and never get hit (Except for when they try to throw a trash can at you) is to simply tap right the right mouse button (NO TIMING REQUIRED this time). In the first game if you pressed the counter-attack button a lot earlier before the preceding attack, then you would get hit, even IF you pressed the same button right after. The first game really forced you to monitor your enemies closely and work out the algorithm of the fight you were in. But at least now you can counter-attack two enemies attacking you at the same time.But eventually you get introduced to bigger and badder high-tech enemies that force you to employ different tactics (reminiscent of the last splinter cell game).Another minus is that there is no blood in the game, again. (but yes I know that this is Batman Universe, the villains never die, they simply escape over and over and over again....)Also, those annoying unrealistic bats that fly around you are still there. There's still no way to turn them off.Also, this time around, there are even more unlockables to unlock. There are still Joker teeth, but now there are Penguin's penguin dolls, air balloons and other miscellaneous interactive items that need to be destroyed upon sight.The story is engaging and ties itself well with the first game somewhat. Some villains as well as their demise gets mentioned so it's kind of cool to wonder what happened. The boss fights are okaish but the one that I didn't like was with that immortal dude. I mean the whole stage with him and the subsequent fight was just an excuse for Batman to fight some more (even though he was dreaming). Same applies tot he Mad Hatter stage of the game, it's just more fighting, albeit it is disturbing fighting. I think they could use more creativity with these stages. One of the best boss fights without a doubt is with Mr. Freeze, it can last for up to 20 minutes and you do have to use your brains. Sadly, that was the most developed boss battle in the entire game.Also, barely ANY dialogue gets repeated, ever, except for sometimes. I'm surprised how much effort went into dialogue here, it's like watching a movie, a good Batman movie that is, ahem ahem.The loading screen sometimes takes 11 seconds.I also appreciate the remix of the Hans Zimmer soundtracks from the last two Batman movies. Nice touch. There's some inception there too.The bosses and the characters are all so versatile and flamboyant. You get fully immersed in their personalities and you don't really want the villains dead you may want them hurt but you don't want them GONE because then you know that the fun is over. So the game makes you care even about the villains because aside from Batman that's what the Batman Universe if famous for. However, you do not really get to see too much of the villains. You only see the Two-Face a couple of times and you do not even see Killer Croc.The amount of the Riddler riddles and tricks is insane. I'm not sure if that many were needed. I mean, they are supposed to be concealed better; they are supposed to take time to find and unlock like in the first game. Here you get a large portion of them practically for free, but as you progress you realize that Batman has a whopping 400 riddler secrets to unlock and the cat woman has 100. A small portion of them (like 5-10%) is extremely hard to solve, some require blind luck which is annoying.The game is extremely well refined. Ever step and area is thought out, every engagement can still be approached differently so the gameplay will never get you bored. The artistic value of this game cannot be understated. The gangs and the bandits all have different allegiances to different villains, so it is a nice touch to see that not all villains team up with each other, they all have different missions and ideologies.The amount of upgrades here is about 3-4 times than the amount in the first game and you retain most if not all of your abilities from the first game.One of the downsides of this game being an open-worlded game is that quite often you will lose your sense of direction. You might weight out your priorities as to where it is you want to go. There's main mission and there are side missions and there are Riddler missions and there are miscellaneous missions. You might go into one direction only to realize that it's best if you went another direction. The first game didn't have that problem if you can call it that. Still, the world is not too big for you to get lost and it is not too small to be called a sand-box.One of the downsides of the PS3 version was slow texture loading. I haven't experienced anything like that on PC. AND, the loading time between deaths is about twice as short as on the PS3, go figure.Lastly, it's the same unreal engine from the last game; the water looks slightly better rendered on the PC, but it is not that great looking either.

												This game is beyond reproach. Everything from the opening minutes of the cutscenes to the final minutes of the soundtrack are perfectly polished. Every punch and kick thrown in combat is choreographed flawlessly and the sounds and sights of Arkham City create an impressive world for Batman to survey and protect from itself. The story takes so many twists and turns and even if you think you'll know who the next villain is going to be, you're going to have no idea what you're getting yourself into. Batman's got to use every tool at his disposal not just to survive, but to learn the secrets of Arkham City and stop the dangerous path that awaits Gotham's mega-prison on this fateful night.You can look at other reviews, they'll describe technically better what you can expect out of this game. But if you really think you're up for the challenge of being Batman during one of his darkest nights, fighting one of his most climactic fights, pick up this game now. It's time to don the cowl, for better or worse.			"

												A more open version of Batman Arkham Asylum. The only thing i would have to complain about the Arkham series is sometimes it's always the same terrain but it's not that bad because the enemies change. Use Batman and Catwoman to play through this epic amazing story with all your favourite Batman enemies. When u finish the game you can play challenges with Batman, Catwoman, Robin or Night Wing. Amazing Storyline and the best super hero game and my personal favourite super hero. This set the benchmark of how to make a good super hero game. One of the games where the sequel is betterthan the original.I""M BATMAN 9/10			"

												Notice: over 12,000 positive reviews and 430 negative ones. The negative ones obviously are complaints that their PC can't handle the graphics.....or they're stuck in some part of the game and so it's the game's fault. I think this is the best of the Arkham games. I've played 3.There have been numerous times I thought I wouldn't figure out parts of this game, It's one challenge after another. That's why it's the best.I played a lot of the game on console back when it came out. I think I gave up somewhere in the riddler part. That, to me, is the most frustrating part.It isn't an easy game. But, there's so much to do, that it's worth every penny and all the frustration.I'm finisahing this game this time around. Also, I wannna meet the girl they used to model catwoman. Sheeesh. That's one hot looking character.Does anyone know why credits roll at 35%? Is it just that that part of the Joker story  as written and designed separately?Doesn't matter. Once you beat the Joker at 35%, you get the downloadable batsuits to play the rest.And there's A LOT more.All the best villians make an appearance. A few for just a few minutes.I haven't finished this game ever. So, I hear someone in game say ""there's two Jokers? ""Does that mean anything? I don't know yet. I'm busy trying to find Mr. Freeze's wife.....while trying to solve several murders and riddles galore.Totally addictive game......even the 2nd time around. I'm finding new stories and characters at every turn. Who is the mysterious figure watching Batman's every move?I saw Robin for a minute. Is he coming back? Is the mysterious figure Nightwing?Have fun with this one. Of the 4 Arkham games, this one is , by far, the best.			"

The game is simply amazing and a top game in my lists of games to play. This is a solid 10/10. Story is wonderful/ Voice Acting is top of the line.

												While the first entry shows how a Batman video game should be made, the second one takes you to a new level. Well let me break down some details for you.a.StoryThe story of Batman has never been this frustrating. On the first series, Batman has been made confused by the infamous evil Joker's plan. Doctor Hugo Strange, Ra's al Ghul, and once again, Joker, put him on hard times even more than ever where he has to put down the chaos made in Arkham City in. Very interesting and engaging.b.GameplayWe know that Batman, among the Justice League, is the weakest. But, in the game he actually a badass. The free flow combat system makes him really strong and gives an awesome feeling when you hit the last enemy within a combo chain. You can also access many gadgets the dark knight can offer. Fantasy of being the bat came true.c.GraphicsI really like look of the game. The aura of Arkham City nightmare is felt really well. Atmosphere of injustice brings down upon the chaotic city of Arkham. What I like the most is that it can run on my computer very well with almost no performance issues.d.ReplayabilityIt is always good to back as ""The Dark Knight"". You can choose different customisation (character upgrade) from previous playthrough and try to play the hardest difficulty. Well, if you don't fancy yourself challenge modes, have yourself a new game plus.VerdictIt is the best Batman game, beating bad guys on the streets in the most dangerous area out there in the world to bring justice is very noble.Verdict9.0			"

												(CONTAINS WHAT SOME MAY CONSIDER AS SPOILERS. HOWEVER NONE OF THESE ""SPOILERS"" ARE STORY-RELATED)Seeing as I just passed the 100 hour mark, I feel obligated to write a review. I always thought Batman was cool but I never really knew much about him. I never read the comics (it isn't such a big thing in my country, unlike in the US) and I haven't even watched all the movies about him. But these games...BUY THESE GAMES!!There isn't a single bad thing I can say about this game! I love every minute of it and I have played it a lot.It gives you a bigger playground than the last game and faster ways to make your way around it. Also there's a second playable character, a feline femme fatale who makes for a nice change every once in a while. With her unique skills, she can get to Riddler Trophies that Batman can't collect or can't reach.There are tons of Riddler Challenges to complete and find all over the world and I really love the fact that you can find them all without using a guide. These challenges unlock extras like character biographies, villain interview tapes, artwork and much more!! They really made me interested in everything about Batman. The stories or mysteries of how most villains came to be what they are, the reasons they have for hating Batman or Bruce Wayne, their twisted minds and extreme personalities, ... I LOVE IT!The combat in the Arkham games is what makes you feel so powerful! The satisfaction you get by taking out a whole group of thugs without getting hit, makes you feel like a complete BADASS! In this game the combat is even more fluent and seamless than the first. You can now use more different gadgets and use multi-counters (countering multiple enemies who attack at the same time) to dispatch of thugs. This gives you even more opportunities to make it through fights with dozens of thugs without getting hit.There's also the complete opposite of that when you're taking out a whole group of thugs one by one, using stealth and gadgets. The choice is yours, both give you satisfaction.And of course, by fighting and solving riddler challenges, you level up and can choose many upgrades. Almost all of them are necessary, especially when you're playing it on Hard or New Game+ difficulty. These difficulties also make you utilize the stealth-opportunities more, because a large group of thugs can be quite dangerous then.There are also many cool (and unexpected) boss fights and this game also has moments that take you to other ""places"" than Arkham City. The first time I played this game, it kept blowing me away. Now that I think about it, they've really done a fine job keeping the environment interesting. It can't have been easy if the main colors of your game are black and grey.The DLC costumes and Sidechapter also give you a refreshing experience after completing the game for the first time.Now I'm going to end this review, because I could keep yapping about this game. Instead I'm going to play it!tl;dr This game makes you become the bat. It's also one of the best games in the world and probably the universe.BUY ALL ARKHAM GAMES!!!P.S. - The story is GREAT!!!			"

												Take Arkham Asylum, add more of everything, improve the combat system and you have Arkham City.The Combat - Compared to Arkham Asylum the combat has greatly improved as it's playing much more fluid now. The slow motion effect from the predecessor has been reduced, which makes it easier - at least for me - to time my hits and counters.The Story - I'm neither a comic book expert nor a Batman expert so I don't know how Arkham City's story compares to other Batman stories. Nevertheless the story seems fairly standard to me. Save the world - or in this case Arkham City - from destruction. There is a second story arc involving the Joker which is the more interesting one, in my opinion.The voice acting is superb. Especially Mark Hamill as the Joker is incredible.The Sidequests - Arkham Asylum had two side quests which only involved collecting stuff and solving riddles. Arkham City has about a dozen side quests and most of them feature other known characters from the Batman universe, the Mad Hatter, Zsasz etc. Although they bring a nice variety to the game, they don't always fit into the pace of the main story, e.g. the main story gives the impression that time is running out and Batman should move quickly to his next location, yet you're able to do the side quests. It's not like that you have some world-saving to do or anything... But this problem appears to happen in a lot of open world games and I might be the only one who is a bit annoyed by that. To sum ist up: the side quests are fun, but I would recommend doing most of them after you finished the story, so they fit into the canon.The Collectibles - While a chore in most games, Arkham City makes it actually fun to collect them. The high number of 440 collectibles/riddles might be a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but compared to other games (*cough* Assassin's Creed *cough*) they serve a purpose because they are necessary for finishing the Riddler side quest.Post-game - What to do after you finished the story? Hunting for achievements of course. The challenges from Arkham Asylum made it back into the game. You can either do combat challenges and fight in four rounds against a batch of enemies improving your highscores or you can do the predator challanges where you have to silently take out a group of enemies.New in this game are the campaigns which are pretty much the same as the challenge maps, except that one campaign consists of three challenge maps and a bunch of positive and negative modifiers which you have to apply to each map.If you're going for all 64 achievements you have to complete each of the twelve maps (which come in two different versions: normal and extreme) a whopping 16 times - 4 times with each of the four character, twice in the challenges (normal and extreme) and twice in the campaigns (normal, extreme).DLC - The story DLC 'Harley Quinn's Revenge' adds little to the story of the main game. It's nice to have but also not a must play. The character DLCs, with the exception of the Catwoman-DLC, are okay since they only affect the challenge mode. You basically have to play the same challenges again and again (see the passage above). The Catwoman DLC gives a different beginning of the game and you play her four times throughout the main story. In my opinion, she is also the most fun during combat, because she is even a more fluid fighter than batman.How long to beat - The game takes around 15 hours to finish, if you do the story and a couple of side quests and collectibles/riddles on the way. If you just play the main story, the credits would roll after approx. 7-8 hours.Getting all achievements took me 72 hours. You might be faster or slower depending on your skill.Rating - 4,5/5Buy it! It's fantastic!			"

												Buy this game, just it. Really worth for many hours of great gameplay.153 hours of Batman: Arkham City and 120 hours of Batman: Arkham City GOTY this all can tell that this is one of the best games that I ever played. You can find many ways to play this game, obvious it's has a line to be done to finish the campaign, but you have many side quests and challenges to make your own way trough the game. Almost every month this game comeback to my mind and I think to play this once more.			"

												This is a ridiculously good game I found even if you're not really into Batman very much I still recomend it to you because I wasn't either but it was on sale and hell, now it's definitely awesome!I definitely prefer it on steam opposed to windows live because WINDOWS LIVE accounts are insanely hard to setup while I got my STEAM set up within an hour and without millions of google searches.Storyline:Without giving away any spoilers I will say that you will encounter plenty of the good old baddies such as the joker and harley etc. etc. The storyline is also amazing and will keep you captivated throughout the whole game.It took me a while to complete it but if you're unlike me and you prefer to play as long as you can on games than you are likely to complete the main story within a week.Characters:BATMAN:All in all Batman is just a complete bad♥♥♥♥♥in no matter what he's doing he will always find a way to pound a couple skulls together along the way.He also has the largest arsenary of gadgets of all the playable characters in the game.Take note that most gadgets have a quickfire control usable by simple double tapping the gadgets respective number on the numberpad.eg. by double tapping Batarang (1) it quickly releases Batarang(s) depending on how many times you double tap) out to stun and disorientate your foes.Batman also lets out the occasional one-liner and likes to discreetly do a bit of smack-talking before knocking some heads together.So definitely, Batman is a complete badass.CATWOMAN:Catwoman is just as much a badass as Batman because of her always finding a way to mimick a kiss before a knee to the gonads pounds a thug into incapacitation.Like all other characters bar Batman, she has a small arsenal of gadgets but each is effective in combat.Very good with the girly wisecracks, always willing to add something about chipping a nail or something like that.ROBIN:Very awesome character, seemingly more of a ninja because of his bo-staff and ninja themed gadgets.His bullet shield, I found, is extremly usefull in combat because of its ability to block bullets and power bash.For said reason, I reckon Batman should use this one.I won't include very much about NIGHTWING because I haven't used him very much so far.All I know is that he was the original Robin until he grew up and decided to fly it solo.only BATMAN and CATWOMAN are playable throughout the main storyline.That concludes my review of Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition.Hope You Enjoyed-Smiley_HD			"

												For some reason, I never liked Batman. BUT That all changed when I played This Game:Batman:Arkham City.I decided to look at some gameplay before I bought it. It tick all the boxes for my favourite genresOpen World (go anywhere)(I’m)BatmanA lot of gadgetsKevin ConroyMark Hamill3rd PersonAnd I was allowed to play it becauseIt was within my classification range (M)I had enough MoneyI had the platform I was getting it for(PC)When I got Home I did what anyone would do…Put it in the Disc Drive of the laptop and Install it. After what seemed like 3 Hours (15 minutes) It had finished installing and, So I booted it up. It asked me to make an account for…The Dreaded…..GFWL(Games For Windows Live). I couldn’t make an account because of some stupid reason. so I panicked for 10 minutes THEN I had a brilliant idea to fix it...Look it up on youtube. I found that way to get around the no saving problem. I finally got to play and immediately I fell in love with the graphics and gameplay. The Gameplay:3rd personOpen WorldBatmanEPIC GADGETSStealthy or Fighting Detective Case filesKey Features:Made By a talented teamPerfect Voice ActingIn-Depth storyMany Easter Eggs (secrets)Engaging gameplayAfter I got up to a certain point in said game my disc stopped working and I was HALF WAY THROUGH. But by that time my game save had been deleted several times making me start again.½ a year later:I finally got another Copy of a really good site called {STEAM} and it was 75% off so i got the GOTY(Game Of The Year) Edition and I was happy again. BUT I had to start again. My playtime on steam is around 130 hours!! because of the open world there are many sidequests and thing to collect and secrets to find.The Review:Batman: Arkham City is a very engaging Batman styled “stealth-beat em up” with an amazing story. Although They tried to pack all the villains they could think of to add in to make it like the mad hatters tea party i still like it.It is not perfect but it is still pretty amazing.I really love how you get the feeling of actually being batman (without the raspy voice) Kevin(Batman) and Mark(The Joker) do an amazing job and so do all the other Voice actors.The thing I really took away from this is: You DON’T have to be Batman to be Batman. 9/10My favorite moments: The best boss fight in the game is Mr. Freeze which was very well thought out making you think and making you use all your skills.The Combat is what you’d expect very well flushed out mechanics and amazing Free Flow(jumping from thug to thug).Gadgets were well implemented too.Open world makes any game last longer to make you just want to fly around or grapple and punch randomly generated thugs.The Bugs and Glitches are just plain funny, once i saw a thug spinning rapidly and i walked right through him.The cutscenes are acted out using motion capture making them look extremely realistic.Animations of batman are always either crouching walking or leaping.There are amazing animations like when the thugs see you coming they might cower in a corner.The BAD: Not having a powerful computer affects cut scenes making the voices look desynced.Cramming in all the villains possible makes it look messy.Joker’s sadistic nature make it appropriate for people above the age of 11.After you complete EVERYTHING there is no reason to come back.Story is quite short: 9-10 hours for beginners.Can’t QuickFire Gadgets while flyingNo BatmobileWorld is quite smallBig Hard Drive Space (17 Gigabytes)Final thoughts:In conclusion you should play this game if you like batman or fun games in general.it only costs around $7.50 on sale and it will keep you coming back for ages.I am extremely excited about Batman: Arkham Knight coming out early next year (2015) because it has fixed most of the problems that I had with this near perfect game: Possibly a much longer story, you CAN QuickFire gadgets while flying , they added the batmobile and also the open world of Gotham is 5 times larger than this!Quiz: What was the first episode of the 1960s batman TV show called? ANSWER: Hi-Diddle Riddle. It featured Frank Gorshin as the Riddler and Adam West as Batman. It aired on the 12th of January 1966.			"

												(CONTAINS WHAT SOME MAY CONSIDER AS SPOILERS. HOWEVER NONE OF THESE ""SPOILERS"" ARE STORY-RELATED)Seeing as I just passed the 100 hour mark, I feel obligated to write a review. I always thought Batman was cool but I never really knew much about him. I never read the comics (it isn't such a big thing in my country, unlike in the US) and I haven't even watched all the movies about him. But these games...BUY THESE GAMES!!There isn't a single bad thing I can say about this game! I love every minute of it and I have played it a lot.It gives you a bigger playground than the last game and faster ways to make your way around it. Also there's a second playable character, a feline femme fatale who makes for a nice change every once in a while. With her unique skills, she can get to Riddler Trophies that Batman can't collect or can't reach.There are tons of Riddler Challenges to complete and find all over the world and I really love the fact that you can find them all without using a guide. These challenges unlock extras like character biographies, villain interview tapes, artwork and much more!! They really made me interested in everything about Batman. The stories or mysteries of how most villains came to be what they are, the reasons they have for hating Batman or Bruce Wayne, their twisted minds and extreme personalities, ... I LOVE IT!The combat in the Arkham games is what makes you feel so powerful! The satisfaction you get by taking out a whole group of thugs without getting hit, makes you feel like a complete BADASS! In this game the combat is even more fluent and seamless than the first. You can now use more different gadgets and use multi-counters (countering multiple enemies who attack at the same time) to dispatch of thugs. This gives you even more opportunities to make it through fights with dozens of thugs without getting hit.There's also the complete opposite of that when you're taking out a whole group of thugs one by one, using stealth and gadgets. The choice is yours, both give you satisfaction.And of course, by fighting and solving riddler challenges, you level up and can choose many upgrades. Almost all of them are necessary, especially when you're playing it on Hard or New Game+ difficulty. These difficulties also make you utilize the stealth-opportunities more, because a large group of thugs can be quite dangerous then.There are also many cool (and unexpected) boss fights and this game also has moments that take you to other ""places"" than Arkham City. The first time I played this game, it kept blowing me away. Now that I think about it, they've really done a fine job keeping the environment interesting. It can't have been easy if the main colors of your game are black and grey.The DLC costumes and Sidechapter also give you a refreshing experience after completing the game for the first time.Now I'm going to end this review, because I could keep yapping about this game. Instead I'm going to play it!tl;dr This game makes you become the bat. It's also one of the best games in the world and probably the universe.BUY ALL ARKHAM GAMES!!!P.S. - The story is GREAT!!!			"

												Take Arkham Asylum, add more of everything, improve the combat system and you have Arkham City.The Combat - Compared to Arkham Asylum the combat has greatly improved as it's playing much more fluid now. The slow motion effect from the predecessor has been reduced, which makes it easier - at least for me - to time my hits and counters.The Story - I'm neither a comic book expert nor a Batman expert so I don't know how Arkham City's story compares to other Batman stories. Nevertheless the story seems fairly standard to me. Save the world - or in this case Arkham City - from destruction. There is a second story arc involving the Joker which is the more interesting one, in my opinion.The voice acting is superb. Especially Mark Hamill as the Joker is incredible.The Sidequests - Arkham Asylum had two side quests which only involved collecting stuff and solving riddles. Arkham City has about a dozen side quests and most of them feature other known characters from the Batman universe, the Mad Hatter, Zsasz etc. Although they bring a nice variety to the game, they don't always fit into the pace of the main story, e.g. the main story gives the impression that time is running out and Batman should move quickly to his next location, yet you're able to do the side quests. It's not like that you have some world-saving to do or anything... But this problem appears to happen in a lot of open world games and I might be the only one who is a bit annoyed by that. To sum ist up: the side quests are fun, but I would recommend doing most of them after you finished the story, so they fit into the canon.The Collectibles - While a chore in most games, Arkham City makes it actually fun to collect them. The high number of 440 collectibles/riddles might be a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but compared to other games (*cough* Assassin's Creed *cough*) they serve a purpose because they are necessary for finishing the Riddler side quest.Post-game - What to do after you finished the story? Hunting for achievements of course. The challenges from Arkham Asylum made it back into the game. You can either do combat challenges and fight in four rounds against a batch of enemies improving your highscores or you can do the predator challanges where you have to silently take out a group of enemies.New in this game are the campaigns which are pretty much the same as the challenge maps, except that one campaign consists of three challenge maps and a bunch of positive and negative modifiers which you have to apply to each map.If you're going for all 64 achievements you have to complete each of the twelve maps (which come in two different versions: normal and extreme) a whopping 16 times - 4 times with each of the four character, twice in the challenges (normal and extreme) and twice in the campaigns (normal, extreme).DLC - The story DLC 'Harley Quinn's Revenge' adds little to the story of the main game. It's nice to have but also not a must play. The character DLCs, with the exception of the Catwoman-DLC, are okay since they only affect the challenge mode.

												Best game i have ever played and it also has Game of the year so it isnt me being a DC fan. The story hasn't fallen off. the graphics are great even for today's standered. the game has all the pros from arkham asylum except the chlostrophobic feel because it takes place in a part of gotham city that was taken by the goverment to extend arkham asylum and because arkham asylum is well... damaged after the last game. the map is really big. some people prefer arkham asylum over city because asylum had a chlostrophobic feel. I dont agree but its there opinion.Arkham city's combat is smoother than asylum and has more combos. The stealth from asylum is also back better than ever. For me, arkham city is a must buy for anyone.10/10			"

												In the days of yore, the Comics Code prohibited comics to depict the negative sides of life. Based on Arkham City, removing the Code may have been a bad call for playing this resembled a superhero daydream on a sugar rush. Absolutely no real world logics or limitations apply here making this the finest escapist spectacle in recent memory.Batman finds himself in Arkham City, a large portion of Gotham isolated from outside world to house supercriminals and their organizations. Detailing the story and the absurdities within would require several pages (if not books). Suffice to say that this is one of those games powered by Why Not? logics. Why are everyone but Batman so helpless and why do all the women look and dress like Playboy Bunnies when it is winter and there are lonely inmates in every direction? Why does Batman cooperate with a supercriminal, then have a boss fight with him and then cooperate with him again? How can anyone do all this in one night and completely ignore gravity in his moves? The game answers all this and much more with a resounding Why Not? followed by a Wait, There's More!That is not to say that playing it was not entertaining, quite the opposite. Arkham is absolutely filled with fun superhero things to do. The game throws side quests, activities, challenges and rewards at the player so rapidly it all blurs on by. Completing everything is quite tempting for playing is so smooth and responsive as to approach perfection. The close combat system is still the best yet seen and requires far more than mere button mashing. The predator rooms, which task you with taking out gun-wielding thugs, give you a variety of possibilities and the freedom to test them as you see fit. The gadget arsenal features no duds and moving around Arkham is sheer pleasure as well. You also get some playtime as Catwoman and playing as her contains just the right amount of variety.Visuals and sounds are just as good as in Asylum, if not better, with the gorgeously melodramatic soundtrack giving an extra boost. I had some technical issues with certain pieces of music disappearing halfway through the game. Since AC uses the console system of autosaves only and in one slot, this was a pain. Games For Windows Live has finally been removed, however, and I had no other bugs.Comparing this with Arkham Asylum makes quite clear why Origins failed to recapture the magic or move the franchise forward. Arkham had nowhere to go from here. Asylum was clear, compact and suspenseful while City is completely blown out of proportions but instead of collapsing from absurdity, it is strengthened by embracing the superhero lifestyle. Arkham City is weightless, highly polished entertainment that is absolutely recommended for anyone looking to soar above everyday concerns as Batman.			"

												Rocksteady did the impossible; they took an already perfect game and made it even better. Batman: Arkham City takes every single aspect of its predecesor and improved it; visuals, sound, gameplay, combat, etc. The only aspect if falls a bit short is on story; it's good but I think Arkham Asylum's story is tighter. But with so many side missions and challanges to have fun with, it's just a minor flaw. My pick for Best Game of 2011, truly worth every single cent.			"

												Um dos melhores jogos que já joguei 10/10Sempre fui fã do Batman desde a minha infancia , assistindo animações , vendo filmes , lendo quadrinhos e etc . mas sempre ficava desepcionado com os jogos , maaas a rocksteady realizou o meu sonho , tanto com seu titulo anterior , quanto com esse , Jogabilidade ♥♥♥♥ , Historia MUITO boa , digna de ser comparada com o quadrinho A piada Mortal , cujo o final lembra muito o do quadrinho , vc se sente na pele do Batman , vc vê ele se FODENDO , Cidade destruida , Crimes em gotham . trilha sonora ♥♥♥♥ , orquestrada e lembra bem a trilha sonora dos filmes do nollan . Jogabilidade A serie Arkham Criou uma propria , um pouco mentirosa , mais bem fluida e rápida vc pode pensar que o batman é meio durão sem muita mobilidade mas , eu acho que a desenvolvedora quiseram por assim por ele ser o batman e ele tem que ter uma pose de fodão .Resumindo esse de longe foi o melhor jogo dessa geração , para min , se vc gosta do batman , do universo do mesmo é uma compra OBRIGATORIA !

												Batman: Arkham City is a highly recommended game if you’re into an open world action-adventure game. You get the chance to play Batman and Catwoman in Arkham City; a prison fortress controlled by Hugo Strange. Besides Hugo Strange, you’ll run into other Batman’s foes however I won’t give list the names since it will spoil the story.Playing Batman is fantastic. You got access to Batman’s gadgets that will help him in any errand he’s in and let’s not forget his cape. The game takes place in an abandoned city so you’ll get the chance to glide with minimum sound and attack the thugs by stealth. There are a lot of stealth methods to be applied so it’s about planning attacks. Sometimes I improvised to make it more authentic and that was such a cool experience! This game is the sequel to Batman - Arkham Asylum so I suggest trying that game as well.Peace.			"

												Well I waited too long to play this one for sure! A great sequel to the fantastic first game, Arkham City presents a larger game world, more incredible characters from the Batman lore, a lot of new gadgets and combos/moves, nice graphics, top notch musical score, all this made precious by one of the best control interfaces and combat mechanics ever designed for a third person action game (please buy a gamepad if you don't have one!). The GOTY edition let's you play also as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing, a nice short DLC campaign is included and there's also a big bunch of arenas where you can test your combat and stealth skills while trying to rank up more points as possible (and that is addictive I can assure you). Maybe the campaign story is a bit weaker than its prequel's and game fundamentals are basically the same all other from the previous title, but Rocksteady has expanded and optimized every positive aspect of the first game, so I think this is indeed the best super hero game on the market, and one of the best action games / beat 'em ups ever created.Let's see if they will be able to do better and maybe innovate their franchise with the third and final game of this planned trilogy, Arkham Knight is coming in 2015!

												A great sequel offering more variation to the established gameplay. Although I prefer the 3D-metroidvania-structure of the first game to the open-world approach in this, it strikes a fine balance between having an open world you want to explore while remaining focused in the story. The story and voice-acting is also excellent and stays engaging and varied enough to not get mundane.			"

												For some reason, I never liked Batman. BUT That all changed when I played This Game:Batman:Arkham City.I decided to look at some gameplay before I bought it. It tick all the boxes for my favourite genresOpen World (go anywhere)(I’m)BatmanA lot of gadgetsKevin ConroyMark Hamill3rd PersonAnd I was allowed to play it becauseIt was within my classification range (M)I had enough MoneyI had the platform I was getting it for(PC)When I got Home I did what anyone would do…Put it in the Disc Drive of the laptop and Install it. After what seemed like 3 Hours (15 minutes) It had finished installing and, So I booted it up. It asked me to make an account for…The Dreaded…..GFWL(Games For Windows Live). I couldn’t make an account because of some stupid reason. so I panicked for 10 minutes THEN I had a brilliant idea to fix it...Look it up on youtube. I found that way to get around the no saving problem. I finally got to play and immediately I fell in love with the graphics and gameplay. The Gameplay:3rd personOpen WorldBatmanEPIC GADGETSStealthy or Fighting Detective Case filesKey Features:Made By a talented teamPerfect Voice ActingIn-Depth storyMany Easter Eggs (secrets)Engaging gameplayAfter I got up to a certain point in said game my disc stopped working and I was HALF WAY THROUGH. But by that time my game save had been deleted several times making me start again.½ a year later:I finally got another Copy of a really good site called {STEAM} and it was 75% off so i got the GOTY(Game Of The Year) Edition and I was happy again. BUT I had to start again. My playtime on steam is around 130 hours!! because of the open world there are many sidequests and thing to collect and secrets to find.The Review:Batman: Arkham City is a very engaging Batman styled “stealth-beat em up” with an amazing story. Although They tried to pack all the villains they could think of to add in to make it like the mad hatters tea party i still like it.It is not perfect but it is still pretty amazing.I really love how you get the feeling of actually being batman (without the raspy voice) Kevin(Batman) and Mark(The Joker) do an amazing job and so do all the other Voice actors.The thing I really took away from this is: You DON’T have to be Batman to be Batman. 9/10My favorite moments: The best boss fight in the game is Mr. Freeze which was very well thought out making you think and making you use all your skills.The Combat is what you’d expect very well flushed out mechanics and amazing Free Flow(jumping from thug to thug).Gadgets were well implemented too.Open world makes any game last longer to make you just want to fly around or grapple and punch randomly generated thugs.The Bugs and Glitches are just plain funny, once i saw a thug spinning rapidly and i walked right through him.The cutscenes are acted out using motion capture making them look extremely realistic.Animations of batman are always either crouching walking or leaping.There are amazing animations like when the thugs see you coming they might cower in a corner.The BAD: Not having a powerful computer affects cut scenes making the voices look desynced.Cramming in all the villains possible makes it look messy.Joker’s sadistic nature make it appropriate for people above the age of 11.After you complete EVERYTHING there is no reason to come back.Story is quite short: 9-10 hours for beginners.Can’t QuickFire Gadgets while flyingNo BatmobileWorld is quite smallBig Hard Drive Space (17 Gigabytes)Final thoughts:In conclusion you should play this game if you like batman or fun games in general.it only costs around $7.50 on sale and it will keep you coming back for ages.I am extremely excited about Batman: Arkham Knight coming out early next year (2015) because it has fixed most of the problems that I had with this near perfect game: Possibly a much longer story, you CAN QuickFire gadgets while flying , they added the batmobile and also the open world of Gotham is 5 times larger than this!Quiz: What was the first episode of the 1960s batman TV show called? ANSWER: Hi-Diddle Riddle. It featured Frank Gorshin as the Riddler and Adam West as Batman. It aired on the 12th of January 1966.			"

												This is a ridiculously good game I found even if you're not really into Batman very much I still recomend it to you because I wasn't either but it was on sale and hell, now it's definitely awesome!I definitely prefer it on steam opposed to windows live because WINDOWS LIVE accounts are insanely hard to setup while I got my STEAM set up within an hour and without millions of google searches.Storyline:Without giving away any spoilers I will say that you will encounter plenty of the good old baddies such as the joker and harley etc. etc. The storyline is also amazing and will keep you captivated throughout the whole game.It took me a while to complete it but if you're unlike me and you prefer to play as long as you can on games than you are likely to complete the main story within a week.Characters:BATMAN:All in all Batman is just a complete bad♥♥♥♥♥in no matter what he's doing he will always find a way to pound a couple skulls together along the way.He also has the largest arsenary of gadgets of all the playable characters in the game.Take note that most gadgets have a quickfire control usable by simple double tapping the gadgets respective number on the numberpad.eg. by double tapping Batarang (1) it quickly releases Batarang(s) depending on how many times you double tap) out to stun and disorientate your foes.Batman also lets out the occasional one-liner and likes to discreetly do a bit of smack-talking before knocking some heads together.So definitely, Batman is a complete badass.CATWOMAN:Catwoman is just as much a badass as Batman because of her always finding a way to mimick a kiss before a knee to the gonads pounds a thug into incapacitation.Like all other characters bar Batman, she has a small arsenal of gadgets but each is effective in combat.Very good with the girly wisecracks, always willing to add something about chipping a nail or something like that.ROBIN:Very awesome character, seemingly more of a ninja because of his bo-staff and ninja themed gadgets.His bullet shield, I found, is extremly usefull in combat because of its ability to block bullets and power bash.For said reason, I reckon Batman should use this one.I won't include very much about NIGHTWING because I haven't used him very much so far.All I know is that he was the original Robin until he grew up and decided to fly it solo.only BATMAN and CATWOMAN are playable throughout the main storyline.That concludes my review of Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition.Hope You Enjoyed-Smiley_HD			"

The story isn't its strongest point, though it will carry some interest throughout its short campaign.  Then there's the riddler collectibles, the challenges and more.  Lots of fun.

												Arkham city is one of the best game in the Batman Arkham series, packing action and a great storyline with a satisfying length and good replayability.The game re-uses the good old Arkham Asylum mechanics (which is the same across all the Arkham games) and expands the explorable area to the whole of Arkham city, a prison city that Bruce Wayne is trying to shut down through the political game. But Dr. Hugo Strange has other plans for Mr. Wayne, namely throwing him into Arkham City with shackles to tie loose ends. Once inside Arkham, Bruce Wayne finds his way to an airdrop with a batsuit sent by Alfred, his butler. He then takes matters into his own hands and clears the city himself.The gameplay is honestly flawless, as per usual in this game series. Couple that with a nice lengthy storyline (14-16h) that builds upon the Batman universe and characters, such as Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Bane, The Joker, and many more classic vilains. I would highly recommend any Batman: Arkham X games, even if you're not a fan of Batman at all. The story is good and easy to get into, the gameplay is noob friendly on low difficulties, and it's overall a very enjoyable experience.			"

												22-Nov-2016 : Finished main story + extrasSetup : Windows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80-2QE Notebook, Logitech F710 GamepadREVIEW :Great voice acting, great graphics (4-year old technology still holding up), great soundtrack, mediocre story and characters, and mediocre gameplay. Too many collectibles to be found and unfortunately you can't just leave them because some of the side-quest are related to them. The control design also not so fluid as I expected to be. Several times I missed a jump or a counter-attack because of this. I love the detective side-quests and the riddles. And to get the collectibles, you also need to solve a kind of mini-puzzle. But again, the collectibles are just too much and tedious. Overall, it still a great game, especially compared to other comic-based superhero games which normally have bad quality, but it's not as memorable as Arkham Asylum. CONCLUSION :Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.			"

												Batman : Arkham City is a very good open-world action title with a heavy emphasis on exploration. With interesting boss fights (a nice upgrade from the first game), a very slick and balanced gameplay that manages to balance stealthy segments with more action-packed ones, and great visual identity, Arkham City establishes itself as a solid AAA title that follows in the footsteps of its predecessor for great results.  The game is filled to the brim with content ; while the main story can be beaten in about 15 hours, the many sidequests and collectibles will grab dedicated players' attention. Also worth noting are the numerous iconic characters from the Batman lore that make an appearance, whether during the main storyline or during sidequests. This will most certainly satisfy hardcore fans of the franchise, while being a great way to introduce newcomers, as each appearing character is given a biography that the player can read at any time.The elements that disappointed me were the simplistic combat system (not really improved since the previous title), the upgrades that sometimes felt like they were only useful for one specific situation ; and the story, while more developed than in the previous title, did not quite make up for the slightly underwhelming and subdued overall atmosphere that clashed with the oppressive, almost intoxicating setting of Arkham Asylum. All in all, Batman Arkham City is really enjoyable, and although it is not revolutionary by any means, I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone with as much as a passing interest in the Batman universe.

												Batman: Arkham City is a spectacle fighting/partial stealth game featuring (you guessed it) the Batman. Plot:Batman is captured by Hugo Strange and sent into Arkham City, the super prison built in part of Gotham. Batman soon learns of ""Protocol 10"", which Strange says will make him famous. Batman begins his quest to stop Hugo Strange and his Protocol 10 to save Gotham city. Notable villains include:-Hugo Strange-Two-Face-Penguin-Mr. Freeze-Ra's al-Ghul-Joker All of the characters are very well done with phenomenal voice acting. Most notably are Batman voiced by Kevin Conroy and Joker voiced by Mark Hamill (HEEEEEEHEHEEhehehee AHAAAAAAAAAHHHHAAAAhooo HA HEHEEE heee heee)Gameplay:You will spend the majority of the game as the Dark Knight himself, and there's a reason he is ""The most dangerous man in the world"", as Superman once said. The gameplay can be split into four basic categories:Batman is a master of all forms of martial arts, and it shows. The combat is focused on a free-flow brawl which utilizes combos after 8 uninterrupted moves and is very responsive and satisfying. The right click to counter system works very well and is very enjoyable to play.He is the Dark Knight for a reason after all. Not all thugs are simply using their fists to try and beat you to death, some have found that bullets are far more effective. Now begins the stealth portions of the game, which are just as fun as the brawling. Stealth focuses around Takedowns. Takedowns can be silent, loud, terrifying, and much more. The thugs in the room have a very realistic reaction to things. I love (perhaps a bit too much) terrorizing thugs as I zip around, breaking more than a few of their bones.Arkham City is a big place, and the sidewalk just ain't gonna cut it. Batman uses the Batclaw (his grapple gun) to zip around Arkham City in a very enjoyable manner. He can also use his cape to glide around like the bat he is. Parkour in the game is also very well done: not very complicated, but very effective.And of course, what would Batman be without his toolbelt? At your disposal are all sorts of gadgets available to the Bat at any time. These gadgets range from the Batclaw, smoke pellets, explosive gel, and the classic Batarang. His gadgets are all unique in their own way, each with their own puprose and all very useful.Graphics: The game has great graphics and the in game cutscenes transition very well to actual gameplay. I don't have much else to say, I'm not a graphics guy.Overall, I highly recommend this game. When I got it I didn't expect to play it that much. I don't like fighting games all too much. After 5 hours (straight) of ""I'M BATMAN"" I changed my mind. Also:I'M BATMAN			"

												This game is truly something special.  Though I was a comic book fan in younger days, I always favored Marvel over DC, and I was a particular fan of Spider-Man.  Also, when it comes to video games, my preference skews toward complexity.  Selling me on a basic beat 'em up starring Batman would not be easy.  However, I was intrigued by a proliferation of glowing reviews, so I took the plunge when it became available at a heavily discounted price.Sometimes Steam feels like gambling -- you put your money on the table, and either you get loads of smiles or you walk away feeling cheated.  Almost anyone who thinks they might enjoy this game will get loads of smiles from it.  Combat resembles a simple rhythm game, but it becomes much more complex for players who care to learn and exploit some of the many special maneuvers available through the progression system.  Also, the gritty dark tone is probably my favorite variety of Batman -- heavy on the Dark Knight vibe with pitch perfect comic relief sparingly applied.Though it feels like a console game, and I imagine it could be a little awkward without a gamepad or Xbox controller, it delivered the best of both worlds for me.  Beautiful graphics were silky smooth for me at 1920x1080, and I did not experience troublesome technical hiccups that could really mess with the fun of combat so sensitive to timing.  It is also, just a little bit, a genuine open world game in the tradition of GTA or Skyrim.  The ""world"" is confined to a few neighborhoods in a walled off section of a big city, but the various villains and their henchmen make some territories much different from others.  Perhaps the best way to convey the scope is by pointing out that vehicles are not missed.  Skillful use of grapnel and cape make it possible to swing and glide quickly across large areas.The game abounds with side quests and collectibles -- these things aren't essential, but they can provide supplemental XP, and some players will really appreciate that sort of feature along with achievements and cosmetic unlocks involved.  Also, some of the side quests are well thought out stories unto themselves.  The excellent main storyline is not confined to Batman alone.  The narratives of other characters must be advanced by completing missions with those characters during substantial breaks in Batman's adventures.  However, when the story does put Batman toe to toe against a major villain, you can expect a properly elaborate boss fight.By now there are a couple of newer choices in this product line, but I get the vibe that Arkham City remains a sentimental favorite among critics.  I've acquired a few AAA comic book action hero games over the past year, and none of them can hold a candle to this purchase.  I join the consensus holding that it was a masterpiece at the time it was released, and I believe it is an excellent bargain at the prices we're now seeing 2-3 years after that release.			"

												How have I not reviewed this yet?  Arkham City is the sequel to Arkham Asylum, which was an excellent game itself.  I said a lot of great things about that game, and Arkham City improves on pretty much everything.First, the combat.  The combat in Arkham Asylum was okay, but had some awkwardness.  This game is a little more forgiving and far more fluid when fighting, you'll notice the difference immediately if you've played the original game.  This along with a whole lot of new moves and better combos means fighting is more fun and interesting, and feels less stiff.  While Arkham Asylum took place on an island divided into three areas that loaded separately and were connected by passages, Arkham City takes a different approach to make it feel more like an open world.  The entire exterior map acts as one large area, and you can move freely across it, even though overall it is larger than the entire map of Arkham Asylum.  Interior areas still load separately, but the outside has eliminated loading screens and connector areas entirely.  It makes moving through Arkham City seamless.  Even better, with the improved controls, it is now possible to travel through the entire game world using glide without ever touching the ground.  It's amazing thing to see.  The glide system was overhauled, allowing new actions during gliding, such as diving, giving Batman near-flight powers.  The grapnel gun was also upgraded, with a boost mechanism that instead of pulling you to a location allows you to gain momentum and shoot out into the sky.  The grapnel gun can easily be used in mid-glide, now.  This makes travelling around the city both exciting and easy, instead of tedious.  Another nice touch is the addition of another character.  In the storyline (Game of the Year Edition), the plot alternates between Batman and Catwoman, both are playable.  Catwoman's moves are completely different from Batman's, which makes a nice change.  Unfortunately, for most of the game the switching is mandatory, meaning you have to finish a Catwoman segment to continue as Batman, and the transitions between the characters are cliffhangers.  Eventually, you will get the option to switch back and forth between them.  The story is excellent, and plays into the foreshadowing in Arkham Asylum.  The Warden, Quincy Sharpe, is now the mayor of Gotham, and following Joker's takeover of Arkham, ordered both the Asylum and Blackgate shut down, and a rundown section of Gotham was designated a maximum security prison, the new Arkham City.  This setting means most of Batman's regular foes can all be running loose in one crime-infested area, with no one to stop them, which gives villains like Penguin and Two-Face a lot of time to shine after being left out of the previous game.  Joker and Harley Quinn remain the biggest threat to Batman, but something strange is going on with Joker.  Few people have actually seen him, and rumor is that he is very ill after the Arkham Asylum incident.  But Joker is not the only mastermind in Arkham City, not in the least.The ending is stunning.  I was shocked.  I won't spoil it.  All I will say is I won't hear the song ""Only You"" the same ever again.I know I used a lot of words, but I didn't come close to talking about everything good about this game.  It really is great.  Definitely recommended.			"

												Batman: Arkham City is overwhelmingly great and atmospheric, everything in this game is great, more than great. The graphics, the sound effects and especially the music, the gameplay, and the storyline. Arkham City is one of the best games ever.  For me the thing that made Arkham City beautiful the most is its storyline and combat system.  The story has dozens of surprises, easter eggs for example, dozens of them that has connections with the main story, the sidequests and collectibles (riddler trophies unlockables like interview tapes) supports the main story giving the player background and an idea about key characters in the game. The game has a complete feeling when you finish it, the story isn't vague, not confusing, has few flaws, the storyline is nearly perfect. Plus the history of Arkham Asylum gives the game more background.BTW, I played the game for more than 80 hours, Steam didn't record my playtime when I'm offline.Still, Poison Ivy and Catwoman are so hot.9.8 + .2 for Catwoman's sexy a$$.10/10 would like to see Poison Ivy's vines all around Catwoman again			"

												Expands greatly on the original Arkham game by giving you a small city to play in. My personal taste however is for the first game in the series, as i love the fact that you are trapped in an asylum with batmans greatest foes. I never felt like i was in any danger with this game, as its too easy to grappnel away from any battle. And i miss the terror of being hunted by killer crock.Sill, a very good entry in the series and a must have for any dark knight fan.			"

												This game has a fun combat system, but can sometimes be slightly repetitive.  Most of the missions in the campaign of this game involve Batman running back and forth across the city, which was suprisingly enjoyable.  Batman's glider combined with the grappling hook makes the parkour in this game extremely fun.  Overall, this game was enjoyable and I had fun playing the 16 hours that I logged.Also, the team that created the animations for this game is amazing.  All of the animations are perfectly fluent and can get very complex between transitions.			"

												This is a great, fun and easy to play game. In this game you play as Batman and you enter Arkham CIty; a huge prison for all of Gotham's worst criminals. You are kidnapped by the Joker who has been poisoned and he has injected some of his blood into Batman's. You will explore Arkham City and try to find a cure. You will take down thugs and will discover a much more sinister and evil plan that lurks withing the walls of Arkham City.			"

												Batman: Arkham City is a good game, but in my opinion worst than Batman: Arkham Asylum. In the game appear a lot of Batman enemies and they are not the same than the first part. The story is very good and you can find a lot of items and secrets so you can learn more about Batman universe.			"

												This game is fantastic.The graphics aren't perfect but make up for it by an awesome artistic direction. The ambiance is phenomenal. The gameplay is top notch, so enjoyable.The only downside is a story a bit too far-fetched, but still interesting to follow.One of the best games I've played in years.			"

												Batman: Arkham City is a spectacle fighting/partial stealth game featuring (you guessed it) the Batman. Plot:Batman is captured by Hugo Strange and sent into Arkham City, the super prison built in part of Gotham. Batman soon learns of ""Protocol 10"", which Strange says will make him famous. Batman begins his quest to stop Hugo Strange and his Protocol 10 to save Gotham city. Notable villains include:-Hugo Strange-Two-Face-Penguin-Mr. Freeze-Ra's al-Ghul-Joker All of the characters are very well done with phenomenal voice acting. Most notably are Batman voiced by Kevin Conroy and Joker voiced by Mark Hamill (HEEEEEEHEHEEhehehee AHAAAAAAAAAHHHHAAAAhooo HA HEHEEE heee heee)Gameplay:You will spend the majority of the game as the Dark Knight himself, and there's a reason he is ""The most dangerous man in the world"", as Superman once said. The gameplay can be split into four basic categories:Batman is a master of all forms of martial arts, and it shows. The combat is focused on a free-flow brawl which utilizes combos after 8 uninterrupted moves and is very responsive and satisfying. The right click to counter system works very well and is very enjoyable to play.He is the Dark Knight for a reason after all. Not all thugs are simply using their fists to try and beat you to death, some have found that bullets are far more effective. Now begins the stealth portions of the game, which are just as fun as the brawling. Stealth focuses around Takedowns. Takedowns can be silent, loud, terrifying, and much more. The thugs in the room have a very realistic reaction to things. I love (perhaps a bit too much) terrorizing thugs as I zip around, breaking more than a few of their bones.Arkham City is a big place, and the sidewalk just ain't gonna cut it. Batman uses the Batclaw (his grapple gun) to zip around Arkham City in a very enjoyable manner. He can also use his cape to glide around like the bat he is. Parkour in the game is also very well done: not very complicated, but very effective.And of course, what would Batman be without his toolbelt? At your disposal are all sorts of gadgets available to the Bat at any time. These gadgets range from the Batclaw, smoke pellets, explosive gel, and the classic Batarang. His gadgets are all unique in their own way, each with their own puprose and all very useful.Graphics: The game has great graphics and the in game cutscenes transition very well to actual gameplay. I don't have much else to say, I'm not a graphics guy.Overall, I highly recommend this game. When I got it I didn't expect to play it that much. I don't like fighting games all too much. After 5 hours (straight) of ""I'M BATMAN"" I changed my mind. Also:I'M BATMAN			"

												How have I not reviewed this yet?  Arkham City is the sequel to Arkham Asylum, which was an excellent game itself.  I said a lot of great things about that game, and Arkham City improves on pretty much everything.First, the combat.  The combat in Arkham Asylum was okay, but had some awkwardness.  This game is a little more forgiving and far more fluid when fighting, you'll notice the difference immediately if you've played the original game.  This along with a whole lot of new moves and better combos means fighting is more fun and interesting, and feels less stiff.  While Arkham Asylum took place on an island divided into three areas that loaded separately and were connected by passages, Arkham City takes a different approach to make it feel more like an open world.  The entire exterior map acts as one large area, and you can move freely across it, even though overall it is larger than the entire map of Arkham Asylum.  Interior areas still load separately, but the outside has eliminated loading screens and connector areas entirely.  It makes moving through Arkham City seamless.  Even better, with the improved controls, it is now possible to travel through the entire game world using glide without ever touching the ground.  It's amazing thing to see.  The glide system was overhauled, allowing new actions during gliding, such as diving, giving Batman near-flight powers.  The grapnel gun was also upgraded, with a boost mechanism that instead of pulling you to a location allows you to gain momentum and shoot out into the sky.  The grapnel gun can easily be used in mid-glide, now.  This makes travelling around the city both exciting and easy, instead of tedious.  Another nice touch is the addition of another character.  In the storyline (Game of the Year Edition), the plot alternates between Batman and Catwoman, both are playable.  Catwoman's moves are completely different from Batman's, which makes a nice change.  Unfortunately, for most of the game the switching is mandatory, meaning you have to finish a Catwoman segment to continue as Batman, and the transitions between the characters are cliffhangers.  Eventually, you will get the option to switch back and forth between them.  The story is excellent, and plays into the foreshadowing in Arkham Asylum.  The Warden, Quincy Sharpe, is now the mayor of Gotham, and following Joker's takeover of Arkham, ordered both the Asylum and Blackgate shut down, and a rundown section of Gotham was designated a maximum security prison, the new Arkham City.  This setting means most of Batman's regular foes can all be running loose in one crime-infested area, with no one to stop them, which gives villains like Penguin and Two-Face a lot of time to shine after being left out of the previous game.  Joker and Harley Quinn remain the biggest threat to Batman, but something strange is going on with Joker.  Few people have actually seen him, and rumor is that he is very ill after the Arkham Asylum incident.  But Joker is not the only mastermind in Arkham City, not in the least.The ending is stunning.  I was shocked.  I won't spoil it.  All I will say is I won't hear the song ""Only You"" the same ever again.I know I used a lot of words, but I didn't come close to talking about everything good about this game.  It really is great.  Definitely recommended.			"

												A realistic shooting experience that takes you on a trip to Aurora, Colorado, where you will be introduced to the protagonist James Holmes. After a quick introduction to being mentally ill, dying your hair in a way that makes you look like a surprised carrot, and finally getting your AR15, which as well all have been taught is essential to daily survival next to shelter, clothing, and food, you will encounter the enemies of the first level. Do not be fooled! These stone cold monsters are portrayed as harmless cinema enthusiasts. Beware ... pure evil sleeps within their deceptive popcorn buckets and soft drink bottles. The hope for salvation of the whole world lies in your hands, and your hands only. Your finger, the trigger, the blood rage - the essential holy trinity of this mission.Young hero, be prepared to show no mercy to these traitors. You must succeed.Oh, wait ..			"

												I absolutely loved Batman: Arkham Asylum. It was a spectacular look into the asylum itself, a location that stole the show, transformed and twisted by the inmates over the course of the game and providing ample room to explore. The plot wasn't groundbreaking, but it was great, and the spectacular returns of Animated Series cast members were accompanied by other great performances across the board. Most importantly, it gave the player an experience no other game could attest to: The feeling of becoming The Bat, learning his methods and feeling the tension he never expresses. When I heard about Arkham City, I doubted that a sequel could do it justice.Those doubts have been blasted out of the frikkin' water.The mere concept of Arkham City as a location cleverly serves several purposes: The reasons you'll uncover over the course of the game, a chance to explore much of Gotham City while staying in criminal territory, a way to bring together enemies both criminally insane and just downright criminal, and a warning that this is all-new, untrodden territory. Sure, there are a ton of thematic illusions to classic Batman works, as in Asylum, but while Asylum stuck to a composite of other works, City creates a new blend of characters all its own, and does quite well in doing so. A lot of characters we write off nowadays as pathetic jokes are brought back up to the terrifying, vicious foes they're meant to be.The vocal talents on display here are fantastic once again, although I personally got a little annoyed at Nolan North voicing every other goon. (To be fair, he does an excellent job as Penguin. I just feel the lack of vocal variety for enemies stands out.) I was disappointed to hear that Arleen wasn't voicing Harley this time around, but Tara Strong takes the role and runs with it like it was hers from the start. Everyone on the cast slips into these roles quite naturally.Anyways! Combat is quite well evolved from Arkham Asylum, and just as thrilling as before. The ""quickfire"" options took me quite a while to actually figure out, though, and I only understood how to do the knife counters until after completing the story (and all side missions (besides the AR stuff but we'll get to that later)). Stealth segments didn't feel quite as interesting to me as before, but that might just be nostalgia goggles and a bit of repetitive choices on my part.The side missions are quite engaging and presented in a reasonably organic manner. I would go as far as to say that the only missions that legitimately suck and are never fun are the AR Training challenges. Finish the first four early on, get your Grapnel Boost upgrade, and don't even bother with the other ones. They are not worth the frustration.Boss battles were one thing that Arkham Asylum sucked at. They are noticably better here, with the exception of one that reminded me of a certain infuriating duo in the first game. Here, it's frustrating due to a particular environmental hazard that you WILL hit. Upgrade your health early.As far as the Game of the Year content goes, there's some new challenge maps, some costumes, and most importantly, extra characters. Unlike what you might expect, they all play very distinctly from one another, and Catwoman takes center stage a few times in the main plot in this version. Her role provides a refreshing change of pace every now and then.They heavily advertise the addition of a new story mode called ""Harley Quinn's Revenge"". That is not really the strong point of this version. It's more of a neat little extra for when you've finished pretty much everything else and would like to see a little more story. It's like an OVA: It's a nice extra to have if you really, really want more, but it doesn't fundamentally change much. I would've at least hoped for more focus on Robin in it, but nope. Back to The Bat in short order.In short, excellent detail, intriguing plot, fantastic gameplay, and a spectacular Batman experience all-round, with most issues arising in tacked-on extras that shouldn't hamper the core experience much for you.

												This is an insta classic game. 10/10!Arkham City is on of the best game's i played last 5 years.I could tell you millions of reasons why to own this game but i will for fast forward...a) The visuals are Freaking amazing, and the game is AMAZINGLY renderd without the need of a super computer to play it on max settings.b)Music and game sounds are so intence you will catch yourself squeezing your mouse in fights or chaces with a stupid smile in your face.c)Gameplay is perfect. You can roam around city gliding like a bat or you can kick 20 peaple's♥♥♥♥♥on the ground with 40x combos screaming out of pleasure. Everything works like a charm.d)Storyline is great without needing a previus game explanation for what is going on. Most of gamers knows the enemys anyway from comics, cartoons or movies.e)Replayability? Well, i finished the main storyline in about 9 hours. After that i did some missions which they where totally AWESOME feeling like i was still playing the main story. I 'll say 3-5 more hours there. Riddles could take you days to solve, adding more time. You can restart the game with all your upgrades in a harder mode and dont forget the GOTY edition with huge amount of extras and an extra story line with the amazing Harley Queen! :p I'd say 25-35 hours of pure gameplay and more of 50hours for the 100% achiv.The best game i played this year so far!

												With a critic of 91/100, Batman: Arkham City is the game every Batman fan deserves! It's simple, you play as Batman, fight through the villains like the Jocker, Penguin, Harley Quinn, Bane and more! The people at Rocksteady studios have really done a great job! The Voice acting is really well done and appreciating! Has awesome cutscenes! The Arkham City is really well detailed! There's no need of playing the earlier version which is the Arkham Asylum. The main part of the game is you feel that you are Batman in the game and that what all Batman fans like! No matter you are Batman fan or not (You should be!) this game is must to buy and it worths each and every penny! It's my guarantee that this game will not let you down! Also try the next Arkham series! If this review helped you please give a thumbs up! Thanks!			"

												I have finished the main story and the dlc story of this game and enyoyed every part of it. The game has a really good fighting system and gives a challange to the player when there are a lot of enemys.The Story is ok and simple to understand.U have a open world with a few side-quests that put batman against some of his less known villians.Being batman does not feel like u are imortal yet u dont feel like u can die in 1 hit.The thing that makes this game really awsome for me atleast is that u can stealth a lot of missions and by doing them stealthy u get rewarded more.There is a progression system in the game which allows u to unlock a lot of gadets to help u on your journey.Now lets get to the bad stuff...The game is a bad console port, playing the game on low and the fps is still going down to ~20 while i can run lets say Battlefield 3 on high with 60fps. This game has also a lot of problems with crashing randomly when loading areas.So in short....+ good story+ good fighting system+ open world+ become Batman- FPS problems- Random crashing- GlitchesIf u do not mind googling some fixes this game is a must buy :) "

The game has a really good fighting system and gives a challange to the player when there are a lot of enemys.The Story is ok and simple to understand.U have a open world with a few side-quests that put batman against some of his less known villians.Being batman does not feel like u are imortal yet u dont feel like u can die in 1 hit.The thing that makes this game really awsome for me atleast is that u can stealth a lot of missions and by doing them stealthy u get rewarded more.There is a progression system in the game which allows u to unlock a lot of gadets to help u on your journey.Now lets get to the bad stuff...The game is a bad console port, playing the game on low and the fps is still going down to ~20 while i can run lets say Battlefield 3 on high with 60fps. This game has also a lot of problems with crashing randomly when loading areas.So in short....+ good story+ good fighting system+ open world+ become Batman- FPS problems- Random crashing- GlitchesIf u do not mind googling some fixes this game is a must buy :) "

												Batman: Arkham City (B:AC) is a sequel to Rocksteady Studios' original Batman: Arkham Asylum. Featuring many of the same components that made the first game a success, B:AC improves upon the open-world design which gives you free reign on initiating additional side-quests. Yet again, B:AC does not cease to satisfy fans of the Dark Knight given their clever use of the cast of villains and tying them to the grand plot. B:AC is an absolute must for fans and should not be passed up by any gamer.			"

Arkham Asylum is one of my favorite games, when this game came out I was blown away. This is one of the games I can keep playing and never get bored. I suggest buying the Game of the Year edition for all the DLC, it's worth it.			"

												Arkham City - and you are Batman!This game is the best Batman-Game of all Batman-Games. It is like watching the 60's Batman TV-show and than switching the channel to see Heath Ledger as Joker trying to let guys decide if they want to blow up the other boat and survive instead of .. bla bla - you know the storyThe game is over the top in almost every aspect. As if the combats aren't awesome enough and the Sidestorys wouldn't be as much Fun as the major Storyline - no - they let you flip into another person and kick but as you do so. Did they chose sidekick Robin or former sidekick and now sandalonesuperhero Nightwing? - NO - They give you highheals (realy? how does she climb with these.. öhm.. forget it) whip whiping Indiana Jones Catwoman!! - And!!! - You can play as Robin at ""Harleys Revenge"" - AND!!! - You can play as Nightwing on the Bonusmaps - AND!!!!! - you could that as Deathstroke also!!!Damn - I need a second to calm down here.If you ever wanted an game that is like the good old Batman-comics where meant to be in the fifties. if you watched the Dark Night-Triology and wondered if there is an game that is as good/bad/ugly/mean as these films... well... this is it!10/10			"

												                                                          *****WALL OF TEXT WARNING*****The legendary Batman Arkham series continues with Batman: Arkham City.  I haven't played Arkham Asylum, so I can't make a comparison between two.  It wouldn't make sense to compare it to the other Batman game I played, Batman NES by Sunsoft.  The game takes place in Arkham City, a new super prison set up in walled off section of Gotham containing the area where Bruce Wayne's parents were gunned down by Joe Chill.  As Batman you fight to uncover the truth behind the walls of this new super prison.  You can also play at Catwoman during the campaign.  The game features challenge maps where you play as Batman in different skins, such as the Animated Series Batman and Batman Beyond.  You can also play a few different characters.  There is an add-on campaign called Harley Quinn's revenge where you reprise your role as Batman not that long after the events of the main campaign.  The ""Free Flow"" combat system carries on from the previous installment, which allows for more dynamic hand to hand combat or Bat vs Gun combat.  As you land consecutive hits the combo meter increases and the more hits you can land without getting hurt or taking too long to get another hit, the more experience points you get.  You use the experience points to level up your armor for both Batman and Catwoman.  You can also unlock extra gadgets, improve your gadgets, and you can improve your combat skills with special takedowns or moves.  There are other factors that goes into your XP gains.  There are bonuses for using different gadgets during combat, such as the Bat-a-rang, the Batclaw, etc.  There is also an ""intimidation bonus"" where taking out thugs through stealth and concealment.  Once you get down to the last thug standing or if you are only fighting one thug you are granted a slow-mo take down where you can look at the painful last hit thrown by Batman or Catwoman(the nutshots are painful to watch).  Honestly, the combat can get a little boring but the takedowns are satisfying.  You can counter enemy attacks with default RMB, if you see little blue lines above an enemies head they are about to try to hit you.  You block multiple enemy attacks by pressing the RMB the number of times there are people about to try to hit you.    The graphics are fantastic, but there are some glitches, but overall it is pretty well put together.  There are times where you can tell that it was ported, but don't let that fool you, it is still a great game.  The voice acting is superb, the Joker is voiced by Mark Hamill aka Luke Skywalker.  Batman is voiced by Kevin Conroy, the same man behind the Animated Series's Batman.  I never found any dull voice acting, even the minor characters were well done.  The game can last pretty long if you go for the side-quests, especially getting all the Riddler trophies without looking up hints.  Overall, I give it a 9/10, it is a great game once you get past some of the glitches, but for me I never had any problems with it except for some long load times at some points.  This is one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												You get to be Batman and Kick@$$!!! This Game runs super smooth on my old PC rig I made back in 2013 A.D. with maxmium settings turned on. I haven't finished it yet but the storyline is really impressive. Feels in sysnc with the comics and the old animated series. Some tricky side quests here and there but nothing a guide or two online won't help you solve. This Game of the Year Edition reallys smooths all out any rough edges it might have had in the past. Never have any glitches or memory save problems. A truly bad@$$ PC port from console all considering. You too should become one with the Night!			"

												This game is awesome, I can't really write something bad about it.This game continues the Arkham storyline after what happened in Arkham Asylum.So you're Bruce Wayne and you have been sent to Arkham City, a city that's under lockdown with all the criminal insane in it fighting for dominance. You'll eventually try to find out more about what's going on in the city and the reason someone would put all the criminals in a city. This game features the most important enemies of Batman, Catwoman, Robin and some less known enemies. The combat system and storyline are good.			"

												You can either take out people stealthily (as the game recommends), or 10v1 them (bearing in mind they have guns). 10v1 all the way.Seriously though, great game and graphics, truly immersive storyline with some very good voice actors. It combines everything you could possibly want in a game, good fighting mechanics, good story, good graphics, puzzle-solving, and most importantly of all, Batman! You don't really have to have played Arkham Asylum to understand the game, so that's an added bonus.I'm only halfway through the storyline, but I would definitely recommend it already.			"

												As a follow up from Arkham Asylum, I would have to say, THANK YOU LORD FOR MAKE A BRILLIANT PREVIOUS GAME INTO A ANOTHER FANTASTIC GAME. I refer to those games with sequels where everyone and you reading this, know about the terror of a brilliant game fallen in the next one, we will bang our heads against the wall saying ""they should've stopped the morns"" but Batman Arkham City, did just that. the made this game better then the 1st and topped it with even more gadgets, a bigger map , as well as tons of challenges, villians (such as Two-face, Penguin, the badman himself Joker and the smoking Harley ;) etc) the story continues and will make you once again sit there for hours playing this game over and over again. To everyone that wants to know about this game, I recommend buying as there are plenty of spoilers. through review. The graphics are amazing, the story-line gets better, and the DLC's are trully an amazing things, as they let you play as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing.Overall I give this game 9.5/10 same as Arkham Asylum, only because it stops you from doing university work, homework, and jobs be warned lmao.

												A sequel to Batman Arkham Asylum and the second entry to the trilogy, it brought back everything that was succesful in Arkham Asylum, but gives you more with more interesting gadgets, and a big city sandbox to play with it in.PROS- The previous combat system is improved, but nothing changed too much, since it was already pretty good as it was before. - Big variety of enemies on how they will try to take you down, of course, that means you have more tools to take them down. Because you know, you're the Batman. Rich snob.- A large map is yours to glide around, not much to do, but still a big relief compared to the cramped space that was the Asylum.- Expanded the detective part of Batman a lot more with a variety of cases that range from homicide to search and rescue. - Two (or three, depending how you look at it) playable characters! Though its still more heavily focused on Batman, you'll get to play as Catwoman here and there. She's a little forgetable though. My only regret is that they didn't expand the use of Robin a little more than they should have.- Plot twists! Plenty of plot twists! It solved the previous game's problem of being a little predictable by having multiple side missions with their own little story focusing on some of the villains of the past. CONS- Goddammit, Riddler, you still prove to be annoying with your trophy collectibles, but now you come back with some really easy puzzles to solve for his side case. - A little short for the main story, but this is the type of game that you don't just focus on the main story. Its not really a complaint against it, you should focus on getting the most out of this game, not just the main campaign.- Post-game story uses a better way to fight bosses that aren't used for the main game. A little unforunate, since it was definitely more interesting to try and stealth takedown a boss than rushing at them announced.			"

												Don't let the hours fool you. I have a lot of hours on the PS3 version i just recently decided to get the PC version. I have to honestly say this is one of the best games I have played in a while. Everything about this game i just love about it. The combat feels great. And I love the story of the Arkham games and this one to me doesnt dissappoint me at all. The pc port of this game feels like a really good port despite the specs i have i still can run this game rather well and still have a wonderful time with it. And like with the other Arkham games the riddler is here and boy are there a lot of stuff to do with especially since this is the Game Of The Year edition. Now I'm gonna talk about the combat. If you have played either Arkham Asylum or Orgins then the combat will feel the same. Arkham city's combat really feels perfect i can't really find a fault with it. If you have ever played sleeping dogs then this combat will feel the same. Now about the riddler there are a lot of riddles and riddler trophies to collect since this is the GOTY edition. If you enjoyed getting all of them in Asylum/Origins then you will enjoy getting them here. Now i haven't gotten all of them yet on the PS3 version but i do plan on getting all of them on here. Ill try to get talk about some of the story. The story begins with Catwomen trying to steal from Two-Face but then gets caught then the game cuts to bruce wayne getting shocked by Hugo Strange then a flashback happens and shows Bruce at the gates of Arkham City's gate saying how Arkham city is destorying the fine city of Gotham and he wants it shut down then he gets captured. Fast forward to bruce getting shocked and hugo strange saying how by the end of the night he will be a hero thanks to protocol 10. Its up to you Batman to figure out what protocol 10 is and shut it down before its too late. And one last thing the music Oh my god is it amazing. Every track fits what is going on. Buy the soundtrack if you love it. The soundtrack can be found on itunes. Overall I would give this game a 9/10. It is an amazing game and I feel like everyone should play it if you have the specs for it. And as of this theres a sale for it where its only 5 bucks. Get it while its on sale you will not be disappointed.			"

												Nagyon jó játék volt. A sztori érdekes volt, végig fenntartotta a figyelmet, voltak benne különösen jó pillanatok. A szereplők is nagyon jók voltak, a szinkronhangok is tetszettek. El lettek találva a játékbeli elemek. Jó ötletem tartom, hogy nem csak Batman-nel kellett játszani a játék során. A harcrendszer, a különféle újabb, és újabb ellenféltípusok is nagyon tetszettek. Egy-egy harcban eléggé meg lehetett izzadni, főleg, hogy egyszerre 3-4-5 fajta ellenséggel is kellett harcolni, és mind ellen más-más technikát kellett alkalmazni. A skillrendszer is tetszett, jó volt fejlesztgetni Batman képességeit, a kütyüim képességét, vagy akár Macskanőt. A Rébuszokkal is elvoltam, bár volt, amit nem tudtam megcsinálni, nem is kevés. A bossfight-ok különösképp jók voltak, bár azok nem voltak annyira nehezek, viszont annál inkább lehetett izgulni, hogy le tudjuk győzni az adott ellenfelet. Többször előfordult, hogy elakadtam, és hosszú ideig nem jöttem rá, hogy most mi a fenét is kellene csinálnom, de ez csak a játék mellett áll, ettől lesz egy Batman játék igazi Batman játék. Hisz mint tudjuk, ő a világ legnagyobb nyomozója, és nem csak egy agyatlan darálógép, így az Asylum-ból már megszokott környezeti puzzle-kből sem volt hiány -- már önmagában az a 400 Rébusz kihívás is nagyon sok agyalást, és gondolkodást követel, és ezt nagyon pozitív értelemben mondom. Tehát az egész játék a tetejétől a talpáig teljesen kiváló volt. Mindenkinek ajánlom a játékot, aki szereti Batman-t, esetleg csak szeretne egy jó sztorival rendelkező, játszásra érdemes játékkal foglalkozni. Azok is nyugodtan játszhatnak vele, akik az előző részt kihagyták. A játék nem túl hosszú, de rengeteg tartalom van benne, ha akarunk eltölthetünk 30-40 órát is, mire mindent megcsinálunk benne. Megérte végigjátszani! Kíváncsian várom az Origins-t, valószínűleg azt is elkezdem a közeljövőben.			"

												A great sequel to a masterpiece of a game. Batman Arkham City took all the great points from Batman Arkham Asylum and combined them with the concept of an open world game - beautifully. I recommend you to play Batman AA before playing Batman AC to fully enjoy yourself.Pros:+ GREAT story, many new and interesting characters are added to this sequel. + GREAT gameplay. + GREAT fighting system. Free Flow Combat is still implemented beautifully. + GREAT array of classic and new gadgets, allowing you to takedown enemies with your own style. + GREAT sound. + GREAT atmosphere. + GREAT graphics. + GREAT characters and voice acting, the characters really felt like they are coming right out of the comics. + GREAT and beautiful open world. Arkham City is a big world with so many things to do beside the main story, such as side missions, collectibles, challenges, and more villains to kick.Cons:- Catwoman's ""Thief Vision"" is blurry and kinda hurt my eyes, but still acceptable.  Overall: 99/100BE THE BATMAN			"

												Batman Arkham City was one of my personal favourite games. This game used to be one of the best games a few years back .If you play this game before Arkham orgins you will find  that a lot of things are much better mainly the story and the ending.*SPOILER ALERT* I know it sucks that joker had to die at the end but that doent affect the calibre of the game. You can play as catwoman and play her missions . Guys i think shes much hotter than the catwoman in arkham knight. She is sexy as ♥♥♥♥ (she even kisses her enemies while fighting). The story is without doubt better than arkham origins althoug it doesnt have better detective mode and the batplane. I think that the game is worth buying at a sale or you can always download it from torrent since this game doesnt have much multiplayer content.			"

COMPLETED 100%Decent game with the same excellent gameplay mechanics. Story however is pretty inconsistent; like how the heck did Batman keep up with his same performance despite being infected ill for 90% of the game? The whole main story isn't that long, in fact, it's pretty darn short if you just ignored all the riddler trophies and side missions.  Combat system is quite improved from Asylum but it becomes easy as pie once you master it.Arkham City is mostly cramped and tiny in size but does offer many incentives to explore (mostly riddler stuff). What's amazing is how the game is completely flawless from glitches/bugs throughout my entire playthrough. Real neat work.			"

												I didn't enjoy Arkham City as much as Arkham Asylum, but it's still a great game and good continuation of the story. Everything else feels pretty much the same, which is a good thing... plus some new gadgets.What Arkham Asylum did better: the whole reality breaking psychological tricks were much better in Arkham AsylumWhat Arkham City did better: gave the opportunity to perch high and look down on the city, also gave additional playable characters that fit into the story with different gameplay stylesScarecrow (who didn't make a return in Arkham City) is one of my favourite villains, and I love the reality breaking stuff so it stands to reason that I'd like the first game better, however both games absolutely deliver on what their titles promise: Batman in an asylum and Batman in a city.

												If you haven't played this game yet then I can assure you that you've missed out big time, buddy.Batman: Arkham City is without a doubt one of the most fun I've ever had playing a single-player game. And I'm not just saying that because I am a huge Batman fan: No, the gameplay and story itself are impeccably executed by Rocksteady Studios. As you progress through the main (and side) missions you'll have the opporunity to fight through a vast majority of the caped crusader's rogue gallery, each of whom present a great challenge and intriguing conflict to the player. You'll find yourself wanting to know what comes next and who is really behind the launch of Arkham City. The most important aspect of any game, however, is arguably the gameplay. To date I have seen very, very few games that offer such a fun and smooth combat system as presented by the Arkham games. Obviously many games have tried to emulate this flawless and freeflowing fighting system that Arkham City brings to the table, but none have even come close in my opinion.Especially considering how cheap this game has become I must insist that Batman: Arkham City is an absolute must-have for every gamer out there.

												Welcome to Arkham City the massive hub of riddler trophies and secrets... If you thought that the riddler collectables had a too big presence in the Asylum, you are out of luck. They are everywhere here. And they aren't exactly hidden, oh no, the green question marks are everywhere and they will spam you in the face even after you are done with him... four hundred riddler challenges/secrets for batman and forty for catwoman. This time riddler isn't alone, no he wants to force you to play with him, so if you are immersed in the role of crime fighter you have to find four hundred secrets in order to free the hostages!!! Frustrating and annoying affair. Making what should be an optional side objective at best feel like it is taking over the game... It really is the biggest down of this game.The bosses were all interesting encounters this time around, with different methods of taking them down. But the thugs... Damn there are a lot in an open city where they respawn. And they get way too repetitive.I preferred the atmosphere in Asylum, but this game is still dripping with that whole batman vibe, and you get to see a lot of the batman cast in your adventure in Arkham city. If your favorite is a more unknown character, there is still a chance that she/he won't be mentioned or appear.In the main campaign you get to play as batman and for some portions as Catwoman, who for some reason doesn't close her costume all the way... I mean it clearly looks like it can be zipped up all the way like normal, but for some reason she lets it be unzipped enough to reveal her cleavege. Maybe she thinks she will be a better thief if she distracts twoface and batman with breasts? But honestly I enjoyed playing as catwoman. I love the way she moves and her fight animation. All the voice acting is great as well as the character designs really fitting with the different personalities. Except for cat-cleavage... I'm sorry, but it really annoy me. Every time her front was on the screen I wanted to go over there and zip it up.The main story was interesting and had a shocking finish. Well shocking for those who hadn't seen spoilers. And even then you might not have seen all the spoilers related to the finish. I had heard the main one, but was still surprised at the end.I will recommend it to any fan of batman and action games, as long as you can stomach a grind for riddler secrets...			"

												Nagyon jó játék volt. A sztori érdekes volt, végig fenntartotta a figyelmet, voltak benne különösen jó pillanatok. A szereplők is nagyon jók voltak, a szinkronhangok is tetszettek. El lettek találva a játékbeli elemek. Jó ötletem tartom, hogy nem csak Batman-nel kellett játszani a játék során. A harcrendszer, a különféle újabb, és újabb ellenféltípusok is nagyon tetszettek. Egy-egy harcban eléggé meg lehetett izzadni, főleg, hogy egyszerre 3-4-5 fajta ellenséggel is kellett harcolni, és mind ellen más-más technikát kellett alkalmazni. A skillrendszer is tetszett, jó volt fejlesztgetni Batman képességeit, a kütyüim képességét, vagy akár Macskanőt. A Rébuszokkal is elvoltam, bár volt, amit nem tudtam megcsinálni, nem is kevés. A bossfight-ok különösképp jók voltak, bár azok nem voltak annyira nehezek, viszont annál inkább lehetett izgulni, hogy le tudjuk győzni az adott ellenfelet. Többször előfordult, hogy elakadtam, és hosszú ideig nem jöttem rá, hogy most mi a fenét is kellene csinálnom, de ez csak a játék mellett áll, ettől lesz egy Batman játék igazi Batman játék. Hisz mint tudjuk, ő a világ legnagyobb nyomozója, és nem csak egy agyatlan darálógép, így az Asylum-ból már megszokott környezeti puzzle-kből sem volt hiány -- már önmagában az a 400 Rébusz kihívás is nagyon sok agyalást, és gondolkodást követel, és ezt nagyon pozitív értelemben mondom. Tehát az egész játék a tetejétől a talpáig teljesen kiváló volt. Mindenkinek ajánlom a játékot, aki szereti Batman-t, esetleg csak szeretne egy jó sztorival rendelkező, játszásra érdemes játékkal foglalkozni. Azok is nyugodtan játszhatnak vele, akik az előző részt kihagyták. A játék nem túl hosszú, de rengeteg tartalom van benne, ha akarunk eltölthetünk 30-40 órát is, mire mindent megcsinálunk benne. Megérte végigjátszani! Kíváncsian várom az Origins-t, valószínűleg azt is elkezdem a közeljövőben.			"

												Batman: Arkham City is what you get when a studio isn't trying and is content to rest on its laurels. Other than the half-hearted attempt at an open world setting, nothing stands out as being an improvement on the previous game and many things that Arkham Asylum did well were completely fumbled here.A brave game, trying new ideas while trying to stay fundamentally similar. Naturaly there are weaknesses in the recipe that Rocksteady has created - I can't say that the open world approach won me over.But despite that Arkham City is still a very strong game.			"

												Story is okay, the ending was kind of foreshadowed. I do like the combat and being able to use batarangs and other gadgets  in combat. The skins while not necesary or even available during the story are nice and quite welll made. The challenge mode is fantastic, being able to play as Robin and Nightwing who both have different moves in combat. Overall a very fun game and would reccommend to a Batman or even comic fan.			"

												A fantastic sequel to a fantastic game! I would recommend this to anyone who likes stealth-games and beat-'em-ups. It definitely improves on a lot of things from the first game, such as more upgrades and more fun way to take down enemies. I can't decide whether I like the changes made to the detective mode. I feel it is mostly a change made to make things harder, so you're not constantly in detective mode, scanning for enemies. It is now easier for enemies to destroy gargoyles, which means stealth becomes harder. Another improvement is that you get the batclaw, the explosive gel and the cry-something-hacker-device.With the GOTY-edition you get all the DLC, which there is a lot of, for example the Catwoman-pach which lets you play as catwoman from time to time, which makes combat completely different as Catwoman has different combat tools. If this doesn't convince you, just watch the trailer, which is fantastic.			"

												This game is awesome. The storyline is engaging (albeit short), the gameplay is smooth and easy to learn, the graphics are pretty good, and the staggering amount of side missions and game modes ensures that you won't run out of things to do for a very long time. The game is set in a detailed open-world mini city, with little side missions everywhere. There is also a bonus level, an alternate version of the storyline, and challenge maps that require you to beat up thugs by the truckful, along with the delightful predator mode gameplay, which is basically hiding in a high place and swooping in to take out your enemies before they know what hit them. If that wasn't enough, Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing are playable characters in various game modes. This is a great game. Get it and you won't regret it.			"

												Follow up to Arkham Asylum, the game that brought Batman to the realm of kickass gaming. In the same vein as its predecessor, Arkham City stylishly blends visual and conceptual elements from the Nolanverse, the Burtonverse, and most of all (and most importantly IMO), the Timmverse.Pros: Interesting story, but don't think that just because many of The Animated Series voice actors are involved that this is part of the TAS continuity. Many liberties were taken, but it all plays out pretty well, and pays enough homage to the DCAU to keep us 1990s Saturday Morning Cartoon kids pleased. An excellent arsenal of familiar and loveable characters. Amazing voice acting (of course). This is sadly, Mark Hamill's final outing as The Joker, ending his reign as one of the greatest and most iconic Joker portrayals in history, in my opinion only slightly behind Heath Ledger in the Number One spot.Combat that is fluid, easy enough for just about anyone to get used to, and fun enough to keep you wanting more.Cons: Really terrible third-person navigation. This doesn't affect the main story campaign so much, you can make it work well enough, but for a lot of the quick, tricky maneuvers required for the Extreme Challenge missions it becomes a real Bane. Want to grapple to that vantage point in a hurry? Too bad, you're going to grapple to this ledge with people on it instead. Need to dive over this railing to escape gunfire? Too bad, because Batman can't navigate around this short banister. Environmental circumstances must be JUST RIGHT to perform certain maneuvers, and that is really uncool. Don't expect this Batman to navigate obstacles like a ninja when the action gets intense. He's more like Russell Casse from Independence Day (""I'm fly... I'm pilot""). On Extreme Challenge Campaigns, this causes controller-chucking rage episodes. /rantMaybe it's just me, but the story mode campaign seemed a bit on the short side. I have not yet begun New Game Plus, but I definitely finished my first playthrough wishing there was more to it. I think that one contribution to this feeling is the fact that they crammed so many big-name foes that none of them really get enough screentime and a lot of them seem to come and go way too quickly. Take your time, explore everything, do all the things. All in all:I definitely recommend the game, especially if it's on sale. It's worth it for the main game. Add in the buttloads of concept art, character dossiers, and REALLY cool alternative character skins for the playable characters (yes, including really funny 3D adaptations of their TAS counterparts). I'm raging my way through the bonus missions, and I do plan on playing through the game again, gunning for full completion.			"

												Did you ever watch Batman: The Animated Series? Does a deep orchestra ever bring up thoughts of a dark and dangerous Gotham night into your head? Then this is the game for you! It takes everything from Arkham Asylum that was good and makes it better. Swinging from rooftop to rooftop alone will bring out the kid in you. The voice acting is great, the gameplay awesome, and the hero is mother ♥♥♥♥ing Batman. Perhaps one of the best games I played this year. The only reason why I'm not giving it a perfect score is the combat can sometimes get a little repetative, and there are not always great opportunities to use your gadgets.9.5/10.0			"

Great story, great acting, lovely soundtrack, brilliant atmosphere inside Arkham and the ambient sounds floating in from greater Gotham. Plenty of villians and action, interesting side questions, a New Game+ mode that is a cool take on replay (play again with all gadgets, but without the warning cues when thugs attack). Play as Catwoman to mix up the gameplay. Very Batman. Very cool! :)			"

												Possibly the greatest action adventure game of this (past) generation. That generic genre descriptor really does apply for all the Arkham games though: there’s a lot of action, and you constantly feel like you’re on an adventure. Rocksteady capitalizes on the foundations of Asylum and takes the series along for a ride on the open-world bandwagon; however, they do so in a way that makes their AAA competitors simply look dull and slow. There’s a great feeling of speed and environmental mastery as you use your grapple and cape, upgraded here as a slingshot mechanism that hurls you into the air before bobbing down to maintain lift. Gadgets are now incorporated into your combat repetoire; A-list villains are actually given their due with some impressive boss encounters; the Catwoman chapter is short but immensely fun; environmental puzzles are more complex while the Riddler challenges are compulsively fun to track down and complete. You want to know how to make your collectathon mini games fun? Make them inherently fun, not because they reward a shiny or an achievement or feed your OCD (although all those are legit reasons). 'City' is packed with fun stuff to do.There’s just more of Arkham here: more characters, an expanded moveset, bigger and more diverse environments, more DC universe shoutouts and fanbait (the terrible Harley Quinn DLC is one such tease). It’s the ‘Batman Returns’ of the franchise: a louder and campier sequel that raises the fun quotient significantly, even if it comes at the cost of some narrative and design tightness.			"

												After playing Arkham Knight, would sugget that this is the best game in the series. Not because of all the bugs Arkham Knight had but because of a very closely linked story, nice narration and the free flow combat system. I story unravels very nicely with all the characters being an important part of the game(except for Riddler, God knows why is he still there). The graphics are neat and the music backs the pace of the game very well. The stealth sequesnce are very well designed with a lot of attention given to details.Its a must buy for all the Batman fans.			"

												Certainly falls short of Arkham Asylum in one aspect: Asylum felt closed, tense you really felt you're locked together with a bunch of crazies. Arkham City just couldn't be better in that aspect, once you're in an environment of such size it is impossible to get the same kind of athmosphere.On the other hand combat has seen a huge improvement, the environment and designs are brilliant, the strory is allright. Overall: Although the more sandboxy feel watered it up a bit it is the better game and THE bestest comic book hero game I've played with so far.			"

												The Dark Knight/ Violent Saint returns in Arkham CityStoryThe story is written by Batman TAS veteran Paul Dini. Billionaire Bruce Wayne attends a press conference speaking against Gotham's latest project Arkham City. Arkham City is a walled off part of Gotham that houses all of the criminals from Arkham Asylum and Blackgate. There are no guards other than the Tyger mercenaries who rarely intervene, no cells and food drop-offs are not overseen by Tyger. Worse off gang wars occur in Arkham City with the powerful super criminals obtaining military grade weapons somehow. At the conference Bruce Wayne is taken by Tyger and the founder of Arkham City, Dr. Hugo Strange, reveals to Wayne that he knows he is Batman. He also tells him of Protocol 10 and how it will make him famous. With Hugo Strange obviously being a conniving piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Wayne dons the mask of Batman and sets off to find out more about Protocol 10. But he later on faces more obstacles that all connect in one big story.GameplayThe freeflow combat is back and better than ever. You can counter multiple people and you have more quickfire combat weapons like the explosive gel and the freeze bombs. You also have more combo takedowns like a barrage of bats that disorient enemies, a barrage of batarangs that instantly incapacitate anyone laying on their backs, and more. The best thing about Arkham City is the open world. You have an entire city to explore along with the buildings that house the super criminals like the Penguin, Joker, and more. There are also side objectives you can do like break Tyger cameras just to make them mad, stop Zsasz from killing innocent people by making it from one payphone to another, finding a contract killer, and more. The missions in Arkham City are actually interesting to me. Most open world games I play have boring missions in my opinion and I really don't care about killing innocent civilians in GTA even if they are annoying. You can beat up random people and that is more satisfactory in my opinion. Arkham City has the full package.Catwoman seems like someone they added at the last minute though. She has her own upgrades so you think she will play a big role but she doesn't really. I will spoil what she does. She tries to steal something from Strange so she needs Poison Ivy to help. She fights Poison Ivy's plant slaves and then is captured by Ivy and is hung upside down. This happens early in the game. Later on Ivy lets her go if she promises to rescue her plant from Strange. The funny thing about this is that between her being captured and Ivy letting her go 10 HOURS HAVE PASSED and the game is near the end. So what you are saying is that Ivy hung Catwoman upside down for 10 hours in front of her face and did nothing for 10 hours? That is why I feel she was added at the last minute. After you beat the game you can play as her with her own sidequest (I am still on that) and so far it's pretty decent but in the main story her involvement is virtually nonexistent in the scope of the whole story (she did save Batman but big deal he could've flexed those rocks off of himself.)Wonderful game all around and I haven't even touched the Riddler's Revenge challenge maps or Harley Quinn's Revenge.EDIT: There is a mistake I would like to correct. I thought that Catwoman was held up by Ivy for 10 hours but when Catwoman says ""It looks like he will be in there a while.."" she is looking at the enterance to Wonder Tower not the Steel Mill. Despite this I still think she doesn't add much to the story.			"

												This is the best game I have played on PC but that isn't saying much condidering I have a horrible computer and a low budget. But that brings up a point. My computer is horrid and can still run this game almost completely without lag which means it could probably run well on other dispicable computers. It also has a great story that is quite long but sadly you can't replay a specific mission so if you want to replay a section of the story you're gonna have to start from scratch. It has great graphics, nice voice acting, and amazing gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, it is quite unique. It has pretty great replayability, a variety of stealth takedowns, great combat, and of course, free roaming. There are two differnt types of maps, predator and combat. Combat is prett straight forward but predator is all based around stealth. You could go in guns a blazing but that will most likely get you killed. So you go in with a smile on your face and do some hardcore planning to takedown  4 guys at a time,or maybe that's just me. The combat is great too though. You have many different moves and combos that allow complete maneuverability in combat and you can leave almost any fight without a scratch if you are skilled enough (Like me). The DLC makes it even better. It allows you to be other characters with a wide variety of abilities and gadgets. Oh, I almost forgot to tell about the gadgets. There are a lot and every single one is extremely helpful. You can use many gadgets in combat and of course all of them in predator that are all nothing like the next. There are so many other things that I could tell you about but I would have to think about and I am too lazy so you're just gonna have to go on youtube or something and look it up or maybe buy this amazing game.

												As I rewrite this, the meta rating is 96% positive. What should that say to you?I love this game. Open world but not oversized. Freeflow combat but not insanely overwhelming. Gadgets but not so many you feel overloaded. Story galore. Each street has its own tale. All the major baddies. Most of the secondaries. Catwoman pulls the camera back just enough to show another valid POV. The Story has the entierty of the dark knight saga behind it but never trily shys away from the fact that it's Batman versus himself and his own demons given form in the Joker. It continues stories from the first game, adds a little more in but never once does it ever dissappoint me in my eyes.It's a game that I play on the TV and my kids play it with me or treat it as a movie.

												oh! Batman is back and with him a new adventure in Gotham City. This time you're in a super-prison unlike Arkham Asylum, you are in a city now, where there are thugs everywhere and all super criminals are fighting each other for territory everywhere. This game have the best fighting system I've tried so far, even the Predator missions or parts of the game greatly improved from its predecessor, making the game a great experience. If you have the opportunity to have the DLC's you will have the change to play as Robin and Nightwing in the Riddler's challenges, plus Harley Quinn revenge game extension, lots and lots of stuff to do in this game to reach 100% completion. So, stop thinking about it and join the Dark Knight in this fun adventure!... (since the game was moved to GFWL, all of hours spent in the game are in the non-GOTY version)			"

												After playing Arkham Asylum, I was thirsty for more. This sequel proved what a sequel should do. Batman Arkham City expanded and improved upon what was already great for a Batman game. A smoother combat and stealth system and additonal tactics for taking out bad guys made this game incredibly replayable. I first bought this game on the Xbox 360, and I just had to to get it again for my PC. This game creates great sub-plots and introduces popular villains that were previously just referenced in Arkham Asylum. The first of the series felt repetitive with a simple combat system of ""punch and counter"" and fixes it with new enemies and moves that challenge you to utilize new combat moves. The only downsides to this game are the ridiculous amounts of Riddler trophies to collect, and the downplay of certain big-name villains such as Bane. Overall, this is a must-buy.			"

												Picked this up when it was on sale for £3.78 or something. Was definately worth its price. This is a better game than its predecessor Arkham Asylum, as the open world is just amazing to fly and run around in and the side missions help give the game life again after the main story ends. There is a large amount of gameplay options as you can play as different characters (Batman+Catwoman+maybe robin), who all have their own unique gadgets. Furthermore the stealth options in gameplay were also very fun, as it always keeps the player on their toes and thinking about which guard to pick off next. However, the face-to-face combat is also nice, as its quick yet brutal.7/10 Good gameplay and story, and allows for different variety of options to take out enemies.			"

												What can I say about this one? In a nutshell, it's fantastic. If your rig can handle the higher settings, this is still a STUNNING looking game. Combat is fantastic, intuitive, and just plain fun. The story was well worth it to me. You can either blow through the main story in a dozen or less hours, but if you invest in the side missions, riddler challenges, expect to spend a considerable amount of time in Arkham City.Bigger is not always better. Arkham City is larger in scope than its predecessor, Arkham Asylum, but is modest in size compared to other open world games today. What we do have here is an amazing attention to detail that left me simply staring at the scenery.The Riddler challenges require some patience. For some, they will seem overwhelming - just keep in mind that like the prior game, not all challenges can be done immediately. Certain upgrades will be required. Once those are, most challenges make sense and are surprisingly addictive to find!The Ending? FantasticThe voice acting? Fantastic?I played this on consoles when it first came out, but in some ways I felt like I was playing for the first time, thanks to the PC setting option - no comparisons. Never played it on PC, then you need to check out the game again!!!M "

												Gonna start off by being honest and saying I am 100% a Marvel fanboy. I absolutely love Marvel's movies and comics more than DC. However, I find Batman to be one of the coolest superheroes ever created.But with my Marvel fanboyness in mind... This is one of the best superhero games of all time, far surpassing almost any other that comes to mind. The sheer fluidity of the game, the takedowns, the well crafted story everything just comes together to make one of the best games of all time. Heck, this is one of the few games that actually let's you play your way, for the most part, with stealth or loud as an option. And enemies react based on what you're doing. If you take down all of their friends, they become scared. If they have all of their friends up and standing, they become more confident and taunting. There are so few games that make use of fear as something enemies exeperience, and it works so well for a Batman game.Rocksteady knows how to use Batman's story in the best way possible, and it makes me sad to know there's only one more game after this one. Buy this game at full price, it's worth it.			"

												This game is an incredible improvement on the gameplay front compared to Asylum. The freeflow combat system is incredibly fun, and even better than before thanks to new enemy types, new gadgets, and, most importantly, significantly tightened up controls. People who played the previous game will know all those annoying situations when your punch happens to be just a bit too slow to stop an attack, or a counter not working. That happens extremely rarely now - whenever you break your combo, it is your fault. The predator sections are also more fun now, as the enemy henchmen now use their own gadgets to mess up your strategies, like the detective mode-disrupting jammers and mines, which you can also use against them.If you haven't played Asylum, well, prepare for one of the best combat systems in a game, ever. I am not overexaggerating. The freeflow combat system is incredibly simple to leare, but fun and has a lot of depth. It is used in fights with up to 40 unarmed or melee-armed henchmen. It's basics are simple: punch, dodge and counter, but add in the whole different layer of gadgets and special combos, and you really feel like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Batman. The predator sections are a whole different beast: up to 10 armed henchment in open rooms force you to play stealthily, swinging from vantage point to vantage point to take them out one by one. There are a lot of different ways to do this, from a simple takedown from the back to dragging your enemies over railings, blowing up walls and knocking them out with debris, and my personal favourite, disabling their guns, then dropping right in front of them and watching them struggle helplessly as you pummel them into sleep. There are just so many ways to approach an objective, that I can't help but adore these sections.This game adds a free roaming element to the series, and while it is by no means as developed in full-blown sandboxes, it really ties the game together quite nicely. There are a few sidequests which revolve around you catching various (super)criminals in the titular Arkham City, and they do not feel shoehorned in, although there could certainly be more of them. Simply put, don't buy this game just for the open world, as you will regret it if you do. The riddler trophies and riddles return, and they feel far better thanks to the open world. There is more of them, they give better rewards, and it is easier to find them thanks to the new informant system.As for the story, well, it is really the only weaker side of this game, at least when compared to Asylum. The linear structure of the last game lent itself far better to the type of story Rocksteady was trying to tell, but it is still by no means bad. Still, the big plot twist at the end is far too easy to spot, and the characters feel weaker than they did in the last game.The length of the game is around 8 hours, should you just want to complete the main story. However, 100%ing the game will take far more, which should prove really nice for a completionist like me: Besides the aforementioned riddler trophies and sidequests, there is a new game+ with tougher enemies and combat, but you start with all your gadgets, rather than aquiring them over the course of the plot, a 2-3 hour story DLC, and an incredibly large challenge mode.This challenge mode is a bit hit and miss: some people will find it very repetitive. What you need to know is that it can add around 10-20 hours of entertainment, should you choose to complete it.TL:DR;Chances are, you will really like this game if you liked Arkham Asylum.  If you haven't played it or didn't like Asylum, well, you will probably still like it. All in all, this a really good game and one of my favourite games ever, and I would recommend anyone to try it.			"

												At first I thought they couldn't make anything better than Arkham Asylum, but I was proven wrong. This game is incredibly improved, much better controls, packed with extra content, new gadgets, new side-missions, new characters and enemies... They really went hardcore with this game. The single-player campaign is good and entertaining, but rather short and bosses are too easy, but they realized that and added an ""extreme"" mode, which is too difficult XDThe GOTY edition has all the DLCs and many different modes for you to play so you'll never get bored.The graphics are outstanding, but leave PhysX disabled if you don't have 2 or more GPUs in SLI. The game still uses UE3 but has bigger environments so you might experience some stutterings and slowdowns depending on your hardware. Loading times have decreased, though.You don't need to play the first one before this one, since it's a completely different story, but you'll get familiar with the controls more quickly if you played Arkham Asylum.Soundtrack is as epic as the first game.

												The gameplay is top notch. The stealth, but especially the combat, are much improved since the first game. The fluidity of its ""easy to learn, hard to master"" combat mechanics puts stuff like ""Assassin's Creed"" (with its silly hold block until you can counter kill simplicity) to shame. In fact, I'm hard pressed to think of another third person game which has better hand to hand combat than ""Batman: AC.""The open world is a nice touch too, even though alot of the side quests are kind of a pain and best left alone given that they tend to be of the ""find x number of hidden objects on a map, then fight a boss"" variety. The main plot is better, but never really matches the highs of ""Arkham Asylum."" It tries to cram every single Batman villain ever into one overarching storyline, and not only does this stretch credulity even in comic book terms, but individual segments feel rushed and lack the depth of ""Arkham Asylum"" (which focused on relatively fewer villains). Still, if you approach it more as a series of slightly interrelated episodes rather than one grand story the game works much better. Despite its flaws it surpasses the original in most respects and in terms of pure gameplay might be the best third person action game on the market; definitely more polished, better made, and way more fun than any given Assassin's Creed game.

												Batman: Arkham City is just as good as (maybe even better than) the previous title in the Batman: Arkham series! I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it. From the gameplay that makes you feel like the Batman himself, to the joy of flying around Arkham City, helping political prisoners from getting beaten up by thugs and finding the Riddler's trophies. If you're a major fan of Batman or just superheroes in general, this is a MUST-BUY for you! It really is just that simple!!Without delving into the game's story and giving away key details, I will just say that the story is nothing short of movie-quality action. Batman is my favourite superhero of them all, and so I couldn't help from getting excited everytime a cutscene would come on, because the voice-acting and character animations are just superb! The music is true to the franchise too and, if you're familiar with the dark world that the latest movies are set in, you will find that this game perfectly represents the world that Batman is set in.One of the best parts of the game is the gameplay itself. Aside from the ability to glide around the city, grappling to gargoyles and rooftops in order to get to places, the combat is what you will be most interested in. Some would argue that it's a simple system of having to attack, counter, attack, counter, and so on. But in the later stages of the game, you will have to learn the movesets of certain enemies that are of a greater risk to you. Facing off multiple enemies with guns, though, will require you to take them out in a stealthy manner. This is where your gear and gadgets come into full play. From the classy batarang to the grenade-like freeze blast, there are plenty of weapons at your disposal to use.So with the game staying true to the Batman franchise, and the gameplay being spot on, the only thing left to discuss are the visuals. Simply put, they are great, and so I have nothing to complain about with them. Even on my 7 year old system (which was close to mid-range at the time) can run this game. And on top of all of this great news, this is the GOTY edition, so you will be able to enjoy things such as Catwoman's storyline, intertwined with Batman's! Definitely get this game, you won't regret it!Enjoy! :D			"

												I asked my friends wich batman game i should play. They told me to buy Arkham City, that i would have more fun than the others. So, i bought it, and inject Batman in my vains for a couple of days. This game is awsome. The bad thing is that it has a short story. Everything happened very fast, and in a blink of eye the game is over. At least there is more Batman for play, Origins, Asylum and soon Knight. Already bought Origins o/			"

												-Prologue-I'm going to try and do this review without going into too much detail and without any spoilers from Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, so if there are parts that are lacking from my review, it's because they are tied into the story.Batman: Arkham City is the second in the Arkham series, and I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy it thoroughly. I bought it in the recent Summer Sale for $5, which is a real steal. After the 17 Gb download, I was ready to plunge into this brilliant game, after being impressed by Arkham Asylum. It's beautiful scenery down to it's simplistic but engaging combat and it's amazing character potrayals. With that said, Arkham City does the exact same thing, except we're taken to the whole of Arkham Island. The city has been made to an excellent quality, and I couldn't help but get lost in it's picturesque beauty, despite being in a ghetto-like area.The storyline was enjoyable with enough action and adventure to keep you occupied. In regards to length, I got through the main missions and objectives in about 7 hours with the odd sidequest here and there. The main missions (or quest, if you will) were interesting, but some objectives were only put in to either extend gameplay time or frustrate the player. This bothered me at points, but I kept going for the delectable reward which would be a boss fight or a cutscene, which is all acted and set excellently, as you would expect. Villains felt amazingly recreated, and I loved every single one. Not to mention the Joker, who by far was the most interesting one of them all, which once again would be expected. Now, coming out of Arkham Asylum, I was quite disappointed about his potrayal at the end, as it was the polar opposite of what the Joker stood for, but without getting into too much detail about that, I'll move on. In Arkham City, you see less of the Joker than compared to Arkham Asylum, but that's to make way for the other villains such as Two Face, The Penguin, Catwoman (in a sense), Mr Freeze, etc. This wasn't a bad choice, but I really did the interactions with the Joker, but every conversation or cutscene with him was savoured and was enjoyable to witness.To sum up the storyline, we move on about 6 months from the events of Arkham Asylum and the Joker has fallen ill from a disease (which it's origins are explained in AA) and so, with his final hours on the horizon, he is in need of a cure. While in the mean time, another villain comes into the picture by the name of Hugo Strange, who is hell bent on executing 'Protocol 10' and it's up to the Dark Knight to stop it, at all costs. The idea was good, and I liked how they went about it, but I feel it could've felt a lot more alive and engaging if they were to incorporate more villains into the story. Of course, that's not to say that I didn't enjoy the villains that they did include into the main story; I thought they were brilliantly played and potrayed, but more of that was needed. I found myself questioning the result of what I was doing because I found the objectives dull and grindish in a way, but the outcome was interesting interations with them, and that's what kept me going throughout the whole game.The basis of the game, the combat system, is simplistic as mentioned before, with Left Click your primary attack and Right Click being your counter attack, alongside your gadgets which are all able of use in combat situations. This made for interesting firefights and it always remained fresh, if using the gadgets, which I did infrequently as I saw no point if my basic attacks would get me through the game. If you choose to take combat like me and just click the hell out of your mouse, then you're in for an interesting time. It's effective, but it does get dull quickly, which is where this game falls short of a prolonged enjoyment in combat. Initially, you go around looking for fights and you get excited for your next fight. Then as time passes, you try to find ways around fights and you're flying pass every opportunity to engage the enemy and they just become an annoyance more than anything. The developers tried their best to keep it interesting with the addition of extra enemy types and different move types, but these were short lived revivals, and they soon became part of the common fodder of boring combat.Stealth was one of the many strong points of Batman: Arkham City, which was interesting throughout the whole game in my opinion. I had a lot of fun in every situation that involved stealth, and it got me using tactics and patience. This was another part of the game that was done to a superb degree, and I'm sure most players would agree.The boss fights were interesting and quite enjoyable. They were designed really nicely, and they weren't too unbalanced/frustrating, nor were they too easy. You'll definitely have your favourites when playing through the game, and some you wish would just end with the next blow, but I never felt that urge to give up due to difficulty or the fact I disliked it. It's expected that the boss fights be amazing, but this is definitely not a note to glance over.If you purchased the Game of the Year Edition, depending on how much of a Batman fan you are, you'll enjoy it on different levels. If you're a die-hard fan like me, then you'll love the additional (and playable) character models from some of the comic books and the TV series for Batman and Catwoman. There are additional challenges available, but no one buys this game for the challenges, let's be honest here. Along with that, you'll get the Catwoman campaign which comes with 4 missions with Catwoman and more collectables which are just for her, you cannot collect them if you're playing as Batman which I thought was quite smart. You'll also get 'Harley Quinn's Revenge', which is the final chapter to the story of Arkham City, as by the end of the game, you'll definitely want more. I can assure you that you will want more, and the developers responded with this little DLC.To sum up, the performance was smooth on max settings without the DX11 additions enabled, and that's with my GTX 650, which I thought was quite impressive. The challenges you will glance over because you'll play them when you have nothing better to do. The information that the game provides about the characters of the Batman universe is brilliant for people who want to know a little more about their favourite characters. The 3D 'trophies' that you unlock over time look fantastic and are nice to look at every once and a while. Although Arkham Island can be a little dull to explore, and some objectives are grueling, you'll definitely enjoy the results that come. With interesting characters executed in a brilliant way and an atmospheric world, you'll love the eerie nature that is Batman: Arkham Asylum. Although your playtime for main missions is at 7~ hours, you'll still have plenty more hours to put into side missions and for completionists, you have plenty to keep you occupied for quite a while.I'll give this an 8.5/10			"

												THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN GAMEPLAY SPOILERS!!!I really enjoyed playing Batman:Arkham city, it was one of the best games i've ever played. The fist-fighting is amazing, like when-at various points- you take on about twenty people in one fight. The stealth sequences are also tens, and exciting, after flying across Arkham city beating the small groups of people up, I always liked a good stealth section. The combat consists mainly of spamming x, square, or left-mouse button, and occasionally y, triangle or right-mouse button to counter the thugs' attacks. That sounds incredibly boring, but once you have a high enough free-flow combo(Something that lets you do speacial takedowns and other moves when you have enough punches) you can hurl yourself around the battlefields, not letting anybody attack you because by the time they try you are mangling somebody else, it is very fun. Once you get enough free-flow combo, instead of hurling yourself around like a lunatic, you can also do speacial moves, like one that lets you take out one person automatically. You have to purchase the others when you level up, which takes me to the skill tree. There is multiple things you can invest your skill points on, like the speacial moves in fist fighting, or the different gadgets to use in fist fighting or stealth. The stealth is basically crouch-walking around, not getting detected and stealthily taking people out. Again, this sounds boring, but it is tense, terrifying(especially on one of the stealth boss-battles) and overall, fun. A good thing about it is that if you get detected, for whatever reason, you still have a chance to get away, like there are gargoyles that you can swing around on, and multiple vents and floor grates to hide in, but if the thugs find an unconcious body by one, they will check it, and if you are in it they will start shooting you. The game starts with you as Bruce Wayne, being sent into Arkham city, which is just a walled off section of Gotham city to keep the bad-guys in. You get taken through a section where you are introduced to the combat, and Tyger guards, a group of guards led by Hugo Strange, the mega-bad-guy who knows Bruce Wayne's secrets. You then have to scale a building called Ace chemicals, where you get the batsuit and have to save Catwoman from Two-face. SKIPPING. After a while, you go to Joker's place in a steel mill, where you break into his office, and he poisons you! He knocks you out and-he is poisoned too- He puts his blood in you. You then do a section about Ra's Al Ghul, somebody who controls a Lazarus pit, which is a pit full of danger! You then do a boss-fight against him, which I would say is certainly the best boss-fight in the game. You then get cured and go to wonder tower, which is a big tower in the middle of Arkham city. You do a very difficult stealth bit at the top, where the gargoyles are actually on the outside of the tower so you cannot do inverted takedowns(reaching down off a gargoyle and lifting someone up, strangling them until unconcious, and dropping them with rope attached) You then go into Hugo Strange's office, there is a cutscene, he says ""Activate protocol 11"" and you run out and the tower blows up and there is a sequence where Ra's Al Ghul kills himself because he will live forever and he doesn't want to.I would definetly give this amazing game 10/10, for its excellence, and I would very highly reccomend it. BUY THIS GAME!!!			"

												The gameplay is top notch. The stealth, but especially the combat, are much improved since the first game. The fluidity of its ""easy to learn, hard to master"" combat mechanics puts stuff like ""Assassin's Creed"" (with its silly hold block until you can counter kill simplicity) to shame. In fact, I'm hard pressed to think of another third person game which has better hand to hand combat than ""Batman: AC.""The open world is a nice touch too, even though alot of the side quests are kind of a pain and best left alone given that they tend to be of the ""find x number of hidden objects on a map, then fight a boss"" variety. The main plot is better, but never really matches the highs of ""Arkham Asylum."" It tries to cram every single Batman villain ever into one overarching storyline, and not only does this stretch credulity even in comic book terms, but individual segments feel rushed and lack the depth of ""Arkham Asylum"" (which focused on relatively fewer villains). Still, if you approach it more as a series of slightly interrelated episodes rather than one grand story the game works much better. Despite its flaws it surpasses the original in most respects and in terms of pure gameplay might be the best third person action game on the market; definitely more polished, better made, and way more fun than any given Assassin's Creed game.

												What can I say about this one? In a nutshell, it's fantastic. If your rig can handle the higher settings, this is still a STUNNING looking game. Combat is fantastic, intuitive, and just plain fun. The story was well worth it to me. You can either blow through the main story in a dozen or less hours, but if you invest in the side missions, riddler challenges, expect to spend a considerable amount of time in Arkham City.Bigger is not always better. Arkham City is larger in scope than its predecessor, Arkham Asylum, but is modest in size compared to other open world games today. What we do have here is an amazing attention to detail that left me simply staring at the scenery.The Riddler challenges require some patience. For some, they will seem overwhelming - just keep in mind that like the prior game, not all challenges can be done immediately. Certain upgrades will be required. Once those are, most challenges make sense and are surprisingly addictive to find!The Ending? FantasticThe voice acting? Fantastic?I played this on consoles when it first came out, but in some ways I felt like I was playing for the first time, thanks to the PC setting option - no comparisons. Never played it on PC, then you need to check out the game again!!!M "

												There is NO REASON this game shouldn't of won Game of the Year. This game is everything I ever wanted in a Batman game since the beginning of my gaming days playing Atari, Colecovision, and NES... you would be stupid to not want to purchase this game!I have spent ENDLESS hours just free roaming Arkham City as Batman and collecting all the extra riddler trophies and side missions. I definitely free roamed for wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy more than I was doing the main story line because it was seriously that fun, awesome, and epic... Unbelievably fun game, decently difficult on Hard difficulty. Played Arkham Asyulm as well and that game was also fantastic. This game had everything I was saying Arkham Asylum was missing, plus the beautiful free roaming as a Batman badass. Kinda like Assasin'c Creed Batman lol. But so much sweeter.10/10			"

												I personally liked the more focused Arkham Asylum, despite Arkham City being better crafted in virtually every way. I have bad taste though so don't hold that against this game. Great combat, excellent use of the source material, good city traversal, and some really good writing on all points except the fan-fic style ""Gotham City Stories"" text items that pop up here and there but can be completely ignored. Oh and bonus points for letting Batman keep almost all of his  Asylum toys  from the outset. How many sequels have we all endured in which the hero apprently hocked all of their upgrades between games? (I'm looking at you Samus) "

												Batman Arkham City to me was the best video game released during the 7th console generation (2005-2014). Where ever you go trying to do the main story, Arkham City leads you off the trail to do side missions, investigate puzzles and beat the tar out of thugs. You can do various objectives in different order, it's non-linear. Unfortunately you can't solve every Riddler puzzle until you get the last equipment including the line launcher and freeze blast, but don't get hung up on that. I love being able to fly around Gotham with the grapnel boost, following custom way points or deviating from them to spontaneously do something else without getting lost. Top notch voice acting for Batman, Joker and Harley. The Batman villain roster is impressive. I didn't think much of Batman Arkham Asylum, the claustrophobic setting was limited, but was consistent to the story at least.  It's the perfect sequel. Newgame+ and the hard difficulty proves replay ability. The point in the story where Batman is forced to complete the demon trials was where I became the most engaged.If you grew up watching the Tim Burtom Batman movies, including Forever and the Warner Brother animated series, you gotta play this. It's the best representation of Batman in a video game.5/5Here is a list of my favorite games released during the 7th generation of consoles. Honorable mentions to Dead Rising 2 Off The Record, Skyrim, Portal 2 , Call Of Duty Black Ops and Super Mario Galaxy. 1. Batman Arkham City (Best flow of navigation and mission activity)2. Fallout New Vegas (Balances FO3 for more challenge and variety) 3. Bioshock 1 (Defines FPS 1P)4. Call Of Duty 4 (Defines FPS Multiplayer)5. Super Smash Brothers Brawl (Reason to get a Wii)			"

With what feels like the most pristine mix between gritty realism and dark humor, the game is the most organic feel in the most unnatural universe possible. With perfect controls, tons of challenges and captivating gameplay, the game invites players in to never let them go; just like a prison.

That generic genre descriptor really does apply for all the Arkham games though: there’s a lot of action, and you constantly feel like you’re on an adventure. Rocksteady capitalizes on the foundations of Asylum and takes the series along for a ride on the open-world bandwagon; however, they do so in a way that makes their AAA competitors simply look dull and slow. There’s a great feeling of speed and environmental mastery as you use your grapple and cape, upgraded here as a slingshot mechanism that hurls you into the air before bobbing down to maintain lift. Gadgets are now incorporated into your combat repetoire; A-list villains are actually given their due with some impressive boss encounters; the Catwoman chapter is short but immensely fun; environmental puzzles are more complex while the Riddler challenges are compulsively fun to track down and complete. You want to know how to make your collectathon mini games fun? Make them inherently fun, not because they reward a shiny or an achievement or feed your OCD (although all those are legit reasons). 'City' is packed with fun stuff to do.There’s just more of Arkham here: more characters, an expanded moveset, bigger and more diverse environments, more DC universe shoutouts and fanbait (the terrible Harley Quinn DLC is one such tease). It’s the ‘Batman Returns’ of the franchise: a louder and campier sequel that raises the fun quotient significantly, even if it comes at the cost of some narrative and design tightness.			"

												If you are into rpg's, super heroes, batman, crime fighting & gaming then Arkham City is a must play game for you. This game is perfectly done by Rocksteady in every aspect and is one of the best story tellers out there. I think over the years I have finished the main story line more than 20 times and even months ago I completed it again and was still not bored about the story or the gameplay and plans to complete 100% on hard. This will be the best 5 bucks you will spend on anything trust me, not a huge comic fan but these games made me a huge Batman fan and also made me start reading Batman comics.Best Batman related game out there period!

												The world is not over-large but big enough that it doesn't feel cramped and detailed enough to convince but not so detailed as to distract. The combat system is precise, full of useful options and endlessly entertaining. The voice acting is positively top-notch. The music is excellent. The story veers madly from the ridiculous to the sublime but never fails to engage meaningful gameplay. Without DLC there is a massive amount of stuff to do and with it things get almost silly.Yeah, I think this game is pretty much okay.			"

												If you told me 5+ years ago that a lesser-known studio under a massive publisher is making a triple-A comicbook hero game adaptation, I'd be a cynic.2011, Batman:Arkham City was released, the sequel to the acclaimed Batman:Arkham Asylum developed by Rocksteady studios. While AA managed to exceed the expectations of cynics like me, being a really polished and solid game in itself, AC rose way up higher, being one of the most amazing games in recent memory. Or at least for me personally.Arkham City, in essence, is Arkham Asylum with a massive open world, slightly better animations (e.g. no more cretins holding their heads when they're defeated, regardless of where you actually hurt them) and more polishes around its edges, It manages to keep the fantastic, fluid combat, excellent level design, atmospheric setting, incredible narrative and oh-so perfect voice acting. So much of this review has been said in my previous review of AA.Combat in AC is satisfying as ever, but now with more awesome animations and more importantly, more gadgets and the introduction of freeflow gadgets. Freeflow gadgets basically allows you to incorporate your gadgets mid-combat more seamlessly which makes the variety of combos way more exciting. With the introduction of more gadgets comes more approaches in combat which plays a huge part in AC and is without a doubt, extremely fun to experiment with different gadgets in different combat situations.Boss fights in AC are a major improvement from its predecessor. Each boss is almost perfectly depicted as their comicbook counterpart not only in terms of presentation, but also their method of combat. Bottom line, boss encounters are extremely fun and at times challenging, although some bosses rely alot on button mashing.Stealth in AA relied a lot on the game's excellent level design and combat/gadgetry to a certain extent (ignoring the clumsy AI). AC manages to yet again, excel in the series' stealth aspect with even more incredible level designs and as said earlier, more gadgets which also are incorporable for stealthy approaches. If you are a fan of stealth games, I recommend playing the game on hard because more often than not when you have a multiple gun-armed men encounter, you are forced to approach them extremely stealthily as guns kill you fairly quick. IMO, stealth on hard in Arkham City is feels just as or even more rewarding than combat.Talking about stealth, it is almost unignorable to talk about the clumsy AI. Whilst enemies patroling/covering area are sometimes very tight and challenging, it sometimes fails to notice you in obvious positions of their line of sight and I am also convinced they never look behind or above them (unless theyre using thermo). This most definitely needs work.Presentation of the game is without a doubt a massive eye (and ear) candy. The world is grim, dark and quite large, managing to retain the gothic atmosphere of AA once again. AC manages to have an ungeneric world due to being able to not to use generic buildings or placing alike buildings very close to each other. Rocksteady manages to put a lot of easter eggs in the world pretty well with references to the comic book stories in the form of riddler challenges and sidemissions. There's one easter egg where if you go to crime alley within the game which really generates a ton of feels (personally), if you are getting this game, do not forget to check it out, this shows the amount of effort the devs put into the game.The music is not only extremely good as well, but its placement within each scene is perfection, definitely worth checking out the soundtrack itself. Voice acting, oh my god, Mark Hamill nails it down the ground yet again with his portrayal of Joker, alongside Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong and every other villain as well being quite possibly one of the best voice-acting crew in the history of gaming. This helps build a spot-on portrayal of each character which is already presented extremely well with each of their character models and great costume design.Story-wise, a lot of reviews I've read mentions that AC isn's as strong as AA but I say otherwise. While I do agree some villains felt rather shoehorned into the story after much thought, my initial playthrough almost ignores this fact due to the game's undeniably spectacular narrative. AC's narrative played out extremely well and felt very much alike a blockbuster movie (perhaps maybe even comparable to Nolan's trilogy) as the scale felt grand as compared to AA. Overall, I felt that the story was pretty much one of the key selling points of the game (again, personally).Well that pretty much covers all my opinions of the game. I admit I do have abit of a Batboner (ok not that small after all..) but whether or not you are a huge fan of Batman should not be taken to consideration if you are deciding whether or not to buy this game because personally, Batman:Arkham City is one of the best games in recent memory. Treat yourselves well by buying yourselves this incredible piece of entertainment.Conclusion; a fantastic game with incredibly satisfying combat, rewardingly challenging stealth, a relatively large world with excellent world and level design, great atmosphere of grim ( and yet, epicness of being the caped crusader), perfect sound direction and composition, unforgettable characters with their spot-on impressions/models/costume and triple-A voice acting, great story and a wonderful narrative. Yes, this game is so good i ran out of unique positive reinforcement adjectives to use. 9.5/10 - Brings me wonders how TESV got goty instead of this.			"

Supports keyboard and controller. Somple combat, yet can be alot more complex. You won't encounter many glitches, if any. ----------------------------------------Entertainment: 10SO much to do in this game, a decent sized open world packed full of secrets and missions to do. hardly is there ever a dull moment. lots of gameplay hours are needed to 100%.

												Over all a good game. The combat system is fun and addictive so I guess that's the best feature in the game, also the plot and storyline is good but when it comes to side missions I had a trouble bothering with them, they were too much and they were distracting which is why it's better to just finish them after you finish the main quest. I was only a bit disappointed because this game is a bit easier than Arkham Asylum and also because the riddles were not as fun. Gameplay 8/10 Story 7/10Visuals 9/10Control 9/10			"

												Great. Even more freedom than Arkham Asylum and an amazing story with an epic soundtrack. The controls are improved and you are able to do even more. Like its predecessor, you are better off with a controller and non 360 controllers will require the same config file changes made for Arkaham Asylum. For the combat challenges, combos are a lot easier, but the stealth challenges are harder. The DLC of the GOTY is all great, but completing all the challenges gets grindy.			"

												Taking to the roof-tops as The Dark Knight in this game is a surprising delight. Gliding through the skies to swoop down on gangs of thugs, solving some of the many side missions, or just playing the actual story campaign - whatever your preference this game will most likely satisfy it (unless you want to be tooling around in a Batmobile, but I'll get to that in a sec)The combat is well executed and in the style we have come to expect as a result of the Chris Nolan movies and, whilst some may find it repetitive, it has the option of being a straight-up slug fest or a combination of well timed moves. The general opponents range from unarmed thugs to snipers, shield carriers and some in body armour - each of which requires a slightly different approach.The open-world format gives you the freedom to do things in your own time, breaking up the story with numerous side missions and a staggering number of ""collectibles"" so even when the story is finished there is still plenty to do in Arkham City.About the aforementioned Batmobile : The close confines and ruined conditions in Arkham City really don't lend themselves to using a vehicle so to be honest it's really not a piece of Lore that I missed. The combination of Gliding and grapple assisted parkour are more than capable of getting you anywhere in the map in pretty good time.The characterisations are perfect (although this is sadly the last time Mark Hamill will be voicing the Joker) and the scripting is well enough written to let the voice talent really shine. The animations are smooth and fluid, even in the midst of combat with multiple opponents.As a player, the only thing I'd suggest is that you get a controller for this game, much as I prefer Keyboard and Mouse it is better suited to a handset.Overall, I'd say that this was definitely one of my better purchases - but don't take my word for it, get your hands on a copy and see for yourself.

												You enter a room full of henchmen guarding a certain supervillain's gear from Batman's rogue gallery. By activating detective mode you see that there are 8 in total, with 2 armed and a hostage. One of them also has a thermal scanner attached. You slowly creep from a vantage point and begin a silent takedown. Once he is unconcious a beeping sound occurs. Suddenly everyone in the room is alerted to your presence and you grapple to a vantage point to re-assess the situation. You drop down and hide under a grate before perfoming a takedown that finishes with a loud thud. The remaning six run down the stairs and approach you. You hide behind a weak wooden wall that you have sprayed explosive gel on before imploding it onto the first man that approaches. They start shooting at you and you throw batarangs at three of them before dropping a smoke pellet. Activating detective mode you calmly batclaw one of the henchmen outside the smoke towards you, knocking him unconcious. You take down one more before grappling up to another vantage point.Panicking and with his heart rate rising one guy takes the hostage and threatens to kill him. Another runs up and starts shooting down one vantage point, shouting and saying you won't be able to use it. The third man runs under your vantage point and uses his thermal scanner. However because of your anti-heat detection upgrade he doesn't detect you as you stand perfectly still. You then drop down and leave him hanging from the gargoyle you were perched on as he screams. The others rush over and you use you disrupter to jam the armed guy's weapon. You then throw a freeze grenade at the first guy rooting him in place before flying up to a vantage point. The guy with a gun becomes shaky as his weapon is no longer working and he has lost sight of you as you have quickly moved from vantage point to vantage point. As he moves under you you drop down on him and knock him out before running to the frozen guy and finishing him with an ice takedown. Batman then proceeds to clean and brush his wristguards very casually.This is just one tiny morsel of an amazing open-world game. Buy it and play through the rest.			"

												This is the best game I have played on PC but that isn't saying much condidering I have a horrible computer and a low budget. But that brings up a point. My computer is horrid and can still run this game almost completely without lag which means it could probably run well on other dispicable computers. It also has a great story that is quite long but sadly you can't replay a specific mission so if you want to replay a section of the story you're gonna have to start from scratch. It has great graphics, nice voice acting, and amazing gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, it is quite unique. It has pretty great replayability, a variety of stealth takedowns, great combat, and of course, free roaming. There are two differnt types of maps, predator and combat. Combat is prett straight forward but predator is all based around stealth. You could go in guns a blazing but that will most likely get you killed. So you go in with a smile on your face and do some hardcore planning to takedown  4 guys at a time,or maybe that's just me. The combat is great too though. You have many different moves and combos that allow complete maneuverability in combat and you can leave almost any fight without a scratch if you are skilled enough (Like me). The DLC makes it even better. It allows you to be other characters with a wide variety of abilities and gadgets. Oh, I almost forgot to tell about the gadgets. There are a lot and every single one is extremely helpful. You can use many gadgets in combat and of course all of them in predator that are all nothing like the next. There are so many other things that I could tell you about but I would have to think about and I am too lazy so you're just gonna have to go on youtube or something and look it up or maybe buy this amazing game.

												Much better than Arkham Aslyum. Better plot, improved mechanics, and more playable characters.Glad to see that the studio is heading to the right direction.Downside is that Harley Quinns Revenge glitched out for me and I wasn't able to try that =/Lasted Me: 10 hoursWorth Meter: $30			"

												By far one of the best games I've ever played.After the amazing Arkham Asylum Rocksteady published this masterpiece where you are able to explore the whole city of Arkham (not Gotham!). The story itself is a little bit too short but there are a few sidequests so that is okay.The gameplay is just great. Gliding and grappling is very easy and after a few minutes you are used to it. Same for the fight system, which ist easy to control but on harder difficults also hard to master perfectly.Totally recommended if you are a fan of the Batman Series.			"

												First game was my absolute favorite game to come out in years when it arrived, until I purchased Arkham City. Bigger, Prettier, and still retains that feeling of being a love letter to fans of The Dark Knight (hallowed be his name). If there's any series out there that pays more respect and courtesy to it's source materials and said source's fans it's probably The Witcher series, but this is a wickedly close second. If you love open-world brawlers, platformers, modern 3ps metroidvanias, and The Bat, you owe it to yourself to play this game, and play it till there ain't nothin left.NOTE: I know I only have 10ish hours of playtime recorded as of posting this, but I logged many many more hours on my faithful Xbox 360, which I dumped for a PC.

												After playing Arkham Knight, would sugget that this is the best game in the series. Not because of all the bugs Arkham Knight had but because of a very closely linked story, nice narration and the free flow combat system. I story unravels very nicely with all the characters being an important part of the game(except for Riddler, God knows why is he still there). The graphics are neat and the music backs the pace of the game very well. The stealth sequesnce are very well designed with a lot of attention given to details.Its a must buy for all the Batman fans.			"

												Great. Even more freedom than Arkham Asylum and an amazing story with an epic soundtrack. The controls are improved and you are able to do even more. Like its predecessor, you are better off with a controller and non 360 controllers will require the same config file changes made for Arkaham Asylum. For the combat challenges, combos are a lot easier, but the stealth challenges are harder. The DLC of the GOTY is all great, but completing all the challenges gets grindy.			"

												You enter a room full of henchmen guarding a certain supervillain's gear from Batman's rogue gallery. By activating detective mode you see that there are 8 in total, with 2 armed and a hostage. One of them also has a thermal scanner attached. You slowly creep from a vantage point and begin a silent takedown. Once he is unconcious a beeping sound occurs. Suddenly everyone in the room is alerted to your presence and you grapple to a vantage point to re-assess the situation. You drop down and hide under a grate before perfoming a takedown that finishes with a loud thud. The remaning six run down the stairs and approach you. You hide behind a weak wooden wall that you have sprayed explosive gel on before imploding it onto the first man that approaches. They start shooting at you and you throw batarangs at three of them before dropping a smoke pellet. Activating detective mode you calmly batclaw one of the henchmen outside the smoke towards you, knocking him unconcious. You take down one more before grappling up to another vantage point.Panicking and with his heart rate rising one guy takes the hostage and threatens to kill him. Another runs up and starts shooting down one vantage point, shouting and saying you won't be able to use it. The third man runs under your vantage point and uses his thermal scanner. However because of your anti-heat detection upgrade he doesn't detect you as you stand perfectly still. You then drop down and leave him hanging from the gargoyle you were perched on as he screams. The others rush over and you use you disrupter to jam the armed guy's weapon. You then throw a freeze grenade at the first guy rooting him in place before flying up to a vantage point. The guy with a gun becomes shaky as his weapon is no longer working and he has lost sight of you as you have quickly moved from vantage point to vantage point. As he moves under you you drop down on him and knock him out before running to the frozen guy and finishing him with an ice takedown. Batman then proceeds to clean and brush his wristguards very casually.This is just one tiny morsel of an amazing open-world game. Buy it and play through the rest.			"

												The best in the sereis This is the secound instalment in the Arkham sereies, and this is truely the most eventfull of the games I have palyed. The overall gameplay is like the first game in the sereis, but it have been inproved, and perfected. The fighting part of the game, is made by using the mouse to navigate whitch charecter you want to attack, you use the left mouse button to attack and the right to counter, you can also use the middle to confuse. Along the way the enemeys get harder, and get new equpment, and new tacktics must be used to deafeat them. There is also the stealth element, where Batman must take down a room with armed thugs in order to continue or save someone. Here you must plan your attacks and be paistent in order to succed. There are so many small details in this game, and I really love how many mini games and challenges, there are. You can take challenges in fighting and stealth, and use diffrent charecters such as catwomen, there is also a playable charecter in the story mode, nightwing and robin. Furthermore, in the main game Zaez is on the run, the Riddler is kisnapping people and putting up his throphies and riddles to find again. The Mad Hatter is runnig amok, and so much more. The story is the best Batman story in a long time. The story takes palce after the events of Arkham Asylum, where the Joker have become sick becouse of the titan serum he took, meanwhile Bruce Wayne is sent to the new jail city Arham City, and here we find out that Hugo Strange now knows, who Batman really is. This makes the plot more interesting, and it only get`s more tence after the Joker infects Batman with he`s blood. So now Batman needs to find a cure and defeat Hugo Strange, in order to keep he`s identety hidden. Since this is a prison city, we meet many other charecters, such as the Penguine, Mister Frezze, Solomon Grundy, Clayface and even Ras al` Ghoul. Every single charecter is well made, and really memerable. Along the way, you can also find informatiomn about the charecters, inside Arkham city, this only adds more depth to the charecters and I love it. The ending is worth talking about, and this is also the part where I talk about the DLC mission from the game, if you don`t want the ending spolied, don`t read untill you see the spoiler over part.-----------spoilers------------In this game, the Joker dies, this is a shock to anyone who played this game, and it is truely a fantastic ending. It is clear that Batman will be scared by this event, since the Joker and Batman, have a conection deep down, every fan of the seires knows about. The Joker needs Batman and the other way around, but this put the nail in the coffin and made a climactic ending, that will be remembered by me.This leads to the events after the attack on Arkham, and guees who`s gone mad? Well of couse it`s Harly Quen. Since the Joker died, she have kidnapped police officers, and turned prttey goth. We also find out that Batman have been kidnapped, and that Harly Quen thought she was pragnent with Jokers child, whitch only made her even more mad. It is up to Robin to save the day in this DLC, and it is a nice change since you have played as Batman all day in the main game. ------------spoilers over----------Overall this game is really well designed and it is a fantastic story, that have twist and turns along the way, plus fantasitc sceneory, that only will make you love the game even more, thumps up. 8 out of 10			"

												I'm ashamed to admit that this game was my first Batman experience. I'd never been interested enough to watch any of the movies or read the comic books, so I had no prior knowledge beyond Batman being a guy in a batsuit. Even so, I really enjoyed this game.Gotham City is absolutely beautiful, and jumping/gliding from building to building never gets old. The game is also filled with interesting characters – allies and villains alike. There are plenty of familiar faces for people who know the franchise, but they were convincing enough for me to like them based on the game alone.Add to that some interesting game mechanics and boss fights (a direct approach will not always work) and an engaging storyline, and I see no reason for people not to play this game. Even if like me, you have no prior interest in the franchise – Arkham City just might surprise you.			"

												The Game of the Year Edition of Batman: Arkham City packages new gameplay content, seven maps, three playable characters, and 12 skins beyond the original retail release. Also included is the exciting epilogue, Harley Quinn's Revenge -- in this mission, players are sent back into Arkham City to face their final challenge as they interchange between playing as both Batman and Robin. Utilize each of the characters' unique combat and investigative skills to uncover Harley's vengeful plan and shut the gates on the urban mega-prison forever. In addition to experiencing a new storyline, fans can explore new environments and face-off against Harley's all new gang of thugs.			"

												An ambitious folllowup to Arkham Asylum.  Arkham City paints with a much broader brush, but doesn't quite paint a complete picture.  If one were to simply play the main storyline and disregard any sidequests in this game, Arkham City would easily be on par with Arkham Asylum.  However, when the side quests are taken into account, the overall package falls short.  The sidequests feel like constant buildups towards payoffs that don't happen.  Half of the side missions result in nothing more than a nod to past comic book storylines, while the other half culminate in an unsatisfying stealth takedown of the villain who put you through so much frustration to get to him.  When the game asks you to find and collect several hundred collectables only to ""reward"" you with a stealth gauntlet and a stealth takedown on the perpetrator, it just doesn't feel like you have been rewarded at all.If you were to play this game for fun, I would reccommend ignoring everything but the main storyline.  There's a solid game there, but it is buried in an unfocused and unrewarding open world environment.			"

Well now here's your chance to continue your quest to smack up every dude in all of Gotham. Smack the dudes. Because they can take it. You're not a watchful protector. Or a Dark Knight.

												Overall Score: 10/10       ---------------------------------------Concept: 10Great story, Batman fans will love it. Took Arkham Asylum, made it more open world, and fixed all the flaws with the game, while at the same time making it alot more interesting. ---------------------------------------Graphics: 10Game looks really nice, textures are great, nice shaders, good character models, and still runs great on lower end machines. Can't go wrong there!----------------------------------------Sound: 10Good music, good voice acting, good sound effects, not much more to say about that.----------------------------------------Playability: 10Pretty nicely optimized for PC, no complaints about that. Supports keyboard and controller. Somple combat, yet can be alot more complex. You won't encounter many glitches, if any. ----------------------------------------Entertainment: 10SO much to do in this game, a decent sized open world packed full of secrets and missions to do. hardly is there ever a dull moment. lots of gameplay hours are needed to 100%.

It takes everything from Arkham Asylum that was good and makes it better. Swinging from rooftop to rooftop alone will bring out the kid in you. The voice acting is great, the gameplay awesome, and the hero is mother ♥♥♥♥ing Batman. Perhaps one of the best games I played this year. The only reason why I'm not giving it a perfect score is the combat can sometimes get a little repetative, and there are not always great opportunities to use your gadgets.9.5/10.0			"

Also included is the exciting epilogue, Harley Quinn's Revenge -- in this mission, players are sent back into Arkham City to face their final challenge as they interchange between playing as both Batman and Robin. Utilize each of the characters' unique combat and investigative skills to uncover Harley's vengeful plan and shut the gates on the urban mega-prison forever. In addition to experiencing a new storyline, fans can explore new environments and face-off against Harley's all new gang of thugs.			"

												This is my 5th favorite game of all time (my other 4 being Sly's 1 and 2, jak and daxter, and jak II). I love this game so much. The fact that there was a big ol' city full of thugs and croneys, Riddler Trophies, and cool locations to explore made this game the most amazing pc game, like, ever. Protical 10 made the game for me. the only problem I had with it was that after I beat it, my save file went wacky and set me back to the fight with Joker in the steel mill, but whatever, I wanted to explore more of Arkham City anyway. And speaking of Arkham, it is a well built, creatively textured gothic masterpiece. It's riddled (no pun intended) with secrets, awsome locations,  Azrial (that armored, hooded guy,[I recognized him from the outfit. I'm not spoiling anything.]), side quests, and so much more. It feels veeeery atmospherical, and while it may be better to refer to it as ""Arkham Town"" it is still very large. Oh yeah, and it's main character is Batman.... enough said.All of what other people say aside, wether good or bad, this is a good game.10/10			"

Following the events of Arkham Asylum you find yourself in the closed-off Arkham City unravelling the puzzles and missions within. You encouter noteworthy villains both in the main storyline and the sidemissions, and of course the Riddler also has placed his riddles and challenges allover the city for you to solve.			"

												Batman: Arkham City is the follow up to the mega-success Batman: Arkham Asylum. It features the same free-flow combat, with even more bat-gadgets for your goon-beating pleasure and a sprawling open city scape for you to grapple and glide your way across. This is also Mark Hamill's final performance as the Joker, Mark having stated the only way he will ever come back to voice Joker is if someone makes an animated version of The Killing Joke comic book arc. In addition to having even more options while playing as Batman, the game also lets you play as other Gotham city heroes Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing, with their own distinct animations and move sets.I need to mention though, that while Batman: Arkham Asylum had typical comic book problems with portrayal of Harle Quinn and Poison Ivy as sex objects, Arkham City offended my wife and I a lot more with the opening sequence. You begin as Catwoman and have to fight a group of thugs while trying to steal something, but unlike the random threats to simply beat and kill the player that Batman receives, Catwoman is treated to her own taunts that include ra pe threats. There is no ra pe in the game as far as I'm aware, but just the suggestion of it really broke my immersion in the game world and made my wife refuse to play it. Batman exists as a very unique property in that he has been portrayed in very dark and gritty ways (Frank Miller's The Dark Knight), but also as extreme camp with jovial and silly aspects (Adam West live TV show). Even if you pretend the live action show never existed, the animated series (which shared voice actors with this game) was still targetted at children and is in the mind of many the iconic and definitive Batman. It just wasn't necessary to include ra pe threats, we already knew these were bad men we were beating up, and dark for the sake of dark is not a good thing. Frank Miller's exploration of the darker side of Batman was also about dealing with getting old, too old to be fighting punks in the street and super-criminals, too old to continue to let Joker get away with with murder sprees. The Dark Knight comics had more to say than just ""this is what Batman with even more violence is like"".Aside from this (not minor, you play as her more than once) issue with the game, though, the rest is competently executed. The combat is smooth and satisfying, and the difficulty was cranked up a bit since Asylum, especially on the harder settings. There is a LOT of game here for you to discover, with side-objectives such as tracking Zaz by listening to him talk about his origin, and an actual fight with The Riddler if you find all his trophies this time around. I dare say if not for the ra pe threats I would easily recommend this game to anyone, but honestly Batman: Arkham Asylum is all you really need. This game does not offer enough improvement over Asylum to be the definitive game in the series, but if you loved Asylum and want more Batman, Arkham City is mechanically a great game. I do recommend it, because to not do so would be a case of throwing the baby away with the bath water.			"

												As the follow up to Arkham Asylum there was a lot of expectations for Arkham City, and thankfully the game lives up to just about everything one could expect from a sequel, adding in new features while keeping the same basic design unchanged.In Arkham City you play as The Batman who as Bruce Wayne is captured and thrown into Arkham City, a city that has been turned into a prison to house all the supervillains and thugs of Gotham, by Hugo Strange who knows Bruce is Batman and wishes to rid the world of him once and for all. It is not long however before he breaks free and gathers his costume, becoming Batman and ready to get to the bottom of what is going on.Along the way Batman meets a bevy of supervillains, from Two-Face to Penguin to Joker and more, all seemingly at a war with each other within the city and like always it is up to Batman to stop them all, this gives reason for Batman to at times work with some villains for the greater good, least till someones back is turned.Arkham City plays, for the most part, just like Arkham Asylum but with more gadgets, moves, and now a big open city to run around in, making it much larger in pretty much every way it could be as well as letting you play as Catwoman in the open city, and Robin as well as Nightwing in the Riddler challenge rooms, each with their own medals and achievements to earn.Combine that with all the downloadable content such as the mini campaign, bonus maps, and all the skins and you got yourself an amazing package with hours on hours of great gameplay that builds on everything Asylum started. I have very few complaints against this game, noticeable ones being that even though there are more Riddler objects to collect, over four hundred in fact, it is one aspect where more content does not always mean better content, but it is a very small complaint to an otherwise fantastic game, if you loved Arkham Asylum there is a very good chance you will adore this game as well.

												This game is brilliant. This is easily the Spider-Man 2 of Batman games. Arkham City takes everything from the first game, puts it in an open world, and triples it.Combat is surprisingly smoother from the first game. There are side missions to do, you can play as Catwoman, who has her own sub-plot, and you can play as Robin and Nightwing in the Challenge Modes available There is too much to list here but this game is a masterpiece. It's worth your time.			"

												An excellent experience, and definetly a well put together story, although since I got the GOTY edition, I have to say only being able to use the skins after beating the game was a bit of a letdown. As a side comment, the Robin and Nightwing packs can only be used as challenge map characters, and not for free roaming. Sounds a bit boring DLC wise huh? Well, with a bit of knowledge and a few good mods, I was roaming Arkham City as Nighting for hours on end, an excellent game with a few tweaks, great job DEVs!			"

												Batman Arkham City to me was the best video game released during the 7th console generation (2005-2014). Where ever you go trying to do the main story, Arkham City leads you off the trail to do side missions, investigate puzzles and beat the tar out of thugs. You can do various objectives in different order, it's non-linear. Unfortunately you can't solve every Riddler puzzle until you get the last equipment including the line launcher and freeze blast, but don't get hung up on that. I love being able to fly around Gotham with the grapnel boost, following custom way points or deviating from them to spontaneously do something else without getting lost. Top notch voice acting for Batman, Joker and Harley. The Batman villain roster is impressive. I didn't think much of Batman Arkham Asylum, the claustrophobic setting was limited, but was consistent to the story at least.  It's the perfect sequel. Newgame+ and the hard difficulty proves replay ability. The point in the story where Batman is forced to complete the demon trials was where I became the most engaged.If you grew up watching the Tim Burtom Batman movies, including Forever and the Warner Brother animated series, you gotta play this. It's the best representation of Batman in a video game.5/5Here is a list of my favorite games released during the 7th generation of consoles. Honorable mentions to Dead Rising 2 Off The Record, Skyrim, Portal 2 , Call Of Duty Black Ops and Super Mario Galaxy. 1. Batman Arkham City (Best flow of navigation and mission activity)2. Fallout New Vegas (Balances FO3 for more challenge and variety) 3. Bioshock 1 (Defines FPS 1P)4. Call Of Duty 4 (Defines FPS Multiplayer)5. Super Smash Brothers Brawl (Reason to get a Wii)			"

												What can I say that hasn't already been said about this awesome game? You're Batman, Batman! And not only do you play as Batman, but you feel like Batman. Whether leaping from the shadows to takedown your enemies or gliding over the rooftops no other game (besides Arkham Asylum) makes you feel quite like the Caped Crusader.If you liked Arkham Asylum, you're in for a treat. Everything is bigger, and badder. Combat is more intense, and it's a blast to glide through the enormous Arkham City. While Arkham City is a monumental achievement for games of this nature, there are a few caveats. As an open world game, players are given the option to explore and complete side missions at their leisure. While this can be fun, the side missions are repetitive, and largely irrelevant to overall plot. To a completionist, this can grind the story to a halt. I would advise going straight for each main story objective before attempting any secondary missions, as the story is fast-paced and worth experiencing.			"

												If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum you would enjoy this game.  There seems to be more content in Arkham City over Asylum.  The environment and mood had a slightly scarier feel to it in Asylum, but in Arkham City the open world seems bigger and there are more things to do such as sidequests, more challenge maps etc.  I felt this game went overboard with all the riddles, which actually took quite some time for me, but I would definitely recommend this game.

												Going into this game after playing Asylum, I honestly didn't really know how Arkham City could be better (except the boss fights). But it certainly showed me how- it expands massively on Asylum, building on everything done right in it like a good sequel should. The gameplay is even better, with more gadgets and special moves (even the boss fights were improved, although still not perfect (except the Mr Freeze one; that was just plain awesome!)). I also loved playing as Catwoman. There's also way more content in this, with over 10 side missions, over 400 Riddler trophies to collect, New Game +, Harley Quinn's revenge and all the Challenge maps. With it comes the kinda small, but amazingly detailed open world of Arkham City with tonnes of Easter Eggs to explore. The voice acting is still of film quality and the graphics are awesome. The story may feel a bit jumpy and messy at times, and I didn't think Hugo Strange was that good of a villain (mainly because he has soooooo many opportunities to kill Batman practically gift-wrapped for him and he doesn't take advantage of a single one), but the story was still very enjoyable, particularly the beginning and the ending. Overall, Arkham City is one of the best games I've ever played and is by far the best superhero game ever. 10/10			"

												Possibly the greatest action adventure game of this (past) generation. That generic genre descriptor really does apply for all the Arkham games though: there’s a lot of action, and you constantly feel like you’re on an adventure. Rocksteady capitalizes on the foundations of Asylum and takes the series along for a ride on the open-world bandwagon; however, they do so in a way that makes their AAA competitors simply look dull and slow. There’s a great feeling of speed and environmental mastery as you use your grapple and cape, upgraded here as a slingshot mechanism that hurls you into the air before bobbing down to maintain lift. Gadgets are now incorporated into your combat repetoire; A-list villains are actually given their due with some impressive boss encounters; the Catwoman chapter is short but immensely fun; environmental puzzles are more complex while the Riddler challenges are compulsively fun to track down and complete. You want to know how to make your collectathon mini games fun? Make them inherently fun, not because they reward a shiny or an achievement or feed your OCD (although all those are legit reasons). 'City' is packed with fun stuff to do.There’s just more of Arkham here: more characters, an expanded moveset, bigger and more diverse environments, more DC universe shoutouts and fanbait (the terrible Harley Quinn DLC is one such tease). It’s the ‘Batman Returns’ of the franchise: a louder and campier sequel that raises the fun quotient significantly, even if it comes at the cost of some narrative and design tightness.			"

												Picked this up when it was on sale for £3.78 or something. Was definately worth its price. This is a better game than its predecessor Arkham Asylum, as the open world is just amazing to fly and run around in and the side missions help give the game life again after the main story ends. There is a large amount of gameplay options as you can play as different characters (Batman+Catwoman+maybe robin), who all have their own unique gadgets. Furthermore the stealth options in gameplay were also very fun, as it always keeps the player on their toes and thinking about which guard to pick off next. However, the face-to-face combat is also nice, as its quick yet brutal.7/10 Good gameplay and story, and allows for different variety of options to take out enemies.			"

												The best Batman game ever made and, admitting the fact of Arkham Origins release, ever will be made. No words can describe its epicness (and as for me, I pay most of my attention to the in-game voices and soundtrack). I may only hope there will be a native Linux release: well, they've released native MacOS version, haven't they? (:			"

												Over all a good game. The combat system is fun and addictive so I guess that's the best feature in the game, also the plot and storyline is good but when it comes to side missions I had a trouble bothering with them, they were too much and they were distracting which is why it's better to just finish them after you finish the main quest. I was only a bit disappointed because this game is a bit easier than Arkham Asylum and also because the riddles were not as fun. Gameplay 8/10 Story 7/10Visuals 9/10Control 9/10			"

If you don't like Batman, this game will fix that.1) The Combat is greatly improved compared to Asylum(perfect combat system)2) The map is big and extensive3) Full of easter eggs for hardcore fans 4) DLC is worth every penny 5) The plot is well thought out and is carried out with perfection6) Lasts about  6-16 hours depending on your skill level7) Lots of things to do after completing campaign (interesting side missions)8) Makes you think (not many games do that)9) Excellent graphics (not very demanding)10) You get a satisfaction that you spent your money wellIf you're still reading this and you're still not convinced on buying this game let me just say they are 9 out of hundreds of great things about this game, please take my word for this and you will be glad you listened to me.Graphics 10/10Sound     10/10Story       10/10Overall: 11/10			"

												Overall Rating: 10.0RPG/Action: AAAIf you have played other Batman games and followed the comics you will agree that Batman returns garbed in a modern, truly intimidating black and grey combat suit. Arkham city provides the ultimate playground to test Wayne Industries latest gadgets with it's distinctive towers, buildings and ruins.You are quickly thrown into the storyline as you first play Catwoman and learn the basics to fighting. You are given freedom to choose when to fight, what side-quests to take up or you could just complete the main storyline while still being able to go back at any time to complete the other stories. Batman AC is a power trip unlocking one gadget which you use both in and out of combat. The controls are very fluid and easy to use. The gadgets you use are very realistic and convincing.If you enjoy a challenge you will not be disappointed. Riddler has left plenty of trophies in difficult locations to get to. If that's not enough you will always find a challenge in New Game+ mode where you rely on your own intuition in combat to counter-attack.I found no bugs when playing this game.			"

												Taking to the roof-tops as The Dark Knight in this game is a surprising delight. Gliding through the skies to swoop down on gangs of thugs, solving some of the many side missions, or just playing the actual story campaign - whatever your preference this game will most likely satisfy it (unless you want to be tooling around in a Batmobile, but I'll get to that in a sec)The combat is well executed and in the style we have come to expect as a result of the Chris Nolan movies and, whilst some may find it repetitive, it has the option of being a straight-up slug fest or a combination of well timed moves. The general opponents range from unarmed thugs to snipers, shield carriers and some in body armour - each of which requires a slightly different approach.The open-world format gives you the freedom to do things in your own time, breaking up the story with numerous side missions and a staggering number of ""collectibles"" so even when the story is finished there is still plenty to do in Arkham City.About the aforementioned Batmobile : The close confines and ruined conditions in Arkham City really don't lend themselves to using a vehicle so to be honest it's really not a piece of Lore that I missed. The combination of Gliding and grapple assisted parkour are more than capable of getting you anywhere in the map in pretty good time.The characterisations are perfect (although this is sadly the last time Mark Hamill will be voicing the Joker) and the scripting is well enough written to let the voice talent really shine. The animations are smooth and fluid, even in the midst of combat with multiple opponents.As a player, the only thing I'd suggest is that you get a controller for this game, much as I prefer Keyboard and Mouse it is better suited to a handset.Overall, I'd say that this was definitely one of my better purchases - but don't take my word for it, get your hands on a copy and see for yourself.

												If you told me 5+ years ago that a lesser-known studio under a massive publisher is making a triple-A comicbook hero game adaptation, I'd be a cynic.2011, Batman:Arkham City was released, the sequel to the acclaimed Batman:Arkham Asylum developed by Rocksteady studios. While AA managed to exceed the expectations of cynics like me, being a really polished and solid game in itself, AC rose way up higher, being one of the most amazing games in recent memory. Or at least for me personally.Arkham City, in essence, is Arkham Asylum with a massive open world, slightly better animations (e.g. no more cretins holding their heads when they're defeated, regardless of where you actually hurt them) and more polishes around its edges, It manages to keep the fantastic, fluid combat, excellent level design, atmospheric setting, incredible narrative and oh-so perfect voice acting. So much of this review has been said in my previous review of AA.Combat in AC is satisfying as ever, but now with more awesome animations and more importantly, more gadgets and the introduction of freeflow gadgets. Freeflow gadgets basically allows you to incorporate your gadgets mid-combat more seamlessly which makes the variety of combos way more exciting. With the introduction of more gadgets comes more approaches in combat which plays a huge part in AC and is without a doubt, extremely fun to experiment with different gadgets in different combat situations.Boss fights in AC are a major improvement from its predecessor. Each boss is almost perfectly depicted as their comicbook counterpart not only in terms of presentation, but also their method of combat. Bottom line, boss encounters are extremely fun and at times challenging, although some bosses rely alot on button mashing.Stealth in AA relied a lot on the game's excellent level design and combat/gadgetry to a certain extent (ignoring the clumsy AI). AC manages to yet again, excel in the series' stealth aspect with even more incredible level designs and as said earlier, more gadgets which also are incorporable for stealthy approaches. If you are a fan of stealth games, I recommend playing the game on hard because more often than not when you have a multiple gun-armed men encounter, you are forced to approach them extremely stealthily as guns kill you fairly quick. IMO, stealth on hard in Arkham City is feels just as or even more rewarding than combat.Talking about stealth, it is almost unignorable to talk about the clumsy AI. Whilst enemies patroling/covering area are sometimes very tight and challenging, it sometimes fails to notice you in obvious positions of their line of sight and I am also convinced they never look behind or above them (unless theyre using thermo). This most definitely needs work.Presentation of the game is without a doubt a massive eye (and ear) candy. The world is grim, dark and quite large, managing to retain the gothic atmosphere of AA once again. AC manages to have an ungeneric world due to being able to not to use generic buildings or placing alike buildings very close to each other. Rocksteady manages to put a lot of easter eggs in the world pretty well with references to the comic book stories in the form of riddler challenges and sidemissions. There's one easter egg where if you go to crime alley within the game which really generates a ton of feels (personally), if you are getting this game, do not forget to check it out, this shows the amount of effort the devs put into the game.The music is not only extremely good as well, but its placement within each scene is perfection, definitely worth checking out the soundtrack itself. Voice acting, oh my god, Mark Hamill nails it down the ground yet again with his portrayal of Joker, alongside Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong and every other villain as well being quite possibly one of the best voice-acting crew in the history of gaming. This helps build a spot-on portrayal of each character which is already presented extremely well with each of their character models and great costume design.Story-wise, a lot of reviews I've read mentions that AC isn's as strong as AA but I say otherwise. While I do agree some villains felt rather shoehorned into the story after much thought, my initial playthrough almost ignores this fact due to the game's undeniably spectacular narrative. AC's narrative played out extremely well and felt very much alike a blockbuster movie (perhaps maybe even comparable to Nolan's trilogy) as the scale felt grand as compared to AA. Overall, I felt that the story was pretty much one of the key selling points of the game (again, personally).Well that pretty much covers all my opinions of the game. I admit I do have abit of a Batboner (ok not that small after all..) but whether or not you are a huge fan of Batman should not be taken to consideration if you are deciding whether or not to buy this game because personally, Batman:Arkham City is one of the best games in recent memory. Treat yourselves well by buying yourselves this incredible piece of entertainment.Conclusion; a fantastic game with incredibly satisfying combat, rewardingly challenging stealth, a relatively large world with excellent world and level design, great atmosphere of grim ( and yet, epicness of being the caped crusader), perfect sound direction and composition, unforgettable characters with their spot-on impressions/models/costume and triple-A voice acting, great story and a wonderful narrative. Yes, this game is so good i ran out of unique positive reinforcement adjectives to use. 9.5/10 - Brings me wonders how TESV got goty instead of this.			"

												If you played Arkham Asylum before this you will probably be a little disappointed.Arkham City's devs chose the safe route and basically recycled everything from Arkham Asylum and put it in this one.They polished the combat/graphics a little but there's not a huge difference.The game is based in a pretty big city where they tried to implement the ''open world'' feel but I think they didn't really succed.The optional quests are not that interesting and most likely you will ignore them.The city has a lot of secrets and it is fun to explore it,the only problem is the lack of optional quests.With a city like this they could add so many interesting quests but they focused more on the main campaign while still building this amazing city. The plot in this game is a bit weaker than in the previous game in my opinion but it is still worth following.I feel like the atmosphere of the game is a bit off,while in the first it is top notch.As I said before,the combat is almost the same with little improvement.Arkham City is definitely a great game but it is sad that they didn't take any risks and basically took Asylum,polished it a little and added another plot to it.

												*SPOILERS!*In many ways not as good as Arkham Asylum. The More open world can become confusing but also seem a little empty as Batman spends most of his time jumpting from rooftop to rooftop or gliding about the city. On the other hand the additional characters gadgets and abilities give this game an edge in that department.The plot is well done, though within the actual fram of the game missies out the history of Arkham City in any detail (though some can be found secondarily throughout the game) and it leaves it feeling a little detatched from the first.Catwoman is an interesting addition and incredibly well done, though my own feeling the switch between characters ended up feeling a little jarring and that Catwoman would have been better left as a complete expanson, as her story is minimal.*SPOILERS END!*On the whole, if you want a good Batman game, get the first one. if you've played that, get this, but be prepared to dedicate some time to it and not expect the same feeling the first gave so many.

												Arkham City is a hard game to recommend or pan. There is nothing glaringly wrong with it but it feels like a step down from Asylum. City lacks any truly memorable sequences, like the original’s Killer Croc battle or the Scarecrow bits. Asylum also had a more cohesive plot. Plus, while I like playing with Catwoman, I don’t like being forced to switch between her and Batman during the campaign. It just makes things feel disjointed.That being said it looks good, runs great, and there are a ton of gadgets to play with. If you liked Asylum then this offers some more of that gameplay. If you pick it up for $5 or so you’ll probably be satisfied with it, but you won’t love it.			"

(Not every of them)Now with Steamworks and GFWL is bye bye.CONS:Tiny map (Same as AA , you'll stay inside building then outside the streets anyway)Some A.I. tactics are removed (In AA, while in predator mode, a guy would move forward while someone else, would move behind him and keep him cover)I wish there was more Boss battles.Not for Batman fans.

Combat and stealth are really well done. Going into combat doesn't make you feel like you screwed up the stealth part and stealthing around doesn't make you feel like you're missing out on the combat.The only issue I have with this is that most of the boss fights feel a little repetitive.

												Batman: Arkham City builds upon the intense, atmospheric foundation of Batman: Arkham Asylum, sending players soaring into Arkham City, the new maximum security home for all of Gotham City's thugs, gangsters and insane criminal masterminds.Set inside the heavily fortified walls of a sprawling district in the heart of Gotham City, this highly anticipated sequel introduces a brand-new story that draws together a new all-star cast of classic characters and murderous villains from the Batman universe, as well as a vast range of new and enhanced gameplay features to deliver the ultimate experience as the Dark Knight.With all the dlc included such as Catwoman Pack, Nightwing Bundle Pack, Robin Bundle Pack, Harley Quinn’s Revenge ,Challenge Map Pack ,Arkham City Skins Pack. It gives the player alot more to do and to explore Arkham City. after completed the main Story And the side missions these dlcs will introduce many more main story and side missions (95/100)			"

												For me, having owned all the Batman games on different platforms, this is by far the                                        BEST BATMAN GAME EVERGood open world while quite small in comparison to other games, this only helps with the constant aesthetic, making it seem you are really gliding around a cut off part of Gotham city.Fantasic story with some godlike voice acting, feels like a batman episode/comic/novel/cartoon.'Nuff said			"

The story is quite interesting with many well known characters in it such as the joker, and the world that you can free-roam in is very immersive.

												Batman: Arkham City is the sequel of Batman: Arkham Asylum and retains the latter's action and stealth game nature. The main story takes place after the events of the first game, with Quincy Sharp (now mayor of Gotham City) building a special facility to contain criminals and super villains upon a derelict part of Gotham (the titular Arkham City) and letting professor Hugo Strange manage the inmates and the facility's security. Batman decides to enter the area to better investigate Strange's true goals and face the many elements of his rogue gallery inside (with the Joker being the primary threat).Gameplay-wise, Arkham City improves the main formula of Arkham Asylum in basically everything. First of all, the game is now an open world experience, with Batman being able to roam freely through a section of Gotham City, with few indoor areas, which serve as ""dungeons"" of some sort. The huge map is inhabitated by respawning enemies and pletora of collectables and other assignments you can complete (but see below). On top of the gadgets Batman could use in the first game, Arkham City features a new set of gimmicks, which, as always, can be used both for exploration or in combat (for instance, you'll be given an electrical charges generator and freezing granades). There are also new combat moves available for Batman. While the main core of the hand-to-hand combat remains basically the same, now your enemies can use several picked up objects to make your life harder (thugs will deploy shields that require a special move to overcome and reinforced armors that'll make them immune to everything except to beatdowns). The same can be said for the stealth sequences: now the enemies'll be able to flush you out with granades and destroy your vintage points and spot some new nasty equipment (some thugs'll carry portable scramblers which'll disrupt your detective vision or special googles to spot you on vintage points). Althought Arkham City doesn't offer different levels of difficulty, upon beating the main story you'll be able to select a new Game Plus mode: it'll allow you to keep your current unlocks against advanced enemies (and reinforced bosses) up from the very beginning.Aside from the main story missions, you can also go after several side quests. The Riddler's challenges return, and so do his trophies and riddles, with now the additional task to save hostages from deadly trap rooms once you completed enough tasks. The other side missions revolve around other important characters and Batman trying to find them to stop their agenda or to ally with them (for example a series of quests revolves around Batman trying to stop Deadshot from killing various political prisoners). It's worth mentioning however that the side missions design could had used a bit more work and trying to follow each from one step to another (especially while dealing with the main story too) is often far too confusing or frustrating (namely, several Riddler's trophies require absolute controls precision to be achieved, and triggering the next step of nearly all the side stories require scouting the huge game's map for hard to find bodies and such).Other side activities include the combat and predator challenges (which require you to achieve the highest score possibly in selected maps by realizing the best flawless combos or offing the enemies in specific ways, respectively), which can be also cleared with different characters, and concept arts and character trophies to unlock.I'd also like to notice how, as some kind of big Batman fan, Arkham City really blowed up my expectation. Not only the main story of the game manages to put together several important Batman antagonists (Penguin, Two-Face, Joker, Mr. Freeze, ...) in the same place, but it also manages to sound incredibly convicing: it's one of my favorite tale from the Batman universe ever. Add to that the general great focus the developers put into the characters' and levels' design and the clever easter eggs.The Catwoman DLC is included in every new copy of Arkham City and allows you to play as Catwoman in few mission which are fullu integrated into Batman's own story (as well as being able to go on free roam with her after the end of it). Catwoman spots different gadgets than Batman and is generally a more fragile character, but she makes up for it with a more agile style of fighting (she can walk on ceilings during predator sequences and pick up unexpected enemies from there, for instance). She can also be used as a character in challenge mode.The Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC is the first and only story-driven DLC for Arkham City. It takes place after the main campaign and inside the Steel Mill level, albeit with several new decorations. You play the first part of the DLC as Robin, while the second one sees you taking control of Batman once again. Despite this, the whole package can be seen as extremely disappointing (the whole main story of it takes place in a reskin of an area you already visited and pits you against reskinned enemies, while there aren't really much elements to advance the general plot of the Arkham universe).All the other DLCs for Arkham City are dedicated to the challenge mode, either introducing new characters for both combat and predator challenges (like Robin and Nightwing) or new maps. They also include several skins for the various characters.To this day I consider Batman: Arkham City one of the greatest jump in quality for a videogame sequel I've ever played, one of the best pieces of Batman media I've ever experienced and one of the finest action game I've ever enjoyed.

												A sequel to an amazing game and an even better storyline than the first one. Flying around Arkham City is so satisfying and the combat, beautiful. The game is definitely worth the money and you will want more. Pick it up now! "

												As other Batman games in the last gen gaming time, Rocksteady has been doing a great work not only in the graphics and gameplay, but the most important thing that cautivates people to play games (in my opion) is the history it has.Great HistoryGreat GraphicsGreat GameplayFew BugsOne of my favourite games ever.

Batman: Arkham City features perfect balance between open-world game and more focused Metrovania-style structure; the combat is refined even further while stealth sections are still challenging and engaging as its predecessor. Moreover, while some may miss the more Metroid-style approach of the last game, Arkham City at least makes sure that its open world is not a gimmick: traversing the map is a breeze (both literally and figuratively), while the side missions and amount of things to do are great both in quantity and quality. Last but not least, Arkham City shows how to do a strikingly impressive storytelling in a game form, another quality which it thankfully inherits from its esteemed predecessor.			"

												Amazing game. I played it several times and even have two copies in my library (one GOTY). The story and the atmosphere itself that oozes from every detail in this nerd-made game is great. In my opinion, it is the best part of the series. The freeflow fighting system and the diverse gadgets allow a genuine gameplay that is the original formula of this series and is copied by following (Remember Me, Mad Max). None of the mentioned can be compared to this piece of art. With good story, characters on both sides and a variety of tasks in the world. If someone has some love for comic book heros, the Batman, good action games: This is a must-have.			"

												After playing Arkham Knight, would sugget that this is the best game in the series. Not because of all the bugs Arkham Knight had but because of a very closely linked story, nice narration and the free flow combat system. I story unravels very nicely with all the characters being an important part of the game(except for Riddler, God knows why is he still there). The graphics are neat and the music backs the pace of the game very well. The stealth sequesnce are very well designed with a lot of attention given to details.Its a must buy for all the Batman fans.			"

												Hey guys it has been a while now since Origins came out and I thought as BIIIG Fan I need to speak a few words. This game is worth buying but not at top mark value. The amount of bugs I encountered and continue to encounter while playing origins holds me back from really enjoying the game and getting into being the bat. If I hadnt been so hungry for the collectors edition and statue on console I would've waited for a sale. That aside, it is a great game with some pretty great moments. When compared to the other two batman games I will say this, it does fall short in some areas, but also makes changes in others.  The combat is MUCH more challenging in this one . However, the combat falls prey to the ever so counter intuitive design pitfalls and glitches . Many times I find myself frustrated with larger groups of enemies instead of excited as I was in the previous batman games. In the first two games when you see a large group of enemies you get a sense of challenge and a thrill to get that highscore. In this it becomes more of a pain in the butt 9 times out of 10. It does challenge you but when you fail it doesnt feel like it was your mistake it feels like somehting happened that shouldnt have. Not saying thats the case 100% of the time but none the less my point still stands.All in all a great game but, it makes appreciate the first two and Rock Steady all the more. I see DLC coming out as well and I am very concerned and warn all of you about the fact they have not polished up all glitches in the current main game they have sold us. They ARE in deed working on it and ever 2-4 weeks ive seen a significant patch solving many issues and improving the experience. Well besides the obvious pros and cons that was my feelings, review and experience with Batman Arkham Origins. Hope you have fun with it ! I know I did ;)			"

												Pros:- An open world that's not too big, but not too small- Large cast of characters and villains- Improved, tighter combat controls- Well crafted story from Batman veteran Paul Dini- Varied enemy types keep you on your toes in both open combat and stealth/predator sections- Good amount of gadgets and upgrades- Many challenge maps with four playable characters (Batman, Robin, Catwoman, and Nightwing)Cons:- Riddler overkill- All but two or three side missions are underwhelming/boring- Traversing the map can be tedious- Technical issues- Horrible looking cutscenes- Catwoman sub-plot is there for gimmickThe Bottom Line:Anyone progressing from Arkham Asylum to Arkham City will notice a significant improvement over the previous title. Better combat, an open world with interior and exterior locations, and a large cast of characters will all be welcome additions and make the game feel superior to the franchise debut.However, Arkham City isn't without flaws. The biggest in my book is the absolute over-saturation/overkill of Riddler junk. There are over 400 trophies, riddles, and destructible objects all over the place and with their integration into a side-mission you almost feel obligated to track them all down - something that becomes even MORE of a pain when you come across numerous ones you can't access yet due to your progress in the main story (needing certain gadgets). This annoyance is multiplied then when you have to come back to it later but to do so requires a lengthy journey to their location hampered by areas that were accessible but no longer (forcing you to find a different path) and/or the simple time it takes to get to them.Arkham City is also still hindered by bugs/glitches and crashes even four years after its intial release, and cutscenes are absolutely terrible looking as they're done at a resolution and detail level that shouldn't even have been the ""norm"" for 2011 consoles. Beyond these things there are plenty of other smaller annoyances that, while not severly diminishing the overall experience, certainly hold the game back from being almost perfect.In the end, Arkham City is a fantastic game that every Batman fan has to play. Easily the second best game in the entire franchise it's not one to glance over because of its age.8 Joker Balloons out of 10 "

												By far one of the best games I've ever played.After the amazing Arkham Asylum Rocksteady published this masterpiece where you are able to explore the whole city of Arkham (not Gotham!). The story itself is a little bit too short but there are a few sidequests so that is okay.The gameplay is just great. Gliding and grappling is very easy and after a few minutes you are used to it. Same for the fight system, which ist easy to control but on harder difficults also hard to master perfectly.Totally recommended if you are a fan of the Batman Series.			"

												***SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BATMAN ARKHAM CITY***	1/05/15So after spending 17-18 hours with Batman Arkham City and completing the main story, I must say that I am blown away. This game is absolutely unbelievable! The story is so rich and motivates you to keep pushing in the story, the gameplay really makes you feel like Batman, and the amount of things to do in the game is staggering. I still have not completed the Catwomen storyline or any other of the DLC included in the GOTY edition of the game (however, I plan on continuing to play Batman Arkham City so be on the lookout for updated reviews regarding the DLC component of this game). This is strictly a review of the base game of Batman Arkham.Story: 9.5 out of 10	After completing the main story of the game, my jaw dropped. Everything that led up to the end, the struggle, all concluded in an epic finale that I will not forget for a long time. I am not going to discuss the story for fear of spoiling something, but I must say that the story alone is worth the price of admission. The written script is excellent, and Batman is confronted by a numerous amount of famous rivals. Overall, I enjoyed every minute of the story; sequences with the Joker (just like Arkham Asylum) were definitely a highlight in my book.Graphics: 9.5 out of 10The graphics in Batman Arkham City are excellent. The atmosphere is dark, tense, rich with detail, and a feeling of dread overcomes me everytime I play the game (in a good way). However, this does not last long due to the fact that you are Batman! The environments vary greatly in Arkham City. There is a steel mill taken over by the Joker and turned into something resembling a circus act, a police department taken over by Mr. Freeze, a museum occupied by the Penguin, etc. The character models and environment are polished, filled with detail, and provide for a rich Batman experience.- The only thing I disliked about Batman Arkham City is that the game sometimes stutters when gliding over Arkham City which I imagine has to be streaming issue (this is a well known issue among many PC gamers). However, other than this issue, the game runs great on my R9 290. Maxed out, I average about 160+ fps indoors and 90-120 fps outdoors. Do not let the stuttering issue prevent you from playing this masterpiece - you honestly get use to it. A work-around that I use to fix some stuttering issues is to pan the camera 360 degrees around Batman a few times - this really helps!Gameplay: 9.8 out of 10Just like Batman Arkham Asylum, Batman Arkham City is broken into a few gameplay scenarios: stealth, combat, and exploration - Riddler trophies/challenges. Just like the previous game, stealth is one of my favorite parts of this game. As the predator, you hunt down one thug at a time using different tactics such as hanging from gargoyles and performing inverted takedowns, and using a range of different gadgets at your disposal. Overall, the amount of options you have when approaching these scenarios is amazing, and I can totally see myself going back and perfecting my skills in the challenge mode.Combat is much more dynamic and free-flowing than in Arkham Asylum. You can now counter multiple enemies at one time, there are many more enemy types, and there are now more gadgets that are hotkeyed to use to string together combos. The combat in Batman Arkham City can be as in-depth as you want it to be. Overall, the stealth and combat is turned up to eleven as compared to Arkham Asylum, and the game really makes you feel like Batman!The game also comes with 12 side missions (I believe that is right?) that has Batman fighting, tracking down, and helping some classic rivals. Challenge rooms return letting you refine your skills in stealth and combat. Also, with the GOTY edition of the game, Catwomen becomes a playable character whose story becomes intertwined with Batman's. Catwomen controls greatly, her fighting style differs greatly from Batman's, and it is a joy playing as her (I personally prefer playing as Batman, but playing as Catwoman is a nice change of pace.)Lastly, just like Arkham Asylum, Riddler trophies/challenges return in abundance (however this is not a bad thing). Spread out among Arkham City are 440 Riddler trophies/challenges (I have only collected 170). These trophies/challenges really make you scavenge the environment, and provide many more hours of enjoyment to an already fantastic game.Audio: 10 out of 10	It should come as no surprise that the audio in this game is stellar. The voice acting is the best that I have ever heard in a game; the musical score bring out the perfect emotions at the perfect times. Gadgets sound just as they should, and gliding around Arkham City with wind flowing underneath Batman's wingsuit is excellent. I could not wish for anything better in the audio department of this game!Conclusion:	I LOVED BATMAN ARKHAM CITY! It is the reason I love playing video games, and why I continue to do so. This game provides a medium to play as Batman, and should not be passed up on. This game does everything right, and is one of the best games that I have played in the past five years (I do not say that lightly). It improves so much upon the great core provided by Batman Arkham Asylum, yet provides so much innovation to keep the game fresh and rewarding. Do yourself a favor, you owe it to yourself to play Batman Arkham City.Batman Arkham  City		9.7 out of 10BUY THIS GAME!!!!			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum was a surprise hit in 2009, blowing away all expectations and grabbing several Game of the Year awards, against heavy hitters like Uncharted 2. It was an excellent game, however it had a few issues, such as glitchy character models and repeated boss fights. Two years later, Arkham City came out. Oh boy. Batman; Arkham City is an improvement in every single way and form, and is a testament to the saying that ""Bigger is better."" As expected, the voice acting is top notch, with Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy delivering excellent performances as Joker and Batman, respectively. The story is leagues better than the original, with an ending so emotionally fulfilling that it left me stunned when I first beat this game. The graphics have aged, yet still help maintain the dark, damp style of Arkham City. The gameplay is the simple ""tap x to punch, y to counter"". Overall, there is so much bang for your buck here. From the side quests featuring a wide range of villains, to the story line that can be truly considered a comic book worthy story, you're getting you're money's worth. Graphics: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Story:9/10Overall:9/10 - Must buy.			"

												Going into this game after playing Asylum, I honestly didn't really know how Arkham City could be better (except the boss fights). But it certainly showed me how- it expands massively on Asylum, building on everything done right in it like a good sequel should. The gameplay is even better, with more gadgets and special moves (even the boss fights were improved, although still not perfect (except the Mr Freeze one; that was just plain awesome!)). I also loved playing as Catwoman. There's also way more content in this, with over 10 side missions, over 400 Riddler trophies to collect, New Game +, Harley Quinn's revenge and all the Challenge maps. With it comes the kinda small, but amazingly detailed open world of Arkham City with tonnes of Easter Eggs to explore. The voice acting is still of film quality and the graphics are awesome. The story may feel a bit jumpy and messy at times, and I didn't think Hugo Strange was that good of a villain (mainly because he has soooooo many opportunities to kill Batman practically gift-wrapped for him and he doesn't take advantage of a single one), but the story was still very enjoyable, particularly the beginning and the ending. Overall, Arkham City is one of the best games I've ever played and is by far the best superhero game ever. 10/10			"

												Much better than Arkham Aslyum. Better plot, improved mechanics, and more playable characters.Glad to see that the studio is heading to the right direction.Downside is that Harley Quinns Revenge glitched out for me and I wasn't able to try that =/Lasted Me: 10 hoursWorth Meter: $30			"

												The best in the sereis This is the secound instalment in the Arkham sereies, and this is truely the most eventfull of the games I have palyed. The overall gameplay is like the first game in the sereis, but it have been inproved, and perfected. The fighting part of the game, is made by using the mouse to navigate whitch charecter you want to attack, you use the left mouse button to attack and the right to counter, you can also use the middle to confuse. Along the way the enemeys get harder, and get new equpment, and new tacktics must be used to deafeat them. There is also the stealth element, where Batman must take down a room with armed thugs in order to continue or save someone. Here you must plan your attacks and be paistent in order to succed. There are so many small details in this game, and I really love how many mini games and challenges, there are. You can take challenges in fighting and stealth, and use diffrent charecters such as catwomen, there is also a playable charecter in the story mode, nightwing and robin. Furthermore, in the main game Zaez is on the run, the Riddler is kisnapping people and putting up his throphies and riddles to find again. The Mad Hatter is runnig amok, and so much more. The story is the best Batman story in a long time. The story takes palce after the events of Arkham Asylum, where the Joker have become sick becouse of the titan serum he took, meanwhile Bruce Wayne is sent to the new jail city Arham City, and here we find out that Hugo Strange now knows, who Batman really is. This makes the plot more interesting, and it only get`s more tence after the Joker infects Batman with he`s blood. So now Batman needs to find a cure and defeat Hugo Strange, in order to keep he`s identety hidden. Since this is a prison city, we meet many other charecters, such as the Penguine, Mister Frezze, Solomon Grundy, Clayface and even Ras al` Ghoul. Every single charecter is well made, and really memerable. Along the way, you can also find informatiomn about the charecters, inside Arkham city, this only adds more depth to the charecters and I love it. The ending is worth talking about, and this is also the part where I talk about the DLC mission from the game, if you don`t want the ending spolied, don`t read untill you see the spoiler over part.-----------spoilers------------In this game, the Joker dies, this is a shock to anyone who played this game, and it is truely a fantastic ending. It is clear that Batman will be scared by this event, since the Joker and Batman, have a conection deep down, every fan of the seires knows about. The Joker needs Batman and the other way around, but this put the nail in the coffin and made a climactic ending, that will be remembered by me.This leads to the events after the attack on Arkham, and guees who`s gone mad? Well of couse it`s Harly Quen. Since the Joker died, she have kidnapped police officers, and turned prttey goth. We also find out that Batman have been kidnapped, and that Harly Quen thought she was pragnent with Jokers child, whitch only made her even more mad. It is up to Robin to save the day in this DLC, and it is a nice change since you have played as Batman all day in the main game. ------------spoilers over----------Overall this game is really well designed and it is a fantastic story, that have twist and turns along the way, plus fantasitc sceneory, that only will make you love the game even more, thumps up. 8 out of 10			"

												Incredible game. Certainly the best superhero game of all time, possibly the best (definitely one of the best) games of all time. It's the perfect sequel to Arkham Asylum, continuing from the events that happened. It's an improvement in every way: Combat, gliding, predator, and environment. The boss fights are some of the most memorable I've ever done, and each feels unique. The music really boosts the atmosphere, and adds another layer of dread and mystery to the story. I've played this game 5 times, and am playing it again, as each time I discover new elements to the game. Highly recommended to anyone, even if you're new to the Batman franchise.			"

												Batman Arkham City is most likely the best superhero video game of all time, if not the best. Rocksteady finally presented to us what we always wanted to become, Batman. This is the sort of game that will make you want to play it twice. This is the complete Batman package. $20.00 for this game with all the DLC is a great price for such a great game. A great story, side missions, challenge bundles and more characters. This is a comic book lover's dream. To become the Batman.""No one is untouchable""10/10			"

												I've been playing games for many years and for the most part; I'm losing my passion for them - in that, I feel that games today, just don't fulfill the promises (that I) (imagined) were made years ago.With that being said, there are few games that truly hold my interest continuously until the game is complete.Batman: Arkham City is one of those games however (along with Arkham Asylum - but I consider them merely the same game in an ongoing saga - so far).Firstly, the game is incredibly polished in my opinion.Graphics, animation, sound, gameplay, story and the various gameplay mechanics.The story is a strong Batman style story and while I wouldn't say there are many twists or elaborate depth to it - it IS very involving and will keep you interested.The game mechanics, from travelling around the city via Cape-Glide, Grappel Gun, Zip-Line to the Combat is where the game shines.Often, in games, you are meant to be some Expert or whatever... Yet, from not knowing the controls very well, you'll find yourself not being very ""expert"" at all.In Batman, the controls are so simple, that it's easy to feel like Batman.Combat is simply a matter of positioning (moving about or jumping about) and a single button for ""attack"" and a single button for ""counter-attack"" (though there are also buttons for your gadgets and abilities that you can use.Pretty much you merely press the button once for an attack, and when it lands, press the button again, for a second attack and so on and so on - in this way, you can build up huge combos.The Counter-Attack button is used when you are going to be attacked by the enemy and works as a block and slight return attack.You simply point the camera in the direction you want to fight.. And then press the button.The combat animations and how it works are superb and never does it feel overly difficult - even when you get beat up, you are totally aware that you made a mistake and messed up the timing or used a button's ability poorly.Building up combos is how you regenerate health at the end of each battle - which I find works well - rather than finding magical health items around the map.There is an element of stealth too. You don't have to just jump into the fray and start using combos - especially since sometimes there are enemies with guns. However a skilled gadgeteer... Will be able to be in the fray, using his positioning and gadgets at just the right moment to deal with these armed thugs. But stealth is actively encouraged too. From swooping in and grappelling out - dealing with foes one at a time.There is so many good things to say about this game.. And, in my opinion, so few things to complain about.I would rate the game as outstanding and completely worth owning. Regardless of price - get the game as soon as you can afford to (though I'd start with Arkham Asylum - which DOES lack a few of the welcome improvements from Arkham City - but the story is a continuation and it's worth experiencing the entire saga).

The gameplay is great, not too easy not too hard, loads of extra content to keep you engaged. Gives you the power to approach situations however you see fit, with the assortment of gadgets at your disposal. All in all a must play game for everyone. (make sure you do the side missions)			"

 Awesome game overall: Engine: Unreal Engine 3 is a super solid engine even if it's heavily modified.Gameplay: Great combat, very fluid, cool mechanics.Story: Good storyline and a fine sequel to arkham asylum.Dialogues: Well written dialogues and the voice acting makes the dialogues sound ever better.World Design: Very immersive world, really feels like a prison city and a part of Gotham.Graphics: Very nice graphics.Sound: Sound effects are pretty good and the voice acting is legendary.Conclusion: Definitely a must buy on any given day, although it can get pretty cheap on sales.Batman: Arkham City is one of the best games in the action-adventure genre... BTW Mark Hamill has the best Joker voice and laugh.Absolutely worth it "

												I think i should get this out there. I haven't played the other games in this series with this game being my first so my opinion will completely be based on my experiences with this game by itself. If your hoping for a comparison between this game and the other you should look at the other reviews. If you don't want to hear the full review but just my thoughts just scroll to the bottom. Ok now let get started with the review ^-^.  The Long Review StealthAs a fan of stealth games, this game does have some elements of stealth to it, with specific segments dedicated to it. These segment provide a decent amount of stealth where you are required to work yourself around a room to take down a number of enemies which are all armed making them difficult to handle head on. Other elements are added on later in the game to make this more difficult so there is some need to vary your strategy. During these moments, you can truly feel like the dark knight as you make your way around the room taking them out one by one and making your enemies feel truly helpless or growingly paranoid.CombatThe more frequent encounters are where you're required to battle a group of enemies head on with the enemies mostly being unarmed near the beginning of the game. These battles are made interesting with the way the combat system works. The combat system is basically a combo meter that requires you to not make a mistake in a combo such as getting hit, countering early or missing a punch. All you have to do is keeping pressing the punch button (Right click for me) while pointing in the direction of your target (wasd for me). Later in the game you will be given the choice to buy a somewhat finisher that can be used at a high combo (12 hits generally). Also, the variety of weapons you will have to deal with will require you to strategies a bit making the experience a bit different each time.GadgetsNow, time for the gadgets. There is a large and healthy variety of gadgets that can be used in this game. From the classic batarang to weapons that batman made on the spot which is somewhat ridiculous but effective. These gadgets can be used to solve puzzles or the riddlers puzzles (which I'll talk about later). The gadgets are not just useful for puzzles. They can also be used in combat, helping to deal with various situations such as when your surrounded or if an enemy has a gun pointed at you. StoryFinally, the story. Without spoiling much, the story revolves mainly around the joker and another villain by the name of Strange. There are many other villains in the game such as Poison ivy, Catwomen, The Penguin and many others. You could play the entire game focused on the main story but after that there are still many other things to do so there is replayability if that's what your looking for. Besides the other Villains that can be interacted with in the game, there are also the collectables placed by The Riddler throughout the map which has it's ups and downs such as if you're trying to 100% the game.Final thoughts In my opinion, i feel that this is a great game and is something that you should definitely try playing if you're a fan of batman or you want to play a fun brawler with interesting stealth.Ques: Could you play the with little to no knowledge about Batman?Ans: You definitely can play it as the game does give you a little insight to the characters you're about to get involved with via the in game encyclopediaI'll admit the controls can feel a little clunky just due to the fact that some of the keys for some actions overlap each other eg. Running and taking cover are the same key there's a chance of doing one or the other when near a corner.There are other examples of clunky control but overall i think Batman Arkham City is a great open world game.I definitely recommend it <3 "

The game came out in 2011, and it still holds up, gameplay and graphics wise. You get a wide range of fun interesting missions and side missions to do and if you want easter eggs, you'll find them.

And the campaigns just completely sucked up my time - making a Mook Horror Show out of the Batfam is so awesome!Arkham City is GOTY like its predecessor Arkham Asylum for a reason.			"

												One of the best open world games I have ever played, the best of the Batman Arkham series is this one! Grab it seriously awesome fighting moves tons of riddles to find & solve tons of stuffs to do and with the GOTY edition you get all the DLCs of the game as well! you can play as the Cat, Robin & the Bat as well w/ various outfits.I recommend buying this game during sale because the price goes really cheap compared to the amount of fun it delivers to you! 10/10 for the game. 100% satisfying.If you have played the game then...  Get out of there you chicken!  "

												Arkham City is a huge step up following Arkham Asylum. The free roam around the city let's you explore new sections of the map freely and also find hidden secrets and side villians. The game is absolutely packed with super villians to interact with and take down. As you do the entire game. In this game you also follow a side storyline of Catwoman. I was very uninterested in that entire thing simply because it was filler. Catwoman does have some pretty cool fighting differences than Batman along with gadgets. But found her being very dull and too much a change of pace when you played as her. - This series is a huge must for any Batman fan and this game alone can make any superhero fan smile. Worth the full price any day of the week. But the Arkham games are pretty common in sales as well. Pick up this game regardless and I'm sure you will be more than happy you did.			"

												The most highly-marketed feature of Batman: Arkham City is the replacement of the small, confined corridors of the previous game with an open-world setting. Ironically, this feature is also the worst aspect of the game, and one of the primary reasons that the sequel doesn't quite live up to Rocksteady Studios' previous effort.One year after the events of Arkham Asylum, Bruce Wayne is abducted and imprisoned within Arkham City, a controversial prison within a walled-off section of Gotham overseen by private security forces led by a mysterious villain named Hugo Strange, who makes it clear up-front that he knows Batman's true identity. It's almost comical how quickly things escalate, with Bruce Wayne being captured by the Penguin literally at the front gate of Arkham City. Weirdly enough, just about none of the game has anything to do with the initial problem of Batman's identity being revealed, and Hugo Strange himself only really comes into villainhood in the game's final act, with the majority of the game's runtime dedicated to the Joker - an infinitely more interesting villain that any of Batman's other enemies, most of whom are regulated to minor, almost tangential missions early in the game. In fact, a lot of the plot is actually just tangents, with the purpose of leading the player on a merry tour of the big, gloomy world that's been constructed. It's lacking in focus for the most part, with one very specific MacGuffin loosely tying everything together. For sure, the villains are still just as good as they were in Arkham Asylum, and there are certainly more of them, but most of them are just minor acknowledgements of actual character, instead just displaying the characteristics for which they are most well-known. To make things even more dire on the story front, the game of the year edition incorporates the normally separate Catwoman DLC into the main story, spreading the missions throughout the game's length, serving only to completely break the flow of both the game and the DLC.While the story's a bit of a mess this time around, the gameplay is pretty spot-on. Most of the new stuff that's been introduced is simple and easy to use, and in general the combat just flows a lot better, making for an even more delightful experience in kicking impoverished homeless people in the teeth. Even better, efforts have actually been made to stop Batman from being incredibly overpowered in stealth segments, with new gear that scrambles x-ray vision and sees long distances, even in the dark. The combat is still a lot more fun - it's fast and surprisingly tactical considering the entire premise is punching large quantities of men. The introductions of new enemy types has done a lot to keep it all fresh and challenging, especially in massive brawls involving weapons and the classic giant mutants from the original game. In short, while Arkham City is quite a bit worse on the story front, and it lacks the tight focus and thick atmosphere that shrouded Arkham Asylum, though it makes up some lost ground with myriad gameplay and control improvements, coming together as a finished product that's overall worse than it's predecessor, but still a lot of fun.My review of Batman: Arkham Asylum "

												[9/10] – Quite possibly the best super hero game I’ve ever played, and for very good reasons. This title (as well as the prequel) is a masterfully crafted piece of art. It’s dark, mature and even scary at times. It is the exact incarnation of awesome that I always wanted out of this genre of game. If you ever thought for a second that you wouldn’t play this because it’s a super hero game, then I invite you to contemplate how much♥♥♥♥♥kicking, batarang throwing boss’ism you are missing. It’s very well-paced, with fantastic voice acting, an incredibly detailed and interesting environment. There are loads to explore and do, including awesome side quests and upgrades to collect, each as rewarding as the last. It also has a deceptively intriguing story coupled with one of the best combat systems I’ve seen a very long time. You are quite literally the awesome that Batman is when you play, and quite literally missing the ♥♥♥♥ out if you’re not.			"

												If you're just in the mood to smash face and not feel bad about it, this is one game you could play. Though games with fighting do somewhat seem simular in nature with Counters and such, Arkham City still had it's own unique feel to it. The story was well done I think, and you are of course... Batman. Sneaking around, grappling from point to point - flying between buildings - it really does has it's own style. I enjoyed my time with it, even though I've not picked it back up since beating it, I never felt like it was a waste of money. A well done game for it's genere.			"

												Batman: Arkham City is a third person action adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios in association with Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment on the Unreal Engine. It follows billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne AKA Batman after getting arrested and admitted to a city sized insane asylum dubbed ""Arkham City"" by an enigmatic scientist, and has to fight his way out whilst simultaneously hunting for a cure to a mysterious TITAN side-effect that threatens to infect all of Gotham.Much like the first Batman: Arkham game, Rocksteady has managed to create a player-narrative experience that feels just as grand and exciting as it was in the first game, but this time the gameplay has been properly honed and the direction now turns toward a GTA-esque city dynamic with side-missions as well as story missions.And as sequels are Rocksteady has addressed the complaints given and now I'm here to report the state of all the problems I listed in my review of Arkham Asylum, to see if they're really up to snuff and to see if this game is worth it.Let's a go!Batman's Detective Vision has been downgraded in a few ways, now it's more difficult to tell which directions enemies are facing, as well as a much murkier style that encourages the player to switch between normal vision AND detective mode. The keyboard and graphical settings are still on a different program, and now you have to specifically look for it it doesn't open on start up like before. Killer Croc does show up in this game but as a cameo so I can't really comment on it, that being said most set-pieces are well placed and exciting unlike Killer Croc's overly slow and unchallenging game of red light green light. The opening of this game gives you almost all the weapons you had originally, which is exactly right for the games pacing.The setting of this game is still atmospheric but now has a lot more character, and feels lively. The final boss with Clayface is still a little bit underwhelming but it's fun and epic and leads to the conclusion that really sells the rest of the game so I'll give it a few points for that alone, and the other bosses are also incredibly fun and much better than the first game's, requiring strategy and variety (Highlights include Ra's al Ghul and Mr Freeze.) The combat is just as solid but now it's made a little easier to perform combos and the countering system is more responsive, but there's still not auto run. The disposal of Harley Quinn in this game isn't really a factor but a similar issue arises with The Penguin who's there from the very beginning but has what seems like frankly boring final encounter before pulling the rug from under you with a surprise boss fight that is anything BUT underwhelming. The attacks from Harvey Dent similarly have nothing to do with the plot and also kind of halt progression, and if you're playing as catwomen the exact same problem is there again with Poison Ivy. The story structure is yet again somewhat repetitive but this time it just works better for whatever reason, and the stealthing is much more varied with smarter enemies who will go so far as to pay special attention to gargoyles if they see you flee to one.The logic involving Riddles is more interesting and makes me really think about my surroundings. The riddler trophies do this really interesting thing where you see a lot of them before you have the tools to get them which makes finding them more gratifying, and sometimes when you DO get them you feel like a freaking genius the first time I figured out a puzzle using the remote control batarang and conducting electricity with it I was singing my praises higher than an egotistical ballad singer.The detecive vision is darker and murkier making key things stand out more, and the normal vision world around you is vibrant and interesting to look at no matter what you're doing. The maps inside buildings are at better scale with the buildings outside them, and overall this is one of them best sequels I've ever played.			"

												The Definitive Batman Gaming Experience.Batman: Arkham City is a masterpiece of a game which displays multiple levels of creativity and care, allowing players to become ""The Batman"". As the sequel to the criticlly aclaimed Arkham Asylum, Arkham City is rich with improvements from the previous entry while also adding new additions to the series aswell. Arkham City's voice acting is top notch, with many notable cast members; such as the recognizable inclusions of Animated Series Vets: Kevin Conroy portraying the ever ""cheerful"" Dark Knight, and the marvelous Mark Hamil as the Joker. From the MOMENT you start this game you will not want to put it down as every second within Arkham City is rich with content which will keep you on your toes till the very end. Just about every location within the game is full of nice nods and suprises which makes the long trecs around the city even more enjoyable. The plot of Arkham City is a rollercoaster of events (and even emotions!), that allow even a newcomer to the batman universe to achieve full satisfactory from the contents of the game, while simultaneously satisfying the greatest Batman Fanatics!After you finish the game, the Concept Art gallery, and Character Trophies are some of the best way to understand how much forethought and time went into making this game, which is possibly one of the most pleasurable experiences you'll ever have with a game!(well at least while playing a superhero game).Also, Good news! This is the comeplete edition of the game (Game of the Year), and as with the GOTY edition comes all the wonderful dlc content such as Characters, Challenge Maps, and Batsuits! (But don't play Harley Quinn's Revenge till you finish the main story...spoilers inside).Overall, Batman: Arkham City is a non-stop joyride with twists and turns which will turn you, into the Hero Gotham City deserves.

												Oh Batman: Arkham City, how I love thee.  I don't even know where to begin to explain how fantastic this game is.The story in itself is good, but where the game really shines is in worldbuilding.  The titular Arkham City is probably one of my favorite locations in all of gaming.  The art style and level design just brings the superprison to life, and even the simple conversations between inmates that you can eavesdrop on make the game incredibly immersive.  That's to say nothing of the excellent use of Batman's villian cast.  To go into too much detail would spoil many sidequests, but suffice to say that all are expertly designed, in character, and brought to life by their respective voice actors/actresses (the Riddler being my personal favorite).As for gameplay, it's just as excellent as it was in Aslyum, but has been improved upon like a good sequel should.  On the combat side, you now have the ability to counter multiple enemies at once, all gadgets can be easily incorporated into combat, new special takedowns, and the animations are just as well-detailed from each punch to counter to special takedown that give the combat a finese that few games can match.  And of course, we have the inclusion of multiple playable characters this time as well, from Catwoman to Robin to Nightwing, all of whom have their own unique gadgets and takedowns that shake up the combat.  Stealth as well gets some minor improvements (the ability to quickly end silent takedowns a very welcome addition), and the new gadgets available also offer new ways to neutralize enemies.  Some now take place outdoors as well, giving you even more verticality to the encounters and more tactical approaches and considerations.And of course, we have the challenge mode carried along from Aslyum.  There are now twelve individual maps (split evenly between combat and predator missions), and a new addition: campaign modes, where you tackle three maps back-to-back with qualifers chosen by the player that can either handicap or give you a helping hand.  Unfortunately, this is where I have one big criticism for the game, as the predator missions erroneously followed in the tradition of Aslyum by requiring you to complete specific objectives to beat a level.  On top of most of these objectives being completely arbitrary, and even pointless, then just restrict the player's opportunity to experiment and serve only to make the maps repetitous.  It's a shame they went this route, because the predator encounters in the story mode are fun precisely because they don't have such arbitrary requirements.  Thankfully, the combat challenges aren't structured this way, allowing you to actually experiment with the many combat moves and not be rigidly locked into a routine, and are genuinely fun, meaning you'll want to go back and play them many times over.Tl;dr Batman: Arkham City is easily one of the best games I've played in years, and I could not recommend it highly enough.

I still pick it up from time to time.As a fan, I can't be more happy with the references and easter eggs you find during the game.There are tons of things to do and I love the Riddles. Some are better crafted than others but its amazing how they are linked to the comics' cannon.I can't recommend this game enough, one of the best games I ever played and I still pick it from time to time.Recommended!

												Arkham City was a wonderful sequel to Arkham Asylum, not only story wise, but with litterally taking everyhting great about asylum and multiplying it by 20. Here we have a much bigger map to explore as well as lots of interesting characters and side quests. Playing through all the side quests doesn't feel like a hassle and in fact I found my self excited to play through them, they all features characters that i personally loved and they were lots of fun. The twists and turns of the story line in Arkham City will keep you hooked from the beginning and you wont want to stop playing until you finally reach the end and learn everything about Protocol 10 and The Joker. This game is a thrill ride from start to finish and should be a pick up if you're a fan of Batman or just looking for a decently sized action game. This game (for my system) had never dropped below its 62 fps cap and ran buttery smooth the whole way through expect for one crash I received at the end of the Harley Quinn DLC but booted back up and finished no problem. Side note: When doing the Mysterious Figure side quest, Azrael may not show up a the location he is supposed to, meaning sometimes he just wont be there, a fix is to simply exit the game back to the main menu and continue your story and he will be there. (figured I'd mention this as I was confused when it happened to me).			"

												This is the best game I've played in years and I believe a worthy successor to Arkham Asylum.I felt Asylum streamlined you a bit while City let's you do your own thing. Unlike the Elder Scrolls game though, I want to complete the main story line.Story/Writing:I loved the writing. I thought they kept true to the characters (small issue with Ra's). I loved how the little extra stuff you do unlocks bio's and tapes (like in the first game) that flush out the writing. The main story line is  good, not great, but good and the characters really do carry it.Gameplay:Flying around as the batman is such a satisfying feeling. I prefer predator mode (stealth) over the punch your way through, but they both feel really good to do. I enjoy the different gadgets and being able to use them in combat. I liked that i didn't need to complete everything in the game and could still play through. I enjoy the lvl up system (which is just upgrades).Bugs: I experienced one bug in which the map showed a mission location that had already been completed. That's it. No crashes, no characters phasing into walls. Nothing else in 50 hours of play.I'm just going to say this game improved the series and is one of the best games i've ever played. (10/10)			"

												A journalist once discribed Batman-Arkham Asylum as a love letter to the Batman franchise; and Batman Arkham City hands you a game that follows that exact MO. Unlike the portrayals of characters and events in the film industry, this game (as with Arkham Asylum) delivers you characters with motives and emotions true to the roots. It certainly isn't beating Superman down. An excellent example here is the sections with Mr Freeze, who isn't the moron that Arnie played, but a sad, desperate man willing to do anything and try any angle to save Nora. No spoilers, but you understand and relate to his actions and you unwittingly feel sorry for him and his fate.The game in itself is excellent, with an amazing cast of script writers, voice actors and level designers. It really gives you the feeling of being the Dark Knight himself.The only minor negative point I have is the collection system with the Riddler trophies. Although mostly brilliantly presented, it ends up becoming a grind with way too a large quantity, and with some trophies not making sense at all. Example: Why would Riddler want you to use a certain weapon a certain amount of time? How would he know and why would he care? Why should I?Regardless. Even as someone that does not nessesarily care for the franchise, this game is highly recommended as with Arkham Asylum. Get it now.			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum was a real surprise to me. I enjoyed every bit of it. However, when Batman Arkham City was released, I got I little bit confused with all the new things. After all these years I decided to give this game another chance and bought it on sale.  Here is my _personal_ list of pros and cons: Pros:- Very engaging world. Especially the radio transmissions- Beautiful graphics. The world design is very authentic - this is exactly how I picture Gotham city- Gameplay is very polished. This includes combat, stealth and movements- You can play Batman, Catwoman and even Robin- The Wonder city below :)Cons:- Well... the open world. Besides the stunning views, the ability to glide through the city and dramatically sit on gargoyles, the open world annoys me. This is the first thing that I disliked in comparison to Arkham Asylum. Also, the collectables- Characters.  I just don't dig into seductive Catwoman, Batman's problem with killing and other stuff. Well, I have never read any Batman comics, so I had hard time to enjoy this. But I watched two Burton's movies, the unspeakable third one and all Nolan's movies. I liked the atmosphere of the Gotham city in Burton's movies. But the characters are the best in Nolan's.			"

												Arkham Asylum had only one major flaw – the game was so painstakingly, overwhelmingly, wonderfully thorough in its depiction of the Batman universe, we couldn’t imagine what was left to cover or accomplish in a sequel. The developers at Rocksteady got every element of the character right, from his combat to his gadgets to his previously neglected detective skills. They featured half a dozen of Gotham’s greatest villains, then included hidden references to nearly 30 more just as fan service. They created a setting with enough macabre detail to capture the comics’ horror, but with enough epic scope to somehow fit a Batcave, Batmobile and Batwing.This was it. This was the perfect Batman game.Yet from the moment we started Arkham City, all we could think was: Arkham Asylum was practice. Compared to its sequel, the “best superhero game ever” and our choice for Game of the Year 2009 seems like a tech demo, a first draft, merely a blueprint for what the perfect Batman game can actually be. This is it.For an immediate idea of how much bigger and better Arkham City is than its already incredible predecessor, take a look at this list of the Batman villains mentioned in Arkham Asylum, but never seen. Half of those now play major roles in the sequel, in addition to return appearances by all except one of the rogue’s gallery introduced in the original. Throw in new heroes like Robin, Alfred, Vicki Vale and Talia al Ghul, as well as a bunch of surprise cameos we wouldn’t dare spoil here, and you have a cast numbering in the “holy cow, did Joel Schumacher direct this?!” range. That fear is unnecessary, however, because the game’s writers and developers have succeeded in fully developing and fully justifying every character’s place in a narrative that makes complete logical and dramatic sense. It’s really rather miraculous.Seriously, this story is special, combining the humanity of the best Animated Series episodes, the brutal darkness of a Frank Miller comic and the confident risk-taking of a Christopher Nolan film. There are no moments as subversive as the fourth-wall break in Arkham Asylum, but there are countless moments of awe, shock and squealing fanboy glee – hell, you’ll be overpowered by all of those emotions within the first 15 minutes of the game alone. By the last 15 minutes, you may honestly choke back some tears, and not for a reason you’d ever predict or ever expect a superhero game to deliver.Of course, the most obvious upgrade in Arkham City is, well, Arkham City. At the time the original game released, a small island asylum seemed like the only possible setting for a properly done Batman experience – attempt to render the sprawling streets and skyscrapers of Gotham itself and you’d sacrifice BioShock-level detail for GTA-style size, and might as well be developing a Superman or Spider-Man game. The sequel, though, proves that assumption wrong. The asylum remains on an island of sorts – a bordered, quarantined section of Gotham City – but is at least four to five times as large as before, and if anything, more detailed.Stand still at any point and the magnitude of both Arkham City’s epic scale and atmospheric intricacy will floor you. Endless rooftops stretching into the horizon, each with a different neon sign (Ace Chemicals, where Joker was born) or peeling billboard (“The Terror”, Clayface’s famous movie role) or deadly booby trap (left by the Riddler, no doubt). An apartment building that can be instantly recognized, not only because Selina Kyle’s cats are outside one of the windows, but because every building in the environment is unique. A gigantic carnival Ferris wheel that, when scanned with Detective mode, reveals a hidden body in each compartment. Snow falling as helicopter spotlights crisscross through the night sky and fire burns in the distant background, leftover from a battle that – at some point in the game – you fought.Who are we kidding? You won’t stand still. While Rocksteady hasn’t given players the keys to the Batmobile yet, gliding and leaping and diving and climbing and rappelling across this expansive playground with the use of Batman’s cape and tools offers just as much exhilarating freedom as tearing across Liberty City on a motorcycle. An example Achievement / Trophy: “Jump off the tallest building and glide for one minute without touching the ground.” Yesssss.			"

												Fantastic. I've just started on 1% of the game but I am already impressed. I'll add more as I keep on playing. At $5 on sale, with all the DLC, I think it's worth it. Will add more when I complete the game.Finished the main campaign, other than a few cons, most impressed with the details.PROS1. Graphics***So much detail. I must say that the artist really put in a lot of effort to design a dark Industrial-age like Arkham City. Kudos to the team. I felt like I was playing the comic.a. Arkham City (Especially the details and the inner design. Who's your artist?)b. Costume design (Even the thugs, but not Robin's)c. Villians (I liked Harley Quinn the most)2. CombatSo smooth, so beautiful. Even though I'm just tapping the Left and Right Mouse buttons, the combat moves so smoothly. You can even cause enemies to interact with the environment E.g. By smashing their faces into the walls3. Detective ModeReally fun pretending to be a real detective. Of course, I understand that this isn't a real CSI but I do appreciate simple realism. E.g. How they calculate the bullets trajectory from Joker's sniper rifle. The X-Ray vision and highlighting of important objects is vital as well.4. CharactersLove Harley Quinn. So wild, so cute, so attractive. Can't wait to see the rest. This is most surprising as I had already watched some parts of the game on Youtube. It's so fun. Even after the main campaign finishes, you get to find Riddler, Killer Croc, Bane, Posion Ivy and so on.5. Arkham CityIt gives you a really good feeling seeing the walls surround the giant prison which is Arkham City. The way it's built up just ties into the story so well.6. GadgetsI love them. I especially love the ingenious use of combat + utility. E.g. Using the Batarang for combat and hitting buttons. Using the Batclaw to disarm and open seals. Using the electric charge gun to stun bosses and turn on motors. It really makes the weapons so much more useful. Compared to other games, where a weapon is just a weapon and a tool is just a tool, this really provide another avenue for clever gameplay.7. ReplayabilityI never thought that I would enjoy going back to the same place twice but Rocksteady Studios really does make the game fun. I especially liked the old GCPD map where you can first go through Penguin's goons and later Mr Freeze's boss fight.8. AIa. Heartbeat monitor. I loved it. This is so much more realistic than other stealth games, where you knock someone out and no one notices he's gone for hours.b. Radio Communications. Great to get game information and to search for clues.9. Riddler's PuzzlesI appreciate the simple, yet thoughtful puzzles. It forces you to think just that little bit more without creating a full blown mental exam.10. Multi-charactersCatwoman was fun. Using the whip was a totally new way of playing. Robin was too similar to Batman to warrant anything interesting.11. StorySo interesting. Penguin's museum collection, the underground Gotham City, the Lazarus project, Hugo Strange etc... I still don't get why Batman doesn't kill though... It is extremely righteous but it takes a little of the suspension of disbelief away.... Practically, it seems totally impossible...CONS1. Button ControlsThe Left Control + Space command is extremely difficult to do and is intutitive. It's used for dropping off the edge but it's quite silly.2. Glide KickYou would think that dropping from a height + smashing a face into the ground would instantly KO an enemy, yet this game seems to create some peculiar situations where you have to link another KO move.3. Riddler Hostage RescueToo many puzzles to solve just to get to the end. 400/600 Riddler trophies plus challanges just to rescue the hostage. I couldn't take it at a 160. When I realised the next rescue required 320 trophies. That was too much and gave up.4. Balloons, Harley Heads, Joker Teeth, Penguin modelsReally silly to have to so many things to shoot that have no value, only a challenge completed. You need to complete them just to do Riddler's hostage quest.5. Dead end MapsSome maps just become empty voids after use. E.g. The Lazarus Pit. Once you finish with it, there's only a Riddler trophy to get. This guy is Batman, he comes from the direction you least expect. It is most silly to limit Batman to doors and watch him walk into an ambush.6. Thug BodiesIf you watch the Batman shows, the thugs usually disappear quietly into the darkness. There is no unconscious body. Batman would tie them up and leave them hanging and gagged. The thugs leaving their buddy hanging or unconscious bodies unable to wake up are super silly.SUGGESTIONS1. Multiple Entrances/ExitsThis is for CON 5. Once you finish with a location, there should be another entrance or instant travel to that area as a reward. It's necessary for maps that can't use the grapnel hook. E.g. Subway.2. Gang/Turf Wars3 major gangs, Joker, Two-Face and Penguin plus TYGER. I was hoping that there would be zones where there were firefights between the gangs. E.g. Joker's snipers shooting at Penguin's men who are hiding behind cover.3. Tying Up ThugsBatman would probably have an option of tagging, hanging and gagging the thugs. It would be more true to the Batman saga. He works on Stealth Mode not fisticuffs.			"

												Very fun game but the story is a bit iffy. I would expect more content from an open world game, but it has more than enough to justify the price. The stealth bits are fantastic and in my opinion the best parts of the game. Overall, this GOTY version is worth it.EDIT: Be warned, when you install the game it auto-installs an amd dual core optimizer. If you don't have an amd card, you have to manually uninstall this thing and restart your computer because it tanks the framerate.			"

												Take a great game and add more characters, costumes, enemies, space and mechanics. Arkham Asylum was good enough by itself, playing this after AA was a great joy of brand-fidelity. As I've stated in my AA review there's nothing not to like about this game. The setting is impeccably fitting to the gotham atmosphere, the fighting has gotten even better and more diverse and so has the sneaky part, the gadjets are close to becoming ridiculous and the expanded edition provides more costumes and stuff than you'll ever use (It even has an old-rocky6like batman skin XD).

												Let me just start by saying that for me this is not only the best comic book game ever made, but just one of the best in general.Now that I've got that out, here's my review of Batman: Arkham CityPROS:-Nicely sized open world map with more than enough enemies to fight.-One of the smoothest and most fun combat systems in gaming.-Great looking game for the time it came out.-I controls really nicely with both gamepad and keyboard & mouse.-Well written Story.-The challenge maps are both challenging and fun.-Great voice talent (e.g. Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Tara Strong etc.)-The gliding is incredibly fun.-The game has great replay value with a challengeing New Game + mode and all of the side quests.-The game really makes you feel like, and captures the esscence of, Batman.CONS:-There are some annoying things about the combat system (e.g. not being able to jump out of a ground takedown leaving you open to attack, having to double tap counter to counter two attacks at once)-There are quite a few wierd bugs.-Overly sexualised female characters.SUMMARY:As you can tell I couldn't think of too many cons for this game and the good stuff heavily outweighs the bad. I will always recommend this game.I have purchased this game 3 times (Xbox 360, PC & Wii U) and I don't regret a single one.			"

												First off, if you've not played Batman: Arkham Asylum yet then you shouldn't touch City as City is a direct sequel, plus Asylum is an amazing game in its own right.Now I'm going to assume you've beaten Asylum  so that I can talk at length about City because this game not only lives up to the really high standard Asylum set, it surpasses it in every way.The main difference between Asylum and City is its pacing and game world. While Asylum had a very direct, linear path due to its constricted size, City throws all of that out of the window giving you a huge open world complete with various sidequests, ranging from AR training sequences to practice your gliding skills to you unearthing many villain's plots, ultimately finding them and incarcerating them, and last but definitely not least, the Riddler trophies and riddles, which make a comeback in an even grander scale.The story didn't lose any quality, the voice acting and overall feel of the game are as top notch as before, the combat has been further improved, with things such as multiple counters, and Batman can use several more gadgets than the previous game. However, Batman is not the only character you can play this time. Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing are all playable characters, the latter unfortunately not being in any story related content, only present in the Riddler's challenges mode. Every single one of these characters plays quite differently to the Dark Knight, and all have their strengths and weaknesses. So while you will have to replay challenges four times, one for each character, it'll feel fresh thanks to their different abilities.Now that it has had its DRM removed, there's nothing stopping you from playing this game.

												This game is another top-notch A+A+A+ BATMAN title! City has the same beautiful graphics, seamless gameplay, great combat system+A.I. and a highly epic story with great surprises/twists, just like Asylum(but better imo!)!!!!City is open world(Asylum had a small section of open world too), and it's a blast to grapnel n glide across the map. My fv part of the game was the Riddler objectives/trphy collecting puzzles. Fav sidestory was the Mad Hatter scene, extremely EPIC awesome!Music is once again very well fitting and compliments the story+atmospher+them!If you enjoyed Asylum, and even if not but you are a Batman fan, even in the slightest, GET THIS GAME!!! YOU WILL HAVE NO REGRETS!I give this game a solid 10/10, 5/5 Stars!			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum was a real surprise to me. I enjoyed every bit of it. However, when Batman Arkham City was released, I got I little bit confused with all the new things. After all these years I decided to give this game another chance and bought it on sale.  Here is my _personal_ list of pros and cons: Pros:- Very engaging world. Especially the radio transmissions- Beautiful graphics. The world design is very authentic - this is exactly how I picture Gotham city- Gameplay is very polished. This includes combat, stealth and movements- You can play Batman, Catwoman and even Robin- The Wonder city below :)Cons:- Well... the open world. Besides the stunning views, the ability to glide through the city and dramatically sit on gargoyles, the open world annoys me. This is the first thing that I disliked in comparison to Arkham Asylum. Also, the collectables- Characters.  I just don't dig into seductive Catwoman, Batman's problem with killing and other stuff. Well, I have never read any Batman comics, so I had hard time to enjoy this. But I watched two Burton's movies, the unspeakable third one and all Nolan's movies. I liked the atmosphere of the Gotham city in Burton's movies. But the characters are the best in Nolan's.			"

												Arkham Asylum had only one major flaw – the game was so painstakingly, overwhelmingly, wonderfully thorough in its depiction of the Batman universe, we couldn’t imagine what was left to cover or accomplish in a sequel. The developers at Rocksteady got every element of the character right, from his combat to his gadgets to his previously neglected detective skills. They featured half a dozen of Gotham’s greatest villains, then included hidden references to nearly 30 more just as fan service. They created a setting with enough macabre detail to capture the comics’ horror, but with enough epic scope to somehow fit a Batcave, Batmobile and Batwing.This was it. This was the perfect Batman game.Yet from the moment we started Arkham City, all we could think was: Arkham Asylum was practice. Compared to its sequel, the “best superhero game ever” and our choice for Game of the Year 2009 seems like a tech demo, a first draft, merely a blueprint for what the perfect Batman game can actually be. This is it.For an immediate idea of how much bigger and better Arkham City is than its already incredible predecessor, take a look at this list of the Batman villains mentioned in Arkham Asylum, but never seen. Half of those now play major roles in the sequel, in addition to return appearances by all except one of the rogue’s gallery introduced in the original. Throw in new heroes like Robin, Alfred, Vicki Vale and Talia al Ghul, as well as a bunch of surprise cameos we wouldn’t dare spoil here, and you have a cast numbering in the “holy cow, did Joel Schumacher direct this?!” range. That fear is unnecessary, however, because the game’s writers and developers have succeeded in fully developing and fully justifying every character’s place in a narrative that makes complete logical and dramatic sense. It’s really rather miraculous.Seriously, this story is special, combining the humanity of the best Animated Series episodes, the brutal darkness of a Frank Miller comic and the confident risk-taking of a Christopher Nolan film. There are no moments as subversive as the fourth-wall break in Arkham Asylum, but there are countless moments of awe, shock and squealing fanboy glee – hell, you’ll be overpowered by all of those emotions within the first 15 minutes of the game alone. By the last 15 minutes, you may honestly choke back some tears, and not for a reason you’d ever predict or ever expect a superhero game to deliver.Of course, the most obvious upgrade in Arkham City is, well, Arkham City. At the time the original game released, a small island asylum seemed like the only possible setting for a properly done Batman experience – attempt to render the sprawling streets and skyscrapers of Gotham itself and you’d sacrifice BioShock-level detail for GTA-style size, and might as well be developing a Superman or Spider-Man game. The sequel, though, proves that assumption wrong. The asylum remains on an island of sorts – a bordered, quarantined section of Gotham City – but is at least four to five times as large as before, and if anything, more detailed.Stand still at any point and the magnitude of both Arkham City’s epic scale and atmospheric intricacy will floor you. Endless rooftops stretching into the horizon, each with a different neon sign (Ace Chemicals, where Joker was born) or peeling billboard (“The Terror”, Clayface’s famous movie role) or deadly booby trap (left by the Riddler, no doubt). An apartment building that can be instantly recognized, not only because Selina Kyle’s cats are outside one of the windows, but because every building in the environment is unique. A gigantic carnival Ferris wheel that, when scanned with Detective mode, reveals a hidden body in each compartment. Snow falling as helicopter spotlights crisscross through the night sky and fire burns in the distant background, leftover from a battle that – at some point in the game – you fought.Who are we kidding? You won’t stand still. While Rocksteady hasn’t given players the keys to the Batmobile yet, gliding and leaping and diving and climbing and rappelling across this expansive playground with the use of Batman’s cape and tools offers just as much exhilarating freedom as tearing across Liberty City on a motorcycle. An example Achievement / Trophy: “Jump off the tallest building and glide for one minute without touching the ground.” Yesssss.			"

												This is a great port to mac just one problem though a line sometimes like goes from the bottom to the top like a wave its hard to notice and doesnt affect the game though. Other then that this is an awesome game the story is great and the atmosphere (unlike origins) is dark and gritty how its supposed to be it the city just has a sinister feel overall it is an amazing game!

												Awesome Awesome Awesome....taking everything that was magnificent about the first game and transferring it to a larger free roaming world, while losing none of the magic of becoming a Superhero and beating up a gang of Jokers goons.Absoultely worth whatever price you pay, but make sure you have played through Arkham Asylum first, this truly is a sequel, not just same again.

												I played Batman: Arkham Barkham Asylum before I played this, and at first I found the new Open World to be a bit overwhelming. But it didn't take long for the game to grow on me, and staying up late several days completing the main story, all the sidequest, collecting all the riddler trophies (accept for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥te one that required me to do a 50 m vertical drop, I can't seem to do that one for some reason) and completing the bonus story, which I think was a nice thing to add, Robin is surprisingly fun to play. I probably won't complete the extra challenges or riddlers math revenge whatever, but I will be checking back to talk to that fat guy in the basement. All and all, The legend of Batman: Return of the Jokie is an exellent game, well worth the pocket change I payed for it.			"

												I love this installment of Batman, very good story and intresting world to explorer. Really nice side missions along with the main story. It took me more then 25 hours gameplay to complete this game.. Arkham City is stuffed to the edge of with content and replay value (in addition to the gigantic campaign there's an expanded Challenge Mode and New Game Plus), is incredible amounts of fun, that will allow you more then 25 hours gameplay. Arkham City is by far a  better game in delivering an immaculately presented, rich, compelling play experience and very intresting and emotionfilled story while it is true to the Batman franchise and giving players imense feel of how it is being Batman. Enjoyed every bit of this excellent game. Sometimes the boss fights got on my nerve, but thanks to the hints after dying, I got the hang of how to kill some of the bosses. You would love the gripping fighting system, lots of diversity  as you have loads of choices to make and a great atmosphere since the world is a ""open world"", this is the best superhero according to me. I just loved it!			"

												Rocksteady has done it again!Without question, Batman: Arkham City is one of the most enjoyable video games I've ever played. Between its wealth of stealth and action, well-written story, memorable characters, and extraordinary production values, this game is definitely worth ""clawing"" onto. You can get away with some “button mashing” at the start of the game, but taking down tougher enemies and bosses later on will require some savvy melee or ranged attacks, use of gadgets, acrobatic dodges, and other tactics. Batman: Arkham City isn't just better than Batman: Arkham Asylum, it's better than most games on the market.			"

												The first thing I noticed about this game was how well the motions are animated. If you block a kick you actually catch the kick in your hands. if you counter a punch you actually catch the punch and pull them off balance - or maybe twist their wrist. As an animator I highly approve!The overall game switches between hunting, stealth, and combat pretty regularly. Never really can I say I got bored.Wasn't very challenging though. Enemies have the capacity to learn, but only locationally. Take someeone out from a ceiling and people will watch out for ceilings, but only in that specific area you did it before. Mr Freeze aside anyway - he learns for real and takes out any advantages you used as he comes across them.Awesome game for the 7.50 I paid for it.The late-game challenges are kind of soul crushing. Not the combat challenges. Those are exciting! The predator challenges though almost always include a requirement that will leave the player waiting minutes upon minutes for the NPCs to just blindly crawl into a situation where you can just complete the challenge - like waiting for two thugs to stand side by side and face the same direction so you can sneak up behind them to deliver a double knockout. I've wasted 20 minutes on a map before waiting for that exact situation. By no means hard or challenging since all you do is wait which anyone can do, but boring as get out. There's no real need to do the challenges though unless you want achievements or just the sense of completion.Overall I would have to give this game a high grade. The story was awesome, most of the challenges are fun, and finding riddler trophies feels strangely addictive.			"

												Far superior to great Arkham Asylum, now you have finally big part of Gotham where you can just glide, free roam, solve detective cases, kick♥♥♥♥♥and so much more. More gangets, more villains, more story, more fights, everything is pumped and better. This is one of those games that should not be missed by comic book fans, or just video game fans in general. Who would not want to be Batman?			"

												This week I got all the arkham games and played them all and this was probably my favorite by FAR I loved how in this game you have two main goals to stop Protocol 10 and get the cure. Also if you have the money to GET THE DLC will make the game a lot better than it already is.			"

												One of the best open world games I have ever played, the best of the Batman Arkham series is this one! Grab it seriously awesome fighting moves tons of riddles to find & solve tons of stuffs to do and with the GOTY edition you get all the DLCs of the game as well! you can play as the Cat, Robin & the Bat as well w/ various outfits.I recommend buying this game during sale because the price goes really cheap compared to the amount of fun it delivers to you! 10/10 for the game. 100% satisfying.If you have played the game then...  Get out of there you chicken!  "

												Nice combat, good moves, good gadgets, a nice degree of freedom to be a city guardian in an open world  style game. This game has a deep, juicy dark story that enchants you since the first second you enter into Arkham City and play as Bruce Wayne.The GoodEverything mentioned earlier and CatwomanThe BadThe amount of Riddler Challenges in this game, compared with Arkham Asylum, this one game was a big pain in the **sThe ResultEverything in this game (unless you want a 100% complete file) is pretty good: graphics, combat, story, challenges, dlc's challenges, etc. With so many elements it gives a lot of replay value, is pretty hard to not touch this game after completing the main story. With just 5$ with the 75% discount sale, this game is worth at least 9/10. Have a good time!			"

												I think i should get this out there. I haven't played the other games in this series with this game being my first so my opinion will completely be based on my experiences with this game by itself. If your hoping for a comparison between this game and the other you should look at the other reviews. If you don't want to hear the full review but just my thoughts just scroll to the bottom. Ok now let get started with the review ^-^.  The Long Review StealthAs a fan of stealth games, this game does have some elements of stealth to it, with specific segments dedicated to it. These segment provide a decent amount of stealth where you are required to work yourself around a room to take down a number of enemies which are all armed making them difficult to handle head on. Other elements are added on later in the game to make this more difficult so there is some need to vary your strategy. During these moments, you can truly feel like the dark knight as you make your way around the room taking them out one by one and making your enemies feel truly helpless or growingly paranoid.CombatThe more frequent encounters are where you're required to battle a group of enemies head on with the enemies mostly being unarmed near the beginning of the game. These battles are made interesting with the way the combat system works. The combat system is basically a combo meter that requires you to not make a mistake in a combo such as getting hit, countering early or missing a punch. All you have to do is keeping pressing the punch button (Right click for me) while pointing in the direction of your target (wasd for me). Later in the game you will be given the choice to buy a somewhat finisher that can be used at a high combo (12 hits generally). Also, the variety of weapons you will have to deal with will require you to strategies a bit making the experience a bit different each time.GadgetsNow, time for the gadgets. There is a large and healthy variety of gadgets that can be used in this game. From the classic batarang to weapons that batman made on the spot which is somewhat ridiculous but effective. These gadgets can be used to solve puzzles or the riddlers puzzles (which I'll talk about later). The gadgets are not just useful for puzzles. They can also be used in combat, helping to deal with various situations such as when your surrounded or if an enemy has a gun pointed at you. StoryFinally, the story. Without spoiling much, the story revolves mainly around the joker and another villain by the name of Strange. There are many other villains in the game such as Poison ivy, Catwomen, The Penguin and many others. You could play the entire game focused on the main story but after that there are still many other things to do so there is replayability if that's what your looking for. Besides the other Villains that can be interacted with in the game, there are also the collectables placed by The Riddler throughout the map which has it's ups and downs such as if you're trying to 100% the game.Final thoughts In my opinion, i feel that this is a great game and is something that you should definitely try playing if you're a fan of batman or you want to play a fun brawler with interesting stealth.Ques: Could you play the with little to no knowledge about Batman?Ans: You definitely can play it as the game does give you a little insight to the characters you're about to get involved with via the in game encyclopediaI'll admit the controls can feel a little clunky just due to the fact that some of the keys for some actions overlap each other eg. Running and taking cover are the same key there's a chance of doing one or the other when near a corner.There are other examples of clunky control but overall i think Batman Arkham City is a great open world game.I definitely recommend it <3 "

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*One of the richest games of 2012 in my opinion and it looks great. Combat is very rewarding and fluid. The only drawback is the use of the quickfire action. You can quickfire each gadget by double tapping its respective key. The trouble comes when you need to double tap keys like 5, 6, 7 or 8 mid combat. It's just not convenient and might cause some frustration. Wonder how the quickfire works on a controller...Anyway, it's a solid game all the way through. It has felt better to control one of the coolest superheroes out there. Not to mention you get to run around as Catwoman too. She feels a little weak compared to Batman and you don't get to use her as much as I'd like. She deserves a game like this of her own considering how good of a job they did with her.			"

Even though Arkham city is great on its own, I do strongly hope that Arkham Knight will showcase new gameplay mechanics and new characters to play as (from time to time)			"

												HelloAfter playing this game for around a total of 20-25 hours and completing the story in under that due to have already playing it on console years ago I need to make a review. It is worth the money if you have never played it before but only buy it if your gonna free roam and do side quests thats fine. My tips on buying this game are very strict and are as followed:1) DONT NOT Buy the game for the story line if you have already played it before2) If you are buying it for the story or even just buying it to free roam and side quests all ways get GOTY Edition due to having more content up to and over 100 hours3)Batman will get mad if you dont buy it4)Joker will find you5) the last to instructions were jokes but if you want to buy it buy it and have fun :)			"

												The main problem with Batman: Arkham City is that it improves so much on it's already excellent predecessor, Arkham Asylum, that it renders AA almost completely irrelevant (fortunately for AA it's so darn good that it can still hold it's ground, even against this beast).A great vision and insight into the Batman universe and a solid rounded story that manages to be affecting, poignant and intelligent while still keeping a familiar comic-book feel. The gameplay and graphics, again, are silky-smooth and almost flawless. There's plenty in this game to keep it fresh for two, maybe even three full playthroughs. Delivered with love, care and attention to detail, Arkham City is a solid and stand-up masterclass in how to make a AAA blockbuster game.			"

												I picked this game up for only $20, and just wow!  Graphics are great. Playing on a GTX 1060 6gb with all the eye candy!  The storyline is great to watch.  I liked all the cut scenes and voice acting. The enemy AI is fantastic as they learn what you're doing and force you to change it up.  Just when I thought I had beaten the game..nope lol  Still working on finishing it up I'm at 85% now.  2 boss fights had me thinking how am I going to beat this, I did not use google at all.  Also just figuring out where to go next was fun and with all the great lighting and effects I am hooked.  I highly recommend this game especially for its current price of just $20.  You can't beat that.  So do yourself a favor and buy this game.			"

												You've probably heard this before but it's worth saying again: this game blows other action adventure third person games out of the water. Let alone actually allowing you to feel like you were the Batman, it features a rollercoaster story on par with best Batman cartoon stories, an amazing look no matter what kind of machine you're using, tons of different gadgets to try out, good learning curve in terms of AI and a completely different experience when using another character like Catwoman. I had fun with Assassin's Creed games for example but this one offers the level of fun of exploration and combat Ubisoft can only dream about making.			"

												I loved Batman Arkham Asylum so had big hopes for Arkham City, and I can say I was impressed. Its kept all the elements from Arkham Asylum that I liked and thrown in some improvements as well as a bit of DLC. The look of the game is even more impressive than AA, and the combat is just stunning to look at. The voice acting and soundtrack are just as great too. The plot is decent enough with some good ""interludes"" and there's plenty of side-quests. So its a definite thumbs up. On the negative side, I don't quite know why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I should. Perhaps because I've seen it before with AA?  Perhaps that a lot of game is within the challenge maps which just didn't grab me? Perhaps that when I'd finished the main plot I'd still only done about 2/3rds of the side quests, and had the opportunity to carry on playing despite the fact the game was ""over"". I can't put my finger on it but I didn't enjoy it as much as AA. Its still an awesome game though, so I have to award it a very respectable 8/10			"

												I've played this game 4 times on different consoles and have loved it every time. There's a great fighting system, probably the best out there, in which it feels great to punch criminals faces and sneak around with grace. Also it has sooooooooo much depth and every single area, even little side streets offers tales of crime, history or treasure. It has great side quests and is just great for any fan of adventure games or open world ones. One bad point is the port, which is pretty bad.All together this is a great game for anyone wanting to fight solo			"

There is trully nothing I could say is wrong, maybe sometimes a bit to repetetive. I think there's something wrong with me why I'm not so much into it.

												I really enjoyed this game.It is a great sequel to arkham asylum. The story is very good continuing on from arkham asylum. The characters are well represented with fantastic character models and the voice actors doing another amazing job. I only played the story and side missions and got a lot of mileage from the game without feeling bored or like the game contained a lot of useless padding content to lengthen play time. There is also a ton of challenge maps if you are interested in them and a new game plus mode that gives an even harder difficulty setting so the game is great value for money.I enjoyed being able to play different characters this time out although I have to say catwoman really isn’t for me. The lack of gadgets and abilities limits how you can tackle the cons, armed guards on hard wreck catwoman if spotted so it can be frustrating.I had a few crashes throughout my playthrough, 10 in all I think. None of them were at the same spot or seemed to be for any specific reason but it didn’t put me off playing the game. I also came across what I thought at the time was going to be a game breaking bug. Playing as catwoman when i jumped from a building to the ground she kept getting stuck in this pose in mid-air just above the ground being unable to move. I restarted the game multiple times to no avail then I put my issue on the discussions and was told to check the integrity of my files on steam. I did and it never happened after so I guess it worked.All in all, I think this game is awesome. really enjoyed it and would recommend it for sure.

												This game is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. I walked into this unsure if i would like it. I knew i would like the story, but i was unsure about the actual gameplay. However, the gameplay is pretty much flawless. The third person beat-em-up gameplay makes it extremely satisfiying to burst in on a group of 15 or so enemies, using smoke grenades, batarangs, and tons of other gear to make a boneriffic entrance before beating the crap out all enemies using the one weapon that all humans are born equipped with. And with all the gear that is found, combat can be taken from many different apporoaches.9.5/10 cuz i reserve that 10/10 for The Last Of Us, my personal holy grail of gamingjust get it, it'll run on anything (Ive got a crappy mac laptop and it runs like a boy band from horny 12 year olds)			"

												Batman was always my favorite superhero, so naturally I fell in love with the Arkham games. After playing Arkham Asylum, I was excited to see that Arkham City was going to be a thing and I was going to be able to actually free roam the city. This game is now almost six years old, and I still get a kick out of playing it. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Batman. Out of all the Arkham games, I think Arkham City was my favorite. It has a solid story, fun gameplay, and there's a lot to do. I find myself coming back to this game often.			"

												As with Arkham Asylum, I got this through a Humble Bundle deal without realizing what I was getting.  As of right now, this is my third favorite Batman game.  My favorite being Arkham Asylum and my second favorite being Arkham Origins.  This takes the gameplay of Arkham Asylum and moves from a Metroidvania-type game to open world, and it works very well.  The story is interesting, although the boss fights are fairly bland.Apparently this game had performance problems at launch, but I didn't get it at launch so I didn't experience any of that.  It runs fine on max settings on my hardware, though not as smooth as Asylum or Origins.  Overall I give this a 9/10.  It's a great game, just not QUITE as great as Arkham Asylum or Arkham Origins.

												Expanding upon the fantastic Arkham Asylum, Arkham City provides a bigger open world within which to be the Batman. Set after the events of Arkham Asylum, with Arkham now having spread to a closed off part of Gotham City. The game opens with Bruce Wayne petitioning for the closure of 'Arkham City' before swiftly becoming an inmate himself at the behest of Dr. Hugo Strange. Within the city walls Bruce meets one of the three 'gang leaders' vying for control, Penguin. Making a swift escape Bruce ventures to the top of Ace Chemicals and opts to 'Suit up' and become 'the Batman'. All your favourite villains are in this, including; Deadshot, Hush, Calendar Man, Mad Hatter, Zsasz, Riddler, Penguin, Two Face and of course, the Joker. The plot of the game involves a three way struggle for control of Arkham, between Penguin, Two Face and Joker. Each gang leader has thugs costumed appropriately to their style, particularly the half-n-half costumes of Two Faces thugs. The larger world gives greater opportunity to explore Arkham City and fly around as the Batman, scouting thugs from the roof tops before Glide Kicking them into next week. The combat system is largely unchanged from Arkham Asylum, where timing your attacks takes precedence over button mashing and you're given a wealth of gadgets to deploy against your enemy. The combat feels very fluid, even if it is sometimes ridiculous as Batman punches one thug before leaping across a room to kick the next. Similar to Asylum the game also features 'predator' areas where Batman must systematically eliminate a group of thugs from the shadows. These sections provide a nice change of pace from combat, where you have to plan out your attack before removing thugs one-by-one. The challenge maps are a mix of combat challenges and preadtor challenges where you are given specific instruction for taking down your opponent, being awarded three medals if your complete all objectives for the map. Combat challenges are a simple, beat the score but the predator challenges force you to utilise the breadth of gadgets available, making you be a bit more creative with your takedowns and dramatically adding to their challenge. The challenges are also grouped in campaigns where you need to complete three maps in a row (with 3 retries) meeting the medal goals for all 3 to get the maximum 9 medals. The campaigns have modifiers that must be used on one of the three maps that can give the enemies guns, booby-trap gargoyles or even reduce your health. Side activities include collecting Riddler trophies of which there are a huge amount (Maybe too many) by using your gadgets to complete tasks (Like moving a globe through a maze or just sliding under a fence). Some of these trophies are very easy to attain, some require a bit more thinking. There are other side activities that will pit Batman against other foes including Deadshot, Mad Hatter and others, The DLC packs included with the Game of the Year edition include three extra characters (Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing), a mini-story for Catwoman (Which plays out in interludes during the main story) and 5 extra challenge maps. Also included are alternate costumes for Batman and the three DLC characters. Overall, Arkham Asylum provides plenty to do (It took me around 85 hours to do absolutely everything) and maintains the fluid combat, and shadowy predator sections. The story itself is fantastic and a really enjoyable ride! Thoroughly recommend this to anyone who was a fan of Arkham Asylum or just Batman in gerneral.			"

												HELL to the power of yes times infinity! This game is so much fun to play and explore Arkham City. Theres an infinite amount of stuff to do with the side missions which are often just as good as the main storyline! All the characters which are 90% vocalized by the same voice actors that did them in the animated series are very cool and unique characters, hell, I even liked playing as Robin and Catwoman because they are so cool in this game. If you dont have it you need to get it on the next sale!			"

												I strongly recommend to play series of Batman's games by Rocksteady Studios.Batman is my favourite hero from DC comics and I'm writing this review because I like the storyline presented by Rocksteady Studios. This is a Batman I always imagine. His will power is astonishining and not a costume makes him a hero as we can hear it on the streets from bandits. Dark Knight is always remains a hero. In ""Batman: Arkham City"" you will mainly see Hugo Strange, amazing pair of criminals Harley Quinn and Joker and what problems they cause for Batman, ""Riddle me this"" will make your game time more entertaining, also you will have a chance to play charming Catwoman to help Batman saving Gotham city.Anyway, try it out by yourself!

												If you've ever played an action-adventure game and loved it, this one will trump it. Batman: Arkham Asylum and City are easily in the very top of my favourite games, not just because I like the Batman character (I'm really not that into comics, after all), but because the gameplay is accessible and very responsive. The freeflow combat-system is probably one of the most fun features I've ever seen in a game of this genre and keeps me playing much longer than I usually intend to.The story of the game is also very enjoyable, and even though it is a completely lineair experience, aside from the occassional side-quest, the city that you navigate in gives off a definite open-world experience. And flying around as Batman is just awesome in every way.			"

												I have played through Batman: Arkham City twice. Arkham City throws you right into the action and a twisted storyline! I love how they include almost every Batman villain, and I also enjoy the Catwoman parts! She's hot, I mean, well, the game is great! If you have played Arkham Asylum, then I strongly recommend you buy this game immediately! You will not be disappointed. Even after the main story and side missions, there's an awesome DLC called ""Harley Quinn's Revenge"" which is also pretty well done.I have to say, out of the Batman: Arkham series, this game is by far the greatest of them all. Second greatest being Arkham Asylum. This game really captivates you to actually BE the Batman and kick some criminal♥♥♥♥♥ From all the gadgets, cutscenes, plot twists, and everything, I truly love exploring Arkham City! Definitely a game everyone should play.			"

												This game is fantastic! I got the game from a friend and was really curious about the series. When i saw gameplay videos of the game, my biggest concern was the combat system: It seemed like it was optimized for controller play. I looked like it would be pretty hard and gamebreaking to play with mouse and keyboard (yes, i don't own an xbox controller). But damn i was wrong! When i played the intro battle, with catwoman, i was very pleased and surprised to find out how perfect i worked with mouse and controller.The history takes you Arkham City, an encapsulated part of Gotham, which works as one huge prison. This is an open world game, and you can glide with your cape and swing your batarang all across Arkham City. The city is not huge, but it's big enough to not getting tired of the place. Throughout the mission you'll meet a lot off Gothams' classic super villains. Of course they all have their own charme, but no one beats the Joker, who plays a major role in the game.The game's graphics looks great and makes Arkham City come to life (even better at 40-60FPS :P). However it's not Battlefield graphics, but still very beautiful and athmospheric. It is rarely i experience so fluent gameplay in a game, there is usually always some small bugs that annoys. But that is not the case with this game: Haven't experienced a single bug, glitch or anything. The game simply feels perfect.Is this a game i would recommend? YES! The game was an absolute joy to play through, and i feel like i will return to it many times in the future.As a gamer, this game stole my heart.			"

												Arkham City is everything that Arkham Asylum was but improved in almost every way. largely fixing the control problems of Arkham Asylum on PC, Arkham City takes you and throws you into a large environment that allows you to explore and fight in many different interesting and entertaining ways. Arkham City makes the improvement of creating a more open world and adding well-integrated side missions that have some meaning to the main story and makes the game feel less linear. Again the voice acting is top-notch and the pacing and progression of the story is a high-point of this title.			"

												I really enjoyed this one. I loved how closer to an open world game it is than the previous one. I also liked this one's gameplay and story more than the Asylum's. There is so much more to do and explore, although that's not a good thing for the challenges: there are 213 challenges to complete with each of the 4 characters (Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing) if you want to 100% it (852 challenges in total), which can be extremely tiring and repetitive, without mentioning that you have to re-do all the side missions in new game plus to 100% it as well.

												If your a Batman fan you MUST get this game, This game is the greatest superhero game in all time and in my opinion even better than Arkham Knight, unlike the first installment of the Arkham series this adds a new bigger open world experience that will make you want to play for hours fighting crime without doing anything productive, the intro to this game will immedately lift you off your toes and give you goosebumps and compared to Arkham Asylum it has massively added new features to the game, such as dive bombs, sliding, side missions, way more riddles, new gadets, new villians, and new playable characters, and more The campaign this game has to offer is a amazing experience that keeps you on your toes the whole time with many unexpected twists and turns and a extremely shocking ending, that changes the next arkham game intensely, even after you beat the campaign which I've done multple times on Xbox and PC the game has lots of replay value that you can play for a year and yet not have everything, and even if you somehow do manage to get everything this game is easy to mod with hundreds of amazing mods and skins, the DLC in this game is 100% worth it with 3 new playable character Robin, Catwomen, and Nightwing, 2 of which have campaigns that are just as great, this game is a must have for Batman fans or anyone in general, I absolutly give this game a 10/10 if you don't trust me then look online to find out that this game has a average rating of 97 out of 100, so make sure to get this game or you'll regret it			"

												I strongly recommend to play series of Batman's games by Rocksteady Studios.Batman is my favourite hero from DC comics and I'm writing this review because I like the storyline presented by Rocksteady Studios. This is a Batman I always imagine. His will power is astonishining and not a costume makes him a hero as we can hear it on the streets from bandits. Dark Knight is always remains a hero. In ""Batman: Arkham City"" you will mainly see Hugo Strange, amazing pair of criminals Harley Quinn and Joker and what problems they cause for Batman, ""Riddle me this"" will make your game time more entertaining, also you will have a chance to play charming Catwoman to help Batman saving Gotham city.Anyway, try it out by yourself!

												HELL to the power of yes times infinity! This game is so much fun to play and explore Arkham City. Theres an infinite amount of stuff to do with the side missions which are often just as good as the main storyline! All the characters which are 90% vocalized by the same voice actors that did them in the animated series are very cool and unique characters, hell, I even liked playing as Robin and Catwoman because they are so cool in this game. If you dont have it you need to get it on the next sale!			"

												Arkham City is everything that Arkham Asylum was but improved in almost every way. largely fixing the control problems of Arkham Asylum on PC, Arkham City takes you and throws you into a large environment that allows you to explore and fight in many different interesting and entertaining ways. Arkham City makes the improvement of creating a more open world and adding well-integrated side missions that have some meaning to the main story and makes the game feel less linear. Again the voice acting is top-notch and the pacing and progression of the story is a high-point of this title.			"

Advanced AR trainings were just effortless attempt by developers to make gamers waste few hours and counting it to a game volume. Sadly for my case, their plan backfired.  All I remember after the game ending was that annoying teeth on the tunnel entrance and unnecessary 90 degree turn training.			"

												Oh boy, not quite such a wonderArkham Asylum was a groundbreaking game for me. I loved the atmosphere, the varied and highly imaginative gameplay, the problem solving, and the superbly animated and free-flowing combat. It was engrossing, compelling, and had a far better storyline than most games. ARKHAM CITY promised more of the same and I looked forward to it immensely. Well it delivered in some respects but disappointed in many. The overarching fault with CITY is that Rocksteady have crammed too much into one game. It’s the game equivalent of bloatware. Combat is less fluent due to too many new moves, some of which you are forced to use. The short, somewhat underwhelming main story is interrupted too often by side missions and the ridiculously numerous riddler challenges and trophies. And the open world structure, coupled with the often intrusive side missions, diminish the sense of urgency in the narrative. There are also too many villains jammed into one story. It may seem odd to criticise something for doing too much but sometimes less really is more. On the plus side you get to play as Catwoman and Robin as well as Batman and some of the enhancements do improve gameplay. In conclusion, CITY is a good game and is fun to play, but it’s not as impressive as Rocksteady’s admirable original. Oh, and good luck trying to get at all 440 Riddler trophies!3.5/5			"

												The first Arkham game I played. To not put this at the top of your list would be a disservice to such a fine fine game. Like any great artwork though it does have some flaws. The most obvious being the map of City itself - though an improvement on Asylum, even when it was new it didn't really FEEL like a city. The claustrophobic map - while good - could have been better or at least larger with more variations in terrain and areas. The story - while good - never really reached a state where you would call it great. Asylum, Origins and even Knight have a moment that can be remembered instantly whenever you talk about it to Arkham fans. City never really seems to have a moment that you want to remember or watch over and over again on YouTube. The thing that makes City special though is that you will only find those flaws if you go LOOKING for them - and even that you have to do HARD. City was a truly special achievement. The launch was perfect. Rocksteady didn't have it's balls so tightly in WB's grip yet and could be counted on to deliver a quality product. The characters were real. Mark Hamil as the Joker. The DLC actually added something to the feel of the game and expanded the story without leaving you hanging. The random enemies on the street would sneak in snipers and shield-holders and other types of enemies that made you think before crashing in fists swinging (something Knight SORELY lacks) meant that every fight was VERY intense whether it was against a goon or against a boss. I could go on and on about this game but - if they ever put games in a preservation vault like they do film - this would be a game I would preserve.			"

This game, being #4 in my top played games currently, is fantastic. The perfect mix of strategy, stealth, and fighting. The story is fantastic, and really brings feels true to Batman origin, the Catwoman missions are fantastic, as she has a completely different playstyle, and switching between the 2 can be fun, and doing all the challenges for them is great. The DLC, adds in an extra mission, where you play as Robin, and you need to save Batman from Harley Quinn. Fantastic game, I always enjoy going back.			"

												Better than Arkham Asylum because of the openness of the game. Graphics slightly more demanding; my five-year-old laptop experienced a slowdown every time I entered detective mode, which was a lot. Sometimes it's unclear where you're supposed to go, especially entrances to large buildings can be frustrating. I was disappointed at how little the other playable characters are in the game, and that they're significantly less powerful. Last, the city was so ""riddled"" with green question marks that it detracted from the beauty of the cityscape.Other than those complaints, it's basically a perfect fighting game, very satisfying, not too challenging (I imagine New Game Plus is a lot harder). The expansion Harvey's Revenge is also excellent. I like puzzles so I found 250/400 of the Riddler Trophies. Highly recommended.			"

A Slice of GothamTake Batman Arkham Asylum's linear sandbox, tear down its four walls, and what do you have? A beautiful sandy beach, loitered with easter egg goodies and villainous surprises! Batman Arkham City does everything Asylum contained so well: a paced and fleshed out Batman mythos. There are so many villains, you'll be glad to fight them and make their fanboyish acquaintance. A number of Combat and Predator challenges as well as side missions (one reminiscient of a Nintendo 64 Superman title!) from the main game keep City fresh long after its completion. If you want to know how resilient Batman is, again, and what it's like to glide like a bat, continue his journey of justice in Batman Arkham City!			"

												This game is masterpiece. Very immersive and atmospheric missions, smooth gameplay. It has a lot of stealth and requires thinking how to take out enemies one by one. Full walkthrough of the main story took about 14 hours, and that includes time for retries from the last checkpoint since the combat sometimes is hard. Combat system requires a lot of mouse clicking skills, but you'll get used to it. I think it should be easier with gamepad though.After finishing main story you can switch character at will (Batman, Catwoman, Robin, Nightwing), free roam, do side missions, collect Riddler's trophies, etc. This adds a lot of replay value. And I'm not even a fan of DC universe.I'd rate this game 8.5/10.			"

												Arkham City takes what worked the best from Arkham Asylum and expands on it in every way. A larger area, better combat (how is that possible the combat was so good in Asylum), an engaging story with enough twists and turns to make any comic book fan gleeful. If you like batman at all you should own this.			"

												Note: I'm going to split this review into two parts, the first covering the base game and the second covering all the DLC.After the success of Batman Arkham Asylum, Batman Arkham City improves almost everything to make this game one of the best of all time. For me, the only thing that's a downside it's the story. While Arkham Asylum was more focused with some villains, Arkham City tries to put plenty of new villains into the main story, creating a mixed bag in the end. Penguin, Mister Freeze, Ra's al Ghul and Hugo Strange are some of the new cast, along with the returning Joker. But it got one thing right: other villains appear briefly in side quests, like the Mad Hatter, Hush and Deadshot. Those feel more well-placed. This time around, you explore Arkham City, which is old Gotham turned into a mega prison. It has the right size and ambience, and feels like a good way to navigate the story or just to kick some random inmates♥♥♥♥♥ This time there's more gadgets, and the combat and predator sections are improved. The combat now feels more fluid, with more combos and enemy types. The predator (stealth) sections are now easier and more enjoyable. And the riddler trophies return, much more improved. This time, many of them require you to solve a puzzle using your gadgets instead of just laying somewhere and waiting to be found; and this time collecting them will get you closer and closer to Edward Nigma himself, saving hostages in the process. This time the bosses are way more interesting, especially the atmosphere in Ra's al Ghul battle and the strategy needed to defeat Mister Freeze, one of the best boss battles ever made. So, this game is more disperse (in a bad way) than Arkham Asylum, but the core mechanics are much improved. After beating the game, you can replay it in New Game+, which is harder but you start with you gadgets. And the challenge mode returns, with more combat and predator maps. The combat maps are easier and more enjoyable, while the predator feels the same as in Arkham Asylum, being harder and requiring patience. One thing that i didn't like was the ""campaings"", which is basically 3 challenge maps that you'll need to beat in one session, with a max of 3 retries. It feels very cheap for me, because it's recicled content with cheap difficulty, especially in the hardest predator maps. There's also character models and artwork to collect with the riddler trophies. And the soundtrack is really amazing in this game. This is definitely a must buy for any comic book fan, or even anyone that likes action games.The DLC has 3 parts:The catwoman story, in which you'll sometimes play as catwoman in the main story, with her own moves and feel. It's a nice addition and doesn't fell rushed, except for the very last sequence.The Harley Quinn's Revenge is a short epilogue where you'll also play as Robin, but this one has a weak story and it's basically just recicled content.And you can also play as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing in all of the challenge maps, which is cool because you can play as those characters, but that also means completing all of the campaings again. The additions are cool, but they are implemented in yet another cheap way to increase replayability.Overall, the DLC feels a bit rushed and cheap, adding little to the main game.But don't let this prevent you from playing the main game, which is really awesome in almost every way.

												The second installment in the series, I really enjoyed the more open feel to the game. It is far easier to get lost in the Arkham City prison life. The larger scene and map as well as the continuation of the story from Arkham Asylum made me really enjoy this title. The disappointment comes when you reach a few fights and wonder what the hell they are doing in the game. Feels like some bad guys were shoe horned in. Overall still a good game.			"

												Ah yes. Batman. I say that he is the most awesome superhero in the DC Universe, heck, he even gives the best of Marvel a run for their money, and he is one of my favorites. There are numerous reasons for this, but the reason I bring up today is that he actually has cool and fun video games. All of the Rocksteady Batman Arkham games; Asylum, City, and Knight, were enjoyed by critics and gamers, excluding that last one on PC as of the time of writing, but they are planning on releasing patches soon to fix that. I've played City before on the Xbox 360 and enjoyed it a lot, so I figured to take another look at it on PC. So what did I think? Well let's take a look at it.STORY: You play as Bruce Wayne, AKA Batman. While on a campaign to shut down Arkham City, a newly opened mass prison that houses the greatest threats to Gotham City, Bruce Wayne is arrested by the guards of the jail and brought to the head of the prison, Hugo Strange, who brings up that he is planning to unleash a mysterious plan only known as Protocal 10 upon Arkham City, and that he knows that Bruce Wayne is actually Batman. After getting free from the holding area, Bruce makes it to the dropoff point of the Batsuit, gears up, and prepares to go after Strange and the mysterious Protocal 10. Along the way you encounter numerous of Batman's enemies, including The Penguin, Two Face, and The Joker, the latter poisoning Batman with the same poison he was infected with and forces him to look for a cure to save both of them. The story is pretty good, I enjoyed a lot of moments in this story, the ending was strangely sad, there are a lot of fun side missions, and you get to play as Catwoman in a side story as she goes after the Arkham City vault, which is also interesting and fun. The story will keep you occupied for around 14-16 hours with extra time if you go after collectables or do the extra challenges included, as well as an extra story DLC which I'll talk about after my rating since it contains spoilers.GAMEPLAY: Combat is fun, it feels satisfying, the only bad thing I can say of it is that I can see it getting a bit repetative. The gadgets are unique enough and let you do some fun stuff in and out of combat. The open world of Arkham City is fun to explore and there are some neat little easter eggs to look for if you're in the mood to find them. Overall, it's pretty fun to play as Batman, as well as Catwoman, who, while having less gadgets and less damage resistant as the Bats, is a lot more agile and is a lot of fun to play as as well. Just make sure to play this with a gamepad, it feels a lot better than a keyboard and mouse.GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: The game looks really nice. I ran it on High Settings well enough at a playable enough framerate, though since my rig is kinda crappy it stutters a bit, though not as much as I thought it would. However, if you have a good PC, or at least anything better than mine, you will have no problem with it at all. The game looks good.CHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Batman is voiced by the same actor who played him in the animated series back in 1997, Kevin Conroy, and he does a decent enough job in the role. Another notible reprisal from the animated series was Mark Hamill as The Joker, who was probably my favorite actor out of all of them, since Hamill did such a good job with him, being a crazy nutjob who's strangely enjoyable even though he's poisoned Batman. Other notable voice actors I have to point out were Corey Burton as Hugo Strange, Nolan North as The Penguin (who I didn't even realize was the voice actor of him until the credits, which is really impressive), Tara Strong as Harley Quinn, Grey DeLisle as Catwoman, and Troy Baker as Robin. All of the characters I mentioned and any notable ones I left out well acted and their character models are nice.EXTRAS: There is a Riddler Challenge Mode, which you unlock maps and miniature campaigns when you collect Riddler Trophies. You get the option to play as Batman, Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing in these challenges, each having special objectives for you to go for. This can bloat your playing time out quite a bit if you want to go for 100% for all of the characters. I personally didn't care for this mode, but it can be amusing for some. The Riddler Trophies I mentioned earlier can also increase your gametime, and in order to get some of them you'll have to use gadgets and upgrades you'd get later on in the game, which is also neat. There are Riddles as well, which unlock stories of Arkham City and the characters in the game, and these are the most interesting collectibles for me.FINAL VERDICT: Batman Arkham City was an awesome game with a lot of awesome moments. If you want to feel like Batman, this is a good place to look at it. 9.5/10, just shy of perfection. The game is absolutely worth getting, it usually goes on sale for $5 on a big sale, which is totally worth it. Heck, it's worth the $20 it costs now.The following spoilers contains my review for the DLC included with the GOTY edition, Harley Quinn's Revenge, and, though I do not spoil the plot of what I look at, I will have to do it for the main game here, though none for the story DLC. These aren't minor spoilers either, this is the ending of the game here. If you finished the main game or if you don't care, go ahead and read on. If not, then just know it's a good DLC and you should play it since it's included with the GOTY editionSTORY: Batman is sent in to the Steel Mill, the former home of Joker's gang and the final area of Arkham City that the GCPD has not taken back due to resistance from the goons and the hostage taking of multiple police officers. When Batman goes in to rescue them, he is kidnapped by Harley Quinn, who blames Batman for the death of The Joker. The Batcave sends Robin in to rescue Batman from Harley and save the hostages. It isn't as grand as the main story, but it's fine enough and it has some neat moments and is some of the better story DLC I've seen. It'll give you another hour, maybe two, of gameplayGAMEPLAY: Batman is the same, nothing really notable to say about him. Robin, however, is not a Batman clone like I figured. He has some unique gadgets that you don't have as Batman that are pretty neat, he feels a lot like Batman with a bit more agility like Catwoman, and overall he's fun to play as.CHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Harley Quinn gets a bit of a redesign, dressed up like a mourning widow, which is actually kind of sad. All notable voice actors return to this and do great jobs, Batman, Harley, and Robin's actors notably.FINAL VERDICT: It's a really good story DLC, it has some neat moments, and it does a good job overall. I'd say buy it, but it's included in the game anyways. Make sure to play it once you finish the story.  Had you ever considered that all this is your fault? Your presence creates these animals...  "

												One of the best games out there, definitley the best superhero game. Great storyline with some amazing boss fights, and you get all the DLC for just $20! The game without the game of the year edition is worth buying, then you have all of it. Harley Quinn's revenge was super fun, and you get to play as multiple characters (Batman Catwoman Robin Nightwing) in Riddlers Revenge. Only thing that I didn't like is how you can't free roam as Robin or Nightwing. Nightwing isn't even in the story at all, but I think he should have. Overall, 9/10			"

												Anyone stuck between buying this and the Return to Arkham remasters, I recommend you grab this version instead. The PC release remains the definitive version as the Return to Arkham remasters are absolute crap. I bought it for PlayStation 4 and it rarely exceeds 30fps, 1/3 of the time dropping into the low 20's. It's awful. While some lighting and textures look a bit better, the buttery smooth framerates you get on PC still outweigh the small graphical improvements the remasters bring. The framerate is unlocked on the console remasters so they do occasionally achieve 60fps in interiors but, again, the majority of the time it's 30fps or below. So stick with the PC version - it's the best. It also goes on sale like four times a year where you can usually pick it up for five bucks instead of paying fifty dollars an inferior console remaster.UPDATE:So they just patched Return to Arkham to 1.02 which puts a 30fps lock on Arkham City where it ran unlocked before. It's sad because, before this new patch, the PS4 Pro could run Arkham City around 45fps average, hitting 60fps in some interiors. So now you're stuck with 30fps forever. So, again, the PC version is still the best way to experience this game and the rest of this great series. I'd also like to recommend you give Arkham Origins a chance if you avoided it because of the reviews. I really think it's under rated. It's the first time The Joker and Batman meet in the series and they wrote it really well.			"

Recommending it because the ending and the Harley Quinn DLC were pertty good!Pro'sVisually the game really puts a nice dark tone, fitting for batman. It's really in a nice spot.The story's nice. It was entertaining enough to keep wanting to progress, which other games in this genre tend to have more problems with!Combat system was quite nice. I like to compare it to Assassin's creed and Shadow of Mordor, but I think those played out more nicely. But that's really nitpicking in details. More on that in the cons.The Harley Quinn DLC totally makes up a lot. It's got a completely new character to play (Robin) which plays awesomely, and it's actually relevant to the story (unlike the mandatory Catwoman side-missons that didn't really matter at all but you had to do anyway). It's also got a timed bomb defuse part which was actually tense and fun. This DLC really added a great deal to my view on this game entirely.Much attention to detail of the DC universe & fanserviceConsIt's not always clear what you need to do. For example, I ended up wandering around Dr. Freeze's laboratory for ages, clueless on what to do, when it simply turned out I had to leave the building.New skills are introduced often and in rapid succession, but really most of that is optional. I basically performed the same combo as in the first five minutes of the game. Counter and mash the attack button, easy wins.The combat animations (especially finishers) don't give you an invulnerability window, meaning that you can get hit if you want to finish somebody off. That only further fuels my previous arguement about counter & mash attack. You might say such a window would make it easier, but I don't think a mechanical point like that should be the the factor that makes this game harder. That leads me to my next point...Often times a boss battle or harder encounter, the game simply throws more bodies towards you to fight. I'd rather see 4-5 tough enemies than 30 essentially the same enemies. I realise that must be tough to make though.Lack of worthwhile puzzle elements. The only real puzzles in the game are riddler trophies, which by itself only unlock worthless challenge missions that aren't fun at all. I would have liked more puzzles in the actual storyline.There are like, a billion side missions in this game. I could literally not move from A to B without being thrown a whole lot of sidequests towards me all the time. After I finished the main storyline (and a little of the side-quests), the game says I only completed about 22% of the game. Whoah. Now if only those side-quests were interesting! Because the ones that I've tried really weren't. I'd much rather have liked a bigger, even more fleshed out storyline, making the storyline:sidequests ratio 80:20 instead of the other way around like it is now. The ""stealth"" system, if you can even call it that, was one of the worst ones I've played to date. Maybe I just didn't understand it (there is no explanation), but most moves, especially from hiding make a lot of sound which triggers everyone in the current room to run towards the victim. There is really only one move ""silent takedown"" that is a stealthy solution. Why give us so many gadgets and so many awesome moves, but leave stealth hanging with one move? Enemies would constantly notice me in impossible situations, but if I crash-landed right behind them, they wouldn't notice whatsoever. Oh and if you get caught? Just spam RB on your controller to grapple away, because obviously an enemy can't move his head and follow where you're going. Totally weird evasion tactic and the game even advises you to use it. Stealthy kills give you less XP than regular combat, and there are barely any riddler challenges for it. The detective system is essentially a wallhack which you turn on for 90% of the game if you're going for a stealth approach. That is a shame as you don't see the great attention to detail that has been put into Arkham City.The game is padded with a huge amount of extra stuff. Outfits, missions, challenges, new game plus, maps, and a whole lot more. That's great for a GOTY edition. However I think the Harley Quinn DLC should've been part of the main game (not that it made a difference for me specifically, but it really added to the game and it's a shame if you missed out on that). I'd rather have seen more attention and polish to the game itself than a lot of additions like this. Ideas would be a talent system, good/bad alignment system, currency system for gear, or a turf war system (between all the gangs controlling areas) et cetera.I'm totally aware people are going to bash on this review, because it's got a lot of criticism. Still, I think I'd recommend other games to people, unless they said they wanted to play a batman game specifically. But this game is not bad. It just didn't have the ""WOW!""-factor for me.			"

												This game isnt a waste of anybodies time it has a great vision of what the batman feels, hears and uses to fight crime arkham city was the frist ever batman game i ever played the ending was sad but thats what made it so good it took a hold of me almost crying about jokers death.the thing about goty why go and buy the robin, nightwing, and alternate batsuits plus the 5 extra content maps or whatever when you have a whole game called goty eddition where you have those thing plus harleys dlc. Waste of money i say.But still a great game made by rocksteady.Probably my favorite until i got batman arkham origins on my ps3 so much fun. I recommend getting batman arkham origins after you play the first two arkham asylum and arkham city.			"

												This games a quality game for three reasons 1. It has a the best story out of all the arkham games 2. You get to do sick tricks with ya gadgets 3. u r ♥♥♥♥ing BATMAN. The game also has sick villains which no one usually cares about like Hush and Solomon Grundy (Born on a Mundi) and very good boss fights e.g. MR. Freeze and Ra's Al Ghul. The game isnt perfect and can get boring, some of the side quests are annoying like saving political prisoners and getting enough riddler trophies to actually do the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ riddler missiions. Part of protocol 10 which is the main plot of the story is kinda stupid Hugo Starnge has to remind u about it all the time and i dont understand because if Hugo Strange knows BIG BOI Bruce Wayne is BATMAN then why doesnt he just kill u at the start also by the end of the game good ol Hugo just gives up like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ even though i didnt think the protocol 10 made much sense the story is still quaility cuz of Joker 'N' stuff. Dlc is kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥Harleys Revenge is of waste of time  and Catwoman IS just breasts on a stick not with not much emotion or story not like im complaining though			"

												Another great game by Rocksteady that is Batman: Arkham City. It is an action packed game and a great adventure along with some good writing.The core mechanics of this game are pretty much the same as it's predecessor Batman: Arkham Asylum. Nevertheless, it  feels great as some new additions were included like some more gadgets in your arsenal and movesets. It is set in an open-world, which is great as developers tried something entirely different from the concept of a limited asylum in Batman: Arkham Asylum. You again will feel like the Dark Knight as you overpower most of your enemies. Riddler's trophies are challenging and time consuming and they are not everyone's cup of tea but puzzle-solving is well doneThe main-story is very well told, the opening is great and the ending is very surprising. Overall. the story from the start to the middle and leading to the epic ending is told in a great way. Very good plot is there too. There are some side missions, most of them very well written and are engaging as will keep you occupied. Voice-acting is superb. Also since it's a Batman game one might expect great boss fights but like it's predecessor it lacks solid boss fights for the most part. The game looks great, as it is dark and gritty yet has comical art-style. It is a good-looking game for sure. Then there are challenges which are fun, they are there to show how slow the version of most people's Batman is. They are indeed challenging and are great for those who would like the arcade style of gameplay but those who don't like arcades might find it repetitive and boring. New Game Plus that you unlock after completing the main campaign is good as the enemies are more aggresive and the indicators of enemies are turned off but still in the end you know what is gonna happen so unpredictability factor in terms of it's story might not be liked my many but it still is more challenging than the main campaign. As you progress through the game you will earn rewards as character trophies and concept arts, which is decent.The DLCs like extra skin and challenge maps are not anything special but the Catwoman's DLC is pretty fun though it doesn't really add up to the story but it's a nice addition to the overall campaign. Harley Quinn's Revenge is a good DLC and continues after the events after the main campaign, and playing as Robin is really fun with different moves and gadgets.Batman: Arkham City is a well written game with fun brawlings and stealth as well.

												Arkham City took what made Asylum great and does it on a much grander scale. However, I feel the fan base would be split on whether Asylum or City is better. Asylum had a great atmospheric setting but City places Batman in a much larger world, full of things to do and discover. I personally prefer City, I feel it has a better plot and I prefer having a bigger open world over a small claustrophobic asylum. Having the City also allows you to use Batmans cape and gliding to full effect. Something I felt wasn't really used in Asylum.			"

												The combat system in this game really is unparalleled and bringing vigilante justice to large groups of criminals using an array of gadgets and jumping around beating them senseless is just pure fun. Guns, stun batons and armoured enemies all add a lot of variation to the combat and keeps it interesting and challenging. Playing as Catwoman also feels very different than batman as she has her own moves and bags of tricks.Gliding around in the open world of Gotham is both fast and fun and the games stealth system is very satisfying as well.The story is really good and has some really stellar voice actors that brings every character to life. You go up against plenty of the well known villains and Mr. Freeze is a special and very memorable boss fight.If you aren't already a fan of Batman, this game will make you one.			"

												Definitely did not disappoint me. Although I never watched Batman before, I decided to give this game a try because of the overwhelming positive feedback about it. It gives a fun and refreshing time from regular FPS single player campaigns. You can try to play stealthily, creeping up and assassinating enemies silently, or just take them all head on. However, the only thing I didn't like is that the combos are too hard to execute. I end up just spamming my attack and counter-attack button and it works most of the time. A number of scenarios were extremely hard too, and I had to attempt probably 10 times or more on some to complete them successfully.Rating: 9/10			"

												Arkham City took what made Asylum great and does it on a much grander scale. However, I feel the fan base would be split on whether Asylum or City is better. Asylum had a great atmospheric setting but City places Batman in a much larger world, full of things to do and discover. I personally prefer City, I feel it has a better plot and I prefer having a bigger open world over a small claustrophobic asylum. Having the City also allows you to use Batmans cape and gliding to full effect. Something I felt wasn't really used in Asylum.			"

												Definitely did not disappoint me. Although I never watched Batman before, I decided to give this game a try because of the overwhelming positive feedback about it. It gives a fun and refreshing time from regular FPS single player campaigns. You can try to play stealthily, creeping up and assassinating enemies silently, or just take them all head on. However, the only thing I didn't like is that the combos are too hard to execute. I end up just spamming my attack and counter-attack button and it works most of the time. A number of scenarios were extremely hard too, and I had to attempt probably 10 times or more on some to complete them successfully.Rating: 9/10			"

REVIEW: BATMAN: ARKHAM CITYHaving already played Batman: Arkham Asylum and been impressed, I found its sequel, Batman: Arkham City, for as cheap a price as its antecedent. So it was inevitable that, sooner or later, I’d play Batman: Arkham City. But would it be as good as its predecessor? Would it fall short of the mark? Or would it surpass it?Quincy Sharp, former warden of Arkham Asylum, is now the mayor of Gotham City, and he has authorised a daring plan: Arkham City, a walled-off part of Gotham where prison inmates have been left to fend for themselves. Bruce Wayne tries to stop it, only to find himself arrested and put into Arkham City by one of its leaders, Dr Hugo Strange, who knows that Wayne is none other than Batman. Thrown into a world where every criminal wants a piece of him, Wayne must become Batman once more, and find out what is going on. But every crime boss within the city has their own agenda. Two-Face and Penguin are vying over territory. Rumours abound of the Joker suffering from a terminal illness. Mr Freeze is locked away in an old GCPD building, working and researching. And the Riddler is making sadistic plans of his own. And behind it all, Dr Strange, the true power in Arkham City, is waiting for the opportunity to become a hero, even at a terrible cost. What is Protocol Ten? Will Catwoman help Batman? And can Batman untangle a web of lies, conspiracies, and destruction before it’s too late?Coming to Arkham City after playing Arkham Asylum, I find that the latter is almost like a proof-of-concept for the former. Arkham Asylum is an excellent game on its own merits, but now, it feels like I am playing the real game. The story is certainly more epic than that of its antecedent, and while it’s good by itself, it’s the extras that you can unlock that add even more depth to the story and its background. The story has more than a few shocking twists and turns, with a truly shocking ending that could mean the end of an era. The story of the DLC, Harley Quinn’s Revenge, is a little less satisfying, with Batman turning into more of a♥♥♥♥♥♥than is tolerable.I was impressed by the graphics of Arkham Asylum, but Arkham City is just that bit better. Once more, the character design is excellent, though the fetishisation of the female characters does happen once more (to a lesser degree at least) to Catwoman. However, the new incarnations of the other members of the rogues’ gallery, like Two-Face and Penguin, are quite enjoyable. Arkham City itself is a vast, sprawling part of a city that feels right, even if confined.Sound-wise, the game once again takes a jump forward. The voice acting is stellar, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill once more reprising the roles of Batman and the Joker, with Maurice LaMarche, Corey Burton, Martin Jarvis and Stana Katic also getting some pretty damned good roles. The music and sound effects are also all good, with Nick Arundel and Ron Fish’s score reminiscent of Hans Zimmer’s work on the Dark Knight Trilogy.Gameplay is where the game takes two steps forward and one step back. The game overall is far more enjoyable, with effectively a sandbox to explore, more gadgets, and more things to do, and more freedom when to do it. Unfortunately, the fact that the game was originally meant for a console comes back to bite it in the controls department, especially combat. Maybe it’s because I played on a higher difficulty this time, or maybe it was the new elements added (like armoured enemies), but I found combat harder than usual, and spiking in difficulty towards the end of the game. I lost many a battle, and had to have the extra edge of the health restored before going back into combat. In addition, the crouch controls, used for dive bombing, meant that I had to use my hand rather awkwardly for puzzles needing that, giving me RSI in my little finger. This made things unnecessarily frustrating, and took a point off what could have been a perfect game otherwise.This annoying tarnish aside, Batman: Arkham City is nonetheless an immensely enjoyable game. I certainly recommend it to any Batman fan out there, and certainly to any fans of a sandbox game with a difference.RATING: ****½  "

												Take everything from the original Arkham Asylum and give it a whole bunch of venom and you got Arkham City. It's bigger and better than Asylum, practically getting rid of all the negative aspects of Asylum like the really basic boss battles and the repetive locations and backtracking. Next to everything is better, a better story, a better world, better side missions, better back story and better characters.9/10 - Near Perfect			"

												Despite me being a fan of games such as GTA and TF2, I really enjoyed this game. It was an amazing sequel to Arkham Asylum and I think it was better than the original. Great gameplay mechanics using Detective mode and the gadgets such as the Cryptographic Sequencer and the Remote-Controlled batarangs. Also there was a great cast of villains, such as the Riddler, Two-Face, Penguin and the dreaded Joker. Also, this game included one the best boss fights ever in video games in my opinion; the Mr. Freeze fight. This put you as Batman against Mr. Freeze, and you would have to use different tactics every time to hurt him, as he adapts to your fighting style. An amazing game, one of my favourites. I recommend this to anyone, even though Arkham Origins has come out. That game has soaked out a lot of my time too.			"

												To keep it short: BUY THIS GAME.If I had to write a full report on it, I could easily fill at least two A4-pages and still there'd be stuff worth telling about.So I just point out some details I think are worth mentioning.The graphics is pretty nice. Lighting, atmosphere, textures, effects... They may be not as perfect as Crysis, but it still is a reference for most games.One thing I really have to mention, is the realistic animation of the characters. I think so far I did not see this kind of game, especially those featuring melee combat, with such perfect fight animations. Check out some videos on youtube or something, where you can see catwoman in a fight and you get the idea of smooth animation captioning.The mission design is also really good. There are some minor points in the story, where an unexperienced player, who does not listen to the dialogs, might not know exactly what to do... but for all others with a brain, the missions are really enjoyable.Although some mechanics get used again and again, I still did not end up bored, because the surroundings or the main story itself were such a motivation, I never thought ""come on, I need something to do"".Level design is pretty good, two. Although there is the one or another unexplainable venting shaft, the levels mostly feel organic and are always fair. Batman has enough possibilities and gadgets to give one the edge in every fight and to enable one, to make really cool looking fights, and withougt having to remember 100 button combos like in other games. The fighting system of Arkham Asylum was adapted and polished and is easy to learn (although it takes some time to master) and just looks awesome.Also the balancing is, in my opinion, great, too. On easy, even a newbie is able to complete the main story and on hard and/or the New Game Plus (after finishing the campaign once) you really have to think on what is the most efficient way to beat those thugs and you have to use most of the gadgets to succeed..Also noteworthy: On New Game plus, the enemies are not just ""stronger"" (more health that is), like in most games. But they are more, they have better equipment and - most importantly - you are missing the ""attack"" icons over their hads. That nees some training first, but in the end it really adds immersity to the game, especially due to the fine character animations, which always gives you a fair amount of time to react accordingly to the situation.The dialogs. The dialogs...The main story itself is gorgeous (and I won't spoiler a thing about it). But those commentaries from Joker are really the best. There are so many puns and wordplays, I ended up laughing on nearly every ""call"" from Joker.And not only him: The ""idle"" dialogs of all those thugs standing around in Arkham and (story) dialogs with other characters like Catwoman are really worth listening. I catched myself upon just standing around for some time after entering a new region to just listen if there are some funny comments from those brainless guys.I recommend playing this game with a Xbox 360 controller.On my first play through, I used mouse and keyboard, which are implemented really good. But to give one an edge is some of the harder fights, the controller is still the better choice; this is mostly to the easier (quick-)use of all those fine gadgets of batman.If there ever was a game, which I'd have to give 100/100, it would be this one.Of course there are litte, tiny things, a game QA could still find. But you'd have to really search for them and, since they do not interfere with the game experience in any way you can easily make it a 99/100 ;)So don't think about it too long; buy this game and ENJOY!

												While still a good game, with an ""open world"" setting, I found it inferior to Asylum. Sometimes bigger just means more filler, and that's what a lot of the game unfortunately felt like for me. Combat, and especially the SOUND of punching dudes, was a lot worse than in AA, and felt really unsatisfying at times, although I liked a lot of the upgrades. It seems the devs forgot everything that made the sound of Asylum great and did something ""else"" in City. It's just ""off"", like a lot of the punches are softened up, sounding like rubber hitting against rubber, while in Arkham you could almost hear the bone shatter when punching people. I also completed the well enough put together main story (too?) quickly, resulting in me doing some Riddler and Side Mission ""chores"" after the big reveal/ending of the main story, which became quite boring after a while.Anyway, happy to finally have completed it and I would definitely recommend it - I guess it's just a case of Asylum setting the bar so high, that to follow up with something better is almost impossible. Definitely worth your time and money.			"

												I really enjoyed Arkham City. It's a lot like Asylum, but set in a larger open world environment, and the plot is absolutely insane/nonsensical. I used a controller this time (I used keyboard/mouse in Asylum) and found it much better for this game, since it's basically an open world cinematic fighting game and you don't really have to precisely aim at anything, ever. Flying around the city as Batman is fun, though the banter of the thugs is kind of annoying; they are all very chatty all the time. No one ever just shuts up, it seems. Also, they aren't afraid of Batman. Random inmates even taunt Batman if they see him, trying to get you to come down and fight them for some reason.I really enjoyed the game, though I think Asylum has a much better plot and is more focused. This game has more refined combat mechanics, though. The game has a lot of side quests where you fight various random Batman series villains, which is odd because Batman is (per the story, anyway) in quite a rush to finish the game before dying. I didn't do many side quests. The combat was fun, especially once you get a variety of gadgets and fight different enemy types.			"

												I wish I could give Arkham City a 10/10; I really do, because I really love the game. It took everything Arkham Asylum did beautifully and refined it to the point of perfection--except for one thing.The camera. Just look at my profile and for the two Arkham City ""Broken Camera"" videos to see what I mean. When you're in intense combat, you can pretty much count on the camera doing little more than spinning around in circles, with no disregard at all for where enemies are located, which can and will cause you to take cheap hits. That's especially a problem in things like Joker's Carnival, but it's an issue in the other challenges, too. Turning off Camera Assist, from what I've experienced, has no effect at all; it changes nothing. If you somehow haven't played Arkham City, what are you waiting for? I've 100%'d the game on 360, and here I am again, going through the trouble again. It's THAT good of a game. 9/10.			"

												10/10, could do with improvement.Joking, this is truly the best game of all time NO DISCUSSION. It is a truly ecstatic feeling when you are running to hide towards a wall and try to crouch but end up destroying that wall, and then the 100 guards are point their sniping guns at you and you instantly die. Haaa, memories, I can't wait for bamtan arkham knight if it's going to be more of this. The combat is perfect, not too complicated, but it looks intricate enough, the storyline was intruiging, wihch a large array of plot twists and villains, maybe too many. The riddler challenges maybe become a bit to tedious, but at the end of the day, anything that's luminous green and still looks ominous deserves praise. The animaiton was spot on, and there is only one way to finish this off properly, in this game, YOU'RE BATMAN!			"

												Take everything from the original Arkham Asylum and give it a whole bunch of venom and you got Arkham City. It's bigger and better than Asylum, practically getting rid of all the negative aspects of Asylum like the really basic boss battles and the repetive locations and backtracking. Next to everything is better, a better story, a better world, better side missions, better back story and better characters.9/10 - Near Perfect			"

												Despite me being a fan of games such as GTA and TF2, I really enjoyed this game. It was an amazing sequel to Arkham Asylum and I think it was better than the original. Great gameplay mechanics using Detective mode and the gadgets such as the Cryptographic Sequencer and the Remote-Controlled batarangs. Also there was a great cast of villains, such as the Riddler, Two-Face, Penguin and the dreaded Joker. Also, this game included one the best boss fights ever in video games in my opinion; the Mr. Freeze fight. This put you as Batman against Mr. Freeze, and you would have to use different tactics every time to hurt him, as he adapts to your fighting style. An amazing game, one of my favourites. I recommend this to anyone, even though Arkham Origins has come out. That game has soaked out a lot of my time too.			"

REVIEW: BATMAN: ARKHAM CITYHaving already played Batman: Arkham Asylum and been impressed, I found its sequel, Batman: Arkham City, for as cheap a price as its antecedent. So it was inevitable that, sooner or later, I’d play Batman: Arkham City. But would it be as good as its predecessor? Would it fall short of the mark? Or would it surpass it?Quincy Sharp, former warden of Arkham Asylum, is now the mayor of Gotham City, and he has authorised a daring plan: Arkham City, a walled-off part of Gotham where prison inmates have been left to fend for themselves. Bruce Wayne tries to stop it, only to find himself arrested and put into Arkham City by one of its leaders, Dr Hugo Strange, who knows that Wayne is none other than Batman. Thrown into a world where every criminal wants a piece of him, Wayne must become Batman once more, and find out what is going on. But every crime boss within the city has their own agenda. Two-Face and Penguin are vying over territory. Rumours abound of the Joker suffering from a terminal illness. Mr Freeze is locked away in an old GCPD building, working and researching. And the Riddler is making sadistic plans of his own. And behind it all, Dr Strange, the true power in Arkham City, is waiting for the opportunity to become a hero, even at a terrible cost. What is Protocol Ten? Will Catwoman help Batman? And can Batman untangle a web of lies, conspiracies, and destruction before it’s too late?Coming to Arkham City after playing Arkham Asylum, I find that the latter is almost like a proof-of-concept for the former. Arkham Asylum is an excellent game on its own merits, but now, it feels like I am playing the real game. The story is certainly more epic than that of its antecedent, and while it’s good by itself, it’s the extras that you can unlock that add even more depth to the story and its background. The story has more than a few shocking twists and turns, with a truly shocking ending that could mean the end of an era. The story of the DLC, Harley Quinn’s Revenge, is a little less satisfying, with Batman turning into more of a♥♥♥♥♥♥than is tolerable.I was impressed by the graphics of Arkham Asylum, but Arkham City is just that bit better. Once more, the character design is excellent, though the fetishisation of the female characters does happen once more (to a lesser degree at least) to Catwoman. However, the new incarnations of the other members of the rogues’ gallery, like Two-Face and Penguin, are quite enjoyable. Arkham City itself is a vast, sprawling part of a city that feels right, even if confined.Sound-wise, the game once again takes a jump forward. The voice acting is stellar, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill once more reprising the roles of Batman and the Joker, with Maurice LaMarche, Corey Burton, Martin Jarvis and Stana Katic also getting some pretty damned good roles. The music and sound effects are also all good, with Nick Arundel and Ron Fish’s score reminiscent of Hans Zimmer’s work on the Dark Knight Trilogy.Gameplay is where the game takes two steps forward and one step back. The game overall is far more enjoyable, with effectively a sandbox to explore, more gadgets, and more things to do, and more freedom when to do it. Unfortunately, the fact that the game was originally meant for a console comes back to bite it in the controls department, especially combat. Maybe it’s because I played on a higher difficulty this time, or maybe it was the new elements added (like armoured enemies), but I found combat harder than usual, and spiking in difficulty towards the end of the game. I lost many a battle, and had to have the extra edge of the health restored before going back into combat. In addition, the crouch controls, used for dive bombing, meant that I had to use my hand rather awkwardly for puzzles needing that, giving me RSI in my little finger. This made things unnecessarily frustrating, and took a point off what could have been a perfect game otherwise.This annoying tarnish aside, Batman: Arkham City is nonetheless an immensely enjoyable game. I certainly recommend it to any Batman fan out there, and certainly to any fans of a sandbox game with a difference.RATING: ****½  "

And from now to then i cant seem to open it up at all because it quits unexpectidly. any one know how to help? im open for any suggestions.			"

												The last great Batman game to be released. Everything is vastly improved from the original with expanded combat mechanics, abilities, looks better. The story is still as intrigueing and compelling as the original was. I did feel that there was a little bit missing or different thanks to the more open world approach to the game over the older, more linear first game as it felt more contained and/or polished. That's barely a nitpick to concern yourself. If you want a great brawler with beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay and very responsive controls. Batman Origins is a massive step back, a step back so much it's more like a running leap to very unpolished in comparison to this game. That is why Arkham City is a game I'd consider the last, great, Batman game.			"

												The combat system in this game really is unparalleled and bringing vigilante justice to large groups of criminals using an array of gadgets and jumping around beating them senseless is just pure fun. Guns, stun batons and armoured enemies all add a lot of variation to the combat and keeps it interesting and challenging. Playing as Catwoman also feels very different than batman as she has her own moves and bags of tricks.Gliding around in the open world of Gotham is both fast and fun and the games stealth system is very satisfying as well.The story is really good and has some really stellar voice actors that brings every character to life. You go up against plenty of the well known villains and Mr. Freeze is a special and very memorable boss fight.If you aren't already a fan of Batman, this game will make you one.			"

												This. This is The Game. I don't even know what to say, really. This game right here brings you an excellent storyline, a thrilling gameplay (in which I found nearly no glitches and no annoying bugs, at all) and hours of enjoyment. The main story, besides being top notch, is only about 35% of the game. You've got so much to entertain yourself with that you'll find yourself immersed within Bat's world. The side missions are reeeeally interesting and the side stories are as perfect as the main one. All being said, do yourself a favor and buy this game. Or simply borrow it, however you prefer, but you've got to play this while you exist. And existence is brief, so do it now! :)			"

												Alright, Arkham City and a comparison with Arkham Asylum:Pros:- The core gameplay is better. Animations and combat are more fluid. You will also fight a lot more enmies now, several at a time even. Pretty cool actually. You are also able to play as Catwoman at certain points.- Gadgets and movement: Almost all of the gadgets from the first game are back and some available from the start. Others are upgraded. You can easily forget you have a certain ability, because there are so many...- The story is pretty good and acted very well- Boss fights are even better than Arkham Asylum- Cool side missions- Interesting riddles are back   Cons:- The game is a bit bloated imho. There are 400 (!!!!!!!!) riddles and trophies and ""destructibles"" like Joker teeth and other stuff + about 50 Catwoman trophies. What is ""worse"" is that the Riddler side quests are again linked with finding a certain amount of riddles and trophies (all for the final confrontation). That confrontation is cool, but it's just too much wasted time. Half the number of stuff would have been sufficient. Instead you're stopping every 5 meters to try and grab another trophy. To do so you have to use your gadgets and/or Riddler pressure plates and other stuff. They are cool, but just too many.- These trophies also unlock character art, background stories and Strange interrogation tapes, but again, you need to find all of the trophies...kinda. *sigh* Too much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.- Some parts of the map are hard to get to if you're just trying to gather trophies.- Finding all the trophies either requires a very very good eye and dedication or you need to find all the ""green"" guards and extract the locations from them. Finding the Riddler map in Arkham Asylum was a lot better and less stressful.- Respawning guards. This is majorly annoying. Enemies just keep respawning and respawning. You can dispatch them pretty easily, but it still gets old after several hours.If you're just here for the base game and some side missions, great game. If you want to 100% that♥♥♥♥♥♥ omg, prepare for a long slog of trying to find all the stupid stuff.Apart from that there's only the ""riddler challenge missions"" outside the base game. Just as in Arkham Asylum you have to complete a series of combat or stalker missions and you can earn medals for that. You unlock these challenges through gathering the Riddler stuff in the game...again. Imho that's still not very compelling, but if you're desperate for a bit more fighting, go ahead.DLC Edit: There's more Riddler combat DLC, letting you play as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing. To be honest the characters don't control any differently. They have some moves that vary (gadgets only really), but apart from that it is the exact same combat flow, so I don't really see the point. Fun for a few minutes but nothing more.Harley Quinn's Revenge: A solo DLC, extremely linear. Takes place at the Steel Mill. There's no level ups, no free roaming, nothing. You have to beat certain enemies, do certain things, etc. All in all about 2 hours of content, alternating between Batman and Robin. In the actual game mode Robin is fun to play since he does solve problems differently than Batman, just as with Catwoman in the base game. Too bad you couldn't play him and Nightwing in the base game. Might have been some compelling story telling as well. Missed opportunity. But a decent DLC detailing the events after Arkham City.			"

												Batman: Arkham City was my introduction to the Arkham series and I have absolutely loved playing it. It has very nice graphics, an interesting story, multitudes of familiar characters, engaging dialogue and voice acting, and a well designed open world that is large enough to enjoy exploring, yet small enough to become familiar with. It can take a while to get between objectives on the map, so I would expect to spend at least 1-2 minutes in transit everytime you need to cross the map.On the other hand, I was miserable with some of the combat. I found in this game that the most challenging thing was appropriately timing my counters and evades amidst my strikes and other moves. I played all the way through on Normal, then completed New Game Plus mode on Normal, and I would have liked to get the Perfect Knight 2 achievement for 100% completion, but I cannot stand the combat scoring. Riddler's Revenge (other than the predator maps) is the least appealing part of the game for me. However, I did like playing a DLC of the batcave and would have enjoyed more interaction with the batcave. If you enjoy this game's style of combat, there's a lot of rich content available for you to explore and personal records to set and break.Overall, I loved getting to know the story arc and I found myself really motivated to play New Game Plus, demonstrating a fair amount of replay value. There were a lot of delightful dialogue parallels that I had failed to notice in my first playthrough, such as when Batman repeats Catwoman's ""broke a nail"" line. Also, I enjoyed optimizing my routes across the map and through levels as well as my combat strategies and boss fights. Despite my significant dislike of and struggle with the combat system, I found the game fun and really worthwhile.			"

												Absolutely amazing story and gameplay. There is just so much to do. There were a few minor things that got a tad repetitive but it was so much fun that it didn't really bother me at all. I love the open feel of the game where you could just stop with anything to do with the main quest line and just do whatever you wanted.  The game mechanics were awesome, the fights never seemed to get old. So many gadgets and ways to dispose of baddies and so many different ways to accomplish your goals.  I hope they make another just like it....don't fix what isn't broken.PS. This game is an absolute steal at the 4.99....over 100 hours of playtime and could have went much more.			"

												I was batman at first flying everywhere. Then I did some major stuff to become the dark knight and at the end I rose to be the best. xD This game is amazing. Batman simulator 2011 and its really gives you a great feel of being batman. You have all the cool gadgets and can do the amazing things that you could only see in the trilogy and comics before. The story fits in pretty accuratly to both the movie and the comics. The progressions makes it so interesting that you want to know whats gonna happen next. Most importantly, you can never have nothing to do in this game. Even if you finish the story the side missions tie in so well that it seems like a continuation of the life of BatmanThe other aspects of the game are great to. The graphics work even on a laptop and are streamlined yet stunning. The scenic takedowns made you satisfied with your hard work. And, the levelling up system was great for variation in tactics. You can be sneaky bat or muscle bat both payed off. As for the DLC:It's like a practice during the competition maps and the Catwoman sections were pretty exciting and the opportunity to have 2 metas is definately great. They tie in well and each of the characters are interesting in their varying gadgets.cons:nothing to major to report except for if you have a touch scroll mouse. (can't use middle mouse for some weapons)theres also the fact that sometimes the ai becomes to strong with excessive guns(but thats my opinion it makes sense story wise)Reccomendation:If you dont have it yet, a) its not too late b) your missiong out on life c)cmon its BATMAN NANANANANNANANANANA BATMAN			"

												While I preferred the story in Asylum, I believe that Arkham City is the better and more enjoyable experience. This game has a lot more replay value than Asylum, and the inclusion of side missions makes me come back for more even after the main campaign is finished. Once again, Conroy and Hamill completely nail it in their performances, as does the rest of the cast. Overall, I'd give it an 8.5/10.			"

												So far the best Batman franchise game, due to it's stealth and combat gameplay combined with storyline. Atmosphere is criminal and dark, so it is a perfect playground for Dark Knight, as well as the criminal for him. Story is fluid and entertaining, side quest are asking to be completed, and only thing that will make You go forward and back will be Riddlers trophies, but besides that, it is fun to be the Dark Knight.

												아캄버스의 두번째 이야기. 전작 아캄수용소를 벗어나서 이번에는 아캄시티 전체가 무대이다. 전작에 비해 좀더 많은 빌런과 좀더 화려해지고 쉬워진 격투신. 플레이어블 캐릭도 캣우먼을 비롯해 DLC에서 사용할수있는 나이트윙과 로빈까지 전작에 비해 아쉽다고 느껴진것들을 꽉꽉 채워넣었다. 하지만 맥빠지는 보스전은 전작과 동일하고, 스토리면에서는 먼치킨이자 뱃신이라고 비꼬임 당할수밖에없는 배트맨과 왜 나왔는지조차 알수없는 빌런들로 인하여, 몰입감은 전작에 비해서 떨어진다. 전작에서는 볼수없었던 사이드미션의 경우 몇몇 빌런 특유의 개성을 살리기보다는 돼려 죽여버린 느낌이 더 강하고 몇몇 사이드미션은 왜 만들었을까 하는 생각이 들정도로 좋게봐줄 구석이없다. 그저 장점이라면 빌런들 자체의 스토리를 정확히 알게된다는 그거 하나뿐... 그외에 모든 시스템이나 구성은 어사일럼과 거의 비슷하고. 전작의 묵직한 느낌은 많이 사라지고 전작에 비해서 모든면이 많이 화려해졌다. 곳곳에 숨겨진 DC빌런들의 체취며 깨알같은 대두모드까지... 어사일럼이 아캄수용소의 정신나간 빌런들과의 대결을 다룬 다크히어로의 이야기였다면 아캄시티는 그저 먼치킨 뱃신의 히어로 이야기가 아닐까싶다..

												This. This is The Game. I don't even know what to say, really. This game right here brings you an excellent storyline, a thrilling gameplay (in which I found nearly no glitches and no annoying bugs, at all) and hours of enjoyment. The main story, besides being top notch, is only about 35% of the game. You've got so much to entertain yourself with that you'll find yourself immersed within Bat's world. The side missions are reeeeally interesting and the side stories are as perfect as the main one. All being said, do yourself a favor and buy this game. Or simply borrow it, however you prefer, but you've got to play this while you exist. And existence is brief, so do it now! :)			"

												Author's Notes: I've just recently replayed Arkham City for the 4th time (Once on PC and the other three on Xbox 360) so, I think it's time for me to review this. Batman: Arkham City is a sequel Arkham Asylum and really captures what a sequel should be. For starters, the story was absolutely fantastic. I won't go into a lot of detail with the story, but basically Batman is in Arkham City, trying to prevent it from falling into utter chaos because of the forces that threaten it (Mainly the Joker and Hugo Strange). Along with a fantastic story, the game also brings awesome voice actors (Such as Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill) and brings some great soundtrack work along for the ride. The Batman Arkham series is known not only for its awesome actors and great story, but also for its great fighting mechanics. The fighting mechanics that are present in this one feel even better than Asylum's. The fighting feels a little more fluid and also is even more responsive. There are even new fighting skills to unlock and the moves have been spiced up. The AI in this game is pretty great as well. They aren't your average stupid AI at times, which adds some difficulty to the game. Just like Asylum, City has some stealth segments that are really well done and are very fun! You can hide in the floor vents, blow up a wall behind a thug, and even preform those awesome inverted takedowns from the 1st game.Being that this is a Batman game, there are indeed gadgets. If you've played the previous game, you'll recognize some of them, such as the iconic batarang and grappling hook, along with the batclaw and explosive gem. City also adds some new gadgets, such as a remote gun jammer and freeze grenades. These new additions add some fun moments and provide more variety for taking out thugs. Along with fighting thugs, you'll also fight Batman's villains. There are a fair amount of boss fights in this game! None of them are really hard, but they are fun. Each boss has a weakness so, it's just a matter of finding it. The boss fights provided here are probably some of the best in the series! Another awesome element added in this game was the open world aspect. The city is filled with thugs to beat up, side missions to complete, and Ridder trophies and riddles to find and solve. You really do feel like Batman gliding around the city when you play through the game! The open world aspect adds a lot of fun to be had and a lot of replayablilty. The side missions are really good and are definitely worth checking out. Now, since this is the game of the year edition, it comes with all of the dlc. There's a story dlc for Harley Quinn, which is really fun and well made (I recommend playing it after you defeat the main story though). Also, the Catwoman dlc is present in the game. The Catwoman dlc adds a different dynamic to the game and allows you to play as a different character, other than Batman. It provides a nice break in between segments and gives you a good look at what happens in other parts of the city when Batman is off doing his thing. Also, when you defeat the main story, you unlock all of the skins, which are nice to mess around with. (There's also a way to get them before completing the main story ;) ). In all, Arkham City is what a sequel should be, it improved upon what was previously there and also added new mechanics and really spiced things up. If you haven't played Arkham Asylum, I recommend playing it first, but this one is definitely the best in the series! This game is easily one of my favorite games I've played ever. I highly recommend checking it out (There's even a demo), because who doesn't want to be Batman?  "

												This is gaming at its finest. Excellent and engaging gameplay, awesome fighting and stealth segments, compelling story, out-of-this-world visuals (thanks to the UE3 engine), and an entire city filled to the brim with content and things to do. Even if you are not a fan of the ""Batman"" comics, you need to play this! It will keep you busy for several hours, and will keep bringing you back over and over again even after you finish it. Simply put, it's one of the best games ever.			"

												So far the best Batman franchise game, due to it's stealth and combat gameplay combined with storyline. Atmosphere is criminal and dark, so it is a perfect playground for Dark Knight, as well as the criminal for him. Story is fluid and entertaining, side quest are asking to be completed, and only thing that will make You go forward and back will be Riddlers trophies, but besides that, it is fun to be the Dark Knight.

												While I preferred the story in Asylum, I believe that Arkham City is the better and more enjoyable experience. This game has a lot more replay value than Asylum, and the inclusion of side missions makes me come back for more even after the main campaign is finished. Once again, Conroy and Hamill completely nail it in their performances, as does the rest of the cast. Overall, I'd give it an 8.5/10.			"

												If you are checking reviews to see if this game is worth buying or not, I would advise you to stop and buy Arkham Knight, if your computer can handle it of course. As of writing this review it is priced the same, and Arkham Knight is a lot more in depth and is all around better, but this game is still a must have and will go down in history.Arkham City is the game that fully got me into playing video games. Granted, I played minecraft once or twice when it first came out, but it just wasn't my game and at the time it made me assume I wouldn't like any video game. I still remember going over my friends house, who at the time was the only friend of mine who had a PS3, he liked to brag about it even though he just got it and a lot of other people had it too. (this next part is a huge spoiler for the story so don't put your mouse over it if you don't want a spoiler)  I remember ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants when Freeze attacks you and I made my friend play through his fight for me I remember all the times I went over his house and played, and I never really did much after the story missions. I just restarted the game, over and over again. I've beaten Arkham City about 50 times and I decided to come back a little bit ago. Of course, I had to adjust from playing Arkham Knight to Arkham City, they are very very different. I didn't want to buy the Return To Arkham, because even though it has Arkham City and Asylum, the improved graphics and bad times on Arkham Asylum drew me to just buy Arkham City.As soon as I started up the game, the nostalgia was so intense, I could still remember most of the puzzles at the first few missions and their answers, helping me to get some riddler trophies easier at the start. Although, what really made me want to share how good of a game this is was the parts I didn't remember. Doing whatever you can, wether it be stupid or smart, to try to solve a puzzle is so much fun. Some of the puzzles are pretty difficult and fun to try to get through, especially because they don't hinder your progress in the story.Another amazing feature of this game is the flawless execution of stealh. One reason I would recommened Arkham Knight over this game is that in Arkham Knight you startle enemies when you appear out of nowhere, giving you a second to react, wether it be attacking them or preforming a takedown. Although, in Arkham City, they instantly react to you, which is one of the only stealth flaws. There are many options on how you take people down, wether it be attack and run away, silent takedowns, or knocking them out with one of your many tools, this game is very in depth. You can even play ""Riddler Challenges"" which let you play different stealth and combat missions with added objectives.My final reason to buy this game is the amazing combat. Its not flawless, but it is very well put together. You have a second to react to being attacked, and there are multiple kinds of enemies. There are thugs, thugs with shields, thugs with shock batons, titans, brutes, armored thugs, and sometimes you even fight armed thugs head to head. All of the different types of enemies are taken out differently, making combat more than just button mashing. Any thugs with nothing in their hands will pick up bats, shields, shock batons, and really anything dropped by their allies that you took out.Overall this game is amazing and I would give it 9/10			"

												Arkham City is a rare sequel that is better than the original game. It takes everything that worked well in Asylum, improved on it, and added more of everything. More puzzles, more villains, more interaction with characters from the comics, etc. I enjoyed the Catwoman DLC woven into the main storyline, as it served to break up the monotony of playing as Batman.I like that at the end of the game free roaming mode is unlocked as well as the ability to swap characters in and out. But, I think that it sucks that both of the other DLC characters aren't also implimented in free roaming mode without mods. There's a character swap mechanic already in place, so I doubt it would have been difficult to do.			"

												A game which is kinda cool in that it's Batman in an ""open-world"" environment, but unlike Asylum, it's not really as well-designed? There's a lot of dumb moves in here that just leave me groaning (or in a couple of cases, screaming in rage because they just suddenly 'turn on' an ability I've had all game that never worked prior), and I won't lie: this game has serious issues with women.I'd say get it if you dug Asylum, since it's got a lot of the same gameplay, tightened up... but mother of god, this is one of the few times I'll say a game has TOO MUCH content. Puzzle-based collectables everywhere! An ever-increasing number of challenge modes to take on and score attack! Sidequests that range from really cool (some of the actual detective work for the ""World's Greatest Detective"", the Bane arc and its final fight rocked) to abominably bad (the Hatter, Hush, and Calendar Man can go screw off, those were blatant filler).

												A great Batman game, but I still feel that it is somewhat inferior to Arkham Asylum. Not by much, I just simply feel the first game was better. The city is vast, but uninteresting, unlike the small, compact, density of the Asylum.All in all, a worthy successor. But I feel that Arkham City trades 'open world' for quality. And in my opinion, quality over quantity is always the winner. If you're a fan of the first game, then you'll love Arkham City. If you are a fan of Batman, ditto. Basically anyone should be able to enjoy this game, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.So yes, I recommend this game. I wouldn't say it's a must play, but if you like good games, here you go, here's one of 'em. For $20, you'd be hard pressed to find something too much better.			"

												The second game in the ""Arkham"" trilogy. The combat system is pretty simple. If you don't already know you have one button to ""strike"" and another to ""counter"" with the ability to mix various gadgets in your combos rather fluently. There are also stealth sections throughout the game though they are pretty bland and don't have very much depth in my opinion. You are offered various methods of taking people down in the stealth sections, but I don't see much reason to use them when a silent takedown is the simplest, most effective way of taking enemies down. Basically, this game is a continuation of the story of Arkham Asylum with a few improvements of gameplay. There are more gadgets,upgrades, and collectables. As well as an open world setting and much more side content than Arkham Asylum. The atmosphere of the game is fantastic and I even 100% the main game. I say ""main game"" because this game has a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of DLC characters that can only be played in ""challenge maps"" which in reality are more frustrating than fun to play. There is only 1 story DLC, but it's short and rather unfulfilling. I still think this is a good buy as nothing in the game except the DLC is conceptually worse then Arkham Asylum. A good buy for people intrested in the series.			"

												I've played and beat all of the batman games (except for ARKHAM NIGHT bc of BUGS) but this Batman game is by far the best one i've played. I beat the story and only played a couple of side quests but overall is one of the best games yet. 10/10 would beat again			"

												YES!!! There's a reason this game is so critically acclaimed. The villians are terrifying and interesting characters, the combat is extremely unique and never seems to get repetitive. The graphics are beyond gorgeous, and Nvidia's PhysX really shines through on this game, so I would recommend playing it with an Nvidia GPU. Love this game, it's such an open amazing world, that has touches of RPG, arcade, flight, stealth. etc. The riddler challenges are super fun!			"

												Браво Rocksteady!!! Б-Р-А-В-О!!! Играя в Arkham Asylum, я даже и подумать не мог, что Arkham City будет такой шикарной! Это просто нечто! Зуб даю, данная игра станет классикой для подростающей молодежи! В игре есть абсолютно все, что нужно истинному фанату Бэтмана! Куча персонажей, отличный сюжет, настоящая библиотека вселенной, файтинг на высоте, озвучка - ""Шик и Блеск"". Грех не назвать данную игру лучшей из лучших! (10+ из 10)P.S.: Берите и вы ни за что не пожалеете!			"

												The second game in the ""Arkham"" trilogy. The combat system is pretty simple. If you don't already know you have one button to ""strike"" and another to ""counter"" with the ability to mix various gadgets in your combos rather fluently. There are also stealth sections throughout the game though they are pretty bland and don't have very much depth in my opinion. You are offered various methods of taking people down in the stealth sections, but I don't see much reason to use them when a silent takedown is the simplest, most effective way of taking enemies down. Basically, this game is a continuation of the story of Arkham Asylum with a few improvements of gameplay. There are more gadgets,upgrades, and collectables. As well as an open world setting and much more side content than Arkham Asylum. The atmosphere of the game is fantastic and I even 100% the main game. I say ""main game"" because this game has a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of DLC characters that can only be played in ""challenge maps"" which in reality are more frustrating than fun to play. There is only 1 story DLC, but it's short and rather unfulfilling. I still think this is a good buy as nothing in the game except the DLC is conceptually worse then Arkham Asylum. A good buy for people intrested in the series.			"

												It's hard to top an already good game.But it's even harder to top a near perfect game.But Arkham City does exactly that.It takes the all the mechanics of the Arkham Asylum and applies it on a whole city with perfection.If you haven't played this game by now...then you either don't like superheroes or games in general(thus rendering my review pretty much useless).Pros-+An exciting,varied and exhilarating campaign.+Stellar cast of voice actors.+Story and writing is remarkable.+Traversing the city is sheer joy.+Improves a lot features of it's predecessor.+Boss fight's are splendid (I am looking at you Mr.Freeze).+Decent amount of side missions.+Mainly it preserves the feeling of being Batman like it's predecessor and adds toppings.Score-10/10If you somehow haven't played this game by now...you really really really should.It just one of those games that make you proud about your hobby.

												ossibly one of the best and most complete games I have ever played. I enjoyed every second of Arkham City from start to finish. Initial release with DirectX11 support was rushed and needed to be patched ASAP as it wasn't implemented/coded too well. However I enjoyed the game for what it truly is. It is a great tribute to Batman which says a lot because we all know how crappy superhero games and movie spin-off games can be. I will be playing through Arkham City once again as soon as I have the chance. 10/10			"

												While I admit I prefer RPG's such as Final Fantasy (Ok, more like old school Final Fantasy), I do love a good Action/Adventure game when done right. The Batman Arkham City game drew my interest because it's Batman, one of the best DC characters of all time. And they did an awesome job making the game, it has dark but great graphics, an interesting (mostly in a good way) fighting system and little challenges sprinkled throughout the game with the Riddler trophies. For the most part the game is pure awesome, though it does have it's bad parts. You can't officially play as Nightwing or Robin in the main game, only in the little challenge maps which is kind of annoying as I kind of believe that they would have made a great addition to the main story of the game. Also, Batgirl (I know Barbara is still Oracle in this game but there was more than just barb as Batgirl) would have been nice to have to.The biggest gripe I have about this game is that it can seem a little repetitive at times which may be more me than the game as many people don't find the game as repetitive as I do. Still, there is plenty to do in the game and it is kind of cool to be able to play as Catwoman later in the game which helps break up the monotony a bit. Still, the game deserves at least an 8 out of 10 for everything that it does right and all of the cool gadgets you get to play around with.			"

												Batman Arkham City GOTY is perhaps the greatest superhero video game ever to be released. It is very hard for me to find words to describe just how beautiful this game (a dream come true to any batman fan).The free-flow combat is absolutely superb, it is by far the most well-made in any video game of this genre in my opinion and is guaranteed to give you tons of fun if you like these type of games.The graphics and sound of this game are just outstanding. I mean for the time it was released (back in 2011), the game was absolutely magnificient. This is just my opnion, but i think even to this day, the game still looks superb.As i said above, this game is a dream come true to any batman fan. You can find almost every well-known hero/villain (batman, robin, catwoman, joker, two-face, mr. freeze and more, riddler and more) in this game, and the story that you go through is very good.If you are a batman fan like me or if you just want a good superhero game, i recommend this game with all my heart. It is truly a masterpiece in every way.			"

												Batman Arkham City is the second installment in Rocksteady's Batman Arkham series and it had a lot to live up to following it's predecessor Batman Arkham Asylum. It improved upon almost every aspect of the game and lived up to its expectations receiving 2011's Game of the Year award.What I liked: Big new map to explore as Batman and Catwoman Excellently written sequel that is of better quality and longer than the original Improved combat system with more moves, more upgrades and more awesome Same incredible attention to detail as the first Riddler returns with more riddles and his own side missions Twice the content as the first gameWhat I didn't like: The combat and predator challenges can become quite tedious after having to play them over and over again as 4 different charactersRocksteady have done it again with more quality content and added DLC characters, challenges and a short campaign you'll easily clock up 50+ hours if you want to 100% this game. 10/10			"

You can't officially play as Nightwing or Robin in the main game, only in the little challenge maps which is kind of annoying as I kind of believe that they would have made a great addition to the main story of the game. Also, Batgirl (I know Barbara is still Oracle in this game but there was more than just barb as Batgirl) would have been nice to have to.The biggest gripe I have about this game is that it can seem a little repetitive at times which may be more me than the game as many people don't find the game as repetitive as I do. Still, there is plenty to do in the game and it is kind of cool to be able to play as Catwoman later in the game which helps break up the monotony a bit. Still, the game deserves at least an 8 out of 10 for everything that it does right and all of the cool gadgets you get to play around with.			"

												This is one of my favorite games, Rocksteady has done a great job making these games. Glad they got the original Batman and Joker from TAS! Anyone who is a fan of Batman should play this game .. also Riddler has a lot of free time putting over 400+ secrets into this game :X			"

												It's hard to believe that the first game could be improved on so much but it is. This game is just like the first but better in every area. The first and biggest thing I noticed was how much more fluid the controls and movement are. Arkham Asylum had some of the most fluid controls I've ever seen and this is even better. Even more fluid combat, faster grappling, and all around more precise easier movement. The graphics are better too. Asylum was really grey and dull throughout most of it but this one looks a little more colorful and lively. The whole city's layout is designed very well. Another big-time improvement: the overhead map is filled with challenges and side missions that you can select as waypoints now. The first game was pretty good but this one is great. They took great care and put great detail in these games to show the Batman universe and all the characters. It really feels like they left nothing out, so hardcore Batman fans will love this stuff. These Batman games are some of the best action beat-em-ups of all time. Simply some of the best combat and gameplay that money can buy. 9/10			"

												Batman arham city is the sequel to the great arham asylum game but is it as good as the first one ? This time the caped crusader is held captive in a squared off part of gotham city called Arham city where all the criminals roam free. Joker catches batman and infects him with the titan virus and plus Hugo Strange wants to iniciate a plan called protocol 10. So Batman must stop Hugo Strange and get the cure for himselff. The gameplay is similar to the first game with the addition of new gadgets that can make up for a good time. Also this time there are side quests to be completed and Riddler trophies to be found. This game is a better game than the first for sure if you have the money you need to get this i give Batman arham city 10/10Now the Dlc Harleys quinns revenge. This dlc takes place after the events of Arham city and you play as Robin on the travel to find out what happend to batman. This is a great story pack for batman arham city and its fun as hell and Robin is a badass in this one so overall a great piece of content i give this dlc a 8/10			"

												This is my first review for a steam game as I only like to review games if they are either really, really bad or really, really good. As you can probably tell by the thumb up, this game is really, really good! Some reviewers are complaining that the game doesn't run well or keeps crashing on them but with my play through of the main story the game only let me down twice due to it crashing. This only happened from about 5 minutes in on the game and was probably caused from myself running multiple applications in the background. Arkham City is probably my favourite Batman game, alongside Arkham Knight (which I have 100% twice now with all achievements on Xbox one) and I wish to 100% this game too, once I bring myself to the fact that I have to collect all of those damn riddler trophies! Please just buy this game and play it!!			"

												Batman: Arkham City builds upon the intense, atmospheric foundation of Batman: Arkham Asylum, sending players soaring into Arkham City, the new maximum security home for all of Gotham City's thugs, gangsters and insane criminal masterminds.Set inside the heavily fortified walls of a sprawling district in the heart of Gotham City, this highly anticipated sequel introduces a brand-new story that draws together a new all-star cast of classic characters and murderous villains from the Batman universe, as well as a vast range of new and enhanced gameplay features to deliver the ultimate experience as the Dark Knight.

												In general I think Batman games are underrated.  Given this, I really want to stress how fun it is.  This reminds me of a mix between portal (strategy part) and a normal fps (like half life).  This is definitely not the best game I have ever played, but it is really different and if you have a little extra money, you should invest.			"

												Batman Arkham City is way better than its predecessor. The gameplay mechanics has been improved, the combat system has been refined, and it's pretty hard if you play it on the max difficulty. The villains are very characterized, and the story is great (I loved the gothic atmosphere). The world is not huge, but you're free to explore it between the main missions. From a technical point of view the game is just amazing. I'd definitely recommend to buy this game.			"

												Its a batman game of course its gonna be awesome and the best Arkham game out of the series!Why you ask well lets get started the first thing that I like is that you dont just play as batman(Bruce Wayne).You can play as Robin,Nightwing,Batmanand Catwoman in the game.The story was really great and starts off early in the game with Joker poisoning you.As you may know in Batman Arkham Asylum Joker injects himself with titan but Batman ends up beating him.He overdosed on it so he got Poisoned.If you are a big batman fan like me GET this game.It comes with all the dlc and has hours of gameplay if you dont think so look at how much hours I have 9/10 its even on mac!I do recommend Batman Arkham Origins but there are a lot of game breaking glitches.Batman Arkham City is my favorite game of all time!!!!!!

												If you've never read the comics, imagine if they rewrote 90s Animated Batman for an adult age group, where you play as Christopher Nolan Batman, with all the kickass gadgets, Assassin's Creed type combat, and an inFamous type sandbox world and upgrade system. That's this game in a nutshell, fully worth it at any price, especially discounted.			"

												Absolutely superb. An open-world game where you play as Batman, to start. Absolutely FANTASTIC writing, wonderful voice acting, with Mark Hamil returning to voice the Joker... Graphics are the best use of the Unreal Engine I've seen, gameplay is quite good, and there's a LOT of it... Buy this game.			"

												The epic, soaring music. The arguably greatest graphics of the year. The predictably stellar voice acting, but with a particularly perverse performance by Mark Hamill as the Joker and especially enjoyable take by Nolan North on the Penguin. The menus filled with bonus short stories that address any questions you might have assumed were left unanswered. The Riddler’s Revenge mode that challenges you to clear a room of enemies using specific equipment or strategy. The clever little choices, like having the Bat signal be your custom waypoint marker. Even the bosses are cool this time.Batman: Arkham Asylum was the greatest superhero game of all time. The sequel, Batman: Arkham City, is five times bigger and about a billion times better. You do the math. "

												It's a great Batman story and it's a great game. I don't know why I ignored it for so long.The combat feels like some cinematic beat em up. I initially found it a bit simple, but it gets more and more varied as the game goes on and by the end you feel like a total badass Batman as you beat the crap out of hordes of Arkham inmates.The longer you can dish out punishment without taking a hit yourself, the more XP and rewards you get. The result are fights that feel not just satisfying, but seriously fun as well. Though stealth is also a viable and encouraged option too.Being Batman, there's a ton of gadgets you use to advance through the game and solve Riddler puzzles that are scattered like completionist crack all over the city. These puzzles break up the combat in a nice way, and together with the side-missions, form a great open world.The devs not only seem very up on their Batman mythology, they also managed to get the actors from The Animated Series to lend their voices to the game. The result is an experience that feels right, feels like a Batman game should, and is thoroughly addictive.			"

												Objectively the best western action game ever made.The core gameplay is compromised of a simple but excellent combat system, a very active and satisfying stealth system, and some very decent platforming aspects that make movement feel fluid and interesting.The combat system is built around hitting enemies with combos and countering and dodging their attacks. Eventually, once you get your combo multiplier up to a high enough point you'll be able to do a powerful combo move, like one that stuns a whole group of enemies, or another that you can use to instantly knock out a single enemy. Or, you can save your combo multiplier and get it even higher in order to benefit from a passive buff to your attack and movement speed, allowing you to tear through entire clusters of enemies if you're good enough. While the core combat is relatively simple, a lot of depth is added to it by the gadget system. The player is given 12 gadgets to use, and they all have at least one role in both combat and sneaking, and many are even useful for general exploration. Proper use of gadgets can make or break fights in this game.On the topic of sneaking, Arkham City is also a very good stealth game. The stealth gameplay is both engaging and difficult, and the player will never find a moment where they are left without something to do in a stealth scenario. The speed of it, combined with the utility of gadgets and the neatly implemented detection and noise mechanics provide the stealth with a very high skill ceiling, and plenty of space for the player to master and exploit advanced mechanics.Usually, stealth and combat encounters are clearly segregated, however there are points in the game where the player can make a decision between either as they see fit. This ties in to the free-form nature of the game. Arkham City is a sandbox game, and a very good one at that. The entire map is open to the player from the get-go, with the player free to explore, fight and do side-missions as they see fit.On top of the quality of the core gameplay, Arkham City also has loads upon loads of content. The main story itself lasted me well over 30-40 hours, and it's got very good replay value given the caliber of the gameplay and the open-ended nature of the game. Besides the main story, there is also a very large amount of challenges for each character, in both combat and stealth varieties, truly pushing players to their limits in all aspects of the gameplay. There's four (that's right, four) playable characters, each with their own gadgets, combos and challenges, and there's also an (albeit poor) official DLC extension to the game's story.Speaking of story, Arkham City's plot and writing are pretty good. Many famous Batman characters are given roles in the game, everything makes sense and is in-character, and there are even a few interesting twists at points. The game even pays very good homage to classic Batman characters and media, such as with the costume pack that includes costumes from classic Batman entries like Batman Beyond and The Dark Knight Returns, and the heaps upon heaps of backstory provided for characters and locations within Gotham.The game also exceeds in almost every other aspect. The soundtrack is atmospheric and fitting, even dynamic, matching the gameplay. The graphics are very advanced, with detail including visible snowflakes on your character's body. The artstyle (and architecture) is a very excellent combination of staple entries in the Batman franchise. Even the voice acting is top-notch, with performances by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, among others.Overall, Batman: Arkham City is easily one of the best games I've ever played, and I'd go as far as to say that it may be one of the best games ever made. Also, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, dat cat♥♥♥♥♥			"

												After Arkham Asylum here comes the next entry of the franchise: Arkham City.Exchanging the confined spaces of Arkham for a big part of Gotham City, you play again as Batman (and Catwoman, once in a while) to punch and kick bad buys to the face. Mostly. There's also some other stuff involved, but it really boils down to punching and kicking, which, again, feels absolutely great.An absolutely worthy sequel to the hit Arkham Asylum, Batman takes on Arkham City and all who dwell in it. Once again you can use lots of cool stuff, fight bad dudes and solve crime. Again a fanatastic looking game with yet even more fantastic voice actors (Hamill takes the cake again, though)!Be Vengeance. Be the Night. Be BATMAN!			"

												Batman: Arkham City is an another amazing Arkham game with more villains then ever! The gameplay is the same as Arkham Asylum with a few other differences, like different gadgets.Arkham City is part of Gotham transformed into a whole 'city' for criminals, like The Joker, Two-Face, Mr Freeze and many, many more, and it's your job as Batman to help everyone after a terrible 'event' occurs. I having played Arkham Origins and part of Arkham Asylum have to say that it is arguably the greatest of the 3.A true must-buy for any Batman fan and even if you're not a fan, then you'll still enjoy it just the same.

												Story: With Batman: Arkham Knight on it's way, what better way to prepare than review one of the best, if not the best, superhero games out there. Batman: Arkham City is a direct fallow up to Arkham Asylum, where the Mayor of Gotham, with the help of Dr.Hugo Strange, have opened up Arkham City. A section of Gotham walled up and made into a prison with some of Batmans most challenging villains. Bruce Wayne inevitibly gets thrown into Arkham City and must uncover the conspericy of what ""Protacal 10"" is.Gameplay: If you played Arkham City, it's a very well updated version of that. The combat and stealth mechanics are what make this game one of the most replayable story games, as you dodge, kick, punch, and glide through Arkham City and its inmates. Another popular feature is the Detective Mode, in which you examine a crime scene to find your next objective. It helps move everything along at a nice pace. That being said, Arkham City is free roam, allowing you to grapple to the top of the Church and soar over The Sionis Factory, with various side missions avalible.Soundtrack: One of the most badass soundtracks ever. Even the main menu has an epic theme.9/10Go buy it, the DLC isn't half bad either.			"

												The game is much the same as Arkham City, just with the added central hub of Arkham City to play around with. Though the core of the game is exactly the same, just with a few added gadgets, i feel the game isn't quite as good as the first. Combat is generally as fluent as ever but the camera loves to swing around a lot during the big fights which results in you attacking the wrong thug more than you would like to. The exploration becomes really repetitive very quickly, the game has you returning to the same spots a good few times and just changes it up slightly. Though i wanted to progress, i really couldn't be bothered going over the same territiory again and just getting into the same fights with just bigger mobs of thugs. I also mainly like to stay in detective mode and this game just pulls you out of it all the time...really bothered me after a while.Great game but can get boring real quick and doesn't quite capture the same feel as the first game.

												I don't know why it took me so long to buy this game, but this is not a regrettable purchase. The combat is fluid, the story, while getting a bit ridiculous at parts, is interesting, OMG I love the predator sections, and the challenge maps only add to experience. If you played Arkham Asylum, this game is an improvement in almost every form. If you like to challenge yourself to an intense degree, then the addition of Robin and Nightwing and their new challenge maps will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor, and buy this game. 11/10			"

												Arkham Asylum was objectively a masterpiece as far as previous Batman games before it and even superhero games in general are concerned, but Arkham City successfully managed to expand and improve on the game changer that was Arkham Asylum.Complete with a enourmous and gritty open world, 400+ riddler challenges, 200+ challenge medals to obtain, suprisingly interesting and intriguing side missions and a great main story, there's just a whole lot more to do in this game than in the first. Replayability is massive, voice performances are stellar, main story is great and the combat is better than the great combat system of Arkham Asylum.This is definitely in my top 5 games of the 2000s, you'll like it if you're not a Batfan, you'll love it if you're a casual Batfan, and you will adore it if you're a hardcore Batfan.10/10			"

												Personally my favourite of the Arkham series. A fun to traverse open world and a tight combat system. Despite not being a Batman fan I really enjoyed seeing all the characters and reading up their bios. Playing as Catwoman is quite interesting too and has some similarities to Batman yet plays like her own character.Plenty of things to do in the game and there is even a tonne of challanges to do as Batman, Catwoman and Robin.Also to take advantage of the costumes without having to beat the game first, when you are on the main menu press ""Left, Left, Down, Down, Left, Left, Right, Up, Up, Down"". You should hear a swarm of bats and be able to select costumes when selecting continue. you have to do this each time you load up the game.			"

												Now this is a really fun game. There were massive improvements here ahead of the last game where now you are in a much bigger location and many more villains appear as well as having more unique fights with them such as with Mr Freeze and so on. many which make you think hard about tackling the boss.the ending was one hell of a surprise, but it suited the series down to a T as well. the combat has also been improved and the story is very interesting. I do miss Scarecrow though and how he'd poison you subtly giving you all those messed up visions in the first game, but still. Game is a hell of a lot of fun.			"

												Very worth it as it includes all of the DLC so you don't even have to buy all of it!!!> Game isn't just combo wombos and has huge stealth-like missions and brain thinking puzzles> Side-missions aren't super boring and has you searching around the city because sometimes its not on the map> Nice combat mechanics and has you jumping 10 feet to another enemy like The Flash > Allows you to stray off of the main-mission and you can just roam around beating crap upOverall I rate 9/10 due to how annoying it is to die and go over some cutscenes over and over and over			"

												I love the game, the visual, the story, everything as I'm basically a fan of Marvel, Batman the most! The negative side of the game is, they need to be saved before playing the game, and it needs larger memory space, I think seems to be similar to TOMB RIDER capacity. when you've just got limited memory space, then the being saved loading is very awful, I mean took so long, as a result I turned off my PC manually and Dang it!! my PC's got annoying problems which had to be restored for a couple of times as they're crashed. Once I played, the PC got crashed. Hell! I can't play the game and I have bought a month ago. GREAT!The positive side is, who doesn't like Batman? Marvel stuffs?? the visual, chapters, quests are unquestionably interesting!			"

												Story: With Batman: Arkham Knight on it's way, what better way to prepare than review one of the best, if not the best, superhero games out there. Batman: Arkham City is a direct fallow up to Arkham Asylum, where the Mayor of Gotham, with the help of Dr.Hugo Strange, have opened up Arkham City. A section of Gotham walled up and made into a prison with some of Batmans most challenging villains. Bruce Wayne inevitibly gets thrown into Arkham City and must uncover the conspericy of what ""Protacal 10"" is.Gameplay: If you played Arkham City, it's a very well updated version of that. The combat and stealth mechanics are what make this game one of the most replayable story games, as you dodge, kick, punch, and glide through Arkham City and its inmates. Another popular feature is the Detective Mode, in which you examine a crime scene to find your next objective. It helps move everything along at a nice pace. That being said, Arkham City is free roam, allowing you to grapple to the top of the Church and soar over The Sionis Factory, with various side missions avalible.Soundtrack: One of the most badass soundtracks ever. Even the main menu has an epic theme.9/10Go buy it, the DLC isn't half bad either.			"

												It's a great Batman story and it's a great game. I don't know why I ignored it for so long.The combat feels like some cinematic beat em up. I initially found it a bit simple, but it gets more and more varied as the game goes on and by the end you feel like a total badass Batman as you beat the crap out of hordes of Arkham inmates.The longer you can dish out punishment without taking a hit yourself, the more XP and rewards you get. The result are fights that feel not just satisfying, but seriously fun as well. Though stealth is also a viable and encouraged option too.Being Batman, there's a ton of gadgets you use to advance through the game and solve Riddler puzzles that are scattered like completionist crack all over the city. These puzzles break up the combat in a nice way, and together with the side-missions, form a great open world.The devs not only seem very up on their Batman mythology, they also managed to get the actors from The Animated Series to lend their voices to the game. The result is an experience that feels right, feels like a Batman game should, and is thoroughly addictive.			"

												One of the greatest open-world action and adventure games ever created. It follows a brilliant plot with equally thrilling characters. It has a fully fledged world filled to the brim with collectables and secrets. The gameplay is crafted to perfection, fixing any slight flaws from the first game and adding new features to the second. Every fight, moment and cutscene feels alive and unique. The voice acting, graphics and all the aesthetics to the game are superb, giving it a clear advantage above stock standard games. It is, in my opinion, one of the most fufilling open-world games to date.			"

												Objectively the best western action game ever made.The core gameplay is compromised of a simple but excellent combat system, a very active and satisfying stealth system, and some very decent platforming aspects that make movement feel fluid and interesting.The combat system is built around hitting enemies with combos and countering and dodging their attacks. Eventually, once you get your combo multiplier up to a high enough point you'll be able to do a powerful combo move, like one that stuns a whole group of enemies, or another that you can use to instantly knock out a single enemy. Or, you can save your combo multiplier and get it even higher in order to benefit from a passive buff to your attack and movement speed, allowing you to tear through entire clusters of enemies if you're good enough. While the core combat is relatively simple, a lot of depth is added to it by the gadget system. The player is given 12 gadgets to use, and they all have at least one role in both combat and sneaking, and many are even useful for general exploration. Proper use of gadgets can make or break fights in this game.On the topic of sneaking, Arkham City is also a very good stealth game. The stealth gameplay is both engaging and difficult, and the player will never find a moment where they are left without something to do in a stealth scenario. The speed of it, combined with the utility of gadgets and the neatly implemented detection and noise mechanics provide the stealth with a very high skill ceiling, and plenty of space for the player to master and exploit advanced mechanics.Usually, stealth and combat encounters are clearly segregated, however there are points in the game where the player can make a decision between either as they see fit. This ties in to the free-form nature of the game. Arkham City is a sandbox game, and a very good one at that. The entire map is open to the player from the get-go, with the player free to explore, fight and do side-missions as they see fit.On top of the quality of the core gameplay, Arkham City also has loads upon loads of content. The main story itself lasted me well over 30-40 hours, and it's got very good replay value given the caliber of the gameplay and the open-ended nature of the game. Besides the main story, there is also a very large amount of challenges for each character, in both combat and stealth varieties, truly pushing players to their limits in all aspects of the gameplay. There's four (that's right, four) playable characters, each with their own gadgets, combos and challenges, and there's also an (albeit poor) official DLC extension to the game's story.Speaking of story, Arkham City's plot and writing are pretty good. Many famous Batman characters are given roles in the game, everything makes sense and is in-character, and there are even a few interesting twists at points. The game even pays very good homage to classic Batman characters and media, such as with the costume pack that includes costumes from classic Batman entries like Batman Beyond and The Dark Knight Returns, and the heaps upon heaps of backstory provided for characters and locations within Gotham.The game also exceeds in almost every other aspect. The soundtrack is atmospheric and fitting, even dynamic, matching the gameplay. The graphics are very advanced, with detail including visible snowflakes on your character's body. The artstyle (and architecture) is a very excellent combination of staple entries in the Batman franchise. Even the voice acting is top-notch, with performances by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, among others.Overall, Batman: Arkham City is easily one of the best games I've ever played, and I'd go as far as to say that it may be one of the best games ever made. Also, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, dat cat♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Arkham Asylum was objectively a masterpiece as far as previous Batman games before it and even superhero games in general are concerned, but Arkham City successfully managed to expand and improve on the game changer that was Arkham Asylum.Complete with a enourmous and gritty open world, 400+ riddler challenges, 200+ challenge medals to obtain, suprisingly interesting and intriguing side missions and a great main story, there's just a whole lot more to do in this game than in the first. Replayability is massive, voice performances are stellar, main story is great and the combat is better than the great combat system of Arkham Asylum.This is definitely in my top 5 games of the 2000s, you'll like it if you're not a Batfan, you'll love it if you're a casual Batfan, and you will adore it if you're a hardcore Batfan.10/10			"

												First, if you haven't played arkham asylum then do so before playing arkham city.This game takes Rocksteady's vision of Batman to the next level. We got all the cinematic glory of a true Batman game in Arkham Asylum and now we get a full feature series incarnation in Arkham City. This game should be played over the course of weeks to absorb all the incredible gems both in the story and homages to the Batman universe. Rocksteady is clearly staffed with many true fans who wanted fans to find easter eggs everywhere.This shows in the craftsmanship and level design. Every building, npc dialogue and story event is credible and feels like a real plot device in the Tim Burton movies. Thanks to the larger map, Rocksteady has created the most immersing experience of superhero flight and gliding. No doubt their interpretation of the grappling hook could be used in any other superhero game design. Already the Rocksteady vision for combat and story telling has been copied in countless games including Mad Max and we will see it for at least a full decade.This game is the ultimate fusion of movie and game, a living contribution to the DC corpus and one of my favourite games in my entire life.

												For a game to define a genre is one of the highest acheivements a game can accomplish, in my opinion. Batman Arkham City does just that. With a revolutionizing combat system that I can't get enough of and the slower, more puzzle-like predator mode - Rocksteady knew what they were doing. While this is arguably one of the best Batman stories told to date, this does not mean you have to love Batman to love this game,The soundtrack, the characters, the brawling combat system, the predator combat system, the story, and the good 'ol Gotham City atmosphere are all reasons to love this game.And one top of that - Kevin Conroy's and Mark Hamill's voice acting talents are without comparison to any other. Hamill's performance as the Clown Prince of Crime easily makes this Joker one of my favorites.11/10 easily - no doubtStop reading this and play this game			"

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Just if the crazy 3rd person camera wasn't so messy, this game would be a master piece.To be honest, I hate Batman's comic and, even Batman's films but, this game is a really good one!.Movements of Batman and Catwoman are awesome. Funny action, variated combos, nice acrobacies.I even prefer Catwoman to Batman, her movements are perfect and, she can hung from ceil also.Story is bit simple, as usual in Batman stuff but, the game itself is awesome.Imagine the freedom of exploration of Assassin's Creed, acrobacies of Prince of Persia and, several layers of game in one.You alternative play with Batman or Catwoman (meaw, what a kitty). There is some of puzzle, there is some of arcade action, smashing everyone, some nice gadgets, some of stealth, some of attack planning, some of RPG (experience earning to change for enhancements). Well, it has everything that builds a solid and funny game.I would suggest to developers to create a game dedicated just to Catwoman. She's awesomely characterized and plays like heaven.I wasn't expecting too much from this game but, I am greatefully surprised. I am loving it.POSITIVE SIDE:Graphics, Map s (huge) and Level design.Characters, and this includes all ""bad boys"" which are very well characterized.Interesting story board, with high variety of ""bad boys"" and, interesting combat challeges.Fluid movements of Batman and (specially) Catwoman.Several parallel games or challenges and side quests, which bring you a lot of hours of playing.Alternativelly playing with Batman and Catwoman. Really interesting.The curve of learning is nice and, every step gives you a new gadget or combo which makes your character everytime more powerfull (as well as the enemies).Situations were you have to remove a bunch of armored enemies using stealthing technics is awesome. Hunging your batman and silently neutralizing one by one.Gadgets (even that takes a while to master them).Awesome voice location, nice interpretation, very film like.NEGATIVE SIDE:Weird behavior of camera on this kind of 3rd person games. Usually not a mess, until you fight on a narrow space then, you can completely loss control on your character.Remote controlled batrang. This is a real mess the whole game. Flying controls are so abrupt, that it's quite well impossible to drive your batrang in the good way.Being a non-linear game, you can feel sometimes lost and, having not clear idea on what to do.Puzzles are somewhat impossible with these uncontrolled controls.Once again, controls. This makes difficult to hack computers and door locks.I still didn't find Freeze's woman!.Side quests aren't clear. You don't know what to do next, most of times.BALANCEBut, honestly, even with those flaws that can be sometimes frustrating, this is a HUGE game, with lot of fun and, great hours of playing. Re-playable, with all the gadgets and stronger enemies.			"

												I bought this game after playing Arkham Asylum with high expectations. I was not disappointed. A reasonably sized open world in comparison to Asylum, more enemies, a better story, superb fighting mechanics and The Bat. It takes everything that made Asylum such a great game and somehow makes it even better.			"

												This is a game in which you really feel like Batman. Just gliding around a walled prison city waiting to break some limbs. The damage Batman does, you pretty much kill them. Fine with me. The story is really good, and you really feel like you get to know Batman. For gameplay, you might be beating up a gang of well, gangsters, and making them wish they were never born one minute. The next, you're in a museum or church, sneaking around armed thugs, taking them out silently, one by one. Many iconic Batman characters appear, like Commisioner Gordon, Joker, and Two-Face, with a cast of lesser-known characters, like Jack Ryder, Azrael, and Ra's al Ghul. Small spoiler, but in the last boss battle against Clayface, Batman uses a SWORD. The DLCs provide tons of replayability, with challenge maps, skins, and even story content. Playable characters are expanded to include Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing. This stealth/combat/open world game is definetly worth buying.			"

Batman: Arkham CityThis is the best stealth and combat game I have ever played!!! The open world of Gotham is beautifully well done, Mark Hamill as the Joker is still amazing, Batman: Arkham City is the best one in the Arkham Series passing Asylum.Rocksteady did a great work developing this game, the flying in the game is great, the stealth, the combat, the music, the villains, the city, and batman himself.ConclusionVery fun to play after you beat the game and you even can repeat with all your gadgets but just harder, definetly the greatest Batman games.

BackstoryBatman is incarcerated in Arkham City, he must uncover the secret behind the sinister scheme, ""Protocol 10"", orchestrated by the facility's warden, Hugo Strange.InformationAt the time that you may be reading this you may think to yourself ""Isn't this a really old game"" or ""i swear i heard of the game ages ago"" well you are infact right that this games is getting on abit now in terms of it's age and you may be right if you have played this game before, on whatever that platform you played it on may be.Well i'm here to tell you that you should definatly check this game out or revisit it 100%. This game is so much fun not only if you are into games based on the comic books, movies, TV shows etc. or if you are a fan of open world games with a variety of quests to do and a lot of collectibles to be collecting THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!Pick this game up and you won't be able to put the controller down or take your hands off of the keyboard and mouse. Trust me, you won't regret it.Pros:- Fighting mechanics are great, super cool and really entertaining - Voice actors for characters such as Batman, Catwomen and Joker are amazing- The storyline is really easy to follow, interesting and emersive- The gadgets and weapons are EPIC- The DLC's that are available with the GOTY Edition are awesome- To run this game you do not need a s high-spec system meaning its good for budget gamers- Did I also mention that the Joker is voiced by Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker)Cons:- Dialogue from characters like the goons/henchmen is often repeated due to lack of lines- There are only a few voice actors for the goons/henchmen making the lines and voices stale Want my opinion in numbers? - 8/10I hope this review helped you, Game on & Stay Awesome			"

												I recommend this game to any Batman fan, and any fan of good games. It has great characters, amazing gameplay and a really interesting story. While not necessary to enjoy this game, I would say that you should play Arkham Asylum first, its another amazing game just smaller in scale, and with Arkham Knight on its way you might as play the full trilogy (you can give origins a miss). It would run really well on most systems build for gaming. "

												I had a problem first that didn't let me to start the story. But as that was fixed, I played this game and I loved it. *Jim Carrey voice* :I LIKE IT A LOT. Every single thing that made Batman: Arkham Asylum a great game is even improved in Arkham City. The world is much, much, much bigger than Arkham Asylum and there are whole lot of new things to do. Lets do Pros and Cons:Pros:-Amazing Story. AMAZING. FASCINATING. REMARKABLE.-Great graphics. I personally think that the graphics are better than Arkham Origins in this game.-Smooth frame rate. If you guys think that Rocksteady ruins games with bad frame rate, well you haven't played this! The frame rate of Arkham Knight may be bad but Arkham City is truly remarkable.-GREAT. VOICE . ACTING. Especially Mark Hamill.-A big and exciting Arkham City waiting to be discovered. -Great side-missions. I haven't had time to finish them all but all of them are very good.-Did I mention Mark Hamill?-That's...pretty FUNNY! *cries quietly* *tries not to cry* *cries even louder*Cons:-Nothing major. Final Verdict:100/100AMAZING REMARKABLE FASCINATINGJUST BUY IT ALRADY			"

												Arkham Asylum was objectively a masterpiece as far as previous Batman games before it and even superhero games in general are concerned, but Arkham City successfully managed to expand and improve on the game changer that was Arkham Asylum.Complete with a enourmous and gritty open world, 400+ riddler challenges, 200+ challenge medals to obtain, suprisingly interesting and intriguing side missions and a great main story, there's just a whole lot more to do in this game than in the first. Replayability is massive, voice performances are stellar, main story is great and the combat is better than the great combat system of Arkham Asylum.This is definitely in my top 5 games of the 2000s, you'll like it if you're not a Batfan, you'll love it if you're a casual Batfan, and you will adore it if you're a hardcore Batfan.10/10			"

												First, if you haven't played arkham asylum then do so before playing arkham city.This game takes Rocksteady's vision of Batman to the next level. We got all the cinematic glory of a true Batman game in Arkham Asylum and now we get a full feature series incarnation in Arkham City. This game should be played over the course of weeks to absorb all the incredible gems both in the story and homages to the Batman universe. Rocksteady is clearly staffed with many true fans who wanted fans to find easter eggs everywhere.This shows in the craftsmanship and level design. Every building, npc dialogue and story event is credible and feels like a real plot device in the Tim Burton movies. Thanks to the larger map, Rocksteady has created the most immersing experience of superhero flight and gliding. No doubt their interpretation of the grappling hook could be used in any other superhero game design. Already the Rocksteady vision for combat and story telling has been copied in countless games including Mad Max and we will see it for at least a full decade.This game is the ultimate fusion of movie and game, a living contribution to the DC corpus and one of my favourite games in my entire life.

												For a game to define a genre is one of the highest acheivements a game can accomplish, in my opinion. Batman Arkham City does just that. With a revolutionizing combat system that I can't get enough of and the slower, more puzzle-like predator mode - Rocksteady knew what they were doing. While this is arguably one of the best Batman stories told to date, this does not mean you have to love Batman to love this game,The soundtrack, the characters, the brawling combat system, the predator combat system, the story, and the good 'ol Gotham City atmosphere are all reasons to love this game.And one top of that - Kevin Conroy's and Mark Hamill's voice acting talents are without comparison to any other. Hamill's performance as the Clown Prince of Crime easily makes this Joker one of my favorites.11/10 easily - no doubtStop reading this and play this game			"

												I find it suprising that Batman Arkham City has less reviews(meaning less buys technically) than Batman Arkham Knight on Steam, which goes to show you that people like to be treated mean to keep them keen :DBatman: Arkham City is faultless, simply astounding, and a great port, i am tempted to give Arkham Knight a chance considering it's on a sale at the moment.Late late late review, but buy this game!

												This is the best superhero game hands down. If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum, you will LOVE this game. It takes everything that was great in Arkham and just makes it better. I highly recommend purchasing this game. This is the only superhero game that I've played that actually makes you feel like the actual superhero. Good job Rocksteady.Pros:-Awesome graphics-Awesome soundtrack-Awesome voice acting-Open city to roam-Awesome storyCons:- wish there were more side missions?- boob physics could be better			"

Batman: Arkham City Pros & Cons ReviewPros1: Masterly written storyline, characters, and encounters weave together an addicting game that foreshadows things to come for the Dark Knight.2: New Gameplay Mechanics, Gadgets, and Upgrades ratchets the bar higher in every way possible from its predecessor.3: Riddler Challenge Rooms brings something new to the table; collecting trophies and solving environmental riddles are present but it’s the Challenge Rooms that steal the show.Cons1: Catwoman’s chapters are too short and simple; it would have been nice to flush out her experiences in Arkham City during the course of the overall story.2: More story expanding DLC would have been nice; especially after getting a savory taste of Robin in Harley Quinn’s Revenge DLC.3: Alternate character skins are nice and nostalgic but the feeling doesn’t last long; special suit effects would have made this content more enjoyable.Downloadable Content ReviewHarley Quinn's RevengePro: Harley Quinn's Revenge is a testament to what DLC should strive to achieve in terms of story.Con: Unfortunately, this DLC comes to its conclusion rather quickly and leaves you wishing for more.Overall: 10/10My Thoughts on Batman: Arkham City,Arkham City takes everything Asylum got right and turned it up to 11! More Riddles, Bosses, and Encounters make for one amazing game with tones more to enjoy. Exploring Arkham City in search of trophies isn’t just to help boost your XP it also unlocks access to Challenge Rooms where you must use your wits to solve physical challenges in hopes of saving hostages. Fighting Bosses isn’t new to the Arkhamvers but the real millstone is the encounter with Mr. Freeze; each takedown performed can’t be repeated, forcing you to use gadgets, environment, and techniques you may not have otherwise considered. Adding to these memorable boss fights are randomly generated encounters with Political Prisoners as well as scripted encounters with new threats whose presence unlocks new Side Quests.The negative points while few and far in-between do still need to be addressed. For one, while boss fights are fun and exciting they can feel underwhelming and at times shoehorned into a game. The latter isn’t true of Arkham City but the former is… Bosses like Catwomen’s fight with Two-Face is anticlimactic to her story arc. Same is true of Robins showdown with Harley Quinn near the end of her DLC; only difference is Quinn has hostages that could be held at gunpoint by some random thug during the course of the fight.Overall Batman: Arkham City is a sequel that doesn’t just deliver the enjoyment from Arkham Asylum it perfects it and it’s guaranteed to see you returning to the streets of Gotham and striking fear into the hearts of Joker, Penguin, Two-Face, and any thug unlucky enough to cross paths with the Dark Knight.-SPARTAN 117 B01			"

												A fun brawler.Taking the role of Batman (and Catwoman), you get to explore an open city and beat up thugs in a rhythmic battle system, using a variety of tools. The story is, initially, much more dire than is predecessor, which is further complimented by the cast Batman must face. The addition of collectables and riddles further add to the experience.However, even with the many weapons you are given, it doesn't mix things up too much, and combat can get stale (save for a certain boss and Challenge Mode). The city environment, once you are used to it, ends up being an eyesore. The plot does take an abrupt turn at a certain point, and the additional DLC, while nice (and free), add little to what's already offered.If you enjoy beat-em-ups, or Batman, you'll find Arkham City to be an enjoyable romp. Worth the price, and a definite buy when on sale.			"

												RockSteady's 2nd offering in the continuation of the Batman franchise and I must say it was a great one to say the least. I was glad Conroy and Hamill returned to voice their in-game counterparts again for this one (there was a a bit of a rumor they wouldn't of course). The dangers increase this time around since the size of the area Batman is allowed to roam in increases in size but he also gets a few new toys to play with also. I really enjoyed getting catwoman as a playable character in this one and you actually have to her to get through some specific parts of the game. Just another well-made game by RockSteady to pick up (on sale of course) if you haven't already done so.			"

												Batman Arkham City is a great game with a nice combat mechanic, but the ending... DAT ENDING. It is... just sad. Not sad in the sense that it sucks, but (SPOILER BLOCKED).After you beat the game, you can still play and complete side missions or just assault random thugs like the good crime fighter you are. There is also switching with Catwoman, which, I must say, is a nice touch.Arkham City is not a good game, it's a great game. I can't find much fault with it. And so I really recommend it.			"

												Personally my favourite of the Arkham series. A fun to traverse open world and a tight combat system. Despite not being a Batman fan I really enjoyed seeing all the characters and reading up their bios. Playing as Catwoman is quite interesting too and has some similarities to Batman yet plays like her own character.Plenty of things to do in the game and there is even a tonne of challanges to do as Batman, Catwoman and Robin.Also to take advantage of the costumes without having to beat the game first, when you are on the main menu press ""Left, Left, Down, Down, Left, Left, Right, Up, Up, Down"". You should hear a swarm of bats and be able to select costumes when selecting continue. you have to do this each time you load up the game.			"

BackstoryBatman is incarcerated in Arkham City, he must uncover the secret behind the sinister scheme, ""Protocol 10"", orchestrated by the facility's warden, Hugo Strange.InformationAt the time that you may be reading this you may think to yourself ""Isn't this a really old game"" or ""i swear i heard of the game ages ago"" well you are infact right that this games is getting on abit now in terms of it's age and you may be right if you have played this game before, on whatever that platform you played it on may be.Well i'm here to tell you that you should definatly check this game out or revisit it 100%. This game is so much fun not only if you are into games based on the comic books, movies, TV shows etc. or if you are a fan of open world games with a variety of quests to do and a lot of collectibles to be collecting THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!Pick this game up and you won't be able to put the controller down or take your hands off of the keyboard and mouse. Trust me, you won't regret it.Pros:- Fighting mechanics are great, super cool and really entertaining - Voice actors for characters such as Batman, Catwomen and Joker are amazing- The storyline is really easy to follow, interesting and emersive- The gadgets and weapons are EPIC- The DLC's that are available with the GOTY Edition are awesome- To run this game you do not need a s high-spec system meaning its good for budget gamers- Did I also mention that the Joker is voiced by Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker)Cons:- Dialogue from characters like the goons/henchmen is often repeated due to lack of lines- There are only a few voice actors for the goons/henchmen making the lines and voices stale Want my opinion in numbers? - 8/10I hope this review helped you, Game on & Stay Awesome			"

												Arkham City is exactly what you want in a sequel - bigger and better. Although the size of the city can be daunting at times, the games' seamless offering is worth far more than the price. Rocksteady took their formula for Arkham Asylum and ramped everything up to 11 in delivering this game. More impressive, though, is the fact that while there's is more of everything, everything has its place. There are more characters, but the characters fit nicely into the world and the story and aren't shoehorned in. The city is big, but everything detailed and put to use. The Riddler puzzles are accompanied by many other side missions, most of which are well thought-out and applied in such a way that isn't superfluous. My only gripe is that the DLC was kind of pointless and offered little on top of the base game. But that's really by the by when the base game is so large and you don't have to purchase the DLC. Therefore I have no grips. Arkham City is one of the most polished and entertaining offerings you can hope to buy at this point in time.			"

Well despite it not being very well optimized it's still a fun game, it runs well enough and if you aren't a graphics junkey then it's a great title to pick up, if you are new to the Arkham universe i would say you can skip the original and still understand this story, It's a little bit of fun, i return to it every so often to punch bad guys in the face because it's fun, overall i give the game a solid 7/10			"

												Absolutley amazing game.(Sequel to Batman: Arkham Asylum.)-Awesome Story line. I was entertainted the entire time I was playing this game.(At time of review 18 hours gameplay and 31% gameplay completion on Easy.) Seriously that is how long this game is!!And I still have 3 games to play to complete the trilogy!-Adictive gameplay. So many gadgets you can use to get in and around your objectives.-A lot to do.(Like seriously there is so many things to do you are never bored. Even flying around building to building is fun.)I recommend this game 100%. (But play the first game before the 3rd like me according to story line xD)If I had to rate the game I would give it a 9.99 outta 10. "

												Definitely one of the best gaming experiences of its time.This is the first game that made me go ""woah"" the first time I played it. The combat, the gliding, the characters, everything was so well put together. I never thought games could be this well narrated, especially an adaptation of a series from another medium. You really get the atmosphere you see in the comic books, the dark overtone, the creepiness of characters. The game makes use of the Teen rating given to it very well, as an M rated version of the game wouldn't make sense lore wise (specifically the series this game adapts), and respects the nature of batman very well. Play this game, you will not be disappointed in the slightest.			"

												Well to honestly admit I had never heard about this game pretty late when all the DLC was releasedThe soundtrack was amazing dark yet heroically epic... kind of lively but you dont really see rival gangs going at it or simply put the city being horribly alive with said atmosphere + some of the voice lines from npc are repeated. The combat system was something that got me hooked immediately I dont know how it differed from the Arkham Asylum but its still great fun even on hard mode takes a bit of getting used to but its not a visual display only game there is some depth to it! the stealth / freeflow although It does get repetative there is gadgets to play with.Interesting storyline although short even with DLC with your own custimizable costume sadly I dont think collectables are really interesting or fun to get unless youre a completionist pretty great overall			"

												This is a game in which you really feel like Batman. Just gliding around a walled prison city waiting to break some limbs. The damage Batman does, you pretty much kill them. Fine with me. The story is really good, and you really feel like you get to know Batman. For gameplay, you might be beating up a gang of well, gangsters, and making them wish they were never born one minute. The next, you're in a museum or church, sneaking around armed thugs, taking them out silently, one by one. Many iconic Batman characters appear, like Commisioner Gordon, Joker, and Two-Face, with a cast of lesser-known characters, like Jack Ryder, Azrael, and Ra's al Ghul. Small spoiler, but in the last boss battle against Clayface, Batman uses a SWORD. The DLCs provide tons of replayability, with challenge maps, skins, and even story content. Playable characters are expanded to include Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing. This stealth/combat/open world game is definetly worth buying.			"

												Returned to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City after so many years.  Combat was as fun as I remember, although the boss fights get tedious (particularly in AA, AC improved a bit).  The open world of AC means more gameplay, but the storyline itself wanders a bit.  Gliding over the city is a blast, at least for Batman.  Catwoman is fun to fight with (if limited), but god, her movement mechanism is annoying.  Harley Quinn's DLC is fun, and Robin fights like the acrobat he is.  Too bad he sees limited play even in his own DLC.  And it's a crime that you can't use him in the open world like Catwoman.That said--  my computer is better these days than when I played the original games.  But I still get cutscene crashes and lock ups when there's too many particle effects:  not a problem I remember having before.   I CNTRL-ALT-DELETE and restart my way through because I love these games so much, but my performance issues with these rereleased games were enough to keep me from buying Arkham Knight (which reportedly is even worse in that regard).Shaky thumbs up.  If you've got a state of the art rig (mine really isn't these days, but like I said, better than my old), I doubt you'll have a problem.  If you don't and you've got a console, I'd recommend playing on that instead of the PC port.			"

												Extremely well made game. Even better than Arkham Asylum. The Freeflow system seems to work much better in this one and counters are easier.A minor issue are the occasional enemies that fell through roof and are stuck in buildings. A reload of the last save solves this though. And one side mission is tied to the amounts of secrets you find and the last part requires a bit too many of the secrets to be solved. It was to grindy for me. But you can just ignore that mission.			"

												In this action-packed, superhero game, you play as THE MAN OF STEEL as he attempts to take on his most dangerous foes in the city of METROPOLIS.  Now you may be wondering how I know that you play as Superman rather than Batman, seeing as how his name is in the title.  Well, just take a look at the gameplay:  The Batman in this can SEE THROUGH WALLS, he can FLY, and he can take SEVERAL BULLETS TO THE CHEST.  These are all powers that SUPERMAN has, not Batman.  Therefore, this is the greatest Superman game of all time.			"

												Personally my favourite of the Arkham series. A fun to traverse open world and a tight combat system. Despite not being a Batman fan I really enjoyed seeing all the characters and reading up their bios. Playing as Catwoman is quite interesting too and has some similarities to Batman yet plays like her own character.Plenty of things to do in the game and there is even a tonne of challanges to do as Batman, Catwoman and Robin.Also to take advantage of the costumes without having to beat the game first, when you are on the main menu press ""Left, Left, Down, Down, Left, Left, Right, Up, Up, Down"". You should hear a swarm of bats and be able to select costumes when selecting continue. you have to do this each time you load up the game.			"

												Everyone should play this game. I love Arkham City a lot better than Arkham Asylum because of the wider approach from playing in an asylum to whole Gotham. The gameplay is amazing, the plot is interesting although not much a plot twist but really entertaining still. Playing the normal difficulty is also not that hard. All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to every Batman lover, as the character arcs in this game are just amazing.			"

												I'm not a comic geek but I'm a bigfan of the dark crusader. He has balls the size of his intelect and some women find it rather sexy.This is one of those bad console port but certainly not the worst. Since it the game initialy designed for console don't expect too much on the textures and stuffs. Even the tesselation is poorly implemented. Although the game feels more like console-ish I find this game very entertaining. Gameplay though is unique same as the previous/prequel version but due to the open world and bigger map, I would say the gameplay is much much better than the previous one.			"

												Brilliant. For a game thats based of a superhero and films, its extremely impressive. I am a person that gets bored very quickly and I find myself skipping all the cutscenes in a game so that I can get into the actual playing quicker, however in this game I was so immersed in the story and the characters so much that i would sit through all the cutscenes. The combat is great, its so much fun and you just feel so awesome how your characters kick so much♥♥♥♥♥;) A MUST buy!			"

												I enjoyed this game more than the first one. It was a little hard to get into it at first, I think I replayed the opening to the game probably 5 seperate times a few months a part each time, but when I did I couldn't stop. It was a lot of fun from start to finish. The pacing was good, and the ending was much better in my opinion than the previous. If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum you should definitely play this one.			"

												A great continuation of Arkham Asylum and what's even more great is the game is twice as big. You are no longer confined in the asylum's corridors and Arkham City opens up with a large area to explore with many side activities to do after finishing the story. Great game, but sometimes I felt overwhelmed at the scope and the vast amounts of activities to do. I'm not a fan of chasing down telephones.9/10			"

												Brilliant. For a game thats based of a superhero and films, its extremely impressive. I am a person that gets bored very quickly and I find myself skipping all the cutscenes in a game so that I can get into the actual playing quicker, however in this game I was so immersed in the story and the characters so much that i would sit through all the cutscenes. The combat is great, its so much fun and you just feel so awesome how your characters kick so much♥♥♥♥♥;) A MUST buy!			"

												Join our friend BatMan on his quest to solve his problems by punching things with his fists! Punch exciting things such as:- Criminals!- SUPER Criminals!- Ninjas!- Robots!- A Shark!At one point in the game, BatMan ditches his trusty hand-fists in favor of a sword, and the game ends shortly thereafter as the developers realized their mistake.NOTE: DLC includes two characters who use weapons instead of fists. Ignore content accordingly.			"

												Best Arkham game in my opinion. The story is super enjoyable for those who know a lot of Batman/DC lore but still easy to follow for a comic newbie. Best thirdperson combat system out there, nothing else is so smooth, brutal, or badass. GOTY edition includes extra challenge maps for when you want more of the combat after the story is done. One of my favorite games of all time.			"
