												Prince of Persia is a beautiful game and it's a lot of fun to play. The controls are simple and make all the well animated jumping and running easy to pull off. The graphics are very beautiful, almost like playing in some kind of painting.The game is rather easy, since you can never die. If you fall or miss your jump, your partner Elika will pull you back onto solid ground. If you start to lose in a battle, she will pull you to safety, knocking the enemy back. However, the enemy will regain some of it's lost health for doing so. To me, this is a really great option. Sometimes games are just meant to be fun, and not so much to provide a hardcore challange that will only end up frustrating.Combat is fun and smooth, with great attack animations. You can attack with your sword, you can grab an enemy, and you can let Elika attack. You can combo all sorts of beautiful moves together to make for an awesome fight scene. None of the bad guys should really give you too much trouble, especially since right before you would ""die"", a button will pop up and if you press it in time you avoid the ""final"" blow, so that way Elika doesn't have to save you and the enemy's health stays where it's at.The environments are great to look at. The world starts off all dark and dreary with corruption, but as you heal the lands, everything becomes bright and green and lush again.Most of the time you'll have to go through an area twice, once to get to the fertile ground so you can heal it, and then you'll probably want to go through it again after it's been healed so you can collect all the Light Seeds lying around. You collect Light Seeds in order to ""buy"" special powers that Elika can use for platforming, which allows you to get to new areas.The voice acting and script of the game are not top-notch, but are certainly passable. Personally, I found the soundtrack and plot incredibly pleasing.Overall, Prince of Persia is quite fun; however, it is not for those who don't want to relax. Challenge-seekers will be severely disappointed, and those looking for excitement will also be let down. For those who seek a fun and relaxing experience in a richly textured world, on the other hand, Prince of Persia is the game to play.			"

												The 2008 reboot of Prince of Persia has already gone down in history as a weird specimen, an odd game that was disliked by the series' fans and that Ubisoft hastily tried to sweep under the carpet. As such, I approached the game with a mix of curiosity and caution.What I found was a beautiful, mesmerizing experience.The graphics and the music are striking, from the first moment. I understand that the game extensively cell-shaded appearance can be a love-it-or-hate-it experience which won't appeal to everybody, yet I found the game atmosphere beautiful and enticing. Every scenery is wonderfully drawn, and every moment it feels like you are watching a fairy tale unfold before your eyes. I found myself stopping every now and then to look around and visually explore the enviroment around me, taking the time to appreciate the details of the level rather than just calculating where I should aim my next jump.The rendition of the Prince is also my favourite, so far. Having played through the original Prince of Persia, back in the MS-DOS days, and also through the whole ""Sands of time"" trilogy, I must say I like this version of the Prince the most. This has mainly to do with the Prince's attitude. There is no sense of urgency in this game, no running against the clock, no being pursued by a deadly monster, no ambition, or thirst for power driving the game's protagonist. He simply stumbled upon an ancient evil which is about to be unleashed; however, he still has all the time in the world to stop him. He embraces the adventure he suddenly found himself in and just goes with the flow, always smiling, always relaxed. When controlling the Prince, you can rush from one level to the next, pursuing enemies, or you can stop and go for a walk through the desert under the moon: nobody's coming at you. This is your story, have it your way.Speaking about the actual gameplay, a great deal of criticism stems from its dumbed-down difficulty. In fact, there is no ""game over"" screen, as there is no way to die. Whenever you fall to your death, you witness a cutscene where Elika saves you instead. This is merely a convenience, though: each time you see the cutscene, you know you screwed up; only you don't have to worry about saving, reloading or continuing. To me, that's perfectly fine.Coming from the ""Sands of time"" trilogy, the difficulty of navigating treacherous environments feels reduced as well. There are no spikes or deadly contraptions you have to avoid, most envirnomental hazards are about well-timed jumps and avoiding falls. The controls are easy to master, and there is some amount of auto-pilot helping you navigate the most treacherous parkours. All in all, navigating a level feels more relaxing than challenging, although you will sometime need several attempts to figure out how to traverse a difficult section.The combat system is maybe this game biggest flaw. There are very few enemies scattered throughout the game, so virtually every fight will be a boss fight. You cannot die, but each time you are saved by Elika, your opponent has a chance to recover some life, protracting the battle longer. Fighting in this game is mostly about quick-time events and stringing together your attacks in a long combo, in order to maximize damage. Then it's parrying and ducking, until you can start a combo again. The whole control system seemed stiff here, and whenever I though I had an opening to start a combo I ended up being hit instead. All in all, I never developed a good feeling with the battle system, and boss battles degenerated in a chore rather than a fun experience.Ultimately, this game might not be for players or long time series fan who are looking for a challenge, but I think its visual style and atmosphere earn this title a place in any gamer's collection. It looks and feels like a remarkable work of art; and each time you complete a level, you watch the scenery transform around you, feeling a genuine sense of reward for your efforts. I definitely recommend to try this one out.			"

Prince of Persia (2008) Review 
A Video of Prince of Persia

 Written review Prince of SlidesIf like me you had become increasingly frustrated with the direction Ubisoft had taken with Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones then Ubisoft Montreal's 2008 reimagining should serve as a reminder as to why you fell in love with the series in the first place. Where Warrior Within and The Two Thrones followed a dark and violent path full of frustratingly constricted enemy encounters and a tone gratingly out of sync with The Sands of Time , this reboot reverberates like a breath of fresh air, the kind of gust that makes you forget about the baggage of diminishing returns The Two Thrones had strapped onto its back.Like many, I was reticent about another Prince of Persia reboot but this version bucks the trend and ends up working wonders because it exists in its own wonderfully crafted universe with a graphical style that is visually ravishing and asks that you kindly forget that Warrior Within and The Two Thrones ever existed. In fact the ""Prince"" in the title is not even a prince but a cocky, wise-cracking thief looking for his donkey - whom he gets separated from during a violent sandstorm - when he comes face to face with a beautiful and mysterious stranger called Elika who is trying to escape from a contingency of guards her father has sent to capture her. We soon learn that Elika is a princess and that her father is the King of the realm that our jarringly Americanized Middle-Eastern ""prince"" finds himself in. Without giving too much of the plot away, Elika's father manages to destroy an ancient tree in a moment of madness, a tree that Elika had sworn to protect because of the evil it contained. Soon the land is engulfed in blackness and corruption as the God of Darkness himself, Ahriman, is released from his prison.

What is immediately noticeable with the reboot is how streamlined the combat is from previous versions, but players need fear not because despite being streamlined it's also surprisingly deep. There is a sword attack, an acrobatic move, a gauntlet grab and throw, Elika's magic attack and the standard block. For the most part, you will be looking for an opening in the enemies attack stance before firing off a combination of sword attacks, acrobatics and magical blasts that are incredibly satisfying to pull off when chained together correctly. I was not too enamored with the QTE events that pop up during enemy encounters when things haven't quite gone your way simply because of the speed at which you need to execute them. Encounters do get further complicated by the starting state of an enemy. The starting state of an enemy will determine what type combat combinations you can use against it. Often enemies will switch in and out of states so you will need to adapt your fighting style on the move as some combinations will be useless against an enemy.

			Here is looking at you kid		


Visually, Prince of Persia (2008) goes for a completely new look with cell shaded graphics that are exquisitely crisp and fluid to look at. This new graphical look often evokes that of a watercolor painting constantly in motion. Like the combat system, this new versions control system has also undergone a revamp and is far more simplified than previous versions. This actually ends up being a welcome addition because it allows for some incredibly cinematic death-defying acrobatics if you manage to string together a successful combination of wall runs, jumps, slides and grapples. Speaking about death-defying stunts, this is one area where the reboot stirs up some controversy. There is no death mechanic. Throughout the entire journey, which lasts roughly between 10-15 hours depending on your playstyle, Elika will not only be an aid in combat but also a lifesaver as she uses her magic abilities to rescue the player from death. I ended up rather enjoying this mechanic because I found it removed the frustration that often accompanies these precision point adventures. Elika ends up being a useful and incredibly likable sidekick that thankfully doesn't simply exist in the game world as a poor damsel in distress waiting for a strapping young hero or plumber to come along and save her. Conclusion I found this reboot successfully achieved everything it set out to do. It's gorgeous to look at, exhilarating to play and has a surprising little twist at the end. By the time I had completed the game I was so immensely satisfied with the experience that it is now my favorite game in the entire franchise.

												Having already beaten this game in 2008, I remember loving everything about it, the graphics, the voice acting, the gameplay... everything was perfect. So the idea was to instal and play a relaxing game while I wait for Arkham Knight to get released.Well, the 2008 me was kinda wrong... the combat in this game is just awful and cringe inducing, I have no idea what they were thinking when they made it so that you're blocking 70% of the time, with maybe 15% of free fighting, and 15% quick time events/button mashing. Maybe they were trying to make it harder artificially when they realized the game was too short and fun and easy, I don't know... but I wish the game had 0 combat and more environmental puzzles to fill in the blanks. Luckily though, there are not a ton of fights in the game, so they don't completely destroy the mood.The controls could be a bit tighter, but they aren't horrible, they work... I mean it's a Ubisoft parkour game, you can't expect anything more out of it really.The story is next to non-existent and that's OK. You're looking for a donkey, but instead you find a princess, now help her save the world... c'mon man, do it! She may not be a donkey, but she's hawt.The game came out in 2008, and it looks absolutely amazing even by today's standards, with maybe some stiff animations and facial expressions that wouldn't be present if it were released today.All in all, if you love and miss Playstation 2 era platformers, this game just might tickle your nut$@k. - 7.5/10			"

												An underrated blast.It may be very different to the other Prince of Persia games, but thats what makes it stand out to me. Most people complain about how you can't actually die in this game, however most people don't seem to realise that Elika saving you whenever you 'die' is just a replacement for the sands of time in the original trillogy (The time reversing mechanic).The writing is funny and it's great to look at too. My only complaint is that the combat can be too simple at times, the ability to fight more than one enemy at once would have spiced things up!This game is great!			"

												A rather underappreciated game that fails to innovate like previous installments in the series have, yet, it delivers a thrilling adventure, beatiful enviroments, great platforming and parkour experience. This, mixed with a lackluster fighting system it gets a solid recommendation. While the game itself is not on par with the Sands of time trilogy in terms of fighting mechanics, it sure delivers a story that will stick, a beatiful, cel shaded world that encourgaes to explore through the platforming system that is as satisfying as always.It feels like Ubisoft took a hasty look at The Two Thrones, threw all mechanics out the window and started fresh with everything but the core of the franchise. The instant revival system that recieved a tsunami of hate is there, yes, however this is not necessarily a bad thing. While the fact that you get pulled from every jump you miss shortens the game somehwhat, it gives the more casual gamers a try to get involved in this massive laborynth called gaming. 7/10 - Great bang for the buck// Xaeleep 26/11-13			"

												This game is beautiful, but bland. Most of your time will be spent parkour-ing around mini-hubs in search of enough collectibles to open up further mini-hubs to parkour around to collect more collectibles, and so on.There is one way to play this game: each location has a set number of collectibles to find, that can only be accessed by taking a specific route. Failure to take the appropriate route - for example, by mis-timing a jump, or falling into a trap - means you get caught by your companion, and dropped off at the last flat terrain you were stood on. This means there's very little sense of scale to your surroundings: the only difference between being hundreds of feet in the air dangling from a cliff edge, or hanging from an archway above the ground, is the skybox. Fall off the edge and whoops, try again, you're back at the start.The graphics are sharp and vivid, colours are vibrant, and there's a clear distinction between areas you've 'healed' and those that are on the checklist. There's even a nice subtle visual effect - what's it called? where the corners of the screen dim? - that appears when you pass from safe to dangerous areas.There's not really a lot to the game, in all honesty. What kills it for me is the total lack of variety - enemies are few and far between, and generally exist as an obstacle to slow down your progress (as with the collectibles). Combat consists of waiting for the enemy to strike, parrying, and using a certain weapon to attack (that the game helpfully pauses combat to explain). Even the parkour isn't very interesting, as all the areas you are capable of traversing are marked with certain visual cues: 'wallrun here' areas are all marked with the same scraped texture, for example, and 'climb this ledge' areas have the same scuffed edges. So there's hardly even a sense of exploration, or experimentation: it's like you're told how to solve the puzzle before even attempting the puzzle.Other miscellaneous points:The player protagonist isn't either an obnoxious misanthrope, or a wisecracking cynic. Dude just wants to save the day and then go home with his donkey, which is admirable. The Princess is your standard warm-hearted 'i must reclaim my land from evil' archetype, but mostly exists outside of cutscenes to be dragged around the scenery with you and fed the collectibles.The game itself is fully controller-compatible, but for some reason there's a launcher screen with a 'Launch the game!' option that you'll need a mouse for. Of course, graphics options etc. are also to be found in the launcher, rather than in-game.The soundtrack isn't anything to celebrate: vague 'you are exploring an Arabian Nights-ish landscape' sonic wallpaper, nothing special or memorable.

												As a fan of the Prince of Persia™ franchise, I just couldn't miss this one. And it blew my mind.This game was just what I needed. Like a ray of pure light it purged the ideas of blood, brutal violence, and gory deaths. This particular game was full of magic. And when I say magic, I mean it. The world is just beautiful. Filled with gorgeous landscapes such as: huge mountains, shining rivers, caves and caverns, flowery plains and other delightful sights. And that's just the ""nature"" part. There are also a large number of beautifully designed buildings. Some go deep underground, and others reach the throat of the world. Which is both beautiful, and impressive. Especially when there is a Day/Night cycle. And the nights are full of wonders. The new protagonist is a nameless adventurer in search of fortune. Which, even though called a Prince, is not one. The adventurer is accompanied by an Ahura named Elika, whose race has forsaken the duty given to them by the god of light, Ormazd, and intend to set free the main antagonist, Ahriman. Ahriman is the god of darkness who was imprisoned by Ormazd. The game is a constant fight between the forces of Lights and Darkness. In order to entrap Ahriman and his 4 Corrupted followers once and for all. Most of the gameplay is still intact. The player can use the Prince character's acrobatic prowess, sword, and gauntlet, as well as magic from Elika to perform combat and acrobatic feats variously throughout the game. Which not only looks stunning, but also causes more damage if you chain all the attacks together. The game features open world exploration that allows the player to travel to any spot in the game world at any given point, and lets the player witness the plot in any way they want. The traps are manifested in various forms of the antagonist Ahriman's Corruption. Black-colored blobs that coat the land and swallow the player if touched. The player can use acrobatic maneuvers to avoid these traps. And after they heal the land, the traps are purged completely.The player can not conventionally ""die"" in Prince of Persia. Rather, when an enemy is about to strike the finishing blow, or The Prince presumably falls to his death, Elika saves him. But by doing this, the enemy has time to regain it's health. The combat is tricky at first, but when you get the hang of blocking and deflecting attacks, you won't go down anymore. The voice acting is probably my favorite part of this game. As soon as the Prince started talking, I knew it was Nolan North. And the game would be full of jokes, witty comments, and funny remarks. And boy, I laughed my face off. Elika was serious about the imminent apocalypse, while the Prince was joking around most of the time, making this adventure less tensioned. Take a look at this:Prince: I hope that hurt!Elika: He can’t hear you.Prince: He can’t?! And you're an ugly mother too![Elika gives him a look]Prince: What?Or this:Elika: Tell me about your family.Prince: I don't have a family.Elika: Well, you come from somewhere.Prince: Yes, and I'm going somewhere else.Although I find Yuri Lowenthal's voice more charismatic and touching, I cannon resist Nolan North's. His voice created so many amazing characters...Alright, last one:Prince: Want to play a game ? Come on, it'll be fun !Elika: The World's about to end and you want to play a game ?!Prince: Might as well die happy.Elika: What sort of game is this ?Prince: Well, I see something and you have to guess what it is.Elika: How can I guess that ?Prince: You just guess.Elika: Grass.Prince: No.Elika: Rock.Prince: No.Elika: This is a stupid game....Prince: Want another go ?Elika: No... Path.Prince: No.Elika: This is impossible !...Prince: The game would be easier if we played it by the rules.Elika: There are rules ?Prince: Yeah. I tell you the first letter.Elika: Then why didn't you do that ?Prince: You didn't give me a chance.Elika: *sigh* Can we get to the Fertile Ground ?...Prince: S.Elika: Are you still playing that game ?Prince: S.Elika: Sky.Prince: Hey! You got it! Okay, your turn....Prince: Come on, your turn.Elika: For what ? Uhm... C.Prince: Corruption.Elika: Yes. Can we go on ?...Prince: S.Elika: Sky again ?Prince: Now you're getting it !Elika: You picked 'sky' again ?Prince: No, but you're getting the hang of the rules.Elika: Ah, thanks, they're so complex I was worried they might evade me....Prince: S.Elika: Scar.Prince: No.Elika: Scarf ?Prince: No.Elika: Shrine ?Prince: Aha! No.Elika: I give up.Prince: It's too soon to give up.Elika: I give up !Prince: Soulless Follower of Ahriman !Elika: I am amazed no one threw you overboard on your sea trips....Prince: G.Elika: Are you still playing ?Prince: G !Elika: Gauntlet.Prince: Yes !Elika: You wanna make this game harder ?...Prince: Wanna play the game again for forfeits ?Elika: No.I was even laughing while I was re-checking the text again. Ubisoft, thank you for choosing Nolan North.Now the music. Stuart Chatwood and Inon Zur, my favorite composers. They created this amazing, vibrant music for the game. Both epic and fantastic. When you are roaming around the plains, and other healed ground. A soft, relaxing, light music is playing. And when a fight starts, the drums and flutes are pulsing and come crashing down. Both of these create the perfect atmosphere. As I said, this game is just stunning. Full of adventuring, jokes, fights, flights, magic, beauty, and romance too. I had so much fun playing it, and I still do. I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys an epic adventure.10/10 "

Teal DeerDevelopers: Ubisoft MontrealPublishers: Ubisoft Initial release: Dec 2008Genre: Action, Platformer, Environmental Puzzles #Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationSo after having played the Prince of Persia trilogy and the two dimnesional original (on console please forgive me, and awhile back) you may notice that this version is vast departure. Sort of..I was actually impressed at how it remains quite linear whilst still being open world. Mostly regarding pathing and traversal in between objectives and choosing what order you do the objectives. THIS GAME IS TOO EASY. You literally cannot die. You can't.. Not that you would come close to doing that anyways. All the battles are one on one (2v1 really) but the second person is more of a type of attack and traversal method. The enemies will do stance changes which have visual indications to the effect that only specific types of attacks will affect them where they will go back to regular stance. There are occasional quicktime events in which should you press the wrong button, the only consequence is that the enemy recovers a small bit of health. Traversal is probably the main draw here. Enviromental puzzles have long been a staple of the Prince of Persia IP. But this too is also easy. Any mistakes made during traversal you are saved by your random encounter companion and brought back to the last flat platform. All in all, this bascially ""no fail"" state makes the game fairly relaxing as jumping around and collecting ""light shards"" is fairly mindless and feels pretty good. (and is required to progress)The narrative throughline I found rather unengaging.  The Prince is voiced by Nolan North (the voice of everything that isn't played by Troy Baker.) His performance wasn't bad its just what was being said wasn't interesting. There is a twist in the ending that is fairly unique. Though there a comparison a specific PS2 exclusive (PS3 remake) game that I wont name due to potential spoliers. I won't even put it behind a black bar. I re-read what I just wrote and I feel like it comes off more negative than I intended. Nonetheless it remains accurrate. In essence this is more Prince of Persia. If you've played previous ones and didn't like them. This will not change your mind.Follow my curation for more "

												You may think you know Prince of Persia, but I assure you this one is nothing as the rest. I never was huge fan of PoP games, although I enjoyed few of them, but with this one I become a fan. What makes this adventure of our favourite prince different for the others he partake you may ask, and I'll try to describe what I found so refresnhing and marvelous. Very first thing to notice is cartoony aproach to graphics witch suits perfect the tone of the game. There is little to none combat in game, and there is no death, as it should be in such a cartoony and beautiful place. Second thing is interpretation of story, very light story, just a few characters, and relativly simple light vs. dark fight. You couldn't imagine better story for given characters and style. Characters are talkative, there is great chemistry between them, and more often then not they've put a smile on my face.From gameplay prespective this might sound boring, but for me atleas it wasn't. No death didn't make platforming easier, but it did remove lot of frustration. There is quite a little backtracking, but often landscape change, so it gives you idea of what are you doing to world. From time to time I guess it could become little bit repetative, to me it didn't matter as don't beat games in one sitting, or even in one month, but even if you do game lenght is such that you won't have to endure it for long.This is real gem, and one of game that left me in awe after completing, great ending, one on my favourites in games I may add, so I can not recommend you this game enought, unless you just want to kill things.

												Cazualisation to the Maximum and beyond! The First hour is really enjoyable, the characters are likeable, the atmosphere is great.But after a while you'll just end up wondering ""why the hell am I still playing this?"". You really quickly end up doing the very same things over and over and over AND OVER, to the point where it all feels like one big chore. The ""jumping arround"" is fun but if you take a good look at it, it's rather limited. You end up running through  the same patterns during the whole damn game. You fight each of the few bosses several times with litterally no differances in your approach (fights are just QTEs btw). The puzzles do nothing but slow down the pace for a short bit but won't require you to think much. The game allows you to interact with magical plates at some point, which allows you to get to new areas, but they don't bring any kind of diversity to the gameplay and are pretty flappin' anoying (especially the yellow ones) The game is litterally just a succsession of QTEs, with a complete absence of challenge. The fact that you can't die, even during combats, thanks you your qt magical gf, removes any kind of threatning situation. All that's keeping you away from the end of the game is just the fact that you have to collect shiny stuffs that are all arround the place. It's entertaining at first but it's really all there is to do, and it's not satisfying.This game stands as a reminder of why QTEs are dumb ♥♥♥♥ and why having a ""fail state"" is vital to any game of this kind. Too bad.			"

												This is a great game for people who like lore, collectors (for unlockables) and platforming. The game does not have a great combat system and you will find yourself doing the same thing ALOT. The game does not have a difficulty setting and you can not die. By far the best thing about this game is the SETTING and ART STYLE.Recommended for those who want a platform that focus less on combat and does not punish you for failure. "

												Still playing in 2016. This game, together with Bioshock Infinite , has extremely gorgeous artwork instead of graphics and thats why its able to hold itself until this day. From the combat , to the interaction with Elika , their small chats , all make this game a masterpiece. Prince of Persia is definitely THE ONLY series that Ubisoft does it right unfortunantely. I wish they would stop focusing on Assasins Creed and start making Prince of Persia. 9/10 for me. Cant believe a 2008 game runs so smoothly!			"

Wasted potential.Prince of Persia as a game has qualities much like its own game world: The rich, beautiful and fertile parts are starkly contrasted by poor, infuriating and corrupt ones.Right off the bat I ran into problems with this game. In Windows 7 64-bit, I could launch to the menu but the game would hang while loading the first level. A quick look at the forums indicated that enabling Vertical Sync in the settings would fix this; it did. Still, this game came out nearly 7 years ago and Ubisoft has never addressed this common issue. The only other technical failure I ran into was the lack of screenshot capability, which is more of a design flaw than a bug. Uplay is not required but its existence likely played into the decision to disable the Steam overlay, and its screenshot function.While I can forgive these technical missteps, I cannot forgive this game's story. Without spoiling anything, this game clearly ended with the expectation that there would be a sequel. However, there hasn't been a sequel and more than likely there never will be. Even the DLC epilogue doesn't wrap things up at all. At best it gives an indication of where the writers were planning to take things after the main game's ending. If you are playing on PC, that epilogue isn't available to you. I watched it (mostly at 2x speed) on YouTube.Worse than the lack of a satisfying conclusion was the content of the ending. It clashes with the tone of the rest of the game and feels mismatched and forced. It's a slap in the face to the players and everything they felt like they accomplished in the game. Prince of Persia does a good job of building characters and setting but the plot was poor throughout and left me shaking my head as the credits rolled. This is particularly unfortunate because the two leading characters are generally very likable with great voice acting and good dialogue.By 2015 standards the gameplay of Prince of Persia is rather poor. In 2008 it was probably slightly above average. My biggest issue with the acrobatics is how they feel nearly automatic or partially ""on rails."" You are required to push one of three buttons as you jump, swing or use magic to get around in your virtual playground. Precision is rarely necessary. Same for creativity since there is typically only one correct way across a specific pathway. Combat has a four button combo system and quick time events but never developed a pleasant flow in my hands. It also doesn't evolve at all as the game progresses. Tack on nearly no consequences for failure and you have gameplay that has little challenge or urgency to it. Oh, and you need to collect roughly 600 Light Seeds floating around the world in order to finish the game. That's not fun-- it's tedious.I'd be remiss if I didn't offer up some praise for the artists behind this game. Both visually and aurally Prince of Persia is a joy to behold. The designs of the two primary characters are distinct and memorable. The environments, while clearly laid out with gameplay as first priority, are beautiful with a grand sense of scale. The soundtrack contains a nice fusion of common eastern themes, epic orchestral scores and a wondrous magical quality. It's too bad that the good in Prince of Persia is so badly undermined by its flaws.			"

												This is a vastly underrated game. Magnificent art direction, excellent voice acting, great music, a good solid plot and writing (although yes, you will get sick of the phrase ""sacred ground"" pretty quickly), incredible character animation, and game mechanics that steadfastly refuse to punish the player for experimenting.It was too different from the games that came before it and it was ""too easy"", so it was considered a failure and Ubisoft went back to the previous incarnation of the franchise. Such a loss, because it was so far ahead of its time.I played this on a console first and then bought it again for Steam because I didn't want to lose it when my console went obsolete.			"

												I love the POP series, but this game is a repetitive chore. There is nothing of interest in this game. You climb the same exact areas, the same exact level designs, collecting shiny orbs, with an occasional ""boss"" battle. It is an insultingly lazy game. Ubisoft did not care one bit about the game itself, the orb collecting and area opening aspect of the game, which is the biggest part by far, is the most boring thing ever in a game. The prince's and Elika's relationship is by far the best aspect of the game, but honestly the game is not worth playing for that reason alone. The only positve thing I can say about the game is the cellshaded graphics, and the general art direction. Other than that, just pass this one, it's not worth the money. 4/10			"

												Of all Princes of Persia, this is the one I love most.While the gameplay is easier and more casual compared to the other games in the franchise, it's still quite dynamic and fun, and free from endless irritating ""here we go - here we die"" sequences. Personally I like the specific take on replayability: when you defeat minibosses, locations get upgraded with new obstacles and foes receive new abilities, depending on the boss you defeated - and you can defeat minibosses in any order, so the game can be very different on your consequent runs.However, forget the gameplay - you should see this game just for the characters. Story is quite simple yet emotionally deep. Cutscenes are wonderful. The game itself is majestically beautiful, unless you are allergic to this specific kind of rendering (some people really hate it). Also there are really nice touches in animation when heroes interact after falling or switching places on a thin beam etc.In my opinion, this game deserved a sequel much more than the mainstream Sands plotline.

												I remember playing this with my brother years ago, when it came out. I can recall us saying ""pass the sticks"" everytime we fell and Elika had to save us. Playing this again, it still is as good and as fun as it was all those years ago. If you're thinking about getting this game, and have the money, go for it. Furthermore this game is controller campatible, no installing, just plug in. I love this game as much as I did when I first played, definitely a good buy.			"

TL;DR: Middle Eastern Parkour SimulatorI played the game originally on the Xbox 360 when it first came out and enjoyed it. Since I didn't get to finish it there, I wanted to play it on the PC.Pros: Looks beautiful, especially after you have cleansed an area. There's lots of really nice Middle Eastern architecture to look at and a nice ambience overall. Best played with the lights off to get the full effect. Occasionally funny dialogue between the protagonists. Puzzles can be challenging at times, I wish there were more.Cons: No non-boss enemies. You don't really fight anything that isn't a boss like animals or other hostiles. You can't use your sword outside of battle to cut stuff or anything. No depth to fighting style. Essentially, you can get away with continually hitting the attack button and dodging the enemy. There aren't any real combos other than magic/sword/magic. You don't learn any new moves or get any new weapons as you progress. Light seed collection can get repetitive. When you fall off, you go back to last piece of level ground you were standing on, which could have been really far back, forcing you to repeat the jumping sequence you just did. Story could use a little tweaking.Other: You can't seem to die. Ever. Falling off ledges, almost getting skewered by the Hunter, getting sucked up into goo . . . everytime you will be saved by Elika. Even when she is trapped by one of the enemies! She can't free herself, but some how can reach across the arena and grab your arm. I hope you like parkour because there's a lot of it. Sometimes it's fun and fluid, especially when you have a good rhythm going. There's quick action sequences during boss fights reminiscent of Resident Evil 4.Overall, this isn't the type of game I see myself playing for several days in a row, but more of a game I come back to whenever I need to take a break. I still recommend it though. Note: I have never played any other PoP game before this one, so I can't compare it to previous installments in the franchise.			"

												Once upon a time, when I was 10 or maybe 11. That was the first time I played Prince of Persia 4 back in 2008.That time, the video game industry wasn’t as flourished as today’s, but the franchise Prince of Persia held a pretty dense weight. It was the renowned franchise of action video games, could say that nothing competes it in the pure hack and slash world. And Prince of Persia had also inspired the following action games, transformed the whole action genre. Back then, if you ask some game enthusiasts for Prince of Persia, they definitely know the black-haired prince who slashes his way out of all kinds of predicaments. And the famous wall-running was basically every teen boy’s dream move.But all of that, was before 2008. When it came to 2008, a new prince emerged from the middle of nowhere desert, and accompanying with a new princess. Fans were really upset Ubisoft didn’t continue our brown prince’s journey, thus in that time, it seemed not quite a game can catch up with its predecessors.It is a brave new world, with everything changed so significantly that totally contrasts its previous titles. A fantasy world with swords, magic and lore. Color theme is so different from the previous ones. Fortunately, the prince’s classic wallrunning wasn’t removed. And due to the design, the prince will never die, because the princess has that sort of time reverse ability can save him whenever he falls. Or more precisely, the magic to pull him out of endangerment. And because of this, I once quit playing it because it violates the rules of video gaming – there is death, and there is reload. And never touched it ever since.Lately, the game once again appeared in my life, out of curiosity and the completionist grand cause, I bought it on Steam and played it once more.10 years have passed ever since, the second touch of this game everything looks so visually astonishing and aurally soothing. A fantasy exotic land is put right in front of me, with the slick prince and the beautiful Persian princess. The game looks exactly great, I do enjoy my time playing it. Whether it’s the freerunning, the puzzle solving or the plot. With the combination of excellent visuals and audios, I fully fit myself into the tomb raider/prince role. It’s simple, the same time not lacking enjoyments. And I think I have pretty much perceived the fact that the late years how video games have made protagonists invincible. Either it’s Call of Duty, or simply, Ubisoft games. The game is not like the usual type of action hack and slash, those games would have a character growth system which enables certain skills after you reach certain levels. But Prince of Persia enables the full combo moves at the start of the game, making it all flourishing and stunning at the beginning of the game. Which, also makes it stale after a certain amount of time. But the combo moves are pretty rich, so takes a bit time to master all, but it’s simply all divided into 5 segments – Elika, Acrobatic, Throw, Lift and Sword. Amongst all I especially love the duo movements – you can add Elika, the princess, into your combo and make up a beautiful duo waltz dance, beating the enemy heart deep.After heavy combat, let’s now focus on the world design. The world has two statuses, one is corrupted and the other is healed. Respectively presents with dark and cold color theme and colorful and rich color theme. After you defeating the certain area’s boss, the world would become healed status and opens new paths that are previously blocked. And here, lies in the freerunning.Freerunning is a big part of this game, I can say that 70% of game time you are doing freerunning: jumping the walls here, wallrunning the walls there. And with the healed status areas, you need to do all the freerunning so that you can collect Light Seeds. In this game, developers especially focus on freerunning so that they added 4 abilities for Elika to be unlocked. After you have collected a certain amount of Light Seeds, Elika can return to Temple and unlock new abilities – activating unusable plates in the world.  These 4 types of plates can do all sorts of imaginative movements across walls and footholds, bringing vast excitement out of flying across the sky. After the freerunning, the game has another segment that is relatively common in the past games. Puzzles. This game gives me the feeling of exactly what a pre 2010 game looks like. Back in the time I was even playing Kung Fu Panda game on my PC. All sorts of puzzle solving, achievements unlocks, it’s niche. Nowadays game has expanded vastly on scope, covers even more, so sometimes you feel like you are not playing a game, but experience a life. But these pre-games, feel exactly like a game.Whenever we talk about a game, the plot never gets away with it. Prince of Persia’s character development is fine, not great, not epic, it’s just fine. We had a rush introduction on the two protagonists fateful encounter, and then suddenly the world collapsed, and our protagonists had set sail for their long-last world saving journey. It’s cliché, but hell it’s an old game. But slowly did it graduate, the bond between the two had emerged. Here, we hear from the partners conversations we can learn their backgrounds, their stories. But our John Doe prince has never mentioned his name, even though our princess Elika has told so much about her and her country. Maybe it’s just like what he said, “Where to come does not matter, what matters is where to go.” The game fully revolves around these two characters, mostly conversations are also happened between them. From them, we gradually learn about the world settings, the backgrounds, and the history of the world. And sometimes the couple would flirt with each other, and sometimes some wise lines would come out of our “idiot” prince. They make up a lovely couple. Although I strongly doubt the fact that the princess had been a virgin before she met the prince. Wait, she’s still a virgin right? Conclusion. Prince of Persia is a beautifully crafted game with fascinating visuals and sounds. A very old game, but the quality is solid. 7/10.

												Even know its vastly different from the PoP trilogy, I still enjoyed it for what it is: A cool cel-shaded game with parkour, a collect-a-thon, semi open world, and one on one shuffle fights of doom. The battles are more or less repetetive, but it feels pretty awesome to execute overly dramatic sword slashes and finish enemies.It's a pretty cool, decent experience with pretty awesome environments, although semi-linear.

My least favourite version of my very favourite Prince of Persia gameThis is a gorgeous adventure game set fully separately from any other Prince of Persia game. It has a great art style, amazing exploration in gorgeous environments of which you'll see both a light and a dark version and a good story with strong, well-voiced characters.You traverse a desert environment, fix it using magic powers and try to find out what's going on exactly. On your quest you are accompanied by Elika, who seems to have a better idea of what's going on but doesn't quite feel like sharing. She helps you in combat, while platforming and when you mess up she saves you at the last second every time. Some people disliked this, claiming it removes the challenge, but it is little more than a cleverly (and charmingly) masked respawn system and will not detract from your enjoyment.It's not all great though.Combat is not as fluent as you'd expect, either from the series or an action game in general, and there is a severe lack of variety in the enemies. I'd argue that the focus is more on the exploration and platforming anyway, but that doesn't quite excuse this level of laziness.Then there's the point specific to this version. How integrated with Steam a game is is completely up to the developers. Since this is published by Ubisoft (which has its own competing system, uPlay) it wasn't much of a surprise to see no trading cards or achievements on Steam, but the Steam overlay isn't even available. This means no in-game chatting or easily checking the time and, worst of all (to me), no screenshot functionality.If you have a console (the game came out on XBox 360 and PS3 as well) it would make sense to me to get it there instead, but I had no problem with this version either. Just wished it had been given a bit more love in its conversion so that it matches the amount of care and dedication that went into the game itself.Summary:+Best platforming+Good story+No uPlay required (or in fact possible)-Shallow combat-Poor Steam integration			"

												It's a great stylistic game with an easy to pick up control scheme. The voice acting is terrible and the combat is a joke, but if you can get past those element, the ambiance makes up for it. The ability to choose where you want to go next is also an interesting concept which keeps the game interesting. While it definitly doesn't play the same as the previous Prince of Persia titles, I'd recommend this game as a solid platformer.EDIT: I'm using a Xbox controller, so I cannot comment on how the keyboard controls are.

												I really regret not recommending this, i truly do because the series was my favourite, after Sands of Time, Warrior Within and The Two Thrones i was really excited to play this, but they screwed up with this one only to bring the true Prince of Persia game after this (Forgotten Sands)The combat is long, boring and irretating. You only fight one enemy at a time while in the previous Prince of Persias you had to fight multiple and made you think about your moves and not running into one while attacking the other and then blocking it at the same timeAnd the fact that you need to collect Light Seeds to continue just made it even worse, because you need to do CONSTANT parkour to get to those Light Seeds and you need to get about 1080 in total....HOWEVER!! The prince is 20 times funnier and he is a lot more chilled and not so... ""emosional"", when he talks. It has a nice story line but they ruined it with the boring 1v1 combat and the collection of the Light SeedsHope this helps and i am really disappointed with this Prince of Persia :(P.S.

												First off, I must start by saying I am a huge fan of the Sands of Time trilogy. I feel compelled to mention this because this game seems to get a lot of flak from fans. It's also the reason I haven't given the game a try for 8 years - I did not want to be disappointed.But I was wrong. Very wrong. Prince of Persia does not disappoint. In fact, it's amazing. Casualization? Sure, the combat is easy - the platforming often isn't. In fact I'd be frustrated in the later parts without the constant checkpoints. Don't mind the people saying that Elika (the princess) constantly revives you so you cannot die - that's basically a checkpoint system given a personality, which is good. The prince can die and lose progress - Elika only brings him back to the last area with solid footing.Since I've mentioned Elika anyway, let's talk about her. She is one of the best video game companions/NPCs I've ever seen in a game. Her personality grows on you. She helps you out in fights and platforming. I really like how standard mechanics are given a personality through Elika. Like the checkpoint system. Or the double jumping - you need Elika's help to double jump. This is not to say the Prince is not a well written character - his pessimistic sarcasm (as opposed to Elika's optimistic wit), combined with the many, many small conversations he and Elika has during the game is something that adds to the game's charm manyfold.Alongside the characters, what makes this game stand out is its art, audio and narrative direction. It's some of the best, and it has held its own over the years. The environment is simply, soulful. It's a narrative-driven game where the emphasis is on the narrative, with a beautiful ending (and not in the way you'll be expecting).So yeah, is this a more ""relaxed"" experience than the previous games? Certainly. Should you play it? Certainly. It's a very different game from the previous trilogy, while maintaining the Prince of Persia feel - and it should be judged as such.			"

												I have a soft spot for the 2008 reboot of the Prince of Persia series, if only because it was Ubisoft's attempt at selling a game without DRM (sadly, their only attempt as they quickly jumped to SecuROM- and later UPlay-protected games thereafter). And for many, that was the game's only saving grace, as the general consensus was that the game was a poor follow-up to the acclaimed ""Sands of Time"" trilogy. But not me; I liked this game.One of its major failings for some was that this was a game that was impossible to lose. Jump off the wrong ledge or get your ♥♥♥ kicked by a monster, and your AI partner Elika would invariably be there to bail you out, resetting you to the last checkpoint. While this doubtlessly removed some of the challenge, it also removed a lot of the frustration of having to replay the same jump-n-run segments over and over (imagine that, a Ubisoft game that tried to LIMIT the amount of repetitive grinding!). The game was also far more relaxed in the  timing of its button-presses, playing more like a series of casual quick-time events than a fast-paced platformer. But both design choices allowed the developers to emphasize the setting and characters (not to mention that, by slowing down the pace, I actually get to watch the action on-screen rather than focus on what quick-time button to press next). It becomes a game more focused on environment and experience than difficulty and - while not necessarily the direction I want all games to go - I was fine with that choice in this title. The story and characters are appealing, the visuals are colorful and the gameplay supports the mood rather than - as too often happens - opposes it. It's a relaxing and enjoyable romp that won't appeal to everyone but was a pleasant way to pass the time between more hard-core games. "

												Don't compare it to other PoP games in the series, and you'll enjoy it the most. Loved graphics, soundtracks, stylish combos, witty remarks between Prince and Elika, puzzles, everything. There is no gameover screen, correct, but whenever Elika intervenes with your death, you get pulled back to a previous location where you were last standing, or previous state if you're in combat. This is, by all means, no different from games with regular checkpoints.I find this game highly enjoyable.			"

												Nathan Drake is back again in his newest game. Join The Penguin as he saves the world from a constantly spreading corruption. The Bosses' journey will be pretty easy though, since he can't really die or be hindered in any real way. Still, sometimes Vashyron just wants to take in the sights, you know? Raph is (not) suprisingly really slow-feeling in a fight though. The ending is suprisingly bad, despite Captain Walker ending up regretting what he's done. The bottom line is That Guy From Shadow Complex will deliver you through some entertaining platforming and pretty environments and I guess that's all I really need.			"

												If you can get past the story, there's a great game here.    I first played PoP '08 nearly 10 years ago on Xbox. Bought it on sale a few years back, and decided to finally revisit the game a few days ago. Was a little worried as to how it would run as some Win10 users reported not being able to launch, but it ran fine for me; 1080p with all the settings cranked up to max (Also: NO UPLAY!). It's hard to believe this game is as old as it is, visually it looks as good or better than a lot of high-budget games you see today, but I'm biased towards the cel-shading art design they took for this installment.    Gameplay is a little slow, wish the prince ran a bit faster, but once you get the hang of jumping, wall running, and sliding, you settle into a rather enjoyable rhythm. I remember review outlets complaining that your companion Elika made the game too easy and didn't provide enough punishment for mistakes, personally it never bothered me too much. You can really see how this series inspired the later Assassin's Creed franchise in this game, I believe a lot of architecture assets were straight up lifted from this title.    The characters are really likeable in this game, the prince is a little cheesy, but is a welcome departure from the edge-lord from some of the earlier games. Elika is more dry, and it's fun to hear the two banter back and forth. I'd recommend taking the time to hit the ""dialogue button"" several times in each new area to hear their relationship develop. Their camaraderie is reinforced by character animations as well; climb on a vine and Elika will hang on your back. Slide down a wall and wait at the bottom; you'll catch her rather than awkwardly clip through her model and shift to the side.    They really nailed down the atmosphere in this game as well, it's a large, beautiful yet desolate world, and you and Elika are the only two inhabitants for the most part. As a side-note, this lonliness was unintentionally enhanced by the fact that I'm playing a mostly-forgotten game nearly 10 years after its release, and am likely one of the few people doing so. All the music is fully orchestrated and reacts to what you're doing at the time.    Where this game fails for me is the story, namely the ending. The overall story itself isn't really remarkable or important, but be prepared to be disappointed by the ending. I hear PoP '08 was originally intended to be a trilogy, but due to the poor reception the later games were canned, and replaced by a DLC epilogue some time later. This DLC is not available for the PC unfortunately, I'd perhaps YouTube the epilogue ending for some closure (you'll need it).    Overall, I'd recommend giving this game a try, it's a game that I feel deserved more or a chance than it got at launch.TL;DRGood game, no Uplay, jarring ending, kinda easy, worth the price			"

												The good:The visuals look good, and the game flows wonderfully, making the Prince's acrobatic transitions from place to place a genuine pleasure to watch. The before-and-after transitions as you cleanse areas of their corruption are also enjoyable to see.Elika manages, unlike Farah in Sands of Time, to stay out of your way and not shoot you with arrows, while still being there whenever you want to use her to enable a special ability (or to catch you when you fall). The byplay between her and the Prince is also enjoyable rather than intrusive, with the ability to prompt her for narrative on demand to flesh out the unavoidable bare-bones version allowing you to explore the setting and backplot at your leisure.While the environments make little sense if you think about them too hard, taken on their own terms, they generally have an internal logic that can help you understand where to go and how to solve the various minor puzzles on the way.The game also gives you a lot of freedom in which order you tackle its regions - you can explore most of the game's area as soon as you unlock the double-jump, though for most regions, healing them requires you to unlock one of the four special abilities, and in turn unlocks the collectible ""light seeds"" you need to unlock another ability. Each ability immediately gives you access to the associated sacred grounds (with a little travelling to get there) so you can choose which to tackle next.The bad:While some of the achievements are more challenging, including speed-running between certain landmarks, for the most part, the game lacks a sense of challenge - the boss fights are more like extended QTEs, and so are the journeys from place to place - while the paths themselves wind around, and parts may be visible from (in terms of travel time) far away, when you're actually travelling them, they're almost entirely linear - it's less a question of picking your route from A to B and more of launching yourself in the right direction, and tapping the right buttons at the right moments, as cued by chunks of environment.When it comes to combat, there are fights against the four bosses, who you will face several times in their respective territories before finally eliminating them, each of whom has their own quirks, and keys to being defeated, but the only other enemies are boundary guardians between areas, who can be defeated either by traversing the route to them rapidly, or by facing them in combat - a good opportunity to work on your combos, but not so much for actual challenge.The highly structured nature of the game also means that, while each area has its own minor quirks, once you get a feel for the overall structure, the only real discovery comes from uncovering new bits of scenery or solving some of the game's handful of puzzles. Even finding the few light seeds that aren't automatically collected as you follow the paths from place to place becomes routine after a while.While the setting has a backplot and bits of history, the game's actual plot consists of meeting Elika and then going on a grand fetch quest to get the light seeds to restore the land and seal the great evil back in its can. There is some exploration of the characters history, but no development, and not much actually happens - probably mostly to support the player's freedom in choosing when to tackle each region, and whether to prompt Elika's narration.The ugly:The plot (such as it is) isn't actually resolved in the game - instead, you need to play the DLC, which isn't available for the PC version. Having to buy the endgame separately is bad enough; not being able to get it at all makes this a good example of how not to do DLC.Overall:It's a very polished game, which is more fun to watch than most, but ultimately hollow - all style and very little substance. That's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but the lack of an ending leaves me unable to recommend this. If the DLC ever comes out, or if you aren't worried about closure, then sure; otherwise, you're probably better passing on it.			"

												Prince of Persia (2008) is a super easy game with a cool art style and a Zelda-like combat system. It is a very peaceful and relaxing game. Unfortunately, the characters are stupid, the story is soooo dumb, and you have to grind through a bunch of levels that are the same exact difficulty. Plus, there is A LOT of backtracking in this game. Oh and did I mention that you can't even die or lose? This game is definitely for SUPER casual gamers because it offers NO challenge whatsoever.

												Prince of Persia is a great movie, it's just a damn shame that Ubisoft decided to bog it down with so much crappy gameplay. I give Ubisoft props for trying something new with the series and I cannot flaw any of the artistic team that worked on this game. The writing is top notch and the voice actors truly bring it to life in a way that surpasses the beautiful visuals. It's a shame that both the platforming puzzles and combat are not more interesting or challenging. The platforming is Prince of Persia light and the combat is an attempt to revive the classic PoP combat which has many promising elements but ultimately completely fails.While some point to the fact that you cannot die as the problem with the game, the true problem is that there is no challenge. Being sent back to the beginning of the puzzle or fight you failed on would be fine if the puzzles and fights were interesting and challenging.If you're looking for a game to play for the writing and story, this is a good title to pick up.If you're looking for a good platformer or action game, stay away.

												Don't let my play time fool you, I've played this game multiple times across multiple platforms.This is probably going to always be one of my favourite games of all time, to be honest. While I have played through some of the original Prince of Persia series that Ubisoft released, this reboot intrigued me when I saw it in the upcoming releases. So I took a chance on it, and I wasn't disappointed with that decision. Ubiosoft games are generally fraught with complaints about controls, etc. (especially those such as Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed), and while this game is no exception, the fact that you can't really die, at least while platforming around, makes it a bit more forgiving. Moving on to the story, I actually found myself quite enchanted by it, along with how the Prince and Elika's character's were written. Stopping and hearing their banter in the midst of being frustrated almost always made me feel better and it was sometimes just a nice break in general to sit down and listen to mor story almost whenever I wanted. The game world layout is pleasing and the non linear manner they allow you to approach it from makes replays less boring than they could be. The ending and the epilogue (if you get opportunity to play it) can be a bit of a kick in the face, but they didn't detract from my enjoyment. They just make me forever sad we never saw a continuation to this tale.			"

												It's a shame this game was overlooked due to how different it was from its predecessors, because it's really a fantasic game.The game has a different tone and pace compared to most games where it really focuses more on the traversal more than combat. Though combat is still there and very satisfying, it's the traversal throughout the land that makes this game fun.Though the ending is not great, it's worth getting. At this moment, it's on sale for $2.49. That's stupid cheap, and should be reason to buy it alone. If not for the price, buy it because it's a really good game that deserves to be played.			"

												Just so you know before reading: I never played any other PoP game(excluding the 1989 classic). Thus my 'review' is based on ""what I thought it would be and what it turned out to be"", not on ""how well does fit into the series"".I played only for a few hours and already got bored of the ""fight enemies for 5 minutes and collect orbs for an hour""-policy. Not to mention the complexity of the actual combat... (none)If you like collecting orbs - get it. If you expect something alike God of War series(like I did) - this game will disappoint you.Neat graphics, good music and nice environment. So that's a plus.			"

												If you played ANY of the other Prince of Persia games that came out prior to this one, you WILL be disappointed.I wanted to like this, really.  But it's simply impossible to get past the very linear, and very boring 'dungeon crawl' feel it has.  The Sands of Time really felt like an adventure, you were moving through a well thought out story and encountered many fun puzzles and interesting enemies along the way....In this...edition...you run through gauntlets that are extremely forced, fighting essentially the same enemy each time, and all so you can complete the ultimate objective.  Is this how games are? Sure.  But good ones atleast attempt to mask their otherwise very linear plotlines.Bottom line:  Don't waste the money or the time.  If you want Prince of Persia, have a look at Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Warrior Within, or The Two Thrones.  Those are great.  This...well...isn't.			"

												As this review was reasonably current at the time it assumes you know one major thing new to this game in the franchise: you cannot die. Should you fall or lose a combat, your companion Elika will save you. In combat this resets the health of the enemy.I thought this would be a platformer, but it plays more like an extended quick-time event. I didn't find it took much platforming skill (I'd know if it did, I suck at them) so it was actually rather interesting stringing all those moves together. Not entirely satisfying, just more interesting.The music seemed sparse. I see that there appears to be quite a bit of it, but it sure didn't seem that way and there was a lot of silence. I don't think it made full use of its score. I found sound balance to be an issue in general, with far too many things drowning out dialogue and even towards the end of the game I was fiddling with volume levels.The death mechanic worked. Mostly. Where it didn't work was in allowing me to keep light seeds I gathered when I died, removing all punishment from death and making it easier than quick loading would. All in all it kept the flow of the game, which was broken less by death and more by the odd decision to have the prince pause to catch Elika on the ivy.The majority of the game was collecting light seeds. If you only collected the precise number to open the pads you were missing a large chunk of the game. This is why it was such a kicker that there is absolutely zero reward for collecting all of them, beyond a sense of a achievement. Hunting them down was actually oddly satisfying, especially the odd tricky one which got you to think for a bit, but couldn't we get so much as a line of dialogue as a pat on the back for 100%? Considering how vital they were supposed to be to Elika this struck me as another failure in the world building.On that front though, the view was gorgeous. Being able to stand in one land and see all the nearby lands was absolutely outstanding. The immense scale of some of it, seeing the restored clashing with the corruption; made for one hell of a sight.The fighting system was a bit pants to be honest. You have a huge number of combos, but they're almost entirely irrelevant. You either fight an enemy with their back to the edge (push them to their death) or you fight them with your back to the edge (they can't be pushed off you need room for a combo). In the latter case you memorise the longest combo possible and then unleash it, I think mine was Elika - Elika - Gauntlet - Elika - Sword - Elika - Jump - Elika - Sword. I suspect you could go longer but since I almost never had enough space to unleash the full combo it didn't seem worth my time to find out.The real problem is that you don't seem to have any real options in combat. The quick-time events often don't punish you for failing them and don't always reward you for passing them leaving you with the question of what they were for. Sometimes I'd deliberately let the enemy hit me just to get them out of the near invincible ""Smack you back and Elika down"" mode so I could fire off my combo again. For a game which was all about flow in the platforming there was none of this in the combat. And yes, Elika was painfully fussy about distance.My next biggest complaint is the open world. I like that I could do things in the order I want, but the sacrifice was too great. The story is not the saving the world story it first appears to be but rather it's about two characters with one goal but completely different motivations. One is led by her faith in her god and redemption for the acts of her father, while the other is being strung along by his ♥♥♥♥ at first and then more emotionally intimate feelings later on. The problem is that this requires character development, development which the open world precludes from happening (along with any semblance of a difficulty curve) because every zone can be done at any time and so the dialogue maintains a pretty consistent tone throughout, you never feel that the relationship moves anywhere beyond the initial leap from chasing the girl to saving your first land. This was such an integral part of the game I can't believe it wasn't handled better, the chats upon cleansing a zone should have either been unrelated to the zone, or formed of two parts, one for the zone/opponent and one for the stage of the relationship you have reached so that you see a natural development across the course of the game.The writing doesn't help, the characters are far too modern in the way they speak to each other, both in their choice of words and in their voicing. Maybe modern isn't the word, but it really felt off for the entire game. The writing problem extends to the enemies as well.The characters talk about the Concubine for example driving a wedge between them, yet I didn't feel that at all. The best moment was with the Warrior where both characters interpret the events according to their biases and the writer never spells out which is correct.This is a shame because the ending is so good, so very very good, that I wish there'd been a better build up. The characters are key to your enjoyment of the game and a better writer, or just better development spread over the course of the game, would have pushed this from good fun on a budget into superb territory.Overall, it wasn't a hugely challenging game and it certainly had its problems, but nor does it overstay its welcome and it's one of a growing number of ""buddy adventure"" games and that always wins a game points with me. I wouldn't have thought it worthwhile at full price, but in a sale it's worth checking out just to experience the journey if not the tightest mechanics ever seen in gaming. You will also get one of the best endings gaming has to offer.			"

												From a fan of the Sands of Time trilogy, i really enjoyed this game.There may not be any sword play or lengthy battle sequences where baddies surround you, but the story, art style, characters, and platforming more than make up for it.-The platforming was as enjoyable as the past Prince of Persia games even if you really couldn't die with Elika having your back.-The combat was simplistic, but very captivating with how the Prince and Elika fight together. The two characters are not only likeable, but they have a strong chemistry between them and i find that to be a big plus in any game.-The story has more depth in the optional conversations with Elika, so don't forget to talk to your partner!-I never ran into any glitches/bugs or any compatibility issues. (running on Windows 8.1)-No need to download other programs such as Origin or uPlay (often asked amongst other games).I couldn't break away until I beat the game and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.8/10 for me!

The art style, even after 4 years, is gorgeous. I put off playing this game for a long time b/c of the PC v. not having the DLC that finishes the story--& yet I kinda dig the ""F' life"" ending this left us with.The trial-and-error platforming using checkpoints can be mindnumbing, & I'm esp. referring to any sections that had the on-rails breath powers while dodging pillars and whatnot. Awful. Just awful.All enemy fights were irritating delays between platforming segments. Restricted to one-on-one combat (even w/ bosses), you typically just push enemies to an edge or wall and insta-kill them. Collecting light orbs was good and bad.  Never difficulty, somewhat addictive; the bad comes from repeating segments after bosses, meaning much of the game is played twice on the first go-round.			"

												I voted yes because the overall experience is one of my favorites, but there are some problems with it.  It is one of my favorites because it is a complete original concept.  I'll spoil the biggest one.  You can never die.  Honestly, I've never played a game with that before, and I really liked it.  It sped the game along.  The game you will realize, is all about speed.  The world is vast, and you explore it.  Different buttons do different things at a given point in time.  The better you get, the faster you can travel because you don't fall.  And it is blazingly fun.  But let me emphasize this.  There is a combat system, it is fun, albeit it isn't the point of the game.  Battling is just there for something different.  The point of this game is exploration.  It's an exploration game, with a storyline that is captivating.  How you transverse the environment is really fun.  The graphics were really good for its time.  The music like any game gets old after a while, but is really cool at first.  In my humble opinion this is probably the best Prince of Persia out of all of them, however I haven't played all of them, some.  I'm just making a prediction.  However, there are some problems.I know this sounds weird, but there has to be some realism to your fantasy world.  So for example, the end boss the the essence of darkness.  Yet when you traverse a temple, he can't hit you.  Does that make sense?  There are boss battles that I literally can beat in two combos...and...everything just happens to allow you to get through when things are crumbling all around you.  So there are elements that pull you away from the world.Also, they didn't game test enough.  They actually did a ♥♥♥♥ poor job in my opinion.  The camera is all jacked at times, and quite literally the character won't do what you told it to do, because it didn't register.  Sometimes because of the jacked camera, you intend for the character to move one way but you move another.  Quite frustrating.Another really bad design element, is this whole black glob thing that eats you up when you go through a corrupted fertile ground.  All it does is slow you down.  That's it.  What's the point?  The game is a lot more fun when you are just climbing absolutely everything without falling, or missing a combo.  It totally takes away from the experience.The overall game is a positive rating.  There are issues.  I loved it because it was so original of a game.			"

Every level is nearly identical, except for a few of the final boss fights. After a while of playing, I just got bored.

												Make sure you have a controller.This game was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed it more than the Sands of Time trilogy, actually.  It was a bit less cinematic, but there was an ease and a fun to the experience that the other lacked, particularly when you got bogged down in endless streams of enemies.  But make sure you have a controler.  There is one of the quick time events that is impossible to do with a mouse.  You have to click the left button as fast as possible, but at least my mouse won't pick up individual clicks that fast, so when those come up, I have to pull up the options screen find the binding for the action, switch it to a keyboard button, do the quick time event, then switch it back to the left mouse button.  It is incredibly annoying, and although I played an awful lot of the game (much more than the hour and half steam says, I think I was only one world away from the end of the game) I finally just decided it was too tedious to continue.

Awful. Just awful.All enemy fights were irritating delays between platforming segments. Restricted to one-on-one combat (even w/ bosses), you typically just push enemies to an edge or wall and insta-kill them. Collecting light orbs was good and bad.  Never difficulty, somewhat addictive; the bad comes from repeating segments after bosses, meaning much of the game is played twice on the first go-round.			"

												This game is worth it just for the visuals alone. I don't think I've played such a colourful and artistic game before.If you are a fan of the Sands of Time saga, it's best to ignore the connection between them and this game - they are seperate (and as such, no time control).However, it is excellent on the PC, and mouse and keyboard are the preferred controller.

												Wish I'd been playing games like this when all of these came out. The story is good, gameplay is fun, and I'll probably play it again at some point. Being relatively new to gaming in this era (yay for fifteen year hiatus!) and completely new to modern PC gaming (Tetris anyone?), this was great for familiarizing myself with the keyboard navigation and gameplay style common now.

												I was really surprised by this title. It's a fairly expansive (read: long) and they really did a good job on translating the old 2D PoP mechanics into 3D and then built levels that took advantage of them. I had a blast playing this game, aside from a few spots in a few levels and limited combat sequences, it was fun without being frustrating. The game progress is fairly linear without being obvious about it, since the game basically uses a huge interconnected world that you're free to explore whenever you want, though progress forward on branches can be blocked at various points by tools and abilities that you haven't uncovered yet. Once you uncover the tool or ability you can return and progress further, and sometimes there's multiple branches it unlocks so you don't always have to continue down a single branch.It's a shame Ubisoft basically went nowhere with PoP after this title, instead rehashed the mechanics and engine of the earlier 3D titles with their subsequent game, including the tedious fixation on combat.Note that I played through this title on my own a couple years ago in a non-Steam form, hence my short amount of Steam gameplay that doesn't cover a full playthrough.

												From a fan of the Sands of Time trilogy, i really enjoyed this game.There may not be any sword play or lengthy battle sequences where baddies surround you, but the story, art style, characters, and platforming more than make up for it.-The platforming was as enjoyable as the past Prince of Persia games even if you really couldn't die with Elika having your back.-The combat was simplistic, but very captivating with how the Prince and Elika fight together. The two characters are not only likeable, but they have a strong chemistry between them and i find that to be a big plus in any game.-The story has more depth in the optional conversations with Elika, so don't forget to talk to your partner!-I never ran into any glitches/bugs or any compatibility issues. (running on Windows 8.1)-No need to download other programs such as Origin or uPlay (often asked amongst other games).I couldn't break away until I beat the game and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.8/10 for me!

												Ok here's go bad thing: The combat is repeatitive, and it's not many time you engage into a combat. The clibing is slow (like 20% slower than normal PoP). The camera angle is shaky and weird.Good things:+The story is awesome, well, if you slow down and press T, there will be a story for you, and build up 2 characters' relationship nicely.+The scenery is so nice and beautiful, For example: 25 places to visit in game, all different with each other, but all follow the theme of the zone they are at and it's so magical, in fact.+Adding 2 things above together with the slow pace movement makes a good adventure game.I will add one more bad thing: they did not release the only DLC for this game in PC.

												Score: 95/100Prince of Persia is, hands down, one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.But first of all, it needs to be pointed out that this is not Sands of Time trilogy, and that you shouldn't expect a Sands of Time kind of Prince here. That said, quality of this game is on par with Sands of Time. Everything about this game is amazing. The world, platforming, adventuring, everything is on exactly the same level as in any of the Sands of Time trilogy installments. If you are looking for a worthy successor to our beloved Sands of Time games, this is it. Look no further. I should point out that combat, while certainly interesting and visually appealing, is not as diverse as it was in Warrior Within or The Two Thrones, but the quality of this game is such that you will barely notice this slight flaw.The aspect of the game that was the most beautiful to me is the story. I can't describe how immersive it is, how rich and deep it is. And you will love the Prince's new companion, Elika, just as much as you loved Farah. The interaction between the Prince and Elika is beautifully done. Their banter, small talk, discussions... it will keep you captivated throughout the game. You will find yourself rushing to defeat their next enemy just so you could hear them have another conversation, be that a philosophical discussion or a simple chit-chat between a guy and a girl. And as the game progresses, the story will pull you in until the Prince's world becomes your own. By the time the game reaches its ending, both you and the Prince will find yourself enthralled by Elika's spirit and character that you will find yourself (both you and the Prince) profoundly affected by her and what she represents in this game's world.And then the end will come. I will not spoil anything. All I will say is that it will send shivers down your spine. And please, this is not something that can be experience in a YouTube video. For you to really feel it, you need to play the game. You need to bond with the Prince and Elika. You need to care for these characters, just like the developers meant you to. And then, once you play through the end, believe me, it will stay with you for a long time.			"

												The best game of my highschool years so I wanted to buy it on steam.--For those who couldn't open the game:--First it didn't work fon win10 but I just tried to open the game from the folder that it's downloaded and it worked just fine in max.graphic settings no fps issues bug or glitches ect. --About game--I played around 8 hours listen(read) conservations carefully and I realized that the story is much more deep than I tought.  Even tho I played 8 hours for now it didn't over yet. When you try to collect all lightseeds and listen the story, game takes much longer time than you expect and it's not boring like collecting 40 crimson nirnroots (in skyrim). I have 4 more areas to cure and 2 different bosses (angry dude and the big guy(not gonna mention the names for no to spoiler) to defeat. I really was missing this game and I really happy that I bought it on steam too. This game is out of first 3 PoP game's story line so anyone can play and understand it.It's also my favorite game of the series (dont buy the last one ubisoft loved up on 5th game).And has the best area design on the series.--What about cons?--For those who doesn't enjoy story game dont have much combo to do. (has enough but you can finish the whole game just with one if you dont interested to try different things.)Sometimes camera angle gets annoying but most of the time its k.You might get bored of walking in desert in the begining of the game. (but in a short amount of time you gain ability to warp)--I can write about this game for hours but it would be boring for reading so that's all hope it can help thank you for your time :)--			"

												A rich story, often charming and flirtatious, combined with a one-dimensional combat system. Definitely a console port so using a gaming controller is ideal. Keyboard/mouse is possible, but it takes a lot of practice and frustration to get consistently good at it. Most of your time will be spent chasing down light crystals which is just plain boring and repetitive, but if you don't overdo it by trying to get all of them, the story flows pretty nicely. I did find the ending to be extremely disappointing and had me wondering why I went though all the effort to begin with.			"

												If I had only one word to choose when describing Prince of Persia it would have to be this: Beautiful. This particular iteration in the Prince of Persia franchise casts aside its former self including combat, art style, and story formula, in favor of a completely new approach. In my opinion this change is for the better as the graphics and character development in the game are some of the best I have yet to experience in a Prince of Persia game.     From the moment you start it becomes very apparent that the Ubisoft Montreal had a distinct vision for how this entry in the series would look and compare to the others. The art style is a mix of cell shading and realism. The vibrant colors of the characters clash sharply with the sand and stone environment making the characters seemingly pop out of the screen.One of the more elaborate visual effects in the game is the abundant use of cloth physics. Everything that you would expect to be swept up in the wind gets blown around like Marilyn Monroe's skirt, and it works really well. It adds a whimsical feeling to the game when coupled with the amazing color pallet.      Speaking of color, this is why I would use the word beautiful for this game. Ubisoft utilized the entire color pallet with this one. Everything from pastel to neon is implemented so artistically and meaningfully you may find yourself stopping to smell the roses more often than you might expect. The environment changes as you progress and adds a sense of urgency to your mission to bring down the God of Darkness. As you accomplish this the land changes from dark and moody to bright and sunny. The change is animated and dramatic and always fun to watch.The combat is paired with acrobatics nicely and they go hand in hand in terms of the flow of the game. One moment you may be wall running and the next you're performing a Triple Lutz with your sword over an enemies head. The rhythm of movement and combat is extremely well done and makes you feel very accomplished when you string together a long combo attack or a flawless parkour segment.     In terms of story Prince of Persia gets it right and wrong. While playing you can take a moment to talk to your A.I. controlled counterpart. During these brief exchanges you are given insight into the characters and their past. These optional dialogue moments provide for some of the funniest and most enlightening banter I have ever heard in a game. The problem lies in that they are optional. I don't want to even think about what this game would be like without having done all of the chit chat sessions. Voiced by Nolan North as the Prince and Kari Wahlgren as Elika, these should not be missed as they fundamentally contribute to the story and honestly it's a shame they are optional.The story is pretty straight foreword so I won't go into too much detail in that regard, but it is engaging and entertaining throughout. As you play you unlock new magical powers that by the end of the game are all used in conjunction to pass certain areas. There are several puzzle sequences that, in a positive way, interrupt the game play flow. These puzzles require you to manipulate switches and levers in order to progress through the level and range in difficulty.      Because the game is open world, environmental hazards evolve as you chip away at Ahriman's corrupted Lieutenants. At the start of the game, traversing the landscape is pretty straight forward. As you progress however it gets a lot more tricky. Everything from pools of corruption to moving tentacle blobs hinder your progression and add a nice steady increase in difficulty. Before you know it you become an expert wall running, ledge grabbing, tower scaling, pole swinging, God crushing princess saving Prince.     Prince of Persia is one of those rare games that allows the player a whimsical and uncomplicated vacation into another world. It refines the series and reimagines it into a beautiful new addition to the franchise. While there was an epilogue DLC released and a continuation story arc in the form of a handheld title, my only regret is that there wasn't a sequel to this wonderful Diamond in the rough in the form of a full game on console or PC.

You run and jump around a lot, and this time you collect orbs to unlock places. It's a big game. Combat is once again ok, nothing special. The fact that you can't die keeps things fairly good paced, which is, in my opinion, a good thing, especially for a game that relies on acrobatics and timing. Oh, how I love PoP games...

												Prince of Persia '08 is definately of the same vintage Ubisoft's (then new IP at that time), Assassin's Creed. While evidently, this game tries to make the characters more likeable; at it's core, it's a classic case of Ubisoft made something which is so bad, it's kinda good. Not saying that AC and PoP are bad games - I love both dearly - it's just faults here and there which make the player re-evaluate why they spent time and money on this.Level and character design are the strongest points of this game; both adding another element of intrest to the fairly simplistic game. The game at it's core is just 20 jumping puzzles with 24+ boss battles, which the player grinds their way through, in order to progress, all with a varying difficulty. There are a few puzzles here and there, one of which almost forced me to rage quit the game, which extends the gameplay, and changes it up occasionally.If you are considering purchasing this game, seriously consider forming a headcannon for it. You will enjoy it so much more if you do.And I still recommend it.You all know I'm Ubisoft's ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												My first thoughts when I launched this game is that this game has no in-game options menu. You have to change the options before you launch the game. I'm sorry, but that is a stupid design. If you need to test out resoultions for the game you will have to keep exiting the game. There is also a few minor complaints I have. First, there is a one-second delay for the menu selections. Kind of annoying but nothing major. Another complaint is the borders on the screen. Again, the game is still playable.The story is nothing to write home about. A guy unleashes an evil demon, all hell breaks loose and you have to repair the world. Nothing really original. Not to mention the voice acting isn't very good.Right from the beginning you have a partner with you, some kind of princess these guys have been chasing. Now this is where this game goes downhill. Here's the catch: You can never die. Your partner always saves you from falling down a pit or getting hit too many times. There is no challenge from that.In the first few minutes of the game you're introduced to the combat. You can block, some kind of air attacks, normal attack, and claw attack. Not too deep. Though, there is a combo system where you can use your attacks and your partners attack to unleash pretty cool and stylish combos. This gets very boring after a few fights. Another catch: You don't kill any people. They run away. Why? I have no clue. You can also climb and run along walls. These controls are really finicky at times. Though if you've played any Assassin's Creed game, it'll be kind of easy to get used to.The graphics style is kind of odd. The characters are givin this semi-borderlands thing which doesn't look very consistent with the rest of the world. I kind of like it though.Pros:-Graphics are OK.-Combo system is pretty neat-Controls are alright sometimes.Cons:-Story isn't that great-Voice acting isn't great-Combat gets dull-You can't change options during the game-Climbing is like in every other action adventure gameIf you disagree with my review about this game, I don't really care. It's my opinion. I know my hours of the game haven't been enough for some of you, but I got really bored of the game and I don't want to continue it.			"

												I found the game to be aggravating. The game itself is quite breathtaking in all its aesthetics. Once you move past the prettiness the nuts and bolts of playing the game did not thrill me at all, which is made up of exploring levels to find glowing balls or combat with a narrow variety of enemies. Combat is limited to one-on-one every time and I don't think I ever grasped how combat is effectively handled. Crawling around the (very pretty) levels looking for the orbs was fun the first few times. This fun dissipated very quickly. This concept of Prince of Persia would've been better off as an animated feature.			"

Shame.			"

												I love this game. A lot of people hate it from steering away from the original trilogy, but I welcome the change. A prince with a character, a princess who follows you, does acrobatic stunts with you and who you can catch in your arm when she's jumping down at you :3. Lots of dialogue, bickering and an alright story. Just what I want in the game. The gameplay itself was simplified and that caused a huge controversy — you can no longer die in this game, your amazing companion always saves you. But I want to ask — isn't it already the case with all the other games out there? Only there it's called quicksave and quickload. Or ""restart from checkpoint"". Here it looks gorgeous and doesn't take away from the game progress.Easily my favorite game of the franchise. No screenshots can do the game justice (and you can't take screenshots with steam overlay because it isn't working :() but it is just gorgeous. Too bad the ending is console-exclusive.			"

												Things I never knew about this game:Ubisoft made the controversial decision to not release the epilogue for PC, which did get the original game. A Ubisoft community manager stated that the DLC was not released on PC due to ""business reasons"". The decision led to an outcry in the PC community. This is just ♥♥♥♥ing bs. ♥♥♥ hats. Since the original ""ending"" of the game is SO unsatisfactory...but afaik the DLC ending isn't much better anyway.Things I hate in games in general:- Fancy menus that put style above usability. Seriously, waiting several seconds for every menu to ""load"", just because you wanted a stupid animation every time you opened ANY menu!? FU- Unskippable cut scenes...screw you- Unskippable 15 minutes credits scene? Screw you even moreNow this PoP has nothing to do with any of the others. New hero, new side kick, new combat, new mechanics, no more Sand (of Time at least). So no reversing or slowing time or anything else like that.Instead you get a sarcastic, snarky hero (really liked him) and a pretty naive princess (her not so much). The game consists of ""cleansing"" several areas and defeating the area boss. You do so by unlocking 4 different powers, of which 2 are pretty much exactly the same for whatever reason. To do so you need to gather glowing light orbs that spawn once an area has been cleansed. You guessed right, that means tons of backtracking. However, at least you don't need all of them. I think about 65% of available light seeds need to be collected, which, frankly is rather stupid, because by the time you unlocked the last power to reach the final 4 areas and 2 area bosses you have already collected as many seeds as necessary in the game and there is no need to collect any more...sooooo. Someone didn't think this through.Traversing the terrain is pretty standard PoP, but easier, since the controls are MUCH better this time around. There are also almost no puzzles and traps in this game (only a few in the end game mostly) and getting lost is virtually impossible since you have a navigation system with Elika, your partner in crime. Speaking of Elika, she is THE most annoying side kick in terms of game play...she constantly follows you around and you need to lift her up or switch positions with her. Every action takes time and takes away from the fluidity of game play. You also need her to turn a turnstile...really, that means waiting for her to come over, every time. Since many puzzles rely on turning those all the time, this gets really annoying. On the other hand she is required to traverse the new ""power plates"" (yes, those powers), which are ""wall running"", ""flying"" and two ""jumps"". Flying is easily the most frustrating one, since it's the only once requiring real input, but makes it so dubious to see where you have to go at times it's just irritating. The other ones are pretty straight forward.There is no more game over. You simply start at the last check point, which is usually before you leave solid ground to go jumping around somewhere. Health bars are also gone. There is very little fighting in the game now. Only bosses and some random enemies. You now fight only 1 on 1, blocking and countering enemy moves. That works surprisingly well, until you meet a boss you can't damage directly or until the boss just activates 4 quick time events after another...all the time. You also can't lose a fight anymore. The enemy simply gets health back when you mess up. It gets old really fast, because the system does not evolve at all. Thankfully the bosses are mildly interesting.The story is bleh.This is a PoP game to grab on a discount if you're bored. However, it's not bad enough to give it a ""no"".			"

												""Prince of Persia"" (2008) delivers a wonderful gameplay experience that departs quite radically from the previous trilogy. The flashy acrobatic platforming inherent in those titles is carried over but, aside from this, not much else is. The most notable change to this entry in the franchise is the overhauled combat system. Frenzied button-mashing versus multiple foes is gone. In its place is a 1-vs-1 duel system which requires carefully stringing together combos to take down your opponent. These encounters, which are slower in nature, are priviliged moments in the gameplay. Performing long combos and witnessing the fluid on-screen visuals that accompany them are both deeply satisfying affairs. Indeed, the game's visuals are another of its primary selling points. The environments - mostly lush landscapes interspersed with palaces and ruins - are exquisite, elaborately detailed, and can be admired for minutes on end. They are, in the simplest of terms, beautiful. The game's story and its two primary characters - the ""Prince"" (only in name in this series; he's actually a thief) and the mysterious Elika - are captivating and will leave you wanting more.Despite all of the above, I have a couple of misgivings about PoP:2008. Firstly, the platforming, at times, errs on the side of trial-and-error. These moments are unintuitive and can quickly become frustrating. A smaller issue I had was the game's somewhat repetitive nature. Each level is more or less identical in terms of what you have to do and how you are expected to do it. The Prince doesn't acquire any new acrobatic or combat skills along the way; something which might have added a little more variety to the platforming and duels.All-in-all, this is a solid game if you're in the market for an action-platformer with rewarding gameplay, beautiful art, interesting characters, and a great story... It's a shame Ubisoft dropped this iteration of ""The Prince"" because I'm sure it's sequel(s) could have only gotten better.PROs:+ Re-designed combat+ Beautiful environments+ Good story with great characters+ Good voice acting+ Good soundtrack+ Decent lengthCONs:- Unintuitive platforming (at times)- Repetitive			"

												The only issue this game has - the name. It is Prince of Persia only in name and not in the content. If you regard it as a separate game, then no problem.Graphics feels really fresh and painted. The animators did it well - the characters look like they have just been painted. The colours are vivid, after healing the fertile grond you have the sense of achievement because you ""unlock"" painted portion of the map.Soundtrack is, in my opinion, exactly the thing one expects to hear in the Persian fairytale - expecially the main theme (which appeared very briefly in both WW and TTT). Also, the track during the plate tutorials is awesome, in my opinion.Gameplay is fluid, after you learn the rules of combat, enemy form-shifting and surroundings. All the boss battles require different approach,especially, fights with the Warrior. Also, great thinking in the last Concubine fight. Knowing your surroundings is what counts towards...Collecting light seeds. If you know the rule how to thoroughly search each healed ground, it would be interesting, not frustrating. Basically, the formula is something like this: seeds that go along the way towards the fertile ground + seeds that are placed on EACH path to nearby fertile grounds in BOTH directions (2 or 3 different paths) + roughly 2-3 ""tricky"" places, each containing 2 seeds, usually one close to the ground and 1-2 on the way to different place (you have to look around - sometimes you just run past this tricky places, not noticing them) + power plate that does NOT correspond with the power needed to unlock this fertile ground and leads to 5 seeds. After applying this simple rule it was time-consuming, but relatively easy to achieve 1001 light seeds by the end of the game.Dialogues  are sometimes hilarious. You get to know your surroundings, get to know the characters and their background. If you skip the dialogues, you might miss some essential parts of the plot, so the story would seem a bit repetitive and predictable. Pity that we do not have Epilogue on personal computers....Also, it is intreresting to know that now the gods are real - Ormazd and Ahriman are acttual gods of actual religion, not created specifically for the game.I highly recommend this game, so don't pay that much attention to the name of the game and enjoy the gameplay.

			I wanted to like this game, but instead I made a review with some hyperboles and words I most likely used incorrectly Follow me on Twitter @MruSuk		

the cel-shaded reboot(?) of Prince of Persia is both an extremely beautiful and extremely ugy game. As a child of the Dreamcast era and a raving fanboy of Jet Set Radio the Prince of Cel-Shading offers a beautiful graphical presentation in one of my favorite styles, but graphics can only take you so far.For being in the same name as one of the most iconic platforming series out there, Prince of Cel-Shading totally goofs the landing on its platforming gameplay. Controlling The Prince lacks any depth and the game's levels are literally linear pathways, offering virtually no exploration throughout the entire game. Not only this but the pathing done in the platforming is so tight and linear that you rarely even get to see how beautiful some of this game's landscapes are. All of this is make /even worse/ by the inclusion of Light Seeds, these collectables appear when you complete a level for the first time and force you to go back through the level to nab them all. Since there is no exploration you just mindlessly complete the level a second time which is in no way more enjoyable than the first time through.the combat mechanics are rather basic as well. The system is a 1v1 fight which was supposed to give more gravitas to the battles with regular baddies. Sadly, since you can kill an enemy by knocking them off a platform and the platforms in this game are tiny the fights lack the weight the game was attempting. Combat does get upgraded and gets better the further into the game you go but it's never something to write home about.So aside from graphics what redeeming attributes does this game have? Character interactions. The Prince and Princess Elika have some of the most natural and organic conversations I've seen in a video game. Their banter never feels forced or hamfisted and their character develeopment happens more in the background than the foreground. Sadly, this can't carry Prince of Cel-Shading as it crumbles under the weight of its own poor gameplay. It's a shame that what is beautiful about this game can't shine past its glaring faultsPros:- Beautiful Cel-Shading presentation- Fantastic worldbuilding and landscapes- Some of the most organic character interactions and development aroundCons:- Borderline-offensive gameplay- Linear level design detracts from the beautiful landscapes- A rather basic combat system that does get better, but not nearly enough- The Light Seeds cause offensive backtracking and game paddingfor a more in-depth look at Prince of Persia please watch my video review linked above.- Mr. u Suk			"

												Boy... Thank ♥♥♥♥ing god this game only cost me 5 dollars.The list of what they did right to this game is shorter than the list of things they did wrong. Seriously Ubisoft, even for a 2008 title we'd expect something more. Especially after a legendary hit like Assassin's Creed was initially release in 2007.This review is all I have to release the raging anger I have inside. It's kind of like releasing Ahriman at the end of the game. Oh, yeah. Sorry for that spoiler. But SERIOUSLY. You'll be thankful I ruined the ending of this game for you.Admittedly, like everyone - you think the game starts off kinda cool. Like oh, I wonder what kind of spin Ubisoft can put on the Prince of Persia series. Well the answer is total garbage. It's almost like they used the development of this game to solve virtually every problem they had developing the AC titles. It's like hey f*ck it, let's just have the absolute worst game mechanics, terrible script, awful voice acting, and literally only 7 recurring characters. PLUS, let's only have 4 levels in the game. Is this screaming SH*T yet?If it's not, here's another reason not to play this game. It's 12 hours of your life you'll never have back. You could watch an entire season of The Walking Dead in 12 hours. In actuality within the first 3 hours you'll absolute hate the fact that you're saddled with some whiney a$$ b*tch who literally, LITERALLY clings on to you after every move. I mean wtf were they thinking?! A game that should last 6 hours, lasts twice as long because you constantly have to wait for Elika to attach on to you, like an infant to the nipple. Oh, did I forget to mention the bragadocious, nauseating rhetoric between the two of these characters? It's more sickening than your very first valentine's love.-.-Everything, and I mean everything in this game is repeated.  Like its THE definition of repetitive. Every boss fight, every attack sequence. Same, same, same. Its utter bull$hit, there's no WHOA factor to this game. Nothing even remotely charming enough to hide the fact that this was probably developed by a bunch of pi$$ed off frenchman that had nothing better to do, because they weren't involved in the AC titles. It's literally the only excuse I can think of. I dont even want to talk about the final boss fight. It's just horrible. Literally unbelievable, there's not even a probable, sliver of chance that the Prince would walk away from it alive... and thats another thing. You can't die. You just cant. Elika will save you EVERY F*CKING TIME. Even if you want to die you can't. There are so many things you can't do in this game, it's almost like that was the most challening part. (In all seriousness even finishing this game is an achievement) you have no idea the patience it took. If there's one positive thing I experienced playing this game, its the fact that Elika sarifices herself to imprison Ahriman and dies in the process. Obviously! I mean duh, you'd have to be an idiot not to get the hint. The f*cking ending was so over foreshadowed, that a four year old could have guessed it. Either way, she dies - roll credits. Just kidding - really I should have turned the game off after that scene. But, in order to actually witness the finality, and true ending of the game, you have to keep playing. So you break all 5 trees imprisoning Ahriman, you transfer the light back into Elika, (cause I'm only assuming at this point there's no f*cking way the Prince is going to leave her dead, like there's no way he's not going to throttle the ♥♥♥♥ out of Elika's ""enchanted"" bits - like the guy lost all his gold, his donkey, his one shot at true love, or at least a hot one night stand right?) and then she's just like WHY?!Yes, why you f*cking IDIOTS. Why?! There was no point to this game after 12 hours WASTED!! UGGHHHHHEven she's asking you why, you saved the world. You could have found your donkey, left the world at peace, let the annoying b*tch be dead and moved far away with his riches and courtesans. But no, in spite, the Prince just had to bang Elika, and that's why he saves her. Even though the world will now forever be in darkness; at least he gets to ♥♥♥♥ her.Thanks Ubisoft! Thumbs way up (your asses).			"

												Prince of Persia (2008) is a beautiful game with excellent platforming, great graphics, good voice acting, great music, and interesting level design. Unlike the other Prince of Persia games, this one allows more freedom of exploration, though the downside of that is that the difficulty never really increases. Combat can, at times, be a bit of a chore, but once you get in the groove it, too, becomes a largely pleasurable experience, more akin to a simple 3D fighting game than anything else. All in all, I thoroughly recommend this game: it's one of my favourites.			"

												To be honest, I expected a much worse game, cause it has the reputation of the black sheep of the PoP franchise (along with Prince of Persia 3D).It may be not as good as the Sands of Time trilogy, but it's a fun, entertaining game, with some serious flaws that you can accept and surpass, if you really want to. Yes, it's repetitive, yes, the story takes too long to make any sense, yes, the animation could have been a bit more polished, but it still is a pretty good Prince of Persia game.Its most important flaw is that Ubisoft tried to pass it as a PoP reboot, and fans couldn't accept that they should leave their favorite dark Prince for that light-hearted anime character. If it was called something like Prince of Persia: Orient and was promoted as a parallel game, it would have been greeted much nicer.			"

												One of the most boring games I have ever played. Combat is a simpler version of AC/Arkham style games though you can just knock off most enemies on the ledged and the rest of the game is <Collect X amount of light orbs> then proceed to the next area where you have to collect some more orbs for 10 hours. I only have 4 but I found it unbearable to play due to the repetition. Collectables: The Game Some people like it somehow, for the scenary I think. Even that is very similar in style throughout the game. Music is nice I guess. If you are scared off by warnings of bad ports there is a fix, I think turn off V-Sync maybe? I might be wrong but if you look yourself it won't take more than 5 minutes to find the fix, that's what I had to do to get past the giant load times. I use Windows 8.Unbelivably awful, I wouldn't want to waste time playing this if it was the only game I had so 0/10. Harsh review but there you have it.			"

												This game sucks. I liked the price of persia sands of time and the warrior within and the 2 thrones were sub par games but not as horrible as this one.The graphics are cartoony and well done.The story line can be ignored,you have to talk with a partner character incessantly by pressing T to talk to her. The character of the prince is downright annoying and so is the other character elika. The dialogues sound like he is trying to be funny but feels pushed on.It is the most irritating dialogues I have ever heard. So I tried ignoring this part and tried to enjot the gameplay.But for ****'s sake the combat is so damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ filled with quick time events and a horribly slow moving prince.  ou just have to defend by hitting the button at the right time and then attack. I found this excruciatingly painful to bear.The platforming was a nice distraction and I really enjoyed it but the powers of the character elika ruined that too for me where you could speedrun and fly(I got to only 2 powers there are 2 others until I abandoned the game). it feels like those mobile running games which are god really awful.If it had been general prince of persia platforming it would have been good but these gimmicks ruin the experience completely. I could have powered through the game but the combat was so painful that I abandoned it . I just could not take those QTE based combat and the horribly awful dodge and attack system with a snail like moving character anymore. **** this game. And actually there is no way you can die in this game you can power through the combats but it would be very painful it would be like doing household things you know you will finish it but the process of doing that is not fun.Least fun game ever.NOT RECOMMENDED.Pure torture.

												Prince of Persia is a wonderful and nearly magical game. Having said this, Prince of Persia is one of those games that has obvious flaws but manages to pull together to become so much more than the sum of its parts. The charmingly cliched story, the visuals, audio, and their sparkling polish come together to make the Prince of Persia a modern epic.			"

												If you play games for gameplay mechanics, then you might not like this title unless you're a fan of QTEs. This game is essentially one long QTE with a bit of running around intermixed. This title was more enjoyable for me than the previous PoP titles, because there was less focus on combat. The combat is pretty simple as long as the player can time the counters correctly, and there are hardly any enemies to fight. There were literally 20-30 fights in the entire game, IIRC. This title reimagines the ""rewind time"" mechanic from PoP:SoT as a magic-using companion that essentially just saves the main character whenever he falls to his death and returns him to the last solid ground he was on without any interaction from the player or limit on the number of uses. I personally like this mechanic.If you play games for story, then you might like this game. The story did not seem very deep to me, and this is probably due to the non-linear nature of the gameplay. Most of the dialog seemed to either be spent on playful banter between the main characters or on explainations of how each area relates to the main plot. I found the ending to be a bit odd, but I still enjoyed the story overall. The voice acting and dialog were good in my opinion as well.The game world looks good, and the cell shading effect is done well enough. This title could probably be categorized as open-world, but it's essentially a number of interconnected hubs. Teleporting is available to previously completed areas for the sake of convenience.I liked this title, but it did not leave me longing for more. It was pretty short and not very difficult to beat. There were a couple of frustrating parts, but they would have been much worse without Elika there to save me.			"

												Prince of Persia 2008. Absolutely stunning game.The graphics still hold up extremely well thanks to it's style (and doesn't require a monster of a PC to run at 60+ frames per second). I found myself going ""wow that looks gorgeous"" throughout the whole game. The style features a wide variety of vibrant environments.The OST in the game is also amazing and I did not find one track that I thought ""meh I don't particulary like this one but I like the rest..."" unlike most other games. The OST is for the most part orchestrated and fits with the vibrant graphic style perfectly.The dialogue between the two main characters the Prince and Elika is for the most part very amusing and you ; I found myself grinning for long time after the actual conversations had ended. It consists of a lot of optional conversations which generally after you reach new area or have completed an action in that area. Other than the constant very tongue-in-cheek humour between these two characters, there are of course the serious talks that are related to the storyline and these are great too. The lore isn't exactly that original or creative but it's still decent and makes for a pleasant experience as you progress the story.The story itself is not a linear story such as oh this happens then that happens all the time. It's moreso of there are four paths that you have to clear in order to get to the last boss. Each path has 6 areas (not including the intersection tunnels which really could be considered areas on their own I guess); you can do any of these areas you want at any time provided you have the powers available to progress those areas. Each area has it's own dialogue and specific OST track to go with it.The platforming isn't generally hard but you'll find the bits that are ""hard"" are just literally a bunch of simple platforming but stringed together so that there is a higher chance of human error pressing the wrong button. As you progress each of the four paths you will get a new obstacle to avoid when progressing each new area. I personally like that there isn't anything that is ""hard"" that could possibly annoy you.The combat seems a little left out really, there isn't much to it and many say that you cannot die, however this is false really because you can ""die"" it just plays a short cutscene when you are about to with Elika saving you. Once you ""die"", the monster or boss generally recovers most of it's hp so there isn't anything to complain about there. The combat just consists of blocking, deflecting (blocking at the right time) and then using combos which involve both the Prince and Elika which can do a LOT of damage to bosses.10/10 for me, best game I've played in a while. I did not find anything that really bugged me and the ""problem"" many people  say about the difficulty wasn't there for me as it felt just right; it just meant for me that I didn't have anything that I constantly lost to and it was a smooth playthrough that I enjoyed. The dialogue is fantastic for people who love cheeky and sarcastic humour. The graphics are stunning even in today's standards which is very suprising for a 2008 game. The OST is great and the story is enjoyable.UBISOFT PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL FOR THIS SERIES!!! The Sands of Time trilogy got it's newer game, how about you make a new one for this series!?!?			"

												A game that I really wanted to enjoy but overall felt like it fell short of the mark. The storyline was mediocre with a meh ending. The combat and some of the abilities (especially the flying ones) were very frustrating at times. Even the voice acting was not that great. Really, you couldn't get someone besides Nolan North to do the Prince's voice? It's such a unique and highly used voice now that it kind of pulled me out of the game.I think the most frustrating part of it all is this game really feels like it had a lot of potential. The artwork and graphics are quite pretty (except during the weird glitches). The music was quite lovely even though there wasn't much of it. It was a Ubisoft game without Uplay. Jumping around was even quite fun albeit a little repetative. I wish I could say more positive things about the game but even my compliments sound like complaints. I would only recommend this game if it was on sale and if you really really enjoy platform games.6.5/10.0			"

												I was a big fan of the older Prince of Persia games back in the day, so I thought I'd give this one a try. This game is a glorified fetch quest. Imagine Mario where you have to collect every (or most) coins to open up new levels. There is no story to speak of (defeat Evil by collecting orbs) and the characters are flat. The fluid wallruns and leaps of the earlier entries are now scripted, clunky rubberbands. The combat is repetitive and boils down to button-mash/quicktime-event alternations. The game artificially extends gameplay by forcing you to repeat sections multiple times just to collect orbs that appear after you finish the level. This game may have been palatable on PSVita or something similar where the repetitiveness could be broken into 20 minute bus trips, but as such I cannot recommend.			"

												This game had one thing going for it.. ONE. The graphics. Other than that it was a clunky mess that should never have been made. Let me tell you why:First of all: The controls. My GOD is it important to get the controls right when you make a parkour-esque game. They didn't do it good enough. I found an impossible wall to get up to just to proceed further through the game. That is a huge flaw.Secondly: The combat. JESUS THEY COCKED THIS ONE UP! I mean they treat EVERY SINGLE ENEMY LIKE A BOSS! And what is the fighting system based on? Quick time events. I guess Ubisoft hasn't heard what gamers have to say about those (they suck!).Finally: It's unfinished! I found numerous glitches throughout the game. Not only is the controls and combat sloppy as all hell but more than once the game froze on me, i got stuck in a wall or the darn magic thing didn't work! I don't know how they sold this game, but all I can tell you is: Don't do it man! You might be a fan of the series like me but it's terrible. Don't do it man. Just don't.			"

												The only thing this PoP game has in common with any of the others is the name. In all other respects, it's completely different. It's also total, utter garbage. The core element of PoP games is that you have to figure out how to navigate around cavernous rooms, by running up walls, jumping on things, walking on terrifyingly small ledges and so on. This game chucks all of those mechanics away and has you spending most of your time flying around using magic (basically, press one button to fly through the level without really doing anything).Avoid. Avoid even if it's discounted. Avoid even if it's free. I would literally have to be paid to play this again.Unfortunately the review system here only gives me a single ""thumbs-down"" as opposed to holding up both of my middle fingers in the direction of the developers.

												Gorgeous enviroment and atmosthpere, unique fighting style, captivating and beautiful soundtracks, and amazingly well done parkour mechanics. The game hits me with a bit of nostalgia and the Prince in this game actually reminds me of Dante from Devil May Cry for being hilarious and egotastical.The downside of it however, there's a huge lack of characters within' the game, huge lack of enemies as well. Some of the fighting and movement animations are pretty stale or doesn't look well at all (like the flying animation and when you parry the hunter's attacks) Some Audios within' the game are out of context or just sounded weird (like how Elika's moan like she just got a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but suddenly her voice mutes halfway through.) The last complaint i have for it is how the ending of the story was. You don't get to chose to bring Elika back to life or to walk away. And the bring Elika back to life ending is pretty bad as well considering that our whole mission of the game was to stop an angry god from being brought to life only to release it for the sake of a person which makes the motive of the game kinda pointless. overall, i give the game a 6/10. It's good but just not good enough. I really hope they'll make a sequel to this game as well.			"

												Pretty game. Aside from that it balances on a really thin line between ok and awfull. I mean the game is REALLY PRETTY and I love the overrall designs, both the world and the chars. HOWEVER, despite how awesome some of the new platformer mechanics are, NO ONE should be forced to go through the same paths over and over and over AD ETERNUM! So the game keeps a good job on entertaining but more often than it should, it makes you realize that you are wasting your time by forcing you to do some boring as hell task, aka collect orbs. Already expecting something like this to happen I collected as many orbs as I could without straying from my path throughtout the game, and it seems that wasn't enough. Sure I got my first power without a problem, but what about the second? For that one I had to collect orbs, since I barely had half of the required ammount! Screw this! This sort of playtime extending technique is something rarely forgiven, and not always despised in two situations: a) They are made interesting and hilarious (Saints Row 2 POOP AVENGER XD) b) The game is for some reason compelling, on either Story or Mechanics. POP fails in both and at the same time unjustly compromises it's strong point: World Design. Would you pay to see the tip of the Mount Everest once? Probably yes. What about a second time? Perhaps if it was good. And what about another 20 times? HECK NO. POP combat mechanics are ridiculous. POP exploration mechanics are ok, but the whole no risk I'll just grab you back up thing kills the mood. POP story is overral bad or at least lacking the urge to know more. POP is an ok game, but it doesn't live to the Sands of Time Trilogy. Now those were AMAZING! P.S. Btw, the dlc is storywise important, and it's only available on the consoles -_-			"

												Have you ever played a game that, at its end, tells you to undo all the progress you have done? Have you ever played a game that makes you hate the protagonist for a terrible decision that ruins everything?This game has quite possibly the worst ending I've ever seen. To add to that, the combat is terrible, and the free-running is more akin to quick time events with level design set-dressing. Most of the 'running' is automated actions that take place after your button pushes, which then dutifully waits for your next button push to do the next portion of the predetermined free-running animation. Awful game. I'm glad the franchise is dead.			"

												You will not shake the feeling off that this game is only half finished. Yes, it starts off very good and you love but the closer to the end you get the more primitive and absurd the game gets. + this game has an artofficial increase of game's length.  For example the game will you give completely non contextual plaforming which will be Ctr+C + Ctr+V platforms one after another. I know it's the point of platforming but this one didn't take any effort after the first sections. It's like...the first sections of the game are done and the rest is ...well.. done very poorely to say the least. I did not finish it because the game started to just waste one's time after 1/2 of it was done. Not even dialogues matched the situations that were happening.   I loved the characters though. They WERE very well written until I finished 1/2 of the game. After that I was thing countless times ""why did you say that? That had no contextual input whatsover.""  Exagerated example: -How do we get up there? -I don't know-Maybe we should..-Bananas! -what? -The temple ....I'm sorry..-WHAT?!  I'm not even kidding. It's like HALF of the game was cut out and thrown in the dumpster because of some ""awesome"" manager. 5/10 - because only half the game is done. Or at least it feels like it. I said nothing about the bad controlls because every PoP had bad controlls and well.. it's the way it is. If the game is good, the controlls won't bother you. Here - they did.			"

												It's not bad but it's not great either.  It tries to go heavy on story but fails to pull me in.  The gameplay is very simple and easy.  Impossible to die and the computer will greatly aid in landing your jumps.  About half way through the game everything got old.  Not sure why I finished it thru to the end but I did.  The ending is terrible.  The ending fight boss is equally bad.  Nothing challenging about it or the entire game.  Wanna spend 5 bucks for a game to pass the time...this would be worth it.

												I have to say this ranks in as #2 among the games I have played with the acronym of PoP.  Of course, the only other game I have played with the acronym PoP was the incredible EverQuest: Planes of Power, which had a hell of a lot more princes than this game, and also some princesses, but no Persia or Persians.  When you fight monsters in this game you mostly just hold the right trigger and sometimes press the blue button on the Xbox thing, whereas most monsters in the superior PoP required at least 5 players and sometimes 30 to even attempt.  This game also does not have Spirit of the Wolf, making running painfully tedious.   All in all I give this game a -30000 (out of ten).			"

												Prince of Persia 2008 game is a complete revamping of the classic title. Forget everything u knew about the action paced platform game and be ready to submerge in a more urban exploring and item gathering prince of persia game. After 12 hours of gameplay with minimal action in terms of gameplay and oc another 15 mins long ending credits sideshow which oc u cant bypass, i was left with mixed feelings for this particular title. In terms of graphics and platform gameplay this prince of persia title delivers like few games in its category. The puzzles are not that hard but they arent also very easy and the whole open map world is breathtaking especially when u manage to ""heal"" the area u are currently playing. In terms of action its very lacking and its minimal fights make it even worse. Repetitive monotone action once in every area, with the spam of 4 buttons makes that field really disappointing. All and all it felt like a game for more mediocre to lower age fanbase world. If u like platform games then u should definetely buy it. If u loved the previous games and action is your thing then by all means DONT buy it!!!			"

												Stripped down, and boring, this is not the best game in the franchise. If you really want to climb cliffs and jump around like an exceptionally cool monkey, while collecting lots of things, you'll probably enjoy this game for awhile. The voice acting is pretty stellar, and the story is servicable. The world is a little bland and boring, but it has it's charms. It's certainly not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't think I can honestly recommend it to anybody. If after everything I've said you still think you'll like it, go right ahead, but if this blurb turned you off of it, then you're probably better off doing without.			"

												Can't really reccomend this one. Mind you I only played it a little bit but it felt so repetitive that I got bored pretty quickly. Up to this point (3 hours in) whole game consists of a) fancy acrobatics, b) lots of orb collecting, c) occasional fights. Ubisoft streamlined the experience, which is by no means a bad thing but here I felt that it was overdone. There is very little punishment for failing and rewards are minimal. On a positive side I liked fairy tale setting and visuals that hold up even today. PoP is an enjoyable game if you don't set your expectations too high. Perhaps I will return to it one day.			"

												Well, to summarize things first: I've clicked on ""Recommend"", but you mightwant to be careful. It's a somewhat weak recommendation.It's a decent game overall, and it's also worth going through all thedialogue. The look is pretty, the music didn't annoy me -- in fact, Irather liked the rarer pieces.However, the game is split into 4 main areas, each with 4 sub-areas to""heal"" and a final boss area. And this is where things get repetitive-- a lot. All of these areas work the same, repeating the sametemplate over and over again, although they look different to someextent.There aren't a lot of enemies -- which is good, because you get thesame ones over and over again. In fact, by the time you get to theboss area, you've fought the boss 4 times already, and the boss areawill just give you a longer fight of the same, usually split into 3parts.I also consider the combat to be annoying, but luckily it's justtedious rather than impossible. Most fights need a lot of luck, and Ifailed most quicktime events which means it drags on evenlonger. Nonetheless, sooner or later, you'll succeed. The good thingis that you don't die; when you do, the enemy merely recovers somehealth but you can continue right away.I liked the lightseed-collecting parts a bit more. After you'vefinished the objective in an area, the dark and grim area turnsgreen and sunny, and you get to free-roam through it to collectlightseeds.There are 45 of these in each area, but you don't need to collect themall -- you need 540 to complete the game, out of 1000 to befound. Many of these are obvious and are just lined up along the way,some are slightly hidden or require a bit of trial-and-error toreach. Nothing frustrating, although I had to just take a leap offaith in a few cases as I just couldn't find the last seed in an areaand started to just randomly jump into blind spots.Having Elika around does provide the opportunity for dialogue, whichhelps a lot to keep the game from getting boring. As far as her setupgoes, she's neither stupid nor comic-relief -- in fact, one has towonder why she even bothers following you around. I do see a potentialsetup concerning the end of this particular series, though, so that'sok.Also, you character basically doesn't change at all. During the game,you (or Elika, actually) gains 4 powers, but these aren't like spellsor skills -- they are more like keys to be used on specifically markedspots, which will then move you to another fixed spot in the area. So,by the time the end credits roll, you character looks the same and hasthe same abilities that he had in the intro.The story basically has two endings, with the first one being what onewould expect given how everything was set up. If you continue throughand past the credits you get to play a part that could best bedescribed as setting the stage for the sequel -- which neverhappened. I played through it, of course, but I consider it to benon-existent as far as the story goes.So, overall, if you are looking for a not particularly difficult gameand don't mind doing the same things in slightly different scenarioswhile getting a decent but not particularly unusual story, this one isworth to consider. It also helps if you don't mind collecting somelightseeds.I got it at something like -80%, which is definitely ok :-) "

The graphics are wonderous to behold and platforming and combat are much more intuitive, but the downside is they're all a touch too simple and almost completely without penalty if you fail.

												Having never played any of the previous installments of this franchise, I approached this game with no expectations. All I knew about this game was that I could climb stuff. While I've heard that this sequel strips away all complexities of previous game mechanics, I still found it highly enjoyable.My biggest gripe about this game would be that you cannot die. Should you find yourself falling into a bottomless pit or bleeding to death, your lady friend will revive you. This safety net deterred me from ever taking the game too seriously. The feeling of peril was nonexistent, and thus, excitement was nonexistence.Fortunately, this game makes for some great, mindless, slashing fun. Combat is done with a combination of button presses for different attacks. Of course, finding the perfect recipe discourages trying new moves. The visuals are stunning, especially since it's the same engine for Assassin's Creed. Prince of Persia is not a must buy, but worth checking out.Grade: B			"

												I played Prince of Persia since the first games on pc and always liked the solitude and immersion in it. I enjoyed playing this one both on my xbox 360 and on pc. It's relaxing and fun. Some secrets might make you crazy trying to find them if you don't look after the solution and I'd say that those who will find everything without cheating are good players in my opinion. A few light seeds are uneasy to catch but  people who love games that requires extreme skills might get bored though I believe. This game must be appreciated like an entertaining movie where you are the actor.			"

												As a fan of Sands of Time, Warrior Within, and Two Thrones, the only way I can describe this game is disappointing. The storyline, platforming, and combat mechanics of all three previous games completely outshadow this installment in the franchise.Throughout my first playthrough of this game, my experiences have been completely and utterly repetitive to the point where I am almost falling asleep in my chair from boredom.Oh! Lookout! I better dodge the enemies attack! But...wait...why should I? I take no damage from enemy attacks, and after a ""killing blow"", Elika, the companion to the prince, leaps to my aid (even when bound by corruption) and saves my life without any interaction from myself.Wow, climbing this tower looks fun, and challenging! On second thought, no it's really not. I pressed Y on my controller 5 times and now I'm at the top, fighting the mini-boss, which I will now subsequently have to fight 4 more times, all the while being spammed by mindless quick time events, which are meaningless since I take no damage and cannot die even if i fail them miserably, or completely take my hands off of the controller during the fight.The bottom line is, if you want to create a game for a mindless zombie that requires no skill and has no depth, then you create this game.If you enjoy difficult gameplay with tense platforming sections, and a combat system that you can subtly master throughout play to pull off that extremely rewarding combo, please, go purchase Warrior Within. You will no enjoyment here.At least there's Nolan North :/			"

												A pretty face hides a shallow heart.An exercise in repetition and tedium, Prince of Persia ignores the properties of risk and reward in favor of battle mechanics that amount to button mashing and canceling out whatever color of defense the enemy has up with no fear of death. This includes the platforming segments. Slip up, and you just start again at the flat platform you where on a few yards away. And then there's the dialogue. Mighty God above the dialogue. The very being of spoken force is a golem of snark. Constructed from every snappy comeback and crappy action movie hero, it bores deeply into the sane mind eroding away every last bit of class and tact one could hope for in a game so richly layered in artistry. Artistry that only proved to be skin deep. All this amounts to an ending that totally undermines the point of playing in the first place (Unless you fork over the cash for the DLC ending).Don't pick this up for more than 5 bucks or if you -really- like pretty environments and are willing to ignore the mountain of underwhelming parts.

												It's a pity that this game is overlooked and maligned, because it is a lot of fun to play and features some vibrant, beautiful visuals at a time when a lot of AAA games feature sludgy brown and grey colour palettes.Essentially a reboot of the series after the much adored Sands of Time games (which Ubisoft ended up revisiting after this game with the interquel, Prince of Persia: The Lost Sands), this title streamlines some of the game mechanics from the previous titles. This is not necessarily a bad thing.In this game the Sands of Time ability is replaced with a plucky female companion, a princess with magical powers who can assist the Prince in combat against mystical adversaries. For better or for worse, her powers also prevent the Prince from falling to his death, thus serving a purpose similar to the ""rewind time"" ability from the Sands of Time series of games, but taking away control of said ability from the player. Overall, really fun. Don't overlook this one just because of the ""no death"" feature or the fact that it's a reboot. Sands of Time itself was a reboot of the original side-scrolling POP games, after all.			"

												One dimensional. The parkour mechanic is depressing in the sense that it's not about freedom of movement; it's about executing the right sequence of button combinations to clear a specfic obstacle, which is restrictive. On the plus side, you can't die. You can fail, but not die, which actually makes the game more immersive as you play as the same guy the whole way through, not several hollow, expendable shells of a sprite.Well animated, colourful, somewhat satisfying, fun for what it is.

												The beginning of a new narrative set in the same, or a reboot of the world space began in The Prince of Persia trilogy (I believe it's same world, different area/period). This time, we are met with a rogueish man whom is denoted only as The Prince, and encounters a verbatim princess-slash-priestess as destiny sweeps the two up like grains of sand in a mighty storm.

												This game is a pretty fun romp for the price you pay when it's on sale.  It's basically a 3d platformer with little combat, and it's extremely fun to run around the environment, although you're told exactly where to go by visual cues.  After the prologue, the game gives you 4 different worlds to fix with your partner and you can start basically anywhere once you aquire one of the four powers.  To get these powers you have to collect light orbs from areas after you've ""healed"" them, though these light orbs are in the same track that you used to get to the healing ground so after you've healed one area you'll have to start from the beginning and retrace your steps to collect enough orbs.  I found this repetition annoying but it wasn't game-breaking.The characterization for the Prince and Elika and their interactions are sub-par.  The Prince's personality shines like a white-hot sun where Elika vacillates between anger, compassion, sadness, and flirty depending on which area you're in.  I wouldn't mind so much if it was mixed each time you healed an area, but each of the four main areas had a set emotion so when you jumped from one area to another (which you have to) she would go from flirtatious to sad then back to flirtatious and it just seems scripted and poorly planned for what should be an open world game.  Their relationship never really had me convinced that they cared about one another, which (SLIGHT SPOILERS) made for a disappointing ending.Bottom line, play this game for that parkour platforming itch that another playthrough of Assassin's Creed or Mirror's Edge can't quite scratch, but don't expect much else.

Terrible controlling. It’s so suck that I thought is my xbox controller’s problem.3.     Confusing ending. WTF, does he just save the princess’ life and release the evil god to ruin the world just like her father does? What is the point all of this? -----------however, this is better than 2010’s one (Forgotten  sand) if you ask.			"

												Verdict: You're not missing anything, if you don't play this. If you can get it for cheap and are tempted, keep reading.This is an enjoyable parcour platformer. It won't challenge you all that much, but that's part of the draw. It's more about the flow you experience when you flawlessly make your way around the level in a quick fashion.The characters are fun to have around with their playful remarks every now and then, but it also has it's dark moments. The distinctive art style is nice to look at.The combat is kind of repetitive and not much fun. Certainly not the reason to play this game. Don't worry about the widely criticised ""you can't die"" issue too much though. In earlier PoP games you had to press a button to rewind time, this time they do it for you... no big deal. Again, this is more of a laid back experience.It sure is short. Most evidently, if you're good at moving around. You'll blast through the levels in no time - but again - it's fun to do so. Especially those parts leading up to the boss fights.Technically: It doesn't support DirectInput gamepads, only XInput (XB360 pad). The story DLC was only released on consoles. Stereo 3D is bad (everything at almost the same depth).If all this didn't put you off, do buy it. If you don't expect much, you'll be pleasantly surprised.			"

All the battles were overly cinematic and drawn out, not every battle needs to boil down to some giant arena fight.On a good note however, the amount of characterization, game feel, and graphics were all fairly decent, it just didn't agree with what I thought the game was going to be.

												This is a two-fold spin on the Prince of Persia francise. First and most noticably is the art and graphical style of the game. It's fresh, fun and strikingly beautiful. Second introducing a new prince and princess. With enough investment through dialogue and story advancement you'll be hooked by their personalities. The gameplay is tight and controlled with the combat and death (or lack of and hey all games are doing it now) refined. If you've played a Prince of Persia game please give this a try!			"

												*Spoiler Alert*  The game starts off interestingly enough and for the first hour or so you feel like this is a fun and interesting game. However, you soon realize that you are doomed to repeat the same actions literally over and over and over and over and over and over again.  *Here comes the real spoiler* Once you collect enough light seeds in the game to unlock the fertile grounds (which I think is 540) you don't need to suffer collecting any more of them. As I continued to play the game I thought there had to be something more that would happen after I finished the tedious process of cleansing all the fertile grounds, but lo that seems to be the entire point of the game. You can pretty much get a feel for how the entire game is going to play out right away and then it's just repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, until you end up with a very dissapointing/unsatisfying ending that leaves you wondering why, why did I just waste all that time?

												You know, I think I judged this too harshly when it came out a couple of years back. I suppose my main complaint about it was ""It's not The Sands of Time.""Otherwise, it's a perfectly fun, charming and quite gorgeously attractive game. The more-or-less complete absence of any real challenge is not really a fault; it's a design decision which you can agree or disagree with, but I don't think you can argue that it makes a worse game.Shame the reboot never really took hold and the franchise is now more or less dead; but you never know, there may yet be more to come.Whatever Steam may think, I have played this through to the end, and it was vaguely satisfying; I just wish the conclusion had been made available on PC.

												Out of all the Prince of Persia games I've played this version is still my favorite. I love the art style in this game. Its not your everyday, traditional realistic 3D graphics nor the cartoonish 2D graphics you see. This has more of an artistic, comic book, 3D style to it.There isn't a lot of battle like in the other POP games but I believe the story, characters, and artwork make up for that. This game has lots of parkour in it. But don't be afraid to fail. There is no true death in this game. If you mistime your job, fall of a ledge, or you run out of health, no need to worry. Your partner, Elika, will save you from falling and heal you.Try not to get too attached to the storyline because while this was supposed to be a trilogy, Ubisoft cancelled it (can't remember the reason why). There is dlc available for the game but it only available on the PS3 or Xbox 360. The dlc is also known as the epilogue. This epilogue picks up right after the game finishes and sets the storyline for the second game. You can find the gameplay and cutscenes on YouTube.This game is fully compatible with a contoller. I would reccommend using the Xbox 360 controller because that is what the game commands are shown as.I played this game before I bought my Xbox 360 computer controller and I have to say that I was not disapointed with the keyboard controls. Unlike other games that have loads of commands to use this game is simple enough to play with the keyboard and mouse (I do not reccommend using the track pad to play this game). Once you know (and remember) which keys controls what command it gets easier.I never ran into any glitches/bugs or any compatibility issues. I was running this game on Windows 8 with 1.3 GHz. Which surprised me now because when I went back to look the min requirements for this game is 2.6 GHz. Course whenever I play computer games I like to but the graphic settings on low. So even when the graphic settings where on low I still got beautiful graphics. I had lag/decreased frame rate every know and then but nothing that ruined my gaming experince (remember I was running this with 1.3 GHz when it was supposed to be 2.6 GHz)Overall I give this game an 8/10. Give it a shot and try it out! It's a fun game!			"

												Well, I have mixed feelings about this game, which I played once and am playing these days again. I love the graphics, they're really beautiful and artistic. The lead characters are charismatic and their relationship grows in a nice and funny way, the dialogs are fun (the guessing game is really funny) and the story is interesting. The environments can sometimes be very lonely, even a bit depressing when you're exploring them while they're corrupted. Though I prefer Warrior Within's combat system, I think this game's system works well in its own purpose. The ""no-death"" thing is an exageration in my opinion, since you DO ""die"" in this game - the only difference is that the game does not punish you making you do a big part of the way back to where you were, putting you right back to the last ground you stood before falling, for example. There's a lot to explore and nice puzzles, too.BUT...If you like a harder and challenging game, it may disappoint you. If you're expecting for more action like in PoP:WW, it may also disappoint you. If you're a collector like me and likes to complete and/or collect the most possible in a game, know that collecting all the light seeds won't reward you in any way. And though I like the characters and especially the dynamics between them, you won't (as far as I remember) learn much about the hero and why is he the protagonist of a game called ""PRINCE of Persia"".But the most disappointing point - that may even make you angry about the game - is the fact that it does not have an ending. Well, it does, but it seems planned for leading to a continuation, but unlike in WW, which even making way for a continuation, its ending closes the story within that game itself, here, you'll probably feel very angry about the choices the hero makes - and the game just doesn't let you do any other way. The XBOX 360 version has a DLC that's supposed to close the story but doesn't quite do it, just leading to another ""cliffhanger"" apparently, and the PC version doesn't even have this DLC.When I finished the game for the first time (not having all the light seeds) I even thought if I picked up the rest of the seeds I'd unlock some true ending (like in WW when you had the water sword before fighting the last boss), I was totally wrong.To conclude: if you want a beautiful, fun and not so hard exploration game with nice characters and dialogs, buy it. You'll probably like it. But beware the ending will make you ask ""WHY???"" and be mad about being kind of ripped-off of your money for an incomplete story, so you might want to wait for some sale to buy it.			"

												""Run, jump, die, repeat. Run, jump, die, repeat. I'm starting to get the hang of this.""The game's humor is pretty decent, and is willing to take jabs at its own genre and itselfAfter the slog of terrible follow-ups to Sands of Time, this reboot was an amazing breath of fresh air. Back is a fun plot, and wonderful character interactions between the ""Prince"" and his companion, camera is smooth and never unmanageable, and combat is a fun and not overly present grind of an experience. The graphics and atmosphere are wonderful, the voice actors are great, and the music is not awful metal.As a rather nice change of pace, the female protagonist is no longer just tagging along to in cut scenes get through tight spots to open doors from time to time and get damseled other times, but actually aides in battles and the platforming experience. Just watching the two characters interact as they move about the world and fight monsters is great. The game even lets you choose whether to stop and have conversations or not as you want (in many but not all places). The relationship between the characters has a very Han and Leia vibe, but with the ""Prince"" being a slightly less classy Han.Gone are the time manipulation, which I actually found a good thing. In the previous games it was often just being used to be a crippled limited resource reload the checkpoint when making mistakes system, or a way to get timed jumps to be impossible without it and it still being a limited resource. This reboot instead relies on the two characters working together picking up new powers to get past specific case platforming puzzle obstacles. This ties in with the games well done open world, interconnected zones environment in a rather metroidvania style where while the world is open, certain places cannot be gotten to without having collected the right powers. Here in this PoP the games places the four travel powers out as choices and you the player get to decide in which order you pick them up using the light seed ""currency"" collected throughout the zones, and there is far more of these light seeds than are necessary to buy all four travel powers making 100% completion optional rather than required. This ability to choose which zones to do in which order does not make it so that all zones are equally hard, as the game seems to scale the difficulty of fights and adds more platformer hazards in various forms of corruption as each major section of the game is completed.the story and plot are fairly nice, with the results of the final confrontation leading to playable scene as the credits roll, which then leads to a choice past the credits of either just turning the game off and walking away, or taking an option the devs left for you there and getting a little cut scene. It would have been nice to have been given a little cut scene for both choices, but for some reason the dev team thought otherwise. "

												A very simple yet enjoyable story, delivers likable characters. Gameplay while also simple makes it easy to enjoy the beauty of the games visual.Yes you can not die but this helps to cut away loading time whenever you fail (if you even do) long platforming sequences.Yes the combat is only one on one (one of two) but the ammount of combos you can do it very well in depth and some of the later enemies require you to use paticular attacks before you can use other moves.Sadly because of a lot of negitivity when this game came out the story ends and will never get a proper conclusion it deserves.

												In 2008, Ubisoft breathed new life into the classic, amazing franchise known as Prince of Persia. Instead of prolonging the Sands of Time trilogy, which, I might add, ended perfectly, they created a new hero, a prince in name only, voiced not by Yuri Lowenthal, but by Nolan North. The story is great, the graphics are INCREDIBLE, and don't get me started on the music. Stuart Chatwood and Inon Zur have done it again! There is a lot of controversy over the fact that you can't die, but I myself kind of like it. It allows me to enjoy the superb art direction without worrying about getting that jump right.In summary, get this game!			"

												Of all the PoP games this is the one I feel most comfortable with control wise. I always found the other titles a bit awkward sometimes which doesn't help if its a part platform game. I found the artwork and music score very much Prince of Persia with some mesmorising visuals. Sometimes it feels like I am playing through a story that could have easily come from the Arabian nights. I won't drop any spoilers about the plot but I will say that this game is fair to those that make mistakes. That makes a welcome change and it gives you the confidence to go forward and experiment.A worthy PoP title for both veterans and newcomers.			"

												I got Prince of Persia 4 (the 2008 'reboot') in a pack with the other PoP games for $10. It seems safe to say I've got my monies worth. Although this one lacks the sheer ""wow factor"" that the first PoP had upon its release, the 2008 reboot does ambiously innovate in its own ways. There are gameplay mechanics that will frustrate, even irritate you at times, and by the end of the 15 hour campaign it begins to border on repetitive--but other aspects of the game really stand out. Amongst these are the unique water-colour graphics, the incredible sound-track (one of the best I've ever heard), the excellent voice-acting, and an exceptional ending; probably in my personal 10 best of all time. I don't want to give anything away, but it had me thinking, and that's something few games accomplish these days. It's not the best game I've played in the last year, but it does some things better than most, and it is one of the most ambitious and unique, something that I respect in an increasingly saturated ""appeal to the lowest common denominator"" market. Thank you Ubisoft Montreal (makers of  Assassin's Creed) for taking that chance. The gaming industry needs developers to take more chances on games like this, even if they aren't a complete success in every regard. If you get the chance, pick it up. You'll be supporting creativity, and treating yourself to a pretty excellent game too. 8.2/10.			"

												Another reboot to the long live Prince of Persia series. This nobleless Prince comes with spectacular presentation and fantastic visual design. This time the Prince is not alone, all the time, he'll be accompanied by magical princess, Elika, who will help him with everything from traversing landscape to rescuing him from certain death. Fighting to restore peace and purity to the world as the evil god try to taint and completely dominate. Prince of Persia is way too easy because the protagonist is virtually invincible, there is no dead, game over or any punishment. Combat is so climatic and cinematic with memorable and distinctive enemies. You can make a chain of combos similar to free-form combat even though it's always one on one fight, it's still fun. Traveling game world is never get old, now you can roam more freely and more gravity-defying than any previous Prince of Persia. Even though the game is not so great, this new Prince is worthwhile to have an audience with. "

												A game that has not aged well........Quick Overview: Prince of persia released in 2008 as a reboot of the series as well as attempting a new look which worked out well for them. Visually the game looks beautiful and artistic, but that is where the positives practically end. The story was a modest attempt at bringing something new to the series but undoes itself and everything the player did.Gameplay: Marketed as letting you choose how the adventure unfolds seemed to be the main selling point for this game and is ultimately what causes a lot of the shortcomings you experience. compared to many games now a days (2015) the upgrade system is simplistic and adds nothing to the story or gameplay. you gain upgrades (total of 4) by clearing 4 areas. the upgrades do not add a layer of combat, ability or skill to the game but are rather plaques placed around the game that allow you to explore or reach areas previously unlocked and on a preset path. Unlike other games (i.e. Megaman series, Metroid series, or the more recent Batman series) in which upgrades were tied to the story, expanded your combat interaction and strategy when dealing with old & new enemies, as well as reveal previously innaccessable areas; Prince of persia sits content to make upgrades only usable in a small number of locations, and powers that have no real relation to the story or game (minus one power that lets you run along walls on a preset path, almost like a rail segment). Enemy types are rather simplistic and most of them are the same type of enemy with merely a different skin applied. Bosses offer little to know variation in how you defeat them, boiling down to: counter, strike, use ""x"", ""b"", or ""y"" attacks.The goal of the game boils down to collecting ""light seeds"" to unlock the next upgrade, fight one of the same 4 bosses and move on to the next point. Movement (free running) in this game feels almost prehistoric with many actions feeling almost like a quick time event where you are just pressing a button instead of actually maneuvering around the environment. compared to many free roam game out there (assassins creed, mirrors edge) the free running and acrobatics in this game feel rather clunky and unpolished. add to this the fact that by the second area you have seen everything this game has to offer (minus the severly limited upgrades) you feel more like you're running through the motions than actually playing a gameAll this is due to the fact that the game was designed for you to choose which of the four areas you wanted to explore first; and this is where the game gets hindered. Because the developers chose to provide a sense of open exploration, and make the world ""open"" they didn't change enemy types, difficulty or change much of anything in all 4 major areas. this failure to either not decide how to unfold the story or make a simplistic game was what lead to further downfalls. By the second area you are basically just rinse and repeating most if not all your actions. Mario 64 provided more gameplay and that game came out in 1996STORY: The story is almost an a copy paste of the heroes journey at the beginning but provides almost no motivation for the characters and gives no growth to them throughout the entire journey; even undoing everything you had worked for by the end of the game.You start off as some lone wanderer looking for his donkey (which apparently was carrying a load of gold) you bump into some woman on the run, and for some reason (because she's pretty I guess) you give chase and help her. you then stumble across a plot in which only you can help save the world from darkness. That is as cliched as you can get, not even a denial of the call, just straight into the action with no motivation or explanation of who these characters are and what drives them.Even worse is the dialogue throughout this game which proves to be repetitive, bland, and full of corny one-liners that make me hate the main character more than actually relating to him. Again because the world was made ""open for players to choose their own path"" some dialogue between the two main characters feels out of place, with dialogue that should happen later in the game happening early in; and dialogue later in the game sounding like they just met.The ending is the straw that breaks the back of this camel, when you are forced to undo everything you had worked to accomplish during the game because the writers believed that at this point you felt invested/cared for the female character. They don't give you a choice, they make you destroy everything you worked for, and that doesnt work if you don't feel connected/invested in the story.VISUALS: the only upside to this game is the look. The change to cell shaded works well with the art style of both the world and it's structures as well as the look of the characters. The enemies have a stark contrast to both the world and it's inhabitants giving them an almost lovecraftian design. Thats really it, of all it's downfalls the games only positive aspect is the visual style. everything else is a half-♥♥♥♥♥ mess of the designers not taking enough time to think about a varying sort of gameplay that would work well with ""free roam"" world they created.

												Prince of Persia (2008) was a reboot of the Prince of Persia franchise with a new protagonist as the hero. It was meant to lead into a series of games, but due to poor fan and reviewer rerception this didn't happen. I initially brought the game with some trepidation, but find the game an atmospheric, mesmerising experience. However there are flaws in the game.In reviewing this I will try to avoid spoilers, as I want people to enjoy the story for what it is.The game title is a bit of a fallacy, as the hero is a bit of a rogue in the story and does not seem to have any of the royal background of the Prince from the Sands trilogy. However while initially disliking the guy, as I played through the story he grew on me.The background essentially is that during the opening ""tutorial section"" of the game an Evil god, Ahriman is ""freed"" from captivity and spreads corruption throughout the land. It then becomes your job to ""aid"" the Princess Elika in cleansing the land of corruption prevent Ahriman regaining his full strength and escaping the temple where he has been imprisoned.Elika is a constant companion in the game. following you assisting in the fights and her magic powers are both a key to cleansing the ""Fertile lands"" of corruption and traversing each of the four main areas of the game. Each area is governed by one of four corrupted bosses. The Hunter, the Alchemist, The Concubine and the Gaurdian. Initially only four starting areas are available to you as Elika no access to the magic to access the fertile lands anywhere else. In each of the four areas, you are introduced the the Aforementioned bosses. After traversing the areas obstacles and jumps, and defeating the corrupted, Elika is able to cleanse the area which transforms the land from desolate wasteland to vibrant lush greenery, and activates ""light seeds"" throughout the specific area to collect. Collect enough lightseeds and you can return to the temple courtyard to activate one of four powers. This then enables to traverse deeper into the land to further cleanse it, and therefore reteive new seeds to unlock further powers.You are not restricted in the order in which you unlock the powers, so essentially each playthrough can be a slightly different experience. This is due to the fact that as you progress against the four corrupted leaders, they gradually unleash other obstacles to overcome throughout the further levels. Once you have cleared all four sections of a bosses area. You are able to access a final fight with the specific boss. Defat all four and you return to the temple to finally defeat Ahriman.It should be noted that although you need the four powers to access the fertile grounds, that you are able to traverse the outskirts of every area at the start of the game. This is required as the powers only access limited areas. Elika will tell you which areas as you ponder the power to use. As you clease the Fertile Lands, you eventually are able to teleport between cleansed areas to reduce travel using the map screen. The map screen will also allow you to set a waypoint so that Elika can use her magic to guide you should you become lost.The ""Prince"" is an agile fellow, with a gauntlet to help him climb and slide down walls and traverse ceilings, and wall running abilities and jumping to boot. Couple that with Elika being able to assist him by boosting some jumps with her magic and saving you should you fall, or fail in battle. And he needs it to as the lands require all of his acrobatic skills to traverse the fantastical obstacles. This however brings to light the difference between Sands of Time and this game. In The Sands of Time you were traversing a Palace corrupted through the Sands of Time being unleashed. Each are felt ""real"" and that it could exist in a fantastical sense. The World of this Prince of Persia although well constructed is filled with floating islands and walls. A lot of the jumps require timed button presses to continue traversing the area. Fail and Elika will save you and return you to the first bit of flat land and the start of the sequence you failed.The final bugbear is in some of the fighting. Generally your combos are ties to Sword, Gauntlet, and Elika's Magic. Dodge with the jump button is occasionally required, but can be hard to pull off. In general you block as necessary with a timed block allowing you time to counterattack. As the game progresses, the corrupted introduce powers that require you to learn and counter with the correct move. Failing to use the move will mean that you will be unable to damage the corrupted and Elika can even be taken out of the fight requiring you to manuever to help her recover. Some enemy attacks can only be countered via quicktime button events, including manic button mashing (specifically needed for one particular boss every time you fight him, but occasionally used elsewhere).However you are aside from the four bosses you are limited to essentially only one other main enemy combatant throughout the game, albeit combat in general is used sparingly. The rest of the additions throughout the game are new obstacles to dodge in the corrupted lands. Once cleansed the focus is re-traversing the areas to figure out how to get every light seed within the game. No new obstacles are introduced into the cleansed areas. Although it can be fun to get the lightseeds it can also feel boring as there is no further combat in the cleansed areas.So why do I recommend it. Story and Visuals and Sound.The story (penned by Rhianna Pratchett) is charming and compelling and a the relationship that develops between the Prince and Elika is a joy to behold. This is further enhanced by the visuals which use a cel shading technique throughour the game. The visuals are clear and detailed with a lot of effort put in. As you cleanse each area the corruption is replaced with bright colours, blades of grass evident with a multitude of flowers and butterflies. The interaction between the Prince and Elika is further cemented by little things such as the way they change places on a thin ledge, how he will help her up in certain circumstances.Elika is not just eye candy however. she is truly an equal partner to the Prince. At no point is she relegated to escort duty, she never gets in the way and is crucial in the fights and puzzles as the game progresses. Sound through the game is beautiful. My last playthrough was on Windows 10 with a Creative Soundblaster Z and a Logitech 5.1 Surround Speaker set. I was suprised to find the eax dll within the game files. (The game only supports Windows Vista or later). Previously I had played on an Asus Xonar DX on the same speakers. With my current setup, positional sound was very clear, the music which Arabian themed is mesmerising ramping up and settling down as the situation demanded. Some people clain to have issue with sound using Realtek onboard sound cards, but as I have always played the game using discrete soundcards.The story, graphics and sound all combine to produce an incredible atmosphere in the game which compells me on. I am on my third playthrough still enjoying the atmosphere immensely.That said, due to the mechanics the game does lack challenge. (I miss the days when you were actually required to stay alive to complete the game). You will fall, but Elika will always save you. This can make it frustrating in one of the last levels as you are in is constantly retried again and again. The resolution is limited to 1920x41080 maximum and graphic options are accessed through the game launcher. (There is a way to edit the Windows registry to enable you to play at 4k resolutions. and my last playthrough has been entirely at a 4k Resolution). Keyboard and Mouse or Xbox 360/ONE controller can be used to play the game and the keys are rebindable. (I recommend playing with a controller as this is my preferred method for this style of game).			"

												I got this game on PS3 in 2010 for 5 dollars. And from that I like this game, even today. But I don't know if I could really recommend this for everyone. To collect 1001 light orbs, backtracking and repetive acrobatic elements are sometimes painful and anooying to sit through. You don't have to collect all 1001, but the reward is two alternative costumes for the Prince and Princess, that what I heard somewhere are prototype or alpha versions. I enjoyed the atmosphere with the middle-eastern architecture, music, character design and combat system. The story is not bad, nothing much else to add than it's simple and easy to follow. I'd recommend this game to you if you love adventure games. "

												Started out not liking this game very much, but it quickly grew on me, and by the end I was sorry it was over.  Definitely recommend to play.- definitely need to play with controller.- camera can go a bit wonky sometimes, but no more than other games like this- story started out boring, but got way more interesting as time went on- combat was fun, and much easier once I figured out the timing of attacks- once I got the hang of traveling, it was a LOT of fun figuring how to get from point A to point B.- pretty environments, and interesting level design- good voice acting, and liked the chemistry of actors- jumped to my death a billion times due to sometimes twitchy controls  (but nothing that I’d consider too unfair.  and without minor death penalty, simply a matter of re-trying.)

												I prefer Sands of Time but I still enjoyed this game a lot. After Sands of Time I gave the next two games in the original trilogy a miss because I wasn't interested in the darker, more combat driven direction the series was going in.  I love the visual style and the banter between the Prince and princess in the version. Collecting the light seeds and traversing the world was the best bits for me, the combat was tedious and am glad that there wasn't that much of it.I never really like hack&slash sword-based combat in games anyway. Although I said that I prefer Sands of Time over this that is because of the level design and story, not the combat. The combat in Sands of time accounts for about 50% of the game whereas in this I think it's more like 30%.I had no problem with not being able to die, it was refreshing actually and kept me in the sweet spot of gaming. I have noticed a bug with my game though. In one section of the game the light seeds continue to respawn. It doesn't allow you to cheat however since they don't add to your multiplier, they just make it very difficult to tell whether you actually have all 45 in that area. Luckily I succeeded and gained all 1001 light seeds.FYI, this game has FULL controller support. I give this game a solid 8/10 "

												Fairytale from ancient Persia with some of its mythology. The game is painfully easy, you basically cannot die. Experiencing free running around the game world is satisfying and fullfilling. The visual art style is simply amazing with nice effects changing dark/tainted areas into beautiful places is always nice to look at. More artistic than gaming experience.			"

												Zerei pela 2ª vez, a 1ª foi no piratex logo que o jogo foi lançado, gostei e comprei. Eu particularmente gostei do jogo, gostei dos gráficos e jogabilidade, muitos não gostaram porque nesse jogo você nunca morre, eu achei isso legal, devido ao excesso de plataformas, se não tivesse esse esquema, o jogo seria muito entediante, já é meio entediante pela monotonia, mas para mim os cenários e gráficos compensaram.A história é rídicula, é aquela ♥♥♥♥♥ do babaca que se apaixona pela piranha e faz cagada, tirando esta ♥♥♥♥♥ que é a história eu recomendo o jogo.

												I finally got a chance to play this gem, and I really liked it.  The game is beautiful, and the platforming and combat mechanics are a lot of fun.  There's a focus on climbing and jumping, which I like, but still enough combat to keep things interesting.  The gameplay can get repetitive, but each area is worth exploring.  Gathering light seeds slows things down a bit.  I like hunting down as many as I can find, but once you have a certain amount, you can move on if you like.  There's no need to gather them all.Overall, the story is good and unfolds nicely.  The ending is good too, but may leave you wanting more.  In fact, there is more... an Epilogue DLC that didn't make it to PC (thanks Ubisoft).  You can play it on console or watch it on YouTube.  I wish I could say the Epilogue ending is better than PC, but it's not.  In any case, this game is well worth your time.TIP: If the loading screen is slow or stuck, try turning on V-Sync in the launcher settings.			"

												This is an amazingly beautiful game.  The visuals are amazing, and the art direction and style is superb.  The sense of motion it gives, especially once experienced in moving around, is amazing.  The quick ability to recover should you get a little crazy and fall is also welcome.  Combat is sparse, though cinematic.  The normal enemies are not too difficult, but the bosses are each unique and interesting.  Again, every piece of this game is pure pleasure for the eyes.			"

												Loved the Celshadding art style, the combat was full of awesome & varied combos, the addition of the claw gave even more ludicrous wall moves, the story was good tending to great & the sarcastic humor between him and the princess was very amusing =)Only thing that kinda of bothered me since it makes the game lets say ""easier"", was the rescue action when you fall, even if it was given a plausible reason for it on the story.

												So another one of the new Prince of Persia gen games. I gotta say right outta the start that yes, I am a bit dissapointed about the difficulty level.  The game series carries quite a legacy and reputation, the prince series was one of the few games that taught me to have fun with a game even when sometimes is infuriatingly difficult.Most people say that Dark souls gave them back something they really missed from 2D games, actual hard challenge, to me that game was ""Prince of Persia 3D"" (the Mattel one) it was so hard to advance and at the same time so adicting because of the combat system and the feeling of achieving something every level you completed.So OK this one is easy, insultingly easy for any game actually (and more so for a PoP) since Elika (your partner) ALWAYS saves you, does not matter if you fall of a cliff or are about to have a sword jabbedd on your ♥♥♥ for sucking at combat SHE. ALWAYS. BAILS. YOU. And that is the main issue with this game, I dare say the only one.The game looks great, the graphics are (to my liking) very nice and it gives a completely lively atmosphere. The combat system  is very enjoyable, it reminded me a bit of PoP 3D, and though you canot lose I loved the combos and coop with Elika.Talking of Elika, the BEST parts of this game are both related to her, the simple (but good) storyline and the small interactions and dialogues with Elika, they are lovable.About why I really liked the story (even though is quite straightforward) is the ending of the adventure. I wont spoil the ending, but I really loved it because it breaks a very known cliche in videogames and books in general and it earned my respect for that.The interactions with Elika during the story and the scenarios are great, it builds up the character, make you really care for them and gives a lot of interesting tidbits of both the Prince and her. I also loved the small animations on they have during in the gameplay (like when the Princes carries her in the vines and ask her not to press his neck too tight, or when the prince catches Elika after climbing down a wall) those details really make the characters stand out and feel more lively.In general I enjoyed the game but I feel I would have loved it if the difficulty level was upped a lot more and if the combat system added longer combos (relying more on reaction time) and more variable enemies (every battle is a duel, there are no mobs and they mostly react the same except for the bosses)			"

												I haven't played the other Prince of Persia games yet so I don't understand why many people hated the game. It is a fun involved game, which by the way, is also quite challenging the first playthrough. Some Quick Time Events were brutal for me but left a satisfaction not many games leave for me even with their extensive achievement systems. The freedom to choose how you progress your skills is relieving I noticed the scenery changes dramatically as you progress and I'm sure I checked out every corner for those light seeds :0 After you beat the game you are left with so free roaming exploring for light seeds and let me tell you finding all  1000  light seeds (without a guide even!) before facing the last boss was thrilling  My only gripe with the game is that the epilogue DLC found on consoles wasn't ported onto PC so after finding a friend who still had Prince of Persia and playing it with them I see no good reason why it wasn't released after all this time. * On a side note, how often do you find a GOOD content DLC for any story-oriented action game?In short the game is worth picking up and chilling out to for a few days but after beating it I found hardly any replay value beyond maybe the music and climbing up high and looking down at everything.**ALSO play this game with a PC controller. I usually hate using controllers if I don't have to but it does help a lot in quick combat situations when I NEED to mash the button. I'd rather replace a controller than my keyboard with some nice colourful backlights. "

												A gorgeous, and somewhat casual, experience.  This is a shining example of how far the 'norm' of game design has evolved.  Once an brutal game untimely demises, then a game about rewinding said demises, now a game where you cannot die whatsoever.  This is definitely a game more about an experience than a ""game"" in the traditional sense of the word; 'Passive Beauty' is a good way to put it.  There isn't any real urgency felt as you deftly navigate the worlds and bosses, but it lets you absorb more of the visual artistic grandeur that lies in this world.  The characters begin to show some semblance of depth and witty banter, but I wish the story-telling matched the artful execution of the world.  In the end it's as lighthearted as the death-free combat, which is too bad, because it's the weakest link in this otherwise stellar reboot.			"

												The 2008 entry in the Prince of Persia series has a strong visual aesthetic and an impressive pedigree, but lacks gameplay worthy of either. At first glance, the ruins-crawling action seems to be on par with other standouts of the genre, but the gameplay quickly begins to feel repetitive and linear. The platforming is especially limited by the removal of the death mechanic - as soon as you miss a jump, you are transported back to the begining of the obstacle. This has a profound limit on the choices available to the player, as all paths are essentially reduced to on-rails quick time events. Combat is sparse and incredibly shallow, and since you can't die, it feels like more of a chore than anything. Most of the difficulty in this game comes from cheap tricks rather than clever design, and the handful of puzzles are all variations on using a lever to rotate things until they line up. Toss in an underwhelming story to boot, and you've got a frustratingly mediocre game.  C-			"

												Out of all the Prince of Persia games I can really only recommend three. The original classic, Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, and this one. They are pretty good 3D Platformer Puzzle games but there are a couple flaws.  The storyline is decent but isn't going to win any awards. Combat is lackluster with the exception of Boss fights which are interesting the first couple times you run through.  The puzzles are more an exercise of your platformer ability than your reasoning (which is a shame - I'd like more complex puzzles).  But the games still manage to be pretty good (at least the three that I listed). Of the three I'd say Two Thrones is the best simply because it introduces a new mechanic that really changes the game and thus makes it more interesting.			"

												A game that has not aged well........Quick Overview: Prince of persia released in 2008 as a reboot of the series as well as attempting a new look which worked out well for them. Visually the game looks beautiful and artistic, but that is where the positives practically end. The story was a modest attempt at bringing something new to the series but undoes itself and everything the player did.Gameplay: Marketed as letting you choose how the adventure unfolds seemed to be the main selling point for this game and is ultimately what causes a lot of the shortcomings you experience. compared to many games now a days (2015) the upgrade system is simplistic and adds nothing to the story or gameplay. you gain upgrades (total of 4) by clearing 4 areas. the upgrades do not add a layer of combat, ability or skill to the game but are rather plaques placed around the game that allow you to explore or reach areas previously unlocked and on a preset path. Unlike other games (i.e. Megaman series, Metroid series, or the more recent Batman series) in which upgrades were tied to the story, expanded your combat interaction and strategy when dealing with old & new enemies, as well as reveal previously innaccessable areas; Prince of persia sits content to make upgrades only usable in a small number of locations, and powers that have no real relation to the story or game (minus one power that lets you run along walls on a preset path, almost like a rail segment). Enemy types are rather simplistic and most of them are the same type of enemy with merely a different skin applied. Bosses offer little to know variation in how you defeat them, boiling down to: counter, strike, use ""x"", ""b"", or ""y"" attacks.The goal of the game boils down to collecting ""light seeds"" to unlock the next upgrade, fight one of the same 4 bosses and move on to the next point. Movement (free running) in this game feels almost prehistoric with many actions feeling almost like a quick time event where you are just pressing a button instead of actually maneuvering around the environment. compared to many free roam game out there (assassins creed, mirrors edge) the free running and acrobatics in this game feel rather clunky and unpolished. add to this the fact that by the second area you have seen everything this game has to offer (minus the severly limited upgrades) you feel more like you're running through the motions than actually playing a gameAll this is due to the fact that the game was designed for you to choose which of the four areas you wanted to explore first; and this is where the game gets hindered. Because the developers chose to provide a sense of open exploration, and make the world ""open"" they didn't change enemy types, difficulty or change much of anything in all 4 major areas. this failure to either not decide how to unfold the story or make a simplistic game was what lead to further downfalls. By the second area you are basically just rinse and repeating most if not all your actions. Mario 64 provided more gameplay and that game came out in 1996STORY: The story is almost an a copy paste of the heroes journey at the beginning but provides almost no motivation for the characters and gives no growth to them throughout the entire journey; even undoing everything you had worked for by the end of the game.You start off as some lone wanderer looking for his donkey (which apparently was carrying a load of gold) you bump into some woman on the run, and for some reason (because she's pretty I guess) you give chase and help her. you then stumble across a plot in which only you can help save the world from darkness. That is as cliched as you can get, not even a denial of the call, just straight into the action with no motivation or explanation of who these characters are and what drives them.Even worse is the dialogue throughout this game which proves to be repetitive, bland, and full of corny one-liners that make me hate the main character more than actually relating to him. Again because the world was made ""open for players to choose their own path"" some dialogue between the two main characters feels out of place, with dialogue that should happen later in the game happening early in; and dialogue later in the game sounding like they just met.The ending is the straw that breaks the back of this camel, when you are forced to undo everything you had worked to accomplish during the game because the writers believed that at this point you felt invested/cared for the female character. They don't give you a choice, they make you destroy everything you worked for, and that doesnt work if you don't feel connected/invested in the story.VISUALS: the only upside to this game is the look. The change to cell shaded works well with the art style of both the world and it's structures as well as the look of the characters. The enemies have a stark contrast to both the world and it's inhabitants giving them an almost lovecraftian design. Thats really it, of all it's downfalls the games only positive aspect is the visual style. everything else is a half-♥♥♥♥♥ mess of the designers not taking enough time to think about a varying sort of gameplay that would work well with ""free roam"" world they created.

												Prince of Persia (2008) was a reboot of the Prince of Persia franchise with a new protagonist as the hero. It was meant to lead into a series of games, but due to poor fan and reviewer rerception this didn't happen. I initially brought the game with some trepidation, but find the game an atmospheric, mesmerising experience. However there are flaws in the game.In reviewing this I will try to avoid spoilers, as I want people to enjoy the story for what it is.The game title is a bit of a fallacy, as the hero is a bit of a rogue in the story and does not seem to have any of the royal background of the Prince from the Sands trilogy. However while initially disliking the guy, as I played through the story he grew on me.The background essentially is that during the opening ""tutorial section"" of the game an Evil god, Ahriman is ""freed"" from captivity and spreads corruption throughout the land. It then becomes your job to ""aid"" the Princess Elika in cleansing the land of corruption prevent Ahriman regaining his full strength and escaping the temple where he has been imprisoned.Elika is a constant companion in the game. following you assisting in the fights and her magic powers are both a key to cleansing the ""Fertile lands"" of corruption and traversing each of the four main areas of the game. Each area is governed by one of four corrupted bosses. The Hunter, the Alchemist, The Concubine and the Gaurdian. Initially only four starting areas are available to you as Elika no access to the magic to access the fertile lands anywhere else. In each of the four areas, you are introduced the the Aforementioned bosses. After traversing the areas obstacles and jumps, and defeating the corrupted, Elika is able to cleanse the area which transforms the land from desolate wasteland to vibrant lush greenery, and activates ""light seeds"" throughout the specific area to collect. Collect enough lightseeds and you can return to the temple courtyard to activate one of four powers. This then enables to traverse deeper into the land to further cleanse it, and therefore reteive new seeds to unlock further powers.You are not restricted in the order in which you unlock the powers, so essentially each playthrough can be a slightly different experience. This is due to the fact that as you progress against the four corrupted leaders, they gradually unleash other obstacles to overcome throughout the further levels. Once you have cleared all four sections of a bosses area. You are able to access a final fight with the specific boss. Defat all four and you return to the temple to finally defeat Ahriman.It should be noted that although you need the four powers to access the fertile grounds, that you are able to traverse the outskirts of every area at the start of the game. This is required as the powers only access limited areas. Elika will tell you which areas as you ponder the power to use. As you clease the Fertile Lands, you eventually are able to teleport between cleansed areas to reduce travel using the map screen. The map screen will also allow you to set a waypoint so that Elika can use her magic to guide you should you become lost.The ""Prince"" is an agile fellow, with a gauntlet to help him climb and slide down walls and traverse ceilings, and wall running abilities and jumping to boot. Couple that with Elika being able to assist him by boosting some jumps with her magic and saving you should you fall, or fail in battle. And he needs it to as the lands require all of his acrobatic skills to traverse the fantastical obstacles. This however brings to light the difference between Sands of Time and this game. In The Sands of Time you were traversing a Palace corrupted through the Sands of Time being unleashed. Each are felt ""real"" and that it could exist in a fantastical sense. The World of this Prince of Persia although well constructed is filled with floating islands and walls. A lot of the jumps require timed button presses to continue traversing the area. Fail and Elika will save you and return you to the first bit of flat land and the start of the sequence you failed.The final bugbear is in some of the fighting. Generally your combos are ties to Sword, Gauntlet, and Elika's Magic. Dodge with the jump button is occasionally required, but can be hard to pull off. In general you block as necessary with a timed block allowing you time to counterattack. As the game progresses, the corrupted introduce powers that require you to learn and counter with the correct move. Failing to use the move will mean that you will be unable to damage the corrupted and Elika can even be taken out of the fight requiring you to manuever to help her recover. Some enemy attacks can only be countered via quicktime button events, including manic button mashing (specifically needed for one particular boss every time you fight him, but occasionally used elsewhere).However you are aside from the four bosses you are limited to essentially only one other main enemy combatant throughout the game, albeit combat in general is used sparingly. The rest of the additions throughout the game are new obstacles to dodge in the corrupted lands. Once cleansed the focus is re-traversing the areas to figure out how to get every light seed within the game. No new obstacles are introduced into the cleansed areas. Although it can be fun to get the lightseeds it can also feel boring as there is no further combat in the cleansed areas.So why do I recommend it. Story and Visuals and Sound.The story (penned by Rhianna Pratchett) is charming and compelling and a the relationship that develops between the Prince and Elika is a joy to behold. This is further enhanced by the visuals which use a cel shading technique throughour the game. The visuals are clear and detailed with a lot of effort put in. As you cleanse each area the corruption is replaced with bright colours, blades of grass evident with a multitude of flowers and butterflies. The interaction between the Prince and Elika is further cemented by little things such as the way they change places on a thin ledge, how he will help her up in certain circumstances.Elika is not just eye candy however. she is truly an equal partner to the Prince. At no point is she relegated to escort duty, she never gets in the way and is crucial in the fights and puzzles as the game progresses. Sound through the game is beautiful. My last playthrough was on Windows 10 with a Creative Soundblaster Z and a Logitech 5.1 Surround Speaker set. I was suprised to find the eax dll within the game files. (The game only supports Windows Vista or later). Previously I had played on an Asus Xonar DX on the same speakers. With my current setup, positional sound was very clear, the music which Arabian themed is mesmerising ramping up and settling down as the situation demanded. Some people clain to have issue with sound using Realtek onboard sound cards, but as I have always played the game using discrete soundcards.The story, graphics and sound all combine to produce an incredible atmosphere in the game which compells me on. I am on my third playthrough still enjoying the atmosphere immensely.That said, due to the mechanics the game does lack challenge. (I miss the days when you were actually required to stay alive to complete the game). You will fall, but Elika will always save you. This can make it frustrating in one of the last levels as you are in is constantly retried again and again. The resolution is limited to 1920x41080 maximum and graphic options are accessed through the game launcher. (There is a way to edit the Windows registry to enable you to play at 4k resolutions. and my last playthrough has been entirely at a 4k Resolution). Keyboard and Mouse or Xbox 360/ONE controller can be used to play the game and the keys are rebindable. (I recommend playing with a controller as this is my preferred method for this style of game).			"

												It's a positively beautiful game that is fun to play. Some places are easy, some are pretty hard, together it makes a balanced experience. I find the whole concept of cleaning the world from corruption very appealing, I wish it could be done outside of the game as well. The visuals are great, the voice acting is superb, dialogs cheer you up with humour, the female companion is pretty, overall I find it an enjoyable experience. I thought it's mostly for a younger audience, it looks so console-ish. But when you play, it's all fine, and fights are fun, especially since you can't exactly ""die"". Lots of cool movements and tricks you can pull with the enemies. Just as you're getting tired of jumping and performing acrophobic acrobatics, there comes a fight for a change. A few dialogs afterwards ease the tension. A few last boss fights are rather exhausting, as they are full of quick time events, and you must remember which symbol corresponds to which button to press. But when you master it, it can be fun, but maybe too enduring. Unfortunately, the game doesn't quite end, because of a DLC that was never released for PC, only for consoles. But if gaming for you is a recreational activity, I can recommend this one. It won't wear you down as much as it will entertain. It is pretty long, took me 35 hours to finish it. Now I wonder if I should buy PS3 just to play that DLC...			"

												Beaten half of the game ATM, and I'm absolutely loving it. Yes, it's far too easy. Yes, you can't die and furthermore, not punished for mistakes. Yes, it's repetitive, especially with light seeds farming. But everything else... Man, it's a ♥♥♥♥in' masterpiece.Artstyle is absolutely gorgeous, reminding classic Disney animations. Animations look really smooth and natural.Music... don't even get me started, I could easily listen to OST while driving with pleasure. Characters are really nice written, with protagonist making me laugh with his friendly banter towards Elika. I often was just standing and spamming 'Talk' button. Also, Elika contending for the waifu spot for me.Gameplay... well, little amount of fights, low difficulty level and often automated move... I mean, it's not bad, but also not brilliant and stands out a little, compared to other elements of this game. And... flying sucks. Also, QTE are leaving too little time for reaction, making them annoyingSeriously, if you haven't played it yet, go buy it. For 6€ at sale it's a steal, and a must-have for everyone. This game is so diffrent, yet superior compared to PoP Trilogy, which i liked....Seriously, go buy it. Now. As a memorial of times when Ubisoft wasn't ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												Do You remember when You started the Sands of Time for the first time? That glorious felling of being pulled into a great adventure beyond your imagination? Then treasure it and don't let your brain overwrite it by this game.    While bearing the name of the good old running, jumping, climbing trees with occasional monster fight game it is no like it. You are playing as a thief, badly written, pseudo-funny thief, who got lost in a sandstorm and runs in to a girl , magical girl, who is a princes of totally made up kingdom with absolutely overdone looking architecture which looks like paintings that have all been draw with one move  making spirals and more spirals every time... and because you are a bad thief, you decide to help her. So You must save the kingdom from the darkness by finding the four bosses, defeating them over and over with no significant change of environment throughout the whole game.    Do You like collectables? When you have to collect thousands pieces of something just to gain reward, then guess what. You can't finish this game without collecting all the thousand pieces of something, because You need them to unlock a way to get to the bosses. But there is nothing else to do either because there is absolutely minimum of story. And only distraction while running through the plain wasteland of the game map are the conversation between prince and the magical girl, so poorly written that You'll stop paying attention to them after 5 seconds. In comparison with previous instalments of the Prince  the running, jumping, climbing trees is much better in this one. It has been made faster and bit more vivid, but the fact that environment does not change throughout the whole game makes that totally pointless. The time powers are gone, replaced by spiderman wall running, and even when we knew that not every prince of Persia must control time it seems kind of silly that every time you fall the magical girl pulls you back up from the midair like nothing. Battle system is even more boring, allowing you fight only one enemy at the time with no acrobatic kill moves making it only more painfull.    Do Yourself a favour, don't buy it. Go play Sands of Time. And if You want to run, jump and climb trees like this thief-prince, The Forgotten Sands are still a better option than this. XD			"

												First review on steam, didn't expect it to be a Prince of Persia game.Note: Didn't play much on steam as of this review, but I played the game a lot on the PS3 version back in the day, so will base some of my experience based on that as well.Presentation:Prince of Persia with a Fantasy Twist. This version of the prince of persia is by far the most stylised and unique compared to all the others. The way this game presents itself to you, is a Disney (gaming) experience for adults. That is the best way I can describe it.Concept:The game is a mixed bag of a Third Person Action, Adventure, Platforming, Hack n' Slash, Quick Time Events (Heavy), and RPG elements (Lite), with such a large mixture of so many genres it could have easily went wrong, but for the most part it works. No complaints here to be fair. The concept of such a vast multi-genre game works well.Graphics:Cel Shaded graphics, I didn't like this art style choice of graphics when I first encounted it, my first experience being Valkyria Chronicles for the PS3, but I started to realize and appreciate the style the more I played. After Valkyria Chronicles I started getting interested in other games with a similar art style described as a ""Water Cooler ~ Painting Canvas"" and not longer after  VC, Prince of Persia (2008 aka The Reboot to the PoP Series) also adopted this art style.What Cel Shaded graphics lack in realistic nature and textures, it makes up for in design and beauty, if done right it can be like a playable painting, of which both Prince of Persia and VC both are. What makes Prince of Persia unique in comparison though is that it is made by Ubisoft, a english canadian/french developer/company (I think?) while VC and other such games tend to be of Japanese or South Korean origin, a non-asian game of this style makes it extra unique and enjoyable because very few outside of asian developers tried it, at least in the late single digit 2000's.From a technical standpoint for PC players, I noticed this game is not graphics intensive, only ever reaching 50c max with this game (GPU) and that is with 2 of my 4 case fans turned off and I haven't cleaned out the dust (what amount there is) in my rig yet since i built it early last year so 50c with those conditions seem pretty decent in my opinion.Sound:The Sword Slash SFX from the Prince sounds very nice, something right out of Soul Calibur V with [Realistic Sound Effects] tuned on +3 (max), from blocking to slashing to counter attack to parrying. The voice acting is great, Mr. Nolan North is always good at what he does, while Kari Wahlgren is an even better video game voice actor than her anime roles which is considered to be very good.The music is great, although it could have used more tracks to mix things up a bit.Entertainment:The action I liked, the adventure aspect is lacking (It is free roam, however the world isn't as vast as it appears), the platforming is fun, it is easy for the most part but can get very annoying at times, not really hard but it can irritate. The Quick Time Events happen quite a lot, they were fun on the PS3 version, but on the PC version they seem more of a chore to keep up with, mainly because I keep forgetting the keyboard control layout.To be fair, if this game turned out to be a straight pure action hack n' slash with platforming elements and a dash of rpg elements it would have worked out well, the game technically has hack n' slash gameplay but it is of a non-traditional sort, it is very combo intensive and precise timing is everything. Makes it fun because of the challenge factor.Honestly I remember having a lot more fun with it when I played on the PS3 back in the day, it still is fun now but the magic simply isn't there like the first time, kinda like your first kiss.Replay Value:Low. Plain and simple, you can unlock most skins from the start with a quick bing or google search for the codes, the only skins that are unlock are elika's beyond good and evil outfit and the beta outfits for The Prince and Elika, the latter of which is the true prize since Elika's Beta outfit looks much more aesthetically appealing (to us lads anyway, dat' bra/jacket) compared to her normal outfit, The Prince's beta outfit looks decent as well (White/Black with a Final Fantasy finish) although i prefer his blue/red scarf design since the two colors make purple, my favorite color.What makes this bit worse on PC compared to PS3 is that this game doesn't have any form of in-game or steam achievements! Normally I don't care if a game has achievements, trophies, medals whatever, but for single player games like Prince of Persia it really extends its replay value somewhat, which adds more value to the overall experience. Dunno' why this game doesn't have steam achievements at the very least since it has been out since 2008.Story:Pretty good, I like where the writers went with this specific prince of persia game compared to all the others. It has a more original fantasy feel that you'd normally experience in a japanese rpg game or something from miyazaki, something very refreshing and original from a non-asian developer, credit is truly deserved in this regard.The Main Protagonist: The Prince is my favorite version out of all Prince of Persia games, he has a laid back additude, combine that with Nolan's voice acting a you have a very likable and relatable character and a great protagonist. His side-kick princess is pretty neat as well, I don't care all that much for lead female protagonists but side kick status lasses are usually good in my book. The Synergy and Chemistry between these two characters work extremely well, from their unique interactions and conversions throughout the story you as the player will give a damn about them and want the heros to win!Although the ending to the game is still junk to this day, they never did continue this new version of the Prince games as well for some reason which is a shame.Gameplay:Various genres appear in this game.Action | Fun, Quick, Unique.Adventure | Lacking.Platforming | Fun, Easy most of the time, Hard some times.Hack n' Slash | Many combos, Skill Tree with many branches, Precise timing, High skill level.RPG Elements | Very lite, Fun, Casual.Conclusion:Game is great, best in the series, only Sands of Time comes close and even then this game has a lot more charm.Special Steam Note | Got this game for $2.50, what a deal! I do not remember Steam having these sort of deals back in the day!THE GOOD*Fun Gameplay all around*Good story albeit a bit cliche'*Likable and Relatable main protagonist: The Prince*Great voice acting, even if it is only a handful of characters*Beautiful cel shaded styled graphics, PC makes it look even nicer than the PS3/360 versionsTHE BAD*Platforming can get glitchy*Lacking in game and steam achievements*Final reward skins take very long to unlockScore:9/10 ~ Highly Recommended "

												This is quite possibly the most underrated game of the previous generation. Most people shunned it because of how much it shyed away from the SoT Trilogy but this is a spectacular game in its own right. Starting with the story, this is one of the best written games of last generation, and its simple to play. While the combat system might be dumbed down for previous PoP titles, there is still a plethera of comboas to try and land with this games combat system. Toss in the spectacular character development and interaction between Elika and the Prince, and the beautifully rendered environments. This game is sure to please.			"

												Not the hardest game in the traditional sense of the word because of the known game's take on in-game death, yet in terms of gameplay, story, and artistic vision, it's topnotch. The game is divided up between two different characters. One that you directly control, the Prince, and the other that is a semi-controlled, support character, Elika. As for the gameplay itself, it is divided up into two sections: Platforming, and combat. The platforming is pretty much what you would expect from a 3D platformer, but at a more rhythmic, slower pace than a blisteringly fast one like most 3D platfomers out there. The combat more so resembles that of 3D fighting games such as Soul Calibur than what you would expect from a 3D action game. Yet just like the platfoming itself, the combat has a strict rhythmic combo system that makes it all come together, and a joy, when your combos string together properly. Besides the two main sections of the game, you also have the task of collecting the sole in-game collectibles called ""light seeds"". These light seeds more or less act as experience points: Unlocking new abilities, new areas, as well as progressing the overall story. While it may be tedious at times for those who don't enjoy collecting, it isn't too bad because of the game's excellent platforming making it a pleasure just to move around. The last noteworthy thing is the game's superb graphical style. Even today, in 2014, the game still looks absolutely jaw-dropping with an excellent artistic direction that makes the game looks almost like that of a living, breathing, painting. The same praise can be given to the game's soundtrack as well with it's relaxing scores, to the more active ones.Overall, in my opinion, Prince of Persia (2008) is an excellent game in every sense of the word, and if you don't mind an easier, more relaxing game than it's predecessors, then there is a lot to love here. Yet even if the toned-down difficulty should turn you off, it still shouldn't deter you entirely from what is an excellent experience. Highly recommended.			"

												I feel like this game had potential, it feels kinda ""meh"" and eventually dropped my interest.I originally had this for PS3 before I switched to PC. I stopped playing it for a while, saw this game on sale and thought ""hey, i liked this game, I guess I'll pick up on it again"" and I quickly remembered after an hour of gameplay why I stopped playing this in the first place. But first let me adress why I got sucked in.The characters are very well done. The protsgonist looks cool, fights cool, and probaly smells cool. His assistant is a ...uuh... mage magic lady that magics stuff and magics enemies and magics you to save you and help you get across certain areas. Thats awesome.Combat is interesting, I really liked it and its one of the things that really dragged me into the game. You can switch up what kinds of moves to make, and do different combos at your command. Swing your sword, grapple the bad guys, throw them up in the air and have magic mage lady...uh...magic them! Sounds good so far eh?World Exploration killed it. After you beat the tutorial part, you can ask magic lady to show you the path to the boss, which is very usefull considering you can veer off your path easily and go in circles without her help. BUT once you beat this boss, that helpful guide option is no longer available to you, which destroyed the game for me. I climbed and fought and ran and fought and climbed some more with more climbing and a few wall jumps here and there and before I knew it I spent almost an hour running in a giant circle, with fighting 5-6 enemies in between. Realizing that I just threw away an hour of just climbing obsticals assasins creed style (the climbing and obsticals are VERY simular) with a minute long fight in between, I felt dissapointed. I could've usied that time to save starving African children.Overall  6/10			"

												This is a two-fold spin on the Prince of Persia francise. First and most noticably is the art and graphical style of the game. It's fresh, fun and strikingly beautiful. Second introducing a new prince and princess. With enough investment through dialogue and story advancement you'll be hooked by their personalities. The gameplay is tight and controlled with the combat and death (or lack of and hey all games are doing it now) refined. If you've played a Prince of Persia game please give this a try!			"

												Definitely not the same, as the other franchise's games, yet the concept in this one is done absolutely amazing. First a bit of unusual and you guess that it will become boring, yet no, it won't. Good job over designing levels, some places are recognizable as repetitive, but they are very rare. As for me - a fresh breath for this franchise, one I won't regret paying for and enjoy re-playing. Must I repeat that design is phenomenal? Something really colorful, yet not even a drop of annoying. Every minus (like a not very original plot, but the game doesn't need it) is crossed out by the good designer's job. Really enjoyed to see the world of this game.			"

												7/10Almost six years after its release i decided to give this game a try, and im glad i didnt let it get lost in my ever growing steam library. The game is heavily focused on the story and interactions between the main two characters, the Prince and the Princess and honestly does a good job keeping the player entertained and willing to continue the game further. It has good dialogue that can be initiated when ever throughout the game keeping things interesting.Visually and phonetically this game is beautiful. Even six years after its release. Very well done and will have the player just exploring and fixated on the beautiful environments. The environments play a vital role in the games experience and i found myself having appreciating the level of detail put in to this game. From scenery to character interactions it will most surely put a smile on the players face, with probably of the utterance of ""NEAT!""Combat is where it falls short. The game is built with only several combat scenarios, enjoyable indeed they are but perhaps having an extra few random encounters with enemies would of made it more enjoyable and appealing to others. However, the game is more story orientated and does excel in that so if action is something than can be sacrificed then this game may very well appeal and satisfy.I say give it a try!

												Despite loving the Sands trilogy, I always felt like I was following a very specific, very controlled path, which had only one way of completion. Even so, it was all very fun, most of the time.Prince of Persia takes that kind of platforming to the extreme. It's much more streamlined, but still very enjoyable most of the time, thanks to good (not perfect) controls, stellar animations and beautiful levels (and graphics in general, really).The combat system has cinematic confrontations in mind first and foremost, and allows only for one on one combat. At times it is fun, at times it is frustrating and sometimes it's simply there.The Prince is Nathan Drake this time around, but that's not really a bad thing, considering that particular character archetype is easily enjoyable. Also, you will appreciate the relationship him and Elika develop throughout the game (if you're the kind of person to appreciate that stuff, anyway).As for the story, or rather, the ending, my interpretation is that how it ends is up to the player, so keep that in mind.Overall, good game.[It's a shame the Steam overlay doesn't work with this game, it's great screenshot material]			"

												I give it an ""eh"" for effort. Nothing special here.  The gameplay is a series of platforming ""chains"" that must be completed or you need to restart.  You get a couple of fights along the way, but its all platforming for the most part.  And by ""a couple"", thats what i mean. Literally one ""minion"" as you enter each new area, (which you can ""cancel"" if you get to the warp-in fast enough"" and boss fights.  It's like combat was an afterthought.  The platforming was amusing, but it rarely gets tough or tests your reflexes. Your main character does most things automatically, just waiting for your input based on special triggers.  Someone obviously thought this would be a fun game, and built an intriguing storyline, but then the execution utterly failed.  Don't be fooled by the pretty graphics, playing Prince of Persia: Sands of Time trilogy would be a much better use of your time.  And yes, the ending is terrible.			"

												The beginning of a new narrative set in the same, or a reboot of the world space began in The Prince of Persia trilogy (I believe it's same world, different area/period). This time, we are met with a rogueish man whom is denoted only as The Prince, and encounters a verbatim princess-slash-priestess as destiny sweeps the two up like grains of sand in a mighty storm. I heavily enjoyed the game, despite the easy combat, and need to travel. The narrative therein is one to be remembered, and expanded on, hopefully soon.			"

												'Big bad' God Ahriman is breaking out of his tree-prison and covering sidekick Elika's kingdom with 'corruption'. To put the cork back in his bottle you must bust out your very choicest pakour and cleanse all of the 'fertile lands' across the impracticality designed kingdom. For reasons that may or may not involve Elika's hip to waist ratio, our #Edgy Prince decides to tag along. 	You're left to explore a relatively non-linear overworld. You're free to choose in what order to clear levels, but ultimately they must all be cleared and they all follow an identical structure. Climb to fertile land, fight boss, cleanse land. All too quickly, you settle into this routine, and the cycle goes unchallenged throughout the entirety of the game. So much so that you get diminishing returns; no matter how satisfying it is at first to return a fertile ground to it's prettier, greener version, after cleansing 20 areas they all begin to blend into one and each feels less rewarding than the last.	Levels do their best to stand out. Sometimes the stage's boss will interfere, flooding the level with corruption, destroying structures around you or polluting the air. This would've added texture to the game but none of it ever has any impact on gameplay, and amounts to nothing more than decoration. Nonetheless, during these sections Elika and the Prince will dutifully play along with the developers, acting as though these facades are serious issues.	You can't die, Elika will save you no matter how bad you ♥♥♥♥ up. This completely undermines any potential tension. My play style soon veered towards recklessness as there was no reason to be attentive or careful, mistakes are never punished. On the other hand, this feature means the flow of the game is uninterrupted and creates a relaxed and pleasant mood when parkouring across the land.	Combat is stiff. You never deal with more than one opponent at a time. The prince has suddenly lost all acrobatic ability and is fixed to the ground, confined to four attacks and combos. Compare to The Sands of Time wherein combat was more intrinsically linked to the prince's parkour abilities, and there was often space to get creative when tackling many foes. The combos look great though, and parrying attacks is satisfying if sometimes unreliable. When you screw up and need Elika to save you the enemy regains health meaning if you're struggling these fights can go on for a long time. 	Once you've cleared a level, 'light seeds' appear across that level, requiring you to backtrack through the area once or twice to gather them. Despite the transparent effort to extend the game, the most immersive platforming takes place during these searches. Unlike the mindless tunnel platforming throughout the rest of the game, you must occasionally pause, examine your environment and plan your actions. You'll require exponentially more and more of these seeds to unlock four-colour coded powers that each unlock access to more fertile grounds. Unfortunately the powers are indistinct and unsatisfying to use. 	The red and blue powers are identical and simply propel you from a suitably colour-coded plate to another point (usually another plate). The green power is the most fun, propelling the prince in a straight line up and across walls and ceilings, leaving it to the player to strafe left and right to avoid oncoming obstacles. By far the most obnoxious part of the game, the yellow power propels you into a stiffly-animated on-rails 'flight' around the map on the longest route conceivable to man. If you can see through the ugly obtrusive special affects that border your screen you must dodge corners of buildings and whatever other last-minute obstacles the developers decided to try to run you into. Other times it blissfully propels you across short distances... so works exactly like the red and blue powers again.	Elika handles world building exposition throughout a frequent scattering of cut-scenes, explaining what the different sections of the kingdom were supposedly used for before they became interchangeable slip'n'slides. Her descriptions are inconsistent, vague and fail to lend any much-needed depth to the setting. Character development based dialogue and exposition are confined mostly within optional dialogue snippets available at the press of a button. 	This is an odd way round to do things since the narrative success of the story hinges on you developing an attachment to Elika, and so character development should be the primary focus. Regardless, initiating a conversation on your own terms is fairly immersive and I only wish that the feature had been used more widely to reduce the number of expositional cut-scenes that break the flow of play.	The final battle is much like any other stage, unsurprisingly. The game's narrative twist lies in (SPOILER ALERT) forcing the same choice upon the Prince as Elika's father when he brought her back to life at the cost of freeing Ahriman in the first place. This was a nice opportunity to allow the player to make up their own mind. However, the Prince decides that getting his ♥♥♥♥ wet is the prime directive and the game ends with a disappointing fizzle as you're forced to walk around doing some tree-prison gardening and undoing everything you've achieved in the space of a few minutes. (SPOILERS END HERE)	Apparently there was DLC for the console versions which layered an additional unsatisfying ending over the top in a desperate attempt to reach for a conclusion, but they didn't release that on PC so ♥♥♥♥ 'em.

												The 2008 entry in the Prince of Persia series has a strong visual aesthetic and an impressive pedigree, but lacks gameplay worthy of either. At first glance, the ruins-crawling action seems to be on par with other standouts of the genre, but the gameplay quickly begins to feel repetitive and linear. The platforming is especially limited by the removal of the death mechanic - as soon as you miss a jump, you are transported back to the begining of the obstacle. This has a profound limit on the choices available to the player, as all paths are essentially reduced to on-rails quick time events. Combat is sparse and incredibly shallow, and since you can't die, it feels like more of a chore than anything. Most of the difficulty in this game comes from cheap tricks rather than clever design, and the handful of puzzles are all variations on using a lever to rotate things until they line up. Toss in an underwhelming story to boot, and you've got a frustratingly mediocre game.  C-			"

												Out of all the Prince of Persia games I can really only recommend three. The original classic, Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, and this one. They are pretty good 3D Platformer Puzzle games but there are a couple flaws.  The storyline is decent but isn't going to win any awards. Combat is lackluster with the exception of Boss fights which are interesting the first couple times you run through.  The puzzles are more an exercise of your platformer ability than your reasoning (which is a shame - I'd like more complex puzzles).  But the games still manage to be pretty good (at least the three that I listed). Of the three I'd say Two Thrones is the best simply because it introduces a new mechanic that really changes the game and thus makes it more interesting.			"

												Beautifull looking 3d platformer with okay combat.Prince of Persia 2006 is a reboot of the Prince of Persia franchise and revolves around a new ""prince"". The free-running is more on rails this time, and is more about timed button pressing the steering. The combat is now one-on-one with a large list of combo's which you most of the time won't get to use, due to the enemy blocking.The environments are beautifully cell shaded and look amazing at high settings. The story is pretty good, with the chatter between the main characters being the highlight. Collecting orbs to unlock levels can be annoying, but gives a reason to check out the levels in both their corrupt and cleaned states.The ""epilogue"" DLC available on consoles is missing on PC, but the non-epilogue ending is better anyway, seeing as no sequel to this game was ever released.

The humor is really good and the ending is the type of ending you don't expect, but applaud at. Definitely a game to play even if you aren't familiar with the franchise.			"

												Awesome platforming, fantastic-looking combos and a fairy tale-like endearing story whose ending will get to you. I cared about the characters, their plight and was genuinely moved by its ending and would play through the entire game again with joy.The only possible shortcoming of the game imho is the fact that it's impossible to die as your female companion Elika will always save you. This may put off some players that will resent all the hand-holding but I didn't mind as the gorgeous and diverse environments, fun and clever puzzles and great-looking combat kept me coming back for more.9/10			"

												This is an amazingly beautiful game.  The visuals are amazing, and the art direction and style is superb.  The sense of motion it gives, especially once experienced in moving around, is amazing.  The quick ability to recover should you get a little crazy and fall is also welcome.  Combat is sparse, though cinematic.  The normal enemies are not too difficult, but the bosses are each unique and interesting.  Again, every piece of this game is pure pleasure for the eyes.			"

												This game is practically a gender-swapped version of Sands of Time. The Princess of Persia guides a criminal through a palace struck by a cataclysmic event, commits patricide and does spoilertastic stuff. The UST-laden banter between the leads is as good as ever.

												Prince of Persia 2008 was a great game, a step down from The Sands of Time in terms of storyline and plot, having very basic of both. The combat was rather simple and easy to get a hang of and got a tad repetetive, though with increased challenge as the game wore on which always kept you on edge for the next battle. The winner in this game is the original art, and soundtrack and Elika the improved companion character since the Sands of Time Series. The characteristic wall climbing was well done also. What was nice is that unlike the other PoP games which are mostly dark, this game starts in a dark world that is slowly revived and brought back to life as you play the game, giving you both a dark and a light side to play in, which gave the game an interesting and dynamic spin. Well worth playing if you are into action adventure games.			"

												Out of all the Prince of Persia games I've played this version is still my favorite. I love the art style in this game. Its not your everyday, traditional realistic 3D graphics nor the cartoonish 2D graphics you see. This has more of an artistic, comic book, 3D style to it.There isn't a lot of battle like in the other POP games but I believe the story, characters, and artwork make up for that. This game has lots of parkour in it. But don't be afraid to fail. There is no true death in this game. If you mistime your job, fall of a ledge, or you run out of health, no need to worry. Your partner, Elika, will save you from falling and heal you.Try not to get too attached to the storyline because while this was supposed to be a trilogy, Ubisoft cancelled it (can't remember the reason why). There is dlc available for the game but it only available on the PS3 or Xbox 360. The dlc is also known as the epilogue. This epilogue picks up right after the game finishes and sets the storyline for the second game. You can find the gameplay and cutscenes on YouTube.This game is fully compatible with a contoller. I would reccommend using the Xbox 360 controller because that is what the game commands are shown as.I played this game before I bought my Xbox 360 computer controller and I have to say that I was not disapointed with the keyboard controls. Unlike other games that have loads of commands to use this game is simple enough to play with the keyboard and mouse (I do not reccommend using the track pad to play this game). Once you know (and remember) which keys controls what command it gets easier.I never ran into any glitches/bugs or any compatibility issues. I was running this game on Windows 8 with 1.3 GHz. Which surprised me now because when I went back to look the min requirements for this game is 2.6 GHz. Course whenever I play computer games I like to but the graphic settings on low. So even when the graphic settings where on low I still got beautiful graphics. I had lag/decreased frame rate every know and then but nothing that ruined my gaming experince (remember I was running this with 1.3 GHz when it was supposed to be 2.6 GHz)Overall I give this game an 8/10. Give it a shot and try it out! It's a fun game!			"

												Despite the fact I had tons of fun playing this game, it will be the only Prince of Persia I don't recommend, and I don't recommend it for two reasons:First off, it's not a Prince of Persia game. I get that they were trying to go new character, new kind of story, but really for all the differences between it and the feel of the games in the Sands of Time series, (which this is supposed to resemble), it really just has success by loose association. The platforming looks similar, but feels completely different. Plus, there is absolutely NO way to die. You have a partner with magic powers who will use them to catch you if you fall, push enemies off you before they can deliver deathblows, and pull you out of slime. This turns mistakes into minor inconveniences, instead of a need to restart. In the Sands of Time series, you could stop yourself from dying, but every time you use the Sands means that there's one less mistake you can make somewhere else. In this, Elika has seemingly unlimited power. This means you get unlimited restarts. You go back to the last place with solid ground. The enemy gets back the last round of damage you dealt to it. I think every element of this game is great and that they were all mixed together well. However, at the same time, it didn't feel like a challenge in the slightest. Even the Warrior, who you had to button mash to defeat and if you didn't send him over the edge he'd send you through the floor, never once stood a chance because you could survive ANYTHING thanks to Elika. On the topic of the Warrior, let's talk about the battle system. You had five main enemies to face, and some smaller soldiers along the way. The battle system was rebuilt around the fact you couldn't die. It was a fun battle system, but again it wasn't the free-form battle system I had come to expect from Prince of Persia. Yes, there were combos, but you really couldn't choose your own battle style. There were only two combos that did large amounts of damage: 4 sword strikes, or elika, elika, grapple, jump, elika, sword. Everything else was either there to push enemies into things, or the combos were just too short for damage to add up. Ubisoft could make a killing on a game based around this concept, but I wouldn't call it a Prince of Persia game and the system needs major refinement. Now, for the second thing I didn't like about the game: Story. Until the final sequence at the Temple, I thought it was fine. The intro was a bit weak, but hey, not every game deserves a cinematic. However, this is Prince of Persia. Ubisoft has made the whole series around a theatrical experience, and then they suddenly killed it in this one. Again, I get they were trying to go new hero, new kind of experience, but, as much as I like to bash Call of Duty for not innovating, They at least know that people like to play games with the same title for the same sort of experience. They changed this one a bit too much from the Sands of Time formula. Anyway, back to my problems with the plot. Other than the intro and the ending, it was actually fine. You had four different areas to explore and you could do them in whatever order you wanted. The plotline was built in such a way that it didn't matter which one you went to first. That was nice. However, I had to restart the game at one point because of a thoughtless error on Ubisoft's part. It didn't matter which power you unlocked first. However, the one that you choose second pretty much has to be the one that lets you progress further into the same area you were just in. Which means that you have to face down one boss at a time, four, maybe five times in a row. They make him ""harder"" every time, but it doesn't make a difference because you can't die. I had to restart the game because I chose the wrong second power. The Hunter in my opinion was the easiest to defeat, so I wanted to save him for last. However, becaue I chose to fight him after gaining my first power, it meant I couldn't possibly get enough pickups from the areas I had access to to unlock the third power. This forced me to COMPLETELY RESTART THE GAME!!! Now, I'm gonna try and talk about the ending without any spoilers. The whole game (when I played through the way Ubisoft wanted me to) had a pretty nice flow. You couldn't really get lost unless you found a way to skip cutscenes. So here's pretty much how it goes: weak beginning, good flow, good flow, good flow, good flow, mostly stable climax, panicked platforming sequence, then WTF? As far as I can tell I didn't accidentally choose an alternate ending. Your unnamed character undoes everything you worked so hard for the whole game, and it's not even like one of those ""rewind"" endings. If it was, I might not be so upset. This was an ending where he saves the world, changes his mind, and then ends it. Thanks a lot, Ubisoft! I thought this was supposed to be a reboot. How are you supposed to return to a world that NO LONGER EXISTS????I had fun. I'd probably play again. I just couldn't justify this to someone unless they enjoyed this kind of plot.			"

												This is a solid game, However if you were expecting it to be like the Sands of Time Trilogy like I was you'll be disappointed, but have fun. Its art and music for the game are fantastic, as for the challenge there really isn't any hard moments other then looking for collectible stuff you need in the game later and backtracking alot for it, The combat and most of the challenges are pretty easy. I got stuck on a few parts, but its not too difficult to figure out. I don't like how there isn't any challenge to beating the bosses once you got a few combos down, but you'll be impressed by how it looks. However, despite some of my complaints about it this game is still pretty cool because of how you get around and the amazing fights that look amazing, but if you're looking for a challenge this game unlike its predecessors it doesn't hold up to the task. This game if I had to rate it is an 8/10 "

												This is one of those games that gets everything right. The strategic one-on-one combat, the acrobatic platforming, the open exploration, and the cel-shaded art style are all wonderful here. However, it's the relationship between the Prince and Elika that's the real star of the show; their dialogue, which you can initiate at any time with the push of a button, showcases their evolution from antagonistic to flirtatious to genuinely caring for one another. This game recalls some of the best parts of classics llike Okami, Metroid Prime 3, and of course, earlier Prince of Persia games. Why Ubisoft has yet to produce a proper sequel to this game is beyond me.			"

												Ah Prince of Persia. How this series has plummeted at times and tried to arise like a phoenix from the ashes. This game however, does have some merits. The Prince is not the same one from the ""Sands of Time"" series, but he retains the charm, witty, serious-undertone and proud if not sarcastic manner of his alter version in SoT. The gameplay is brilliant and the cel-shading adds so much flavour to the already classy and stunning visuals. The storyline is strong and you'll want to find out what happens in the end and Erika is cute but capable of holding her own. The combat is nothing like SoT but it's equally as fun, although some battles do get tedious very quickly. Sound? Oh god the music is gorgeous.However the ending was some of a shock to the system and I didn't like it. Also PC Gamers don't get the DLC which is equally as disappointing. Ubisoft didn't follow up on this game so the game is just sitting there making no sense. Overall, nice game but buy the SoT series. Please.			"

Fighting to restore peace and purity to the world as the evil god try to taint and completely dominate. Prince of Persia is way too easy because the protagonist is virtually invincible, there is no dead, game over or any punishment. Combat is so climatic and cinematic with memorable and distinctive enemies. You can make a chain of combos similar to free-form combat even though it's always one on one fight, it's still fun. Traveling game world is never get old, now you can roam more freely and more gravity-defying than any previous Prince of Persia. Even though the game is not so great, this new Prince is worthwhile to have an audience with. "

												I give it an ""eh"" for effort. Nothing special here.  The gameplay is a series of platforming ""chains"" that must be completed or you need to restart.  You get a couple of fights along the way, but its all platforming for the most part.  And by ""a couple"", thats what i mean. Literally one ""minion"" as you enter each new area, (which you can ""cancel"" if you get to the warp-in fast enough"" and boss fights.  It's like combat was an afterthought.  The platforming was amusing, but it rarely gets tough or tests your reflexes. Your main character does most things automatically, just waiting for your input based on special triggers.  Someone obviously thought this would be a fun game, and built an intriguing storyline, but then the execution utterly failed.  Don't be fooled by the pretty graphics, playing Prince of Persia: Sands of Time trilogy would be a much better use of your time.  And yes, the ending is terrible.			"

												This game is practically a gender-swapped version of Sands of Time. The Princess of Persia guides a criminal through a palace struck by a cataclysmic event, commits patricide and does spoilertastic stuff. The UST-laden banter between the leads is as good as ever. Absolutely brilliant art direction, the voice acting is top notch and the gameplay is a nice mix of rhythm game and Assassin's Creed.Damn you Ubisoft for not bringing the Epilogue to the PC.

All the battles were overly cinematic and drawn out, not every battle needs to boil down to some giant arena fight.On a good note however, the amount of characterization, game feel, and graphics were all fairly decent, it just didn't agree with what I thought the game was going to be.

												The 2008 entry in the Prince of Persia series has a strong visual aesthetic and an impressive pedigree, but lacks gameplay worthy of either. At first glance, the ruins-crawling action seems to be on par with other standouts of the genre, but the gameplay quickly begins to feel repetitive and linear. The platforming is especially limited by the removal of the death mechanic - as soon as you miss a jump, you are transported back to the begining of the obstacle. This has a profound limit on the choices available to the player, as all paths are essentially reduced to on-rails quick time events. Combat is sparse and incredibly shallow, and since you can't die, it feels like more of a chore than anything. Most of the difficulty in this game comes from cheap tricks rather than clever design, and the handful of puzzles are all variations on using a lever to rotate things until they line up. Toss in an underwhelming story to boot, and you've got a frustratingly mediocre game.  C-			"

												A gorgeous, and somewhat casual, experience.  This is a shining example of how far the 'norm' of game design has evolved.  Once an brutal game untimely demises, then a game about rewinding said demises, now a game where you cannot die whatsoever.  This is definitely a game more about an experience than a ""game"" in the traditional sense of the word; 'Passive Beauty' is a good way to put it.  There isn't any real urgency felt as you deftly navigate the worlds and bosses, but it lets you absorb more of the visual artistic grandeur that lies in this world.  The characters begin to show some semblance of depth and witty banter, but I wish the story-telling matched the artful execution of the world.  In the end it's as lighthearted as the death-free combat, which is too bad, because it's the weakest link in this otherwise stellar reboot.			"

To collect 1001 light orbs, backtracking and repetive acrobatic elements are sometimes painful and anooying to sit through. You don't have to collect all 1001, but the reward is two alternative costumes for the Prince and Princess, that what I heard somewhere are prototype or alpha versions. I enjoyed the atmosphere with the middle-eastern architecture, music, character design and combat system. The story is not bad, nothing much else to add than it's simple and easy to follow.

												I prefer Sands of Time but I still enjoyed this game a lot. After Sands of Time I gave the next two games in the original trilogy a miss because I wasn't interested in the darker, more combat driven direction the series was going in.  I love the visual style and the banter between the Prince and princess in the version. Collecting the light seeds and traversing the world was the best bits for me, the combat was tedious and am glad that there wasn't that much of it.I never really like hack&slash sword-based combat in games anyway. Although I said that I prefer Sands of Time over this that is because of the level design and story, not the combat. The combat in Sands of time accounts for about 50% of the game whereas in this I think it's more like 30%.I had no problem with not being able to die, it was refreshing actually and kept me in the sweet spot of gaming. I have noticed a bug with my game though. In one section of the game the light seeds continue to respawn. It doesn't allow you to cheat however since they don't add to your multiplier, they just make it very difficult to tell whether you actually have all 45 in that area. Luckily I succeeded and gained all 1001 light seeds.FYI, this game has FULL controller support. I give this game a solid 8/10 "

												I finally got a chance to play this gem, and I really liked it.  The game is beautiful, and the platforming and combat mechanics are a lot of fun.  There's a focus on climbing and jumping, which I like, but still enough combat to keep things interesting.  The gameplay can get repetitive, but each area is worth exploring.  Gathering light seeds slows things down a bit.  I like hunting down as many as I can find, but once you have a certain amount, you can move on if you like.  There's no need to gather them all.Overall, the story is good and unfolds nicely.  The ending is good too, but may leave you wanting more.  In fact, there is more... an Epilogue DLC that didn't make it to PC (thanks Ubisoft).  You can play it on console or watch it on YouTube.  I wish I could say the Epilogue ending is better than PC, but it's not.  In any case, this game is well worth your time.TIP: If the loading screen is slow or stuck, try turning on V-Sync in the launcher settings.			"

												This addition to the Prince of Persia franchise isn’t the worst game made but it definitely isn’t great. It’s entertaining for those that want to play a game with little challenge and looking for something relatively mindless but I wouldn’t recommend this game to anyone who wants anything in depth in terms of characters or story. The best part of the game is the art-style used. It’s a bit more timeless in comparison to the other Prince of Persia games which all seemed to have aged relatively bad over the years. There isn’t much of a learning curve with this game and the game constantly reminds you over and over again how to react to certain situations.There are a ton of things though that make this probably a 5.75/10 though in my book. It’s only slightly better than mediocre and could have been a lot worse. The characters are forgettable and even a bit annoying. The story is clique and I was able to guess the ending almost near the beginning of the game. The ending too left a bad taste in my mouth and is left open for more games but the dlc made was never made available for the pc and the next game in the series is only available on the Nintendo DS. Probably the worst part of this game though is the camera. Oh my god… I never thought a game could make me experience motion sickness until I played this. There’s this skill that Elika uses that makes the two main characters seemingly fly and when this happens the camera does all sort of nonsense by turning every direction. I felt sick at times watching the screen. And when the protagonist has to jump or scale walls, the camera sometimes moves, causing the controls to go in a different direction than intended.As I said, this isn’t the worst game; in fact, it could have been an interesting prologue to a truly unique span of games but Ubisoft isn’t one of those developers concerned with plot. That’s what hurts: this game had so much potential but it only comes off as so-so. Maybe once the whole Assassin Creed phase is over with Ubisoft will revamp this series with better storylines and characters but until then, at least there’s this game to curb some anticipation.  "
