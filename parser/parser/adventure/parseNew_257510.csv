												If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.I can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.It takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the ""main"" puzzles.The graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially ""indie"", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.The things I love about it the most:• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.• Weather effects.• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.• Runs on my Macbook Pro.• Has a free demo.• It's so clever, it feels alive.The things I dislike:• Loud ""Death"" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.• It ends.If you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)			"

												In today’s world of microtransactions, games releasing before they’re finished, glitch-ridden open world engines, and games that overall fail to live up to their artistic vision, sometimes there will come a game that’s so perfect that it’s hard to believe it even got made.The Talos Principle is a single-player puzzle game made with full triple-A production values, arguably leaving Portal 2 in the dust at what it does. I liken it to Dear Esther, but twenty times longer and filled with actual gameplay, while keeping the beauty of the world and the philosophical overtones intact.The game consists of walking through majestic-looking outdoor areas to find closed-off puzzle areas, then solving puzzles using only a small handful of simple and easy-to-understand machines. The puzzles themselves are eloquent and very well-tested. There are over a hundred of them in all, but each puzzle introduces a new idea or uses old ideas in new ways, so they never feel repetitive or stale. The game’s environments are simply breathtaking with their huge draw distances and ridiculous detail, while the puzzle areas feel aptly like claustrophobic rat mazes while never losing the area’s sense of atmosphere. The puzzles get very challenging near the end, but expert level design makes them all very rewarding to solve. And if you’re particularly clever, the game’s third ending requires you to figure out how to break the level design and take items out of their designated areas to find secrets hidden in closed-away or out-of-bounds places. It’s rather mind-blowing and something that I’ve never seen incorporated into a game intentionally before.The icing on the cake is the storytelling. The story is that you’re a robot who wakes up in a garden and follows the commands of a god-like figure constantly talking in your head. It quickly becomes apparent that the whole world may or may not be a virtual reality simulation, which may or may not have been programmed by humans for a specific yet unknown purpose, and you are given the choice of blindly following the god’s orders or trying to unravel the mystery of who exactly you are and what lies outside of the simulation. The game has three different endings, and you will find whatever answer you seek if you search hard enough.The game poses a few difficult philosophical questions and studies them from countless different angles. I know that some people will find the philosophy pretentious and trite, and I know it’s completely up to personal preference, but for me it really, really worked. I was hooked on the story the whole way. I think that even if some of the game’s lines fail to impress you, there’s enough material here that you’ll find at least something that will strike a chord and challenge the way you think. Besides, if you don’t like the story, it’s easy enough to skip everything by ignoring the computers, but you might miss out on the brilliance of some of the game’s endings.I give The Talos Principle a perfect score. It’s got sublime puzzle design, mind-blowing secret collectables, gorgeous environments that put Dear Esther to shame, above-average voice acting, a professionally-written and well-presented story, nearly zero glitches, and depths and depths of content. It’s truly one of the best games I’ve ever played. Go play it if you haven't already; you might come out feeling like a different person.			"

												HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!""The Talos Principle"" is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding gaming experiences I've EVER had and I've been playing video games since the Atari 2600 days.  There is a reason why ""The Talos Principle"" is a hit among critics and the player reviews are ""Overwhelmingly Positve."" For me this is a new classic. A game that catches lightning in a bottle.  One of those games that scratches an itch I didn't even know I had.NOTE: If you think you might get this game, I'd recommend against watching video and looking at player  screenshots. They are both highly likely to contain spoilers and inadvertent puzzle hints, both minor and major.  I only played the demo going into the full game and I feel the experience was better for it.This is a first person, sci-fi themed puzzler in which the player, an artificial intelligence, is left to complete puzzles by using a series of tools that are introduced throughout the game. The first tool is the Jammer, a tool that jams electronic devices and force fields. Another tool connects to and aims laser beams.  You'll also learn that tools can be used in combination, keeping the progression interesting. Solving a puzzle rewards the player with a sigil (tetromino) which are then used as puzzle pieces to unlock new areas when arranged correctly in puzzle mini-games.The only conversational contact the player has is with another AI program that often presents itself at computer terminals as the game progresses. The player is also, through communicating at the terminals and reading information displayed on them, left to ponder the role of the disembodied voice known as ""Elohim"", as well as the meaning of life, consciousness, being human, being alive, free will, and the afterlife. The game itself is solid. Easy and tight controls. Very nice music, sound effects, and voicework. Clean, often beautiful graphics. Intelligent writing. No profanity or violence. Menus with many options like FOV, character speeds, FPS display, time display (something I never used as I chose to take my time), etc. This is a quality ""product"" every way I see it and a fantastic game from a company that respects it's PC customers.Many have compared this to the Portal games, which is high praise. While both offer clever puzzles and a high quality experience, ""The Talos Principle"" only rarely depends on any sort of physical dexterity or reflexes.  With those few puzzles that do require quickly timed movement, even the most casual of players shouldn't have any issues whatsoever. While the presentation and story are high quality, it's really about the puzzles. What makes them so satisfying?  First, puzzles do not need to be finished in an exact order. Leave one alone for a while that you are having trouble with and try again later.  I found it interesting how I'd find myself struggling with a puzzle but after a day or two, the solution would become clear. It was almost ""scary"" when realizing how hard at work my subconscious was. I would also think about certain puzzles when not playing and come up with new things to try out.  I  found myself overthinking many times when the solution was much simpler. Also, just when I thought I had a handle on a ""recipe"" that certain types of puzzles used, the game would throw me a curveball, forcing me to deviate from previous ""patterns"". Some puzzles, even of the harder variety, can be figured out quickly depending on the player's frame of mind, while ""easier"" puzzles (those without numerous elements) can be trickier. You know the puzzles are good when you find yourself wanting to do ""just one more"" before ending a session.  And puzzles can often be completed in more than one way. I found out later that some solutions I used were much much more complicated than they needed to be. This dynamic of overthinking vs. underthinking is what helped make my time with ""The Talos Principle"" so interesting, as well as thinking out a solution before acting vs. using a lot of trial and error at other times. This game also encourages and rewards exploration. There are stars to collect, which unlock additional content in the form of more puzzles and ultimately an additional ending choice (there's a main ending and two possible side endings). These stars are often ""puzzles within puzzles"" and gathering them is rewarding and can be quite challenging. It's not just a matter of ""hide and seek"". For example, a star may be within a puzzle and behind a door (force field). It is up to the player to figure out how to reconfigure his/her solution so that an additional door can be opened. There is also an ample amount of ""Easter eggs"" to find, many of which are interactive and well worth seeking out. Many are references to other games, like Portal 2 or Papers Please. Pink Floyd is honored with one as well.Keep your eyes wide as you traverse the puzzles and worlds. Even just finding ways to exploit the simulation is fun, for example, finding a way to climb over the outer walls of a puzzle and into ""out of bounds"" areas (where there are some Easter eggs to find). Or  ""breaking"" a puzzle by finding an ""unintended route"" to the finish by climbing over a wall, or walking above one. (This accounts for a lot of my game time).""The Talos Principle"" should appeal to a wide variety of players. I spent about 80 hours on my first playthrough and a less thorough playthrough will of course take less time. I then replaid  for 100% achievements (which I usually don't do). I suspect that many of the people finishing Talos in ""20 hours"" are not doing everything (reading files, getting all stars/doing the puzzles they unlock, looking for easter eggs) and likely to be using a walkthrough here and there. You can play this game as you want. Complete the puzzles in order or don't. Do them fast or slow. Solve star puzzles or don't. Don't read every piece of information at the terminals if the story side of the game doesn't interest you. Look closely for Easter eggs or don't worry about them at all. Try out the side endings or don't. The support is very good with developers active on the Steam forums should anyone have issues and updates have been released to fix and add things (like an added special settings menu for ""motion sickness"", a speed time function, additional language support, etc.). This company, Croteam, does it right. You should give them your money just ""based on principle.""NOTE: The demo is also good, yet only a taste of the full game. It ofters a solid introduction to gameplay and some clever puzzles. There is even another free game called the ""Sigils of Elohim"" that is made of tetromino puzzles. Solving them will reward you with codes that are then entered into the menu of ""The Talos Principle"" for bonuses. These do not change the core game at all but, for instance, you can get stars with these codes. All the regular stars will still be in the game to find. If you get the codes for bonus stars (three in total), you will start with three stars in the full game. So, you'll be free to leave three stars unfound if you wish and still receive the bonus content for finding all of them. In other words, if you start with the bonus stars and then go on to find every star in the game, you will finish with an extra three stars.PS: If you get and finish the game, check out my screenshots if you want (NOT before you play). Some hint at additional ""challenges"". Like getting a picture of the blue man visiting the greedy man and living to tell about it.			"

												A first/third-person puzzle game with beautifully themed environments and captivating original soundtrack. You solve world puzzles to collect Sigils (Tetris pieces, essentially), and you use those collected Sigils in Sigil puzzle locks (which unlock doors or new puzzle mechanics.) To solve a lock you must arrange the Sigils in a preset rectangular pattern. Along with Sigils there are collectable stars which are used to unlock more difficult content. The stars themselves are often fairly difficult to collect, but are very satisfying.The game plays at your own pace, as puzzles are solved with theory and execution as opposed to timing and platforming. Due to the design of puzzles being self-contained experiences, you can play casually, only completing a few puzzles during a session without worrying about losing progress and having to redo a bunch of them. You can't manually save in the middle of a puzzle, but progress is saved as events get triggered, and your last puzzle/world location is kept track of, so it's easy to continue where you left off.The game does not hold your hand as you play... you aren't told how to use puzzle mechanics, but rather you learn how to use them through natural play and experimentation. The learning curve is very gradual but you will find yourself dealing with fairly complex puzzles later on in the game as you become accustomed to the mechanics. The game isn't a linear progression of puzzles so if you get stuck on a puzzle you can skip it and come back to it later (and often solving it after having an epiphany.) The only barriers are Sigil Locks, which do require you to collect at least certain  ""easy"" Sigils before advancing too far.The story of the game is conveyed through various means... through ELOHIM (the voice in the sky), audiologs (from a female scientist), journal entries (archived data in computer terminals), and messages written on the walls (by various characters.) A big, unique part of the story is done through interactive events in the terminals, where you will interact with an AI character through dialogue trees. The AI will make you think, articulate your thoughts, and ultimately question yourself. If you wish to partake in the story and get the most of it, you'll find yourself having a lot to read, but it's all completely optional and can be skipped if you really just want to solve puzzles. The writing and voice acting are all super high-quality with perfect execution.The level design is based on real-life environments and themes primarily from Roman, Egyptian, and Medieval architectures, with a few ""fantasy"" environments thrown in. Weather and time of day add a lot of variety to the worlds and keep them fresh and feeling unique from one another. Environmental textures and models are very detailed and are made from real life photographs and 3D scans, as I understand it. Puzzle mechanics clearly stand out from the detailed environments by being pristine and more technologically advanced in nature, as to not get in the way of solving the actual puzzles. Puzzle areas are designed to feel open and allow you to see to other areas so you get a good sense of what all you have to work with and the area you have to utilize. Areas such as walls, fences and stairs feel natural while still retaining very distinct purposes, often aiding you in coming up with the solution without you necessarily realizing it.There's a ton more I could say about this game, but all in all you're looking at around 20 hours or more of content spanning around 120 puzzles (not including Sigil lock puzzles or additional secrets.) A second play-through is likely if you're wanting to explore alternative dialogue trees, get all the achievements, find all the secrets/messages, or attempt speed-running. There is also a level editor included as well as Steam Workshop support for user-generated content. The PC version of this game has more settings than you have ever seen before, so it can run smoothly on rather low-end hardware, and you can adjust to your liking. Full disclosure: I was a volunteer beta-tester for this game for ~3 months prior to release, and I have ~180 hours of play in ~4 playthroughs. I highly recommend this game and supporting the developer, Croteam!			"

												The puzzles are good, if perhaps very slightly too easy, and it's definitely the most competent treatment of philosophy I've ever seen in a video game* (speaking as someone who 1. has played a lot of video games and 2. has a PhD in philosophy**). Definitely worth buying, if not necessarily at full price.*If you ARE a philosopher, though, or are philosophically inclined, you might suffer some mild frustration at being limited by multiple choice answers to complicated questions - though again, the options you are presented with are generally better than you might expect from a game.**Please forgive me if mentioning this makes me seem like a d**k.

												This game is like the Hardcore Version of Portal. Where Portal is Funny, this game is Deep and Serious. Instead of Glados you have a God that is constantly telling you things and speaking with the authority of a really strict God. Instead of Weatley you have these Terminals that try to decypher, just like yourself what is going on, and sometimes you feel like you are talking to a real AI. There are Philosophic Exams that this game make to yourself, and you really discover a few things that you might not know about the Real You. The Plot is awesome. The texts, the recordings, the atmosphere, everything is on place. If you take too long on making a Puzzle, God will tell you that don't take things to seriously, that come back later, and then you feel like doing the exact opposite. You will end up reading and listening carefully to everything you find. If you like Puzzle games, this game is for you. And if you want a different experience of a game, this game might end up being really special for you.			"

												Comparing The Talos Principle to a game like Portal is unfair, but immediate. The first time I manipulated a gadget to set off a part of a puzzle, I muttered how much it reminded me of the amazing and witty Portal 1 and 2, and that trying to replicate it was unwise. However, I removed my premature opinions and discovered a whole new world of puzzle and story, placed perfectly in what is called The Talos Principle.The game starts out in ruins, immediately piquing interest and curiosity. This first person interaction makes it impossible to know who you are, or what you are doing in the deserted grounds of what seems like Rome. The land is littered with broken pillars and faulty statues, most of which are missing their heads.Very shortly after running around, an all powerful voice beams from the skies, introducing himself and welcoming you to his garden. The puzzles ahead are a test to see if you are worthy (of what is unclear) and to strengthen your faith in him, ""ELOHIM.""Without going into spoilers, I must say that the story is my favorite part of this game. Despite everything right about The Talos Principle, I’m a sucker for a great story, and very few games have the tone that this one carries beautifully and makes one question the nature of humanity. Almost every word spoken or typed holds a deeper meaning. Nothing is there without reason, and everything is set up in such a way that I didn’t feel left out of anything. There will be no regrets to finishing this game and seeing everything tie together.Gameplay is very simple, which is nice, because the puzzles are not. Having the option, I opted for controller, assuming I could sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice, scenic mind game. I was wrong. Despite the scenery being beautiful and the music peaceful, my anxiety levels were high, attempting to freeze the laser gun that will shoot you down and sneak past the bots that will blow you up. And that’s within the first puzzles. You can’t do much on your own, only using what is provided to pass each task. It makes learning controls easy, which is nice when you have to take most of your focus into the puzzle.There are only a handful of gadgets as well, each with a specific task that they do. Don’t be fooled though, because sometimes they are good for more than what they are intended. The puzzles themselves are short, only getting a little longer with time. Difficulty levels vary, but progress nicely with you, rather than slamming you with something impossible. There are also several puzzles per section, which gives you some options in case you get stuck. This attribute is great as the story is a heavy part that everyone should be able to complete.What the game lacks in wit and comic relief, it replaces with promise and charm as that nagging curiosity presses you forward. There is a lot of content, which can be overwhelming if you want to follow the story, but luckily the audio tracks and journal entries are logged and easy to access at any time.Another nice feature is the hunt for stars, which can be within the puzzle or just randomly hidden on the selected map. It had a lingering feel of Mario 64 about it. It also gives you a break from some frustrating enigmas and allows you to enjoy the landscapes. The signs are helpful to look at as well, so use them. They even mark off what you have completed, though who does it for you is unknown. Kind of spooky, right?The Talos Principle doesn’t let down on graphics, either. Each stage and each little world is beautifully done, with sounds and music to match. Voice acting was very well done, allowing you to stay immersed in the game. The settings are almost too good to be real, which makes the game ever more creepy. Keep a look out when just walking around. There are some questionable sights on the rocks, in the water. You are clearly the only one around which raises the question, “where is everyone else?” Though questions like this will be answered, the theories I came up with thanks to the surrounding areas wwere a little unsettling.With all of the story, the background, creepy settings, and subtle hints, I’d say this game is very replayable, especially if you are like me and forget how to do the puzzles. I know I’m one to miss things the first time around, so going back is always good.Despite the eerie feeling I got every time I turned the game on, I was so compelled to read the QR codes on the walls, left by others before me. I wanted to understand the notes in the computer library and I wanted to know who ELOHIM really was, and what he wanted with me. All of this and more is explained if you are strong enough to pass over 120 puzzles in The Talos Principle.Abstract:    Story 9.5    Gameplay 9.25    Graphics 9.5    Sound 10    Replayability 8.75    Controls 9.5Positives    Story is amazing    Easy to learn    BeautifulNegatives    Slightly monotonous    Very little guidance Overall Score 9.25/10			"

The Talos Principle 
A Screenshot of The Talos Principle
By: SABINA




Possibly the most existential game I've played. Though it is, at it's core, a puzzler. The puzzles are often complex, a few head-scratchers, but sometimes require a more reductionist approach. What may seem complex at first may turn out to be very straightforward. At times it requires you to question the assumptions it has itself given you. Good exercise for the whole brain, as it doesn't train through repetition but demands both creativity and reason, both abstract thought and technical logic. Along with the puzzles a story gradually unfolds. Concepts of self, place and time begin to dawn while another mystery deepens. I like that the story is only hinted at and alluded to, so that you formulate the idea on your own. It makes it that much more meaningful and powerful. It is likely the most existential and eternally relevant topic one could imagine, and the story itself would make a fascinating novel or film. My only complaint is personal, that the game seems to make assumptions concerning beliefs, more specifically, that having them is a universal quality of humans. But this is not at all the case. At times it seemed as though the authors had an agenda to express their own beliefs, but perhaps this was just my suspicion of beliefs in general. The dialogue trees where multiple choice and never once did I actually agree with any of the choices. So it felt like being pigeon-holed and I ended up arguing for a point I didn't actually think was correct. Other than that minor brow-furrowing frustration, I really enjoyed spending time in the beautifully rendered game world. The music was lovely and atmospheric. Extremely smooth play with a good variety of menu options. It's rare that a puzzle game addresses both hemispheres of the brain as well as the subconscious mind. I strongly consider it a work of genius. Oh, and if you decide to play it, I left some messages for you. ;)

Edit for dlc: While a bit on the pricey side for a dlc, it is well worth it. For those seeking greater challenge, many of the puzzles in RtG are considerably more difficult than in the base game. With greater challenge comes greater satisfaction at solving them. Themes from the base game are carried over, and somewhat expanded upon, in a way that I found both humorous and enlightening. It seems to me nothing short of a mirror held up to human nature itself. My earlier point about feeling pigeon-holed in the interactions is rendered moot by new understandings and realizations. So it goes with real learning, when something this worthwhile makes it's dawn across the mind, all one can do is smile. :)			"

												Due to the fact that The Talos Principle is a science fiction based first person puzzler, it’s hard not to make comparisons to Portal. However, while Portal is a more lighthearted game, the Talos Principle is more somber and thought-provoking. Drawing inspiration from writers like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. D*i*c*k (Apparently Steam doesn't like his last name), and John Milton, as well as a number of philosophers, it takes a much different approach to the puzzle genre.With heavy philosophical undertones, you will find yourself thinking beyond the puzzles as the very world around you is questioned. This, in combination with a visually stunning environment, creates one of the most wonderful and unique experiences that I've had in a game.Playing as an android, you must solve puzzles while at the same time being posed a series of increasingly introspective questions about your existence. I am going to refrain from saying anything more about the story so as not to spoil anything. This is a highlight of this game and is best experienced by going in to it knowing as little as you possibly can. The puzzles are very unique, with various elements being added throughout to provide for an experience that never once felt repetitive to me. In these puzzles you will collect sigils using boxes, jammers, crystal prisms to connect lights, avoid mines, and float high up in to the air with fans. The most notable tool at your disposal is undoubtedly the ability to record yourself, allowing you to create what is basically a clone of yourself, which will act out your previous actions while you work with it in real time to solve the puzzle at hand.The puzzles are very scattered in difficulty. Most were able to be solved in very little time, with a select few that I found myself having to really think about. If you want some more difficult puzzles, or you’re like me and want to squeeze every second out of this game that you possibly can, then I highly recommend doing the extra puzzles which are marked by the stars. These are not required to finish the game, but I found them to be some of the most enjoyable ones to complete as they can be more challenging and mind-bending, forcing you to really think outside of the box (or designated puzzle areas). The world is huge, often times even a bit overwhelming. There are quite a few secrets hidden around, so you will be rewarded for exploring. There are also messages and words scattered throughout which provide backstory as well as give you insight to other characters. These can be found on computer terminals, audio logs, and QR code graffiti, and really do add something special to the story. I really enjoyed finding these, and felt that it added a nice touch.Not only are the graphics superb but the music is lovely and perfectly suited for the various environments as well as puzzle solving.There is also a huge amount of customization available in the options menu, which is always to be appreciated. This allows you to change the size of the game hub (or remove it entirely), remove cross-hairs, change from first-person view to third-person, etc. This is a lengthy game, and at my time of completion of the storyline I have clocked about 37 hours of playtime. For this length and the high quality of this game, I feel that the current asking price is more than fair. 10/10 would erase from my memory and play again.			"

												JUST PLAY IT NOW!!! (or read below if you're in doubt, ofc)I don't use the word lightly, but The Talos Principle is TRULY a masterpiece!This game is definitely among the top 3 I've played in my life. Actually I can't remember any better game from the top of my head right now, so, yeah, that's a lot.+ This game is DEEP, mainly in a philosophical way, and that's where this game really shines (don't get me wrong, the puzzles are awesome). Really, not the usual superficial philosophy you usually get on videogames--real philosophy! You'll spend quite some time reading files and listening to records, discussing theories with a computer terminal, proving your point, being contested etc.+ The story is very rich, and obscure, and starts making sense little by little, not having to resort to plot twists, which tend to be a little too cliché.+ At least 3 endings that I can think of.+ Will keep you entertained for many,many hours (my first playthrough was like 30h, the second was about 5h).+ Very nice puzzles (and a lot of them, over 120), and they usually escalate in difficulty very smoothly. But they're all solvable with enough effort. Also, they're probably where you'll spend most of your playtime if you're not checking guides.+ Tons of side-quests -- easter eggs, secret stars, hidden levels, which will also keep you busy for a long time.+ Music and graphics are pretty impressive, too.+ Easily customizable settings and controls for the perfect experience.WARNING: To fully enjoy the game, you'll have to read a lot. Of course, if you just want to go through the puzzles, you can do that, and ignore all the text files and recordings. But, seriously, don't. =)I payed about 1/3 of full price, and I have to say it's well worth its full price.			"

OverviewThe Talos Principle is a puzzle indie game developed by Croteam and is in my opinion one of the best puzzle games out there and although not comparable to games such as Portal, it's certainly not too far off. The game is well-polished, with a great storyline that will test your brains even when not completing puzzles.The Pros: Many Puzzles - Probably the most important aspect of puzzle games, and where, unfortunately, many disappoint, is the length. Not here. This game rocks a whopping 129 puzzle levels, enough to keep you busy for several hours! The trickiest part is the bonus ""Star Sigils"" that are hidden or hard to reach, and in order to do that you have to think outside the box and interact with items from different puzzles at once to obtain them.  Interesting Lore - I won't spoil the story much, but around levels you will find terminals which give you access to a library containing many readable text files so you can learn about your purpose and the backstory to the game. These are optional, but offer a good read, and often times include easter eggs and gags. Breathtaking Characters - The peculiar thing about this game is that it made me feel like it had characters within it, even though you never actually see them. There is Elohim, a god-like voice in the Sky, Milton, a PC program and Alexandra, a mysterious woman who left recordings for you to find. Even though the former two are not real, but artificial intelligence, the way you interact with them and the dialogues you can have with Milton really make you feel like there is someone you are interacting with. Croteam managed, using only text messages and voice recordings to give you a sense of wonder. Around the world you can also find QR codes (which I've tested, they are actually real) that are the thoughts of other ""players"" from the past. Some of them appear often and you can even distinguish their personalities. Wonderfully done. Multiple Endings - A thing I find very important in games is choice. Here, you have an open world, and can complete any puzzle you want, at any time, granted you have enough sigils to unlock the area. After you have enough, you have four possible endings to discover. A nice touch. The Story - I promise, no spoilers. This should probably be the first on the list, but without managing to say much about the story so you can enjoy it, I will just say this: It is amazing. You just wake up, not knowing what or where you are and from that point on you just discover - pay attention to your surrounding, read the library entries, collect the sound files, read the QR codes left by those before you and get to a conclusion yourself. The story is also a reinterpretation of the Bible's Genesis chapter, and after you play the game, you will know why.The Cons: No Custom Levels - The game features Steam Workshop, but it only has a few mods and not really any levels, nor does the game come with a level editor. This could have really extended the lifespan of the game, and I hope it will be implemented in later versions, or at least a free DLC. This does not take away from the gameplay experience and should not stop you from buying it. Level Diversity - Don't get me wrong, the levels are all unique in their own way and each serve a challenge, but the game items are only so many. You have the following logic items: Gates, Turrets, Guards, Lasers, Jammers, Fans, Buttons and Cubes... that's about it. While they are combined in wonderful, different ways, some tricks that are learned through earlier levels almost always give a very big hint on how to solve the difficult puzzles in later gameplay. I would have hoped it is not the same.Conclusion:The Talos Principle is one of the best puzzle games I've encountered so far and definitely worth a purchase if you like a good mind game with suitable backstory and lore. Purchase with confidence, this indie game has better quality than some AAA games.Also check out my review of The Talos Principle: Road to GehennaIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

												Simply wonderful, one of the finest games I've ever played.Puzzle mechanics are straightforward but brilliantly implemented and iterative, providing just enough challenge. An intruiging story is played out using text snippets and great narration. If you enjoyed the Portal games even a little, there'll be something here for you to love.			"

												*Since this review was getting more attention, I decided to add to my review down at the bottom.*The best thing, hands down, about The Talos Principle, is that it runs on my piece of junk laptop, and it still looks beautiful. So, if you're worried about your computer not being able to run the game, then fear not. I have a crappy integrated graphics card, and I can still run this game and its silky smooth. Now, lets get to the gameplay. As others have said, you are just dropped into the world, and expected to figure things out for your self. There is no 'tutorial' on what objects do what or how you are supposed to solve a puzzle. You just figure it out. One of my other favorite things about the game is the little QR codes that are strewn about the levels/world. Past 'test subjects' would leave notes for future 'test subjects'. Now, you can point your cursor at the QR code in game and it will display it, but I decided to download a QR code reader on my smart phone and scanned it with my camera and it reads it. Which I find is a really nice touch.All in all, this is a fantastic and beautiful puzzle game. If you are a portal fan, then you'll deffinitely want to get this game. And remember, it will run smoothly on the crappiest of rigs.*Addition*-Since this review is gaining more attention, I decided to add a little more to my origional review of The Talos Principle. One of the things I failed to mention the first time, is how the game is sort of non-linear.There are 3 'for the sake of this review, lets call them sections' sections. A, B, and C. in each section, there are multiple worlds. In each world, there are multiple puzzles. If you're stuck on a puzzle, and can't figure it out, then you can just walk away and go to a different puzzle. When you're in the worlds, you can solve the puzzles in any order that you want and at your own pace, which I find really nice. Make sure to fully explore the worlds as well. There are many hidden QR codes and terminals and secrets to discover.			"

												Believe the hype. Believe the 10/10 net reviews. They are the truth.I hadn't heard of The Talos Principle and frankly can't remember where I heard of it. I think the PC Gamer RSS feed. No matter. I'll be the first to admit that puzzle games aren't in any way my genre of preference - I'm much more likely to be found playing games such as Unreal Tournament, Mechwarrior Online or a hard-core flight sim. Puzzle games, until now, really haven't captured my imagination or interest.The thing that drew me to the Talos Principle was the notion that it combined a puzzle game, and a beautifully rendered one at that, with notions of the meaning of intelligence, the question of how ""life"" can be defined, what ""artificial intelligence"" would look like. I have a keen interest in philosophy, something that the reviews stated was very much at the center of the Talos Principle. So, I decided to take the plunge and I'm *extremely* glad that I did so.The game is beautifully presented. The Serious engine (as in the FPS game Serious Sam) presents a very nicely rendered world. Each of the puzzles is set in themed ancient Roman, ancient Greek or medieval settings. Having recently spent a week in Rome the ancient Roman themed portions were very familiar and very well representative of ancient Roman remains.The puzzles themselves ramp up very well in terms of difficulty, with early ones being very simple to solve. Later puzzles and in particular special puzzles that grant access to bonus areas can be absolutely fiendish. That being said, unlike most puzzle games I've never given up in disgusted frustration - the puzzles and tools that you unlock to assist you are intuitive enough to make you want to solve the puzzle to progress or to unlock more of the thematic content.Speaking of which, this game is superbly grounded in philosophy, well presented themes from science fiction and indeed theology. Far from being a simple solve-this-puzzle-then-on-to-the-next, this game makes the player really think about such questions as who they are (in game), what they are and whether you are in fact merely a metaphorical rat in a maze. It should be noted that the game absolutely does not require any knowledge of philosophy or sci-fi tropes, but if you are familiar with the concepts developed by the likes of Soren Kierkegaard, Lev Shestov, Carl Sagan or A.C. Clark the game is absolutely that much more immersive and enjoyable.I'm really, really impressed by the Talos Principle on many different levels. This is one of the most intelligently designed and presented games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Everything from the graphics, quality of the voice acting, in-game presentation, music, even the controlls have obviously been developed with a lot of thought.Bored of yet another generic, mindless, so-called ""AAA blockbuster"" game that was identical to the last 5? Give this game a try, you'll be amazed and impressed by how fun it is to play and perhaps more importantly how it makes you really think.Absolutely 10/10. Unhesitatingly recommended.			"

												It's phenomenal. It's a first person puzzler, so naturally there are comparisons to Portal.Basically it's Portal with some different tools at your disposal and instead of making you laugh, it makes you question your entire existence.10/10 would quit my job and cry in a corner.			"

												I was not prepared for this one. I knew what it was, a first-person puzzler with a splash of philosophy. I was ready for puzzles, and I got excellent puzzles. I was ready for philosophy, and I got some cute interludes and snappy dialogues. What I was not ready for was an ending that fit it all together perfectly, so perfectly that I could barely contain the emotions it inspired. It's remarkable how solid a game The Talos Principle is in just its basic systems, but it is a singular accomplishment how powerful an experience they constitute in the end.I'm not telling you a damn thing about the story because that's where the magic happens with this one. You awaken in a bright garden among Greek ruins, and are directed to overcome trials scattered across the strange and picturesque world you find yourself in. These trials reward you with sigils which unlock doors that lead you closer to your ultimate goal. There's more going on than just puzzle-solving though, as you'll soon learn from the computer terminals standing among the trees and ruins.It's a strange and otherworldly setup that frames the experience perfectly, putting you in the right mindset for some philosophical puzzling. The puzzles themselves will be familiar to fans of Portal, featuring buttons to place crates on, laser beams to redirect, force fields to jam, and more. There are about six core mechanics that comprise all the puzzles in how they combine and can be pushed to new functions. Puzzles are color-coded by difficulty and form a nice, smooth difficulty curve up to taxing your brain across the dozen hours or so it will take to complete them all.There's more to these puzzles than meets the eye, though. Croteam loves secrets in their games, and nearly every level contains at least one secret, usually in the form of stars. Solving puzzles earns you sigils (Tetris pieces, really) that open up gates to later areas, helpfully color-coded for their function and also how difficult they are to obtain. But the stars can be anywhere in a puzzle hub, requiring you to notice slight details, solve clever riddles, or string together a complex solution between multiple puzzles. Gathering sigils will make you feel accomplished, but scoring a star will make you feel like a genius.Weaving through forcefields and linking laser networks will keep you plenty busy, but the terminals are what will really catch your attention. Every corner of the world has a computer to fiddle with, complete with its own DOS-style text interface. Though you choose your inputs from a menu they cover a wide range of commands and give you access to a perplexing array of files, articles, and correspondences. There's also another aspect of gameplay that you gain access to via terminals that I really really want to tell you about, but you absolutely have to experience it for yourself. It may seem a little off-putting at first, but rarely have I had my own concepts about the world challenged by a game as they were here.As the story comes together through the terminals and you near the end of your quest, the environments and stakes rise to an impressive pitch. The final areas have a powerful air of permanence to them, as though your choices have far-reaching consequences. Throughout the game the puzzles continue to build in complexity and expand on the concepts they introduce, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the incredible climax. And then it ends, and what follows is without question the best ending I have ever experienced in a video game. It's not the longest or the prettiest or the most complex, but it is the perfect culmination of everything you accomplish in The Talos Principle. It was powerful enough to bring me to tears, and I really don't think there is any higher compliment I can give a game than that.What started out as a clever puzzle game grew to be one of my all-time top titles because of how expertly it formed a complete experience. Other games have amazing gameplay or story or graphics but rarely, if ever, do these elements combine and compliment each other so effectively. I was curious and uncertain about the game in the early hours but with each puzzle I solved, each terminal I explored, I became more and more drawn into the deep and gorgeous world laid before me. I reached a point where I could no longer bear to leave its secrets hidden, and uncovering them made me weep with joy. The Talos Principle is a game I feel fortunate and privileged to have played, and my time with it will surely remain one of my most treasured gaming memories.			"
