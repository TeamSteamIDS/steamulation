												Having never played the original, I didn't really know what to expect. The €20 price tag was enough to make me take a look in to what I would find. I was assured that, despite the interface driven gameplay, this was not a hidden object or pixel hunting game - and I have happily found that this was true. This is a genuine adventure game, in the classical sense - it reminds me of the many, many titles released in the late 90's, which so frequently had fantastic story and design. Noir - A Shadowy Thriller; Sacred Mirror of Kofun...I could go on. These games took on a semi-mythical status due to it being so hard to find them - a demo disc tease was all you got sometimes - but when you could find them, they were so deep and enjoyable, it was worth the search. To find this game, so long after these classics were produced, afloat in a sea of triple-A explosion fests and MMO-RPG-FPS-OMG-STFU games...well, it feels like finally spotting that cardboard game box on the shelf at the local gaming store. That said, this is anything but old fashioned. The interface is slick and responsive, and the game looks beautiful, especially in the Full HD mode. It's not going to tax your video card, but the rich art and loving details make for an immersive environment. Foley (sound effects) and music significantly contribute to this sensation. It is cleverly written, and the story and characters are immensely enjoyable - give them just a little time to grow on you, they will. It's the kind of game you keep thinking about when you stop playing - you imagine yourself in the character's shoes, imagine what you would be doing in the same situation, what you would be feeling...you create your own narratives. Anything which stimulates your imagination in that way is a great argument against anyone who would claim that video games are inherently dumber than books, for example. I'm not a huge fan of puzzles in games - the often break the pace, or aren't logical - but I love the puzzles in J.U.L.I.A. Maybe I'm not a fan of puzzles because they're not often done this well. Even the instantly familiar ""pipe"" style puzzles are different from the norm, so well done and with a proper feeling of reward on completion. Cracking datapads, figuring out door codes, all the while wandering the corridors of long dead stations, a subtle threat looming in your mind...it all fits very well. And the threat is not an IN YOUR FACE, IN YOUR FACE, YOU'RE GETTING STABBED IN YOUR FACE kind of threat...it's an instinctual fear of what you can't see, what might be coming. And that's so much worse. Yet, you're safe up on the ship, while the robot explores. That works really well, as you're sitting at a PC remotely controlling the robot, just as Rachel would be. And just like her, you're safe. Right? Right?!			"

												8.5/10genre : point and click adventure game in 1st person You play as Rachel , member of a group of scientists , who was awaken by ship's artificial intelligence called Julia and your goal is  to investigate the disappearance of the rest of the crew and the mysteries of the solar system.+ Great presentation, beautiful and varied environments , 6 totally different and unique planets to explore, fantastic sci-fi theme and setting.+ Nice soundtrack, good voice acting.+ Classic point and click gameplay, with tons of logical and story related puzzles : some pixel hunting (there is a hint button that reveals hotspots in case you prefer that), screens are static where you interact with hotspots usually examining things or taking samples to analyze or open datapacks  that reveal the story and most of the times contain codes that unlock doors/lockers etc. Not many inventory based puzzles (mostly id cards that unlock doors), some puzzles  may be on the hard side, especially the ones after you find the blueprints that unlock abilities for Mobot. You even learn to communicate with alien beings in a weird at first glance but highly rewarding puzzle. There is some freedom in what planet you choose to travel to, although since you have to unlock abilities for some of them, the right order is fairly linear.+ Nice interface, everything is in order. Important clues you find are being documented, no need to keep notes (like in the old good days of adventure gaming).+ Good length, around 10 hours or much more if you get stuck at some puzzles.+/- Mindomatic is a puzzle where you have to reconstruct the order things happened, very well thought puzzle but found it too frustrating to complete. On the other hand if you complete those puzzles, it's certain you paid attention and understood every tiny part of the story...- The repetitive blueprint puzzles that become progressively more difficult, but are vital to progress.-  Story becomes too dramatic after a point and unbelievable. I like sci-fi stories a lot, but those that are close to our reality. In other words i love the mystery side of the story but i didn't like the magic side of it. Overall the writing is very good though. The game was way above my expectations, it is a very polished classic adventure game but with modern interface and presentation and the way it plays is refreshing for the genre. Highly recommended to those interested in the genre/theme whether on sale or not.			"

												Very surprised to like this game as much as I did, as I'm not a big adventure game fan. Highly recommend, though maybe wait till its a bit cheaper as it is not a super long game.Pros- Good atmosphere- Solid story, kept me going throughout the game- Very nice look to the game, especially for an indie- Voice acting is decent, MOBOT is great though- Some Puzzles are very good. Require some real thinking and are not just mindless A-Z things. However...Cons- Some puzzles are annoying in the extreme. Not in terms of difficulty, but in the actual practice of doing them.For example, an end game translation puzzles resets every time you fail, so if you have 2/3rds of it translated, one wrong click makes you reenter all the info you already know to be correct. Just annoying.- First few worlds are nice and lengthy, the last 2-3 fly by and are less than 6 screens each for the most part.- I had two crashes, both while saving my game. The save still worked, but not ideal.			"

												J.U.L.I.A is an excellent scifi adventure/puzzle game. You are a lone survivor of an expedition to another solar system and your task is to find out what happened to the rest of the expedition and the piece together the story of the solar system.The atmosphere and immersion of the game is very good and if you are a fan of science fiction (especially hard-core/near future), you will like this. I usually don't play adventure or puzzle games, but I really liked this one.Downsides: Puzzles can be very hard to piece together without help. With some cheating with puzzles the game lasted about 8 hours. At 20 euros game price, that is bit on the short side, but worth it. On sale <10 euros immediate buy for all scifi fans.			"

												I love adventure games and I love space. This game is most suitably my 'cup of tea'! This is the first game I have bought that has been re-released in an Enhanced version after buying the original version. This isn't just an enhanced version of the original... It's practically a huge rewrite with loads more content and the graphics and visuals and audio... I could go on all day about it. Simply OUTSTANDING release!			"

J.U.L.I.A. is one of the best games I've played in the recent years; certainly the best adventure game. Excellent story, teriffic voice acting, animation, art, music and sound design. *Everything* in this game is beautiful to look at, listen to, interact with and simply experience.This game is a masterpiece.

												Easily one of the best adventure games I've played in these past few years, and one of the few games that I have on my replay list. How comes? I'm attributing it mostly to the developers keen sense of what makes a good space adventure game coupled with good production values and an enjoyable story.When I started playing this game, something definitely clicked. I rarely play a single game non-stop unless it's really short, but I couldn't put this game down. There was enough mystery in the story to make me want to find out what has happened in the protagonist's past. The feel of adventure and exploration was also there, discovering the different worlds within the star system was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game. Each of the worlds were vastly different and snooping through the different science bases piecing together the mystery was fun.Mechanics wise this game is a fairly standard point and click game. The puzzles in this game felt just right, unlike in many other point and click  games where developers add difficulty by throwing in illogical and unintuitive solutions. I wouldn't say any of the puzzles were hard in this game, but I didn't feel like they were too easy either, the pacing in that sense was very good. It is also worth noting that reading in an important part of this game. Your character has the  chance to read through quite a few emails sent and received by her fellow crewman, some of these may help you with the puzzles, but they will also help you piece together what happened in the story. In the end, the different elements of the game just came together for me and worked very well. The atmosphere, the exploration, the mystery, it all made for a really great space adventure. There aren't many space adventure games on Steam like this, this fills in a hole for a very niche crowd and does so brilliantly. If you want a spectacular space adventure with a good flavoring of mysticism a la Space Odyssey, an enjoyable story, and puzzles that feel just right, this game is definitely worth your time and money.

The Life CosmonauticJULIA Among the Stars = Space Odyssey 2001 - Dave + WhodunnitApart from the sort of awkward-sounding title, JULIA is a completely competent, excellent even, puzzle/adventure title.  I say this even though I would not consider this style of game one of my favored genres.  It's that good.The majority of the gameplay experience happens through the ""eyes"" of Mobot, an intelligent multipurpose exploration robot that follows the directions of your character, Rachel (an astrobiologist) on board a deep space probe that is run by a somewhat acerbic AI named Julia.You navigate between very beautifully rendered scenes looking for clues, insightful information and solving the odd contextual puzzle obstacle.  Puzzles are very logical and are not heavy on pixel-hunting or the combination of seemingly unrelated items.  This makes them feel very much part of the world you're exploring rather than a strange abstract that draws you out of it.Decend to Xenophon if you... ARE a fan of interface-based puzzle/adventures such as Myst.  A must buy in your case. Love a well-told sci-fi yarn.  I would not say the story is completely original, with some plot points being somewhat cliche, but the actual delivery of the plot is well-polished.  All character dialog is well-voiced.  Although you might predict some plot twists ahead of time, others will keep you guessing and it's a satisfying story arc. Enjoy narrative-focused puzzle games.  There is no nonsensical puzzle solving here.  All puzzles make contextual sense, which adds to the immersion rather than distracting from it. Are looking for a thoughtful change of pace.Return to cryosleep if you... Expect any action.  Although there are a few sort of tense moments, you are never really in danger. Want a hardcore puzzle game.  Although some puzzles in JULIA can be challenging, the majority of them can be solved in under 5 minutes. Dislike high-concept sci-fi.  If you think the only good alien is a dead alien, you might think the plot of JULIA a little stuffy.The Bottom LineMy worst dig at JULIA is that the game feels too short.  I really wanted for there to be just another planet or two to explore and a couple more styles of puzzle to unravel.  I suppose being left wanting more is not altogether bad.  The story does seem to borrow a page or three from 2001: A Space Odyssey but does so in a way that is very original and just as thought-provoking.  I had a great time with this cerebral space epic, and if you enjoy a good mystery there's not much reason for you to not give it a try.  You'll make Mobot sad if you don't.  Please don't make Mobot sad.			"

												It's definitely a good game overall, but in the end I cannot bring myself to recommend it. Though the puzzles were very enjoyable, I didn't find the story very interesting or the characters engaging. The CGI is polished but animation is very jerky and unrealistic. The game gets a lot of basic science so wrong that it's simply immersion-breaking (nitrogen gas is explosive now?).If you like puzzle games and want to try out an interesting sci-fi puzzle, go for it. Otherwise I think you're better off spending your money and time elsewhere.			"

												Finally! A great adventure game with seamless Linux support!I loved this game! It has it's flaws: a few unpolished text-pieces that the editor missed, a few pieces of dialouge that miss audio, a few logcial inconsistencies, and at least two puzzels whose premisses are complete nonsense from a Science perspective (I don't mind the science fiction elements, but there were occasions when they simply got the day-to-day science wrong that made me cringe. The one that most bugged me involved Nitrogen being depicted as an explosive compound, which is most definitely is not -- if they had swapped Nitrogen for Oxygen all would have been fine...).The classic game it is most like, and probably owes most debt to, is probably Mission Critical, which is also very good. The gameplay is similar to this game, with several mini-game like puzzels inbetween. This provides a less seamless player experience compared to e.g. the Myst series, and makes ""suspension of disbelief"" a little less convincing, but it works fairly well within the SciFi-setting. Most of the mini-games are fun, and even those that are not make sense, though there were a few that were plain frustrating even if I understood what I was supposed to do. The game-play is also aided by an unobtrusive hint-function that helps you find hot-spots within the scenes. This may be considered cheating by hard-core gamers, but it is optional and I think it is a neccessary function for advanced and detailed graphics such as these. If you are an acheivement hunter, then this game is also promising, with loads of acheivements to unlock. On my system (Linux), however, there seems to be a problem with this, but in principle at least there is a lot to go for. The story also reminds me a lot of Mission Critical, at least the premise: sole survivor has to find out what's happened while they were out cold. It is told in beuatiful graphics (that seem to be inspired by Riven and the other Myst games more than by Mission Critical -- there is also a nod to 2001), very good voice acting, and with a brilliant progressive-rock-esque sound track. There are some inconsistencies in the story, in that some things can be preformed before you logically should be able to, but nothing that is a game breaker. The story took me approximately 8 hours to complete, and is (more or less) linear, but that's the way I prefer it.All in all, a very well designed, melancholy space adventure, well worth my money and my time! I don't say this about games often, but I look forward to playing this one again!			"

												JULIA is... an okay game. The varied settings, atmosphere and general pacing of the game kept me glued til I completed the game.... but I have to say that it climaxed about 75-80% into the game for me and sort of sputtered in the end. The story got wilder and wilder and introduced some unnecessary layers and characters. The visuals are great and I love the accompanying background music (unintrusive, good looping, sets the mood just right), and some of the main characters are quite memorable, but I doubt I'll remember or care about the story even a week from now.The game interactions are heavily flavored with computer assisted interfaces and graphics. This fits in with the storyline and actually works well to frame your limited options. If it weren't for this, I would make a bigger deal from the fact that YOU CANNOT PAN THE VIEW in any scenes. There are hotspots that you can click, and they may let you zoom in\out of points of interests or lets you move between places. NO ANIMATED zoom in\out motion or movement between spots, except for the cutscenes. Most of the screens have animated parts, though (flickering light, billowing dusts, etc) so you'd never think that you're staring at a static picture.Oh, another negative point for this game is that the puzzles are generic ones that are skinned to fit within the game's universe. That's right, (just) visually skinned to fit in. They look right for the settings, but bears minimal logical connection to the storyline. The ones that tied in the most to the storyline that I can think of are the language translation puzzles and the password guessing ones.I can't say that I'd recommend this game... especially at the current price.

												I had almost forgotten how fun a good point 'n click could be. ""J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars"" has a great ambiance that immediately sells you on the premise of your being a lone human explorer in space, Rachel Manners, working with the ship's onboard computer, J.U.L.IA., and the exploration robot, MOBOT, to solve the mystery of what happened to the rest of the crew.It provides good variety on the planets to be explored -everything from jungles and deserts to underwater exploration- as well as a number of puzzles, some of which, however, lack any sort of guidance and will either leave you scratching your head for a good long while or searching google for a walkthrough. That is probably the low point of the game for me, While I will readily admit it's been a while since I last played a game -any game, really- with challenging puzzles, there are quite a few puzzles in J.U.L.I.A. that can only be solved by a trial-and-error approach instead of gathering clues and I usually prefer the latter to the former.Beyond that, my only other complaint, or wish rather, is that I had hoped the game would go on for a few more hours but I clocked 6 hours and still have some things left for the completionist in me. The music, sound and art design, are high points of the game, all of them adding to the superb atmosphere. There's been mention that the soundtrack will be released at some point and I'm looking forward to it.In the end, I think it's a solid point 'n click that leaves the door open for a sequel that I hope comes to fruition some day. In the spirit of full disclosure I did buy the game during the Valentine's Day 50% off sale so it was definitely great value for money in my case. If you're looking for 10+ hours of gameplay that will ultimately depend on your ability to solve puzzles, your patience, and determination not to google a walkthrough. For my part, it makes me hopeful about the point 'n click genre again. "

												J.U.L.I.A. makes a lot of promises, traverse a galaxy, meet aliens, discover what happened to your crew, And for the most part it makes good on those promises. I really like the chemistry between the characters and the puzzles were all well worked out. And aside from an akward loading screen here and a wrong soundclip being played there, the game is technically sound. It's problems lie in design. The order in which the you visit the different planets is up to you, but in order to have the story make the most sense, there's a specific way in which you should do it. There's two plotthreads, one focussing on your crew and and the other on the history of the galaxy you're in. However, the focus is on neither and at the end the game just kind off fizzles out with no real impact or consequence. Most researchable item descriptions boil down to the same hing and are of no use whatsoever. There are some really vague plot-devices that aren't properly explained and the one instance where a morale choice is posed seems really out of place.Non of that outweighs the experience as a whole, though. There's a sence of progression, so you'll never grow bored with it and with 8-10 hours in gameplay you will get your money's worth.			"

												Awesome game. One regret - it's over. I was hooked from the outset and played through this game in 3 sessions. I found it to be a very compelling experience and commend the devs for creating such a thought provoking experience.The graphics are gorgeous and the ever changing UI was both innovative and intuitive. Sounds and music are very apt and the degree of tasks and puzzles keep you going back for more. I found the puzzles to be logical for the most part. A few did require some serious effort but this only enhanced the sense of reward upon solving them. The sense of exploration and accomplishment was high and the situations and encounters very immersive.If you like this type of game, I highly recommend you do yourself a favour and give it a try.  If you are interested in space exploration and sci-fi and like to solve mysteries then this game is a must play. Games which make me grudgingly concede the need to go to bed at 3 am are few and far between and this was one of them.			"

												This game was a very nice surprise. Sci-fi point-and-click adventure with puzzles. Very nice visuals (they are pre-rendered, but are nicely done).I should specifically mention optional, but excellent Mind-o-matic detective puzzles where you need to restore the order in which things happened by constructing sentences from phrases into a text that describe the story. Other puzzles are also very well thought out and diverse.The only thing I don't like is the fact that it became less 'hard sci-fi' near the end, but this is because I love hard sci-fi with as little 'space magic' involved as possible. Nevertheless, the game kept me glued to screen until the very end.Highly recommended to anyone interested in good science fiction stories and uncovering mysteries!			"

												I think J.U.L.I.A. is bound to become a cult classic- this is my take on why this title is so special:- Impressive story (really- I mean it!);- The story is always given to you with something concealed, in a way that the player must imagine and figure out part of it on his own- I consider it to be advance writing skills;- You'll get surprised and twited by it's outcome;- The puzzles are incredible well design and there's a good variety on them;- The graphics and cutscenes are beautiful;- The soundtrack marry perfectly with the game;- The voice acting is superbI think this is a must play- as it's one of the most surprising games I have ever touched.I won't give a 10 because I think it lacks some minor details- like keyboard shortcuts, sometimes the points of interactions are too small and the texts are also a little bit too small. But like a said, those are minor detail- this title is way too impressive.(9.5 out of 10)			"

												A very pleasant and atmospheric puzzle-adventure, especially for all the space and astronomy lovers. Surely there's nothing actually scientific to learn, but the dialogues and the story are genuinely rooted in sci-fi space exploration. The alien vistas are, at times, breathtaking and let your imagination travel in fantastic dreamworlds. The end is kinda bitter-sweet, but that's OK. Overall a worthy purchase and a nice addition for your Steam library.			"

												J.U.L.I.A. : Among the Stars is a very well written and beautiful game, especially when you take into account that most of it was done by two people. And the fact that they only got on the low end of five digits through their crowdfunding effort. It took me about eight hours from start to finish, so there’s a sizable chunk of content…about average for a contemporary point-and-click adventure game. Most of the puzzles are pretty simple to navigate with some deductive reasoning, but some are rather headscratchingly difficult. I found myself having to consult a walkthrough for each of the upgrades, for instance. Still, the experience more than makes up for this shortcoming.All in all, anyone who’s a fan of science fiction should definitely give this game a try. It’s got space exploration, intrigue and a mystery that deepens the further you dig, and even some philosophical debate if you’re into that sort of thing. It’s not easy to make decisions when you’re on your own in an unknown sector of space, after all. And, while I tried to stay altruistic in my dealings with any natives sometimes the “right way” is not always the “best way” to deal with situations. You’ll know what I’m talking about when you play the game.http://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/j-u-l-space-oddity/ "

												J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars is pobably ""one"" of the most atmospheric and immersive videogames you will ever play this year...  A game unlike nothing else; a remake in the complete sense of the word and e n h a n c e d way beyond the bounds of the original J.u.l.i.a. This is the work of a two man indie team who have worked tirelessly to bring us the ENHANCED HD Ready and FULL HD version of J.U..I.A: Among the Stars.  This new game has much more of everything the original J.u.l.i.a. could not offer the first time around, ergo, for this iteration you will find superior sound effects, music and graphics all seamlessly integrated within a contemporary work of art resulting  in a magical trip beyond our solar system imbued with a wonderfully deep storyline, great puzzles and replayability for enjoyable trips into outerspace for an unforgettable and scintilating experience.  This is the reason why I got into gaming over thirty years ago, games like  J.u.l.i.a.: Among the Stars are akin to those rarest of gems being both priceless and universally rare: they pull you in and before you know it the room is filled with the fragrance of midnight oil!  You will keep coming back to Julia, promise made, promise kept...I am not the developer of this game but rather, an honoured individual who has had the complete priviledge to embarnk upon the journey with Ju.l.i.a. and her creators throughout the Greenlight process right up to the closing stages and launch into space. If you only ever buy one game this year on Steam, make sure it is J.u.l.i.a.: Among the Stars.A true Celestial Endeavour & Labour of Love.Thank you for your attention.Best regards, Robert Blane.			"

												Although the graphics are truly stunning, J.U.L.I.A has surprisingly little to offer in originality or entertainment value, and too many annoyances to make this a recommended game. It is a mystery, to which you will figure out the ending 25% of the way in. The mini-games are standard stock and repetitive. It crashed a number of times on my brand new MacBook Pro, and prevented me from saving the game at a critical point, forcing me to re-play a significant portion of the game to see the alternate outcome. The vaguely depressing and anti-climactic ending robs the player of any satisfaction of seeing this somewhat tedious game to its conclusion. Although the developers put a lot of effort into this game, I can't help but feel a little robbed, even if I bought it at a mild discount.			"

Also Devs provided to give two different ending and some choices during the development of the story.			"

												I would like to point out that even though I wouldn't recommend this game normally, if you enjoy games similar to Myst, and this game is on sale, pick it up. It has an interesting enough story, and some of the puzzles are really quite fun. It is safe to read my entire review, I don't mention anything specific, it's spoiler free.Let me first point out the strengths of this game:- The story is interesting, although the entire storyline is given to you and the ending is obvious before you get anywhere near the end.- The characters are well written and fully-voiced. I really connected with them, and felt that they were fleshed out very well.- Even though there is little animation (this game is very much like the Myst series) there is enough to keep you interested, and the scenery and backgrounds are beautiful.Here are a few things that I did not care for:- I didn't like the fact that the story was pretty much handed to me before the end was near. I was also disappointed with the ending, because it's kind of a let down. - I really, really enjoyed certain puzzles, and when the puzzles were challenging but fun, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. However, many of the puzzles were frustrating more than fun, and were not easy to understand what was supposed to be done.- The trailer really leads you to believe that this game is not similar to the Myst series, but that's pretty much what you're getting in this game. There are a few cutscenes where things are animated, but that's about it.			"

												At the very start I had some trouble getting into this game because I expected more visuals than there really were.  However, as the story began to reveal itself and I began to get a feel for the game's purpose and how it was meant to be approached, I found myself coming back again and again until I got hooked and binged until 4AM to finish it!This game is not exactly a clone of the Myst series, but nor is it a hidden object adventure.  The story is a HUGE part of the game!- interesting, fairly original puzzles- investigative gameplay with 'murder mystery' elements- brilliantly-conceived AI personality and engaging story- responsive interface and no glitches that I could findThere's no point listing off negative points, because if you're like me you'll inevitably weight them excessively when you read this review.  Also, I can't really think of any.Buy this game, if nothing else than for the story itself!			"

												This is a real space adventure gem, with a captivating story and lots of interesting puzzles for you to solve. You play as Rachel Manners, an astrobiologist who is restored from cryogenic sleep in order to save the ship she is on. After that she has to do some detective work in the solar system to find out what happened to the rest of the expedition while she was asleep.You play in first person, similar to the first entries in the Myst series. There are lots of innovative design decisions which worked really well. For instance there is the ""Mind-o-Matic"", where you can use your deductive skills to solve the mysteries. The puzzles are varied and almost always interesting to solve. Music and graphics are beautiful.If you're at all interested in adventure games, you shouldn't miss this one!			"

												I, myself, enjoyed this game a lot.  Great graphics, detailed storyline, interesting things to find during exploration.. I admit, the music in one of the puzzles was too high pitched for me so I had to turn down the volume. :-/ Sometimes I wanted to smack J.U.L.I.A. and other times I wanted to hug her. lol  She can deliver a bit of sarcasm, but so can your character..  Mobot is a very interesting assistant.. Without him, we'd be lost.  The scenes are fantasticly created. I only managed about 22 of 30 achievements, but having achievements is a plus! Makes it more fun.I like the point and click type games like this that make you work your mind a bit.. Also tests your memory. I would explore space again w/ J.U.L.I.A. and Mobot :) This game may not be for every type of person but those like me who like point and click, exploration, storylines, and adventure, as well as beautiful scenery, you will likely be like the many of us who liked this game.

												tl;dr version: Good story, poor/chunky/unexplained interface. For the love of god take notes of everything. EVERYTHING.For starters: I did enjoy the story of the game, even if it was very trope-laden. There's a big ""But"" following that statement however. Much as I enjoy exercising the old grey matter, J.U.L.I.A. went from ""interesting story driven puzzle adventure"" with emphasis on the story, to ""aggravating obscure pixel hunt and obsessive note taking ordeal.""The first portion of things went well. Getting to know the characters, gorgeous environments, and a fairly intuitive interface. Things went downhill from there however, with little to no carryover in controls (eg: in one puzzle the right mouse button may rotate objects, in another it is a double left click).Have you ever wanted to construct a six line, 31 character phrase from a set of 24 ideograms, via complete trial and error, with an error meaning having to restart completely? (yes this is really a puzzle)You'll need to take notes during two earlier puzzles to do this with anything other than trial and error, cross reference those notes to find where they overlap, and will still need some trial and error.

												A good game, but it has some serious drawbacks.I'll try to describe it in pro/con-s.Pros:- Beautiful scenes- Interesting oldschool-ish space scifi story- The main characters are voiced nicely- Couple of interesting puzzles; average to good mysteries combined into the main story- Linux supportCons:- Most puzzles are not so good: bad controls and.. idk how to explain it but they're boring. Not all but most of them- Despite scenes being animated and somehow 3d-like, they feel flat: just points of interest which can be clicked, and that's it - no camera panning, no walking etc. It's just a 2D point-click game with 3d-like scenes- HUD is primitive- The story is linear, it has 2 endings but you just choose between them in the very end, plus see some short consequences after that- Poor optimisation (at least on linux)- Not replayableDespite all the cons, the game in general has something which makes me recommend it. Apparently, the pros outweigh the cons, after all.			"

												J.U.L.I.A follows astrobiologist Rachel Manners, who is awoken from cryo-sleep by the ship's Intelligent Unit following a disaster which can only be fixed with the help of human hands. Rachel then finds out that she is alone. With revelations and mysteries which soon occur regarding the disappearance of the rest of her crew, Rachel must explore the solar system to uncover what exactly happened.If you love space, puzzles, and a decent storyline, then I highly recommend giving this game a try. The game sees you explore multiple planets where underwater, snow, and jungle environments are but a few places where you must work out what happened to the crew. The puzzles are really varied and provide a fun challenge, and the datapad hacking/researching was a particuarly engaging way of uncovering the mysteries. As the story progressed (no spoilers don't worry!) the twist was surprising and completely unexpected, all of which led the player to a either/or type choice right at the end!			"

Highly recommended.			"

												JULIA is  a point and click sci-fi adventure game about a biologist named Rachel Manners waking up from cryosleep and discovering that she is the last of her scientific expedition on the ship.  After saving the ship from an asteroid field she teams up with the ship's AI, Julia, and the team's scouting robot, Mobot, to find out what happened to the rest of the crew. This adventure will take them all over an entire solar system as they explore strange alien worlds. These worlds are beautifully crafted and the quality graphics really make for a strong and immersive atmosphere. The writing is also quite good, Rachel, Julia, and Mobot all have good chemistry together and are likable. All this combined makes JULIA one of those games that make you feel that you're a part of the journey and you want to see it through.When it comes to the puzzles I'm going against the popular opinion in the Steam reviews so far and say that the puzzles overall suck. They don't suck in the Sierra sense of missing something and making the game unwinnable and there's no pixel hunting thanks to Mobot's hotspot button, but the puzzles are just more obtuse than they need to be because the tutorials for the puzzles tend to be kind of bad. There are several puzzles that actually have easy solutions but good luck figuring that out. The last half of the game is also filled with puzzles that are impossible to solve without trial and error which makes it a chore. Just play with a guide and save yourself the headache because the really good atmopshere and writing make this game worth playing.			"

												If you like beautiful exploration and puzzle games, this game is it. I played through twice just to investigate everything, make different choices, and get almost all the achievements.I like that you can save whenever you like. If you make a bad choice, you can reload a previous save and replay. However, it would be nice if the ""save"" allowed you to name the save. The saves just show a picture of the planet you were on and the time-stamp for the save. But since you need to go back to some locations more than once, it isn't always easy to determine which save is the one you want to load.  Some puzzles were easy and others were terribly hard, but that made it more fun.Caveat: There is an area in the game where I repeatedly ran into a game bug that caused the game to crash. The issue has been reported by a number of people. So saving beforehand is critical to avoid a lot of replay if you encounter the problem.  On Zenobia, the water planet, save before you enter the submarine. The bug occurs when you are figuring out how to deal with the underwater electrifying creature.[Updated after playing the DLC - Untold Story]The DLC consists of 5 batches of 10 schematics to solve like those in the original game. I really love doing those puzzles, so I was very happy. As you finish a set of schematics you get a ""story board"" version of the back story on J.U.L.I.A and Rachel. To be honest, you probably already guessed the general gist of the back story while playing the original game.Con: I finished all puzzles in less than one day.  I would recommend waiting for a good sale price because of the short game play.			"

Anyways, puzzles were mostly ok. Not a big puzzle fan myself so I didn't have the stamina for some of the more annoying puzzles. I admit I looked up the solutions to those. You really must pay attention and have a good memory with some of them.All in all impressive work for two man development team. I would not recommend this at full price however (20€ at the moment).

												Best point-and-click game I've ever played! The strong atmosphere, and great story line always makes you want to discover the next thing, and keep going, until you get the complete picture.  The puzzles are good. Although mostly the usual stuff, there are a few really clever ones. The music (+atmospheric sounds) are really good, and combined with the creative and artistically beautiful (although technically not 'high end' type of) visuals, and locations, it really gives a relaxing yet adventurous feeling, from the first minute till the credits. I never got bored of it, there is enough change and the next mystery of the story to keep you interrested. However i have to say, you need to have a patient, slow story reading kind of mindset for it to be enjoyable. It is almost like an interactive music+visual enhanced sci-fi novel.  Despite not being a fan of the genre, I really liked it. So i can strongly recommend to those who are actually into these kind of games. :)			"

There is an absolute ton of differnet interfaces to use with the various puzzles.  The narrative feels high-minded and rather preachy.  Unafthomable, mysical , secret ancient aliens from the beginning of time. Urgh.

												I liked this game. It has an interesting story and pretty visuals. The soundtrack also matches it quite nicely. It's an impressive showing from a development team of two.The puzzles were a mix of basic, straightoward clicking/exploration and some rather arbitrary puzzles towards the end. There were several pattern and decryption games I found interesting, but for the most part the puzzles are more random than logical (fortunately, the majority of them are simple and linear). I would've liked to see more logical puzzles that stemmed from the gameplay and clues you found, and had to piece together, but this was largely absent. The closest it came to that was key codes and the Mind-O-Matic parts that really just amounted to testing your short-term memory (or ability to write things down). The Mind-O-Matics were particularly frustrating because they were fairly arbitrary and it had less to do with having the correct sequence of events, and more to do with having the exact solution the authors came up with (made worse by the lack of a meaningful log mechanic to easily view previously discovered information). I likewise found most of the ""history / translation"" exercises clumsy and arbitrary, which was unfortunate.This isn't really a deal-breaker though, because you don't play this game for the puzzles; more for the atmosphere, music, and story, which more than make up for it. It's a narrative-driven game, and it does a good job of maintaining that without feeling too linear.It's a nice story, in an engrossing atmosphere that will keep your interest until the end. It's not really a puzzle game (at least the puzzle elements really aren't so strong, and due to their often arbitrary nature (with the exception of a few solid pattern-matching excercises) you shouldn't feel guilty if you want to consult a guide to help move you along. I wouldn't recommend this at full price, but on sale for 50% off or more, I would say it's definitely worth your money if you like this type of game.It's a nice little gem from a two-person inde team. It looks and feels like a game developed by a much larger dev team. Get it on sale and you'll definitely feel that you got your money's worth. It's a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I would rate it at about 5-8 hours worth of content (wasn't keeping track).			"

												One of the best point-and-click games I've ever played.That this was pretty much made by two guys with a budget of a few thousand crowdfunded dollars is incredible.I took a risk buying this game. I like space settings, but know that point-and-clicks is hardly a hotbed for groundbreaking games, but this exceeded expectations. This is a remake/update of an earlier game, which form the looks of it was a bit crap, but here no shortcuts were taken in making this a proper game.The standard is way more professional than it has any right to be, the graphics are yummy, the voice acting and writing isn't as awful as you'd imagine. Even the few comedy bits inserted in notes or conversation were funny. Most of the puzzles aren't ridiculously hard, but still challenging.One of the endings ends abruptly without satisfaction, and the plot goes a bit (ok, a lot) weird and maybe drags a bit, but overall this was an enjoyable experience of making futuristic screens go bloop bleep.

												Absolutely Gorgeous Audio and Visuals, puzzles are challenging but fair, and an interesting story with a few nice twists thrown in. My only complaints would be that it was relatively short (my 20hrs or so reflects 2 playthroughs), and that while the puzzles are fun, they win no awards for originality. 7.846/10, get it on sale.

I would recommend the game if you pick it up on a sale. I did enjoyed it despite it's shortcomings for the amount I paid.Pros+ Interesting puzzles+ Good music & artstyle+ Good atmosphereCons- The overhanging story didn't grab me- Too few puzzles- Only the first areas really felt fleshed out			"

												This is one of those games you'll only play once or twice. That said, it's worth it. JULIA very much puts me in mind of the old point and click games from the 90s, although with updated graphics and effects. The storyline is good, although it did lead to a point where I had figured out the big puzzle before the game told me, and there were a few occasions where I wanted to do something, knowing it would come in useful later, but it just wouldn't let me until I had the correct objective.For being a studio with just a couple of people working there, JULIA felt very polished, and the voice over work was highly professional.It won't take too long for you to complete this game, but it is a good story.Oh, and just to quickly add...I WANT A MOBOT!!!

												Overall, I found J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars to be an interesting sci-fi mystery adventure game. The game suffers towards the end and the conclusion doesn't quite live up to the story that preceded it, mainly due to plotting issues that made the resolution of the story a bit more telegraphed than I think the author may have intended. The clues as to what happened are a bit too ""hint hint, wink wink"", and it doesn't take long to figure out what the game seems to treat as a major revelation at the end of the story.That all said, the game provided a fun set of environments to explore, and most of the puzzles were engaging without being tiresome or overwrought. There were only a few times where I became frustrated trying to figure out a solution, but there are decent walkthroughs out there for those people that need a little extra guidance to work beyond those stumbling blocks.At present pricing, I would recommend waiting for a sale or coupon to pick up the game. I think I paid about $10, and at that price I feel that I got my value out of the game.			"

												I am recommending this game based purely on the narrative/story/plot aspects of it, as I found most of the later minigames frustrating exercises in trial-and-error that really distracted from the selling point of this game -- the story.  Some kind of tip/hint system would have been nice for those of us without eidetic memories ;-)I really enjoyed the sci-fi/space setting and the first half of the game where the story is probably moving too slow for some. The slow pace really helped me immerse myself in the mystery of what happened to the crew.Then the game tipped its hand and in the latter half of the game I was really mostly interested in finishing, which is probably why some of the later minigames annoyed me.Still, I was hooked on the story and lore of the game universe and the final twist was welcomed, even if seen before and -- in my opinion -- not really necessary to conclude the story.  I'd go into more details, but I don't want to spoil the game.Graphically, the still sets are absolutely beautiful; way above par from what I had expected from an indie game.  Most of the animations are stilted and amateurish, however, they are brief and sparse enough that they don't distract much from the overall impression.  The music and sound effects are meaningful and fits with the theme of the game; although the choice of ending credits music is a bit mind-boggling but I'm sure it has meaning for the developers.From a technical point of view, I encountered a few nuisance glitches, but no game breaking bugs.  The game did crash at the very end, but thankfully an automatic save game had me back right before the crash, and I was able to complete the game without problems.So in short, a good (7/10) casual adventure game, with mostly worthwhile puzzle minigames.  The launch price tag of €20 will probably be a bit on the expensive side for some, considering the length (~10 hours if you take your time) of the game.			"

												This a good point and click adventure with a sci-fi theme and a good amount of mystery. It looks great, very detailed graphics, sound and voicing is fine. Game-play wise it is pretty varied, you will try to crack codes, put two and two together in stories, and solve a good amount of logical puzzles with different interfaces. Game feels nicely polished and at certain moments the atmosphere is top notch in terms of a mysterious aura with a looming presence of danger.I suggest this game to puzzle and point and click game fans, but I also have some criticism: the game's story became too abstract at certain point (and since some puzzles are directly related to the plot, they too became too strange and difficult to solve, since the plot was hard to follow). I wish the game remained on more or less the same perspective it had in the beginning: mysterious, concentrated, spooky. But I guess this is rather a matter of personal taste.			"

												I found J.U.L.I.A. to overall be an enjoyable point an click sci-fi adventure.  Being from an indie developer, some of the 3D characters and animations look like they come from a slighly older game, but I don't have a problem with that.  The story was interesting and kept me coming back to finish things off.  For the most part, the puzzles can be finished without cheating.  Some of the puzzles end up just being sessions of trail and error, which I'm not a big fan of, so that detracted from things a bit.  There was a decent variety of puzzles throughout the game, so it didn't get overly repetative.  I believe my play time from start to end was around 10 hours, which included some minimal bumbling around.  If you're a fan of point and click adventures from the 2000's, this should make you feel right at home.			"

												So I found this game while looking for a new Space Adventure of some sorts. Didn't need to be high action and fast paced like Mass Effect just something that had a decent story and a good ""feel"" to it. Something to lose myself in. J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars.... sort of delivers on this.The potential in this game was pretty big right from the on set. Interesting bit of mystery, fairly cool looking world, and a ship you could get attached to. Better yet the game play has a Myst like vibe to it.I got nice and comfortable and figured this'd take a few weeks to solve along the lines of a game like Myst (URU being my fav because of the 3rd person aspect of it)... And boom. Done the second night I played it... And that... right there... is my issue.Ok the plot in the end is somewhat guessable, who are the good guys, bad guys and what not. You see some lovely scenery, there's some funny (if a bit stilted) dialoge (in their favor most of your interactions are with computers so there is that). But it's just not that hard a game to beat. The hardest parts deal with trying to piece together history... so much like school if you have a rather decent memory for everything that is said you'll cruise through this. I don't... and I still cruised.Would I recommend this game? Mmmnnnnyeah? If it's on an awesome sale yes. Otherwise... I don't feel I got my full money's worth.If you're into puzzle games with twisted puzzles, weird plots, and just sort of... comfortable to play... I recommend checking out Myst: Uru. It's old and sure it's convoluted but it'll take ya a bit longer and heck... it's cheap.			"

												In short terms: Interstellar like story with chick with british accent (instead of MM) but with much less Nolan and black holes.In longer terms: It is a nice sci-fi adventure based on classic p'n'c mechanics with the touch of some modern beautiful visuals and a good atmosphere. Enter the space shoes and thoughts of biologist Rachel Manners, (accompanied by some well mannered A.I.'s) the only living survivor of expedition that went horibly wrong. What happend light years from our home and why was she only one kept alive is a mystery. Help her uncover the truth.Like in almost every other point and click game out there, gameplay is based mostly on clicking on almost static images, looking for clues and so on. There is some backward storytelling through a lot of dialogues, but the best part of the game is story itself and there is a constant feeling that drives you forward to reveal the next tiny piece of the greater picture. Slow paced story revealing is great but once you finish it, everything is revealed and replay value drops basicaly to zero. And if you belong to the group of people that don't like to read or listen too much then this game is not for you. As you go along be prepare for some riddles and some peculiar puzzles but don't worry, they are not Broken Sword level. Game lenght is fair enough. If you take your time there is 11-12 hours but if you hurry you can finish it under 7 or 8. The price on the other hand is somewhat high and I would suggest to buy this on action sales - but let's be fair - it is a indie game mady by two people and for what it's has to offer, it is a great game. To wrap it up I would definitely recommend this but to p'n'c and sci-fi genre lovers only. 8/10			"

												The first game I've played start-to-finish in a while, J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars is a fantastic story and puzzle game. You take on the role of Rachel Manners, an astrobiologist who left Earth to explore a nearby star system that was emitting an artificial signal. You awake to alarms and your ship's computer, JULIA, informing you that a meteor storm has cause significant damage to the ship.This opening sequence introduces you to two of the three primary characters and the interfaces and puzzles you'll encounter. JULIA is the exploration ship's artificial intelligence. She wakes you from your cryoslumber to inform you of an on-board emergency. The ship has encountered a meteor storm and there are fires, gases and electrical issues that need to be addressed.After the initial danger has passed, JULIA informs you that you are the only surviving member of the expedition. Additionally, some of her memory has been corrupted and she is unable to access or reconstruct the events preceding your awakening. JULIA identifies your position and identifies a mobile laboratory on the nearby planet. She introduces MOBOT, a reconnaissance robot, that you can use to explore the planet and the lab.You continue to explore the star system, create upgrades for MOBOT, discover the fate of your expedition members and solve many puzzles. All of these add up to an enjoyable experience that I finished in about eight hours. While some of the story is telegraphed and on trope, the characters, pacing, environments and music are fantastic.J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars isn't the best game out there, but it is a terrific experience. I picked it up on a Steam sale and would recommend you do the same. A capable protagonist, balanced supporting cast, compelling mystery, and interesting gameplay makes this a highly recommended game.			"

												This game has a bit of everything that I love; exploration in beautiful scenery, good depth to the adventure and it didn't make me feel like I was being funelled through a linear storyline.  The game is interspersed with contextual puzzles, which could honestly stand to be a little more challenging, but they aren't the real focus anyway.  The interplay between the three characters is humorously representative of what dialogue between a human, computer AI and robot might be like and is downright amusing a lot of the time.For me, the whole game is reminiscent of DOS point-and-click puzzle/adventure games, modernised and executed beautifully.  If you like your games to require pen and paper in order to keep track and stitch together the pieces that you pick up along the way, I highly recommend this game!			"

												Good point and click sci-fi adventure with some mind teaser puzzles. Some will definitely make you go ""that HAS to be right, why isn't it solving!!??""... only to have goofed on one tiny order. Others are good logic solving ones. Graphics are pretty, but it could have done with a bit more animation. Audio was borderline bad, not enough controls to adjust the overloud voices from the general sound effects.The achievements though in this game are a joke, and you should not even bother with them. One is broken and impossible to get, and a couple others are immersion breaking stupidity. So, just ignore them and enjoy the adventure. If only Steam had a way to ""disable achieves on this game"", that would make them not bother you!It could have done with a bit more UI advancements (like allowing scroll wheel, and some keyboard shortcuts), but it wasn't super painful that it lacked.Good game though overall, and I do reco it, at a sale.

												So... what type of game is this?Two genres come to mind: point-and-click and find-the-hidden-object...The game actually tends more to the former:- There's an interesting story (even if I didn't agree with some of the narrative towards the end - but hey that's part of what stories are supposed to be about, right?);- There is a lot of puzzle-solving (after some hidden-object hunting).- The game gives you a couple of choices that influence the outcome of the game (although not mind-bendingly)Overall I enjoyed the game - there's a LOT of polish on here (which is something I respect and look for in games). And from what I could tell from the credits, the majority of the game was created by two guys... So respect :)Buy this game if:- You like first-person adventure games (like I said, there is a hint of find-the-hidden-object in there, but you'll definitely forgive it).- You like polished productions (cutscenes/graphics, interface, voice-acting, design) - its got a really nice Sci-Fi vibe.There's not much replay value obviously, but I'll definitely recommend this game for 9-10 hours of interesting entertainment :)			"

												An excellent sci-fi adventure game.  The story is solid, especially early, starting off as arguably an involved mystery tale.  The transition from mystery to more pure sci-fi near the midpoint makes for a game that feels remarkably original.Negative points exist, but usually seem self-conscious and apologetic.  There's one action sequence in particular that could have easily infuriated adventure game purists.  But it actively makes itself easier in response to player failure.  As such, it ends up working just fine.There are some occasional annoying liberties taken with science concepts, but they're usually forgiveable enough to just ignore.  Though one did stand out as groan-worthy for me (having to do with alleged dangers of nitrogen gas).In all, this game was better than I expected it to be.  Very engaging.			"

												Could be a good game with a little more work.  There just doesn't seem to be any obvious flow to it.  I mean you get a small phrase about what your next goal should be.  However, then you are on your own.  After you literally hover over everythng on the screen and interact with it (if you can), you are left with, ""Well, what next?"".  I'm not dumb.  I don't want or need hand holding in a game; been playing them for over 20 years and I've played all kinds from shooters to stategy, to RPG, to MMO, to Adventure, to Console.  The game seems to be several good ideas poorly strung together.  The ingame puzzles are not bad but after spending over 2 hours on a ""learn an alien language"" puzzle (with no clear outline of how you know when the task is finished) only to have the game crash and send me way back in the game, I packed it up.  No worth the time.  This is MY opinion.  Some of you (based on your reviews) loved it.  I am very glad for you.  I wish I felt the same.			"

												JULIA Among the Stars is an excellent game. Its a point and click style game, but the pointing and clicking never gets old! The story is also great. Manners wakes up to an empty ship, and you play the game trying to figure out what happened to the rest of the crew. There is also JULIA, the ship AI, and MOBOT, the loveable robot that you control while exploring the different planets. I liked that there was a button that would tell you all the clickable objects in the area. Very helpful. Every planet was gorgeous and looked different from the rest. I liked the voices of JULIA and MOBOT, but Manner's voice sounded too much like she was another AI rather than a human.However, there was a massive game altering bug I encountered. Well, before I mention it, I will say that the developers clearly had a specific order in mind of the planets you visit. Once you leave the first planet and can travel to others, you can travel to any one you want but really there is a ""best"" option. I noticed this in the beginning and tried to mimic this order based on the direction the plot was going. Well, I just happened to stumble on an achievement that talks about a hidden planet. Assuming that this was just an added secret to the game, I went and found it. I shortly realized that I accidentally skipped a nice chunk of the game, because all of a sudden the game was ending. If the developers had a sequence of planets that they based the game's story on, do the players a favor and block the player from accessing planets ahead in the sequence!I did end up going back and playing through the parts I missed, but it wasn't the same.The game was good, but it would have been great had I played it in the right order.Also, there are no jump scares.

												Wonderful looking game. I love the British accent for the main character.However, I found the game broken. First, the hints are not good enough to get the key code numbers. I had to usea steam guide to get anywhere with the key codes.The first mystery had no answers. Did I miss something?Then, I had to build a component. Easy enough, except I had no straight line connectors to connect anything with.I don't know. Other players seem to have played it, and I liked what I could do in the game, as in what did work, but am so lost and was not fun.			"

												Enjoyed the game itself.  Good storyline and puzzles.However,  there were some puzzles that defied logic on how to basically attempt them.Then there were the crashes and the crashes and then another crash.  It was pretty buggy.  I had to replay puzzle after puzzle and I can only guess there was an extra 3 hours of play dedicated to redoing those things.If you want a decent story, its not bad, but expect bugs and resets.Unless its really cheep don't pick it up.

												This isn't a bad game, and I played it all the way through so that must say something.  With that said, you can see the ending coming from a mile away, some of the puzzles are frustratingly silly, and the dialogue is incredibly corny at times.  If you get it on sale for under $10, I'd say go for it.  Otherwise it's probably not worth it.			"

												A surprisingly comfortable point-and-click adventure game with a varied amount of psuedo 'open-world' in the vein of allowing you to visit multiple planets at one time although you're slightly restricted in some aspects until you unlock certain schematics that upgrade your exploration robot.Long-winded run-on sentence aside. I had this on my wishlist for a few months and grabbed it during the summer Sale. I am very happily surprised with how intriguing the game is. The 'puzzles' differ enough to where you are not consistently completing the same exact type of inputs and 'games' to find a solution. The dialogue is rather decent if you ignore the attempts at jokes from the human and two robots in the game. Otherwise, environments are plenty and pretty, characters are established, plot does not seem like generic tripe--STEALTH EDIT: The game is absolutely spectacular and I especially enjoyed the last quarter of the game's plot--and as someone who rarely plays adventure games, I am fully pleased with my purchase.I can only hope this developer makes another game with similar aspects and I hope that anybody else who reads this and purchases the game enjoys it as much as I currently am.

												Having read many of the existing reviews and being a little unsure what to expect, I finally played through this game. And I wouldn't have finished a game I didn't like. But that being said, despite decent voice-actors, beautiful cutscenes and planets, ambient music and a generally very catching atmosphere while exploring the different planets, this adventure game falls short in one aspect: The puzzles. After quite some time of insultingly easy ""puzzles"" the player is confronted with the first literal puzzles - and that already marks the whole spectrum of the game. Insultingly easy tasks where other adventures might deliver interesting item-combinations, and very easy one-screen puzzles that sometimes actually have you assemble pictures. The latter type of puzzle being the extreme opposite of what games like Myst tease your brain with.To sum things up: I would recommend playing the game, mainly because it can be really interesting to explore the several very different worlds while being provided with very good (ambient) sound effects, a friendly interface (no pixel hunting except for a short section of the game) and an interesting story. Should you absolutely need difficult puzzles instead of a highly streamlined, movie-like game, you should pick another game over this one, though.			"

												Good Story, It's a interesting mystery to be solved.Like playing a narrative movie.Acceptable graphics.The user interface, and play style is very  much like the good old Space Quest, King Quest sort of games.But it is a lot less funny than Space Quest. Space Quest is hilarious compared to this.This is a great modern game to introduce to young kids, interested in space exploration or detective type games.			"

												A brilliant and well-written indie title, with quite amazing animation and graphics. The visuals in space were particularly well done. The story line was very intriguing, and while the journey to discover what happened to your crew can be a bit predictable at times, the ending delivers solidly, and can be bit a bittersweet.I had a minor glitch at one point where my mouse cursor got trapped in small square part of the screen, and could not proceed ahead or return back. Luckily had made a manual save just before starting this level, and booting the game from there thankfully resulted in this glitch not returning again.Otherwise a brilliant experience, and would definitely recommend this title to any fan of point-n-click, or space exploration, or a compelling sci-fi storyline.

												I recommend it, but only on sale (which is when I got it). It was a mildly interesting story but very path-driven. Some of the puzzles were very annoying as well, but there were only a few that I decided to consult a walkthrough on after hammering away at them for several minutes with no signs of success.I did enjoy the detail in the videos and scenery.

												This is an engrossing sci fi adventure game that's well worth the sale price.  There's a mystery to solve and it's resolution was very well done, though the end premise does get somewhat outlandish, I was not able to put it down until I was done.  Game play is basic myst and the puzzles seem to either be no challenge at all or very hard - but theres always ways around those few. I love adventure games from my youth and sci fi so this was right up my alley, if you enjoyed games like The Dig or Rendevue with Rama try this out.			"

												Decent diverse puzzles (many minigame puzzles too), some investigating, interesting story in an alien solar system, great visuals all made by one guy, soundtrack was good, not alienated or depressing.The main character is a normal person, maybe too normal, but it helps keep the story and gameplay in focus. The AI that is your conversation partner doesn't sound too artificial or indifferent, as most AIs in games tend to do. My playthru took 14 hours. Would recommend to anybody who likes SF and doesn't have ADD.			"

												I would describe this game as clever, immersive, refreshing, and intriguing. Though you can't move around freely through the 3D environments, you really feel part of the universe it portrays. The mystery and level of detail of the story keeps unfolding and keeps drawing you in the further you go. The use of analytic tools and environment exploration really gives a sense of being out in 'the field', doing research, gathering data. Some of the puzzles are real brainteasers too. The high-res graphics are really beautiful and realistic, the voice acting is good, and the characters are more than functional; you feel you get to know them as you go along. In short, J.U.L.I.A. really comes together as the sum of its parts, and makes for a great experience of a solid story. I really enjoy playing it.			"

												Medium length point and click puzzle game.Includes a couple of choices through its duration.Personally i felt like there was just the right amount of puzzles for it to stay interesting, the game was good at keeping me engaged and curious, and the story was decent enough to be likeable. Apart from that it has a nice atmosphere to it.There will be a few puzzles which arent obvious at all, and for that i had to search for help online. Definitely a worthy challenge, so be prepared for a hint of frustration during the gameDon't expect to be completely blown away though, the game is good, but not a bestseller.If youre into a relaxing experience while being intellectually engaged this game is recommended for you, but certainly not for everyone.*EDIT*Forgot to mention the game is visually well done, not ""AMAZING"" but still enjoyable.

												The short version:On the whole, this game may not be worth full price. But if you're a fan of point & clickers, you'll want to keep an eye on a good deal for it.The long version:You're the last survivor of a space expedition, woken up from cryogenic sleep because of an emergency. Now you get to find out what happened to the others.This being an adventure game, you do so by solving various puzzles, aided by an AI and getting a cool robot to explore the various hostile environments.The good:- Graphics & sound are pretty well done- Plot is quite typical, but well-told and nicely fleshed out. It's easy to get sucked into the setting of the game.- Wide variety of puzzles & challengesThe bad:- Most puzzles are a bit on the easy side.- Interface can be clunky at times			"

												Something over 16 hours for a playthrough (22/31 achievements). No Bugs, no crashes, no problems.I don't like most adventures.Nevertheless my favourite adventures:- Blade Runner- Culpa Innata- J.U.L.I.A.So, why do I like JULIA? First of all, the story is something new, something I did not expect. Not the save the world/girl story you normally get.Then..my main problem with normal adventures is: the puzzles. They are boring and they appear at the worst time, when I want to continue with the story I have to find out how I can use a piece of gum, a hook and whatver you fancy to do something which is just plain stupid and not interesting.Not so here. If you find a tablet and want to access it and it is password protected, then you have to do something. Simple.If an animal prohibits you from going through a room, you have to do something. Simple :)The puzzles in this game are fun and you normally don't need Google or a walkthrough, because you can do it yourself.In the whole game is only one puzzle where you have limited time, but even if you fail, the repeating is NOT done in a way to make the game as long as possible, you just start the puzzle again. So it still is fun, even if you fail some times.The voices and the music and the graphics are all good. The controls are minimal and the interfaces for the mini-games are perfect.Whoever designed the user interfaces is really good at his job.So, what happens in this game? Of course, if you continue to read, you get some spoilers, sorry.You explore the planets of a solar system and find out what happened to the others of your crew. To be able to do this you have to read a lot and think sometimes a bit. You do NOT have to check all spots again and again all the time. IF you have to go to a spot you already where, then it is so clear to you because of the story that you don't even think about ""where do I have to go"".This game is great! If you have not played it, you are missing something really good.			"
