												Resident Evil 6 is not a survival horror game. Period. It's a top notch third-person shooter involving zombies, monsters, and biological weapons. I'll be the first to admit, RE6 is lacking big time as far as the ""throw back"" factor is concerned. However, I appreciate what they're doing here. I personally love the whole lay-on-your-back-and-frantically-shoot-enemies feature. I also like that I can actually melee instead of swipe the air in front of me with a knife hoping to make contact. I agree that having to wait for the zombies to move before I can shoot them is lame, and I had a bit of a struggle adapting to the assault rifle zombie (though he really just holds down the trigger in sporadic bursts that go all over, mostly hitting the ground). The J'Avo are NOT zombies. They are bio-weapons, superhumans if you will. They sometimes transform into other creatures. This I can accept. I had to adapt to RE6's gameplay. I do things like turn on a high difficulty and pace myself. Do I HAVE to walk down that hall with my gun drawn? Well, no. But I do because that creates more tension and I can take in the atmosphere more.I was skeptical at first about Wesker's son Jake. It seemed pretty cliche and silly to me. Then I remembered that the entire story of all of them is. Again, this is not to say I don't like all the others, I love them. But honestly, the dialogue and voice acting has always been pretty bad. That's just one of the things that I fell in love with back then (along with tank controls!). Jake's story even has a Nemsis theme throughout, but that still isn't enough for some folks. Also, by the time I got to the second chapter of Leon's campaign (three hours in) there was some extensive puzzle solving. However, they do baby you through them via pop ups and quest markers. My solution? Turn off the HUD. It clears the screen up and makes the game more approachable. I don't feel like I shouldn't have to do that, rather I appreciate the option to do so.It's things like these that I think offend some old school RE fans. I guarantee the last time 90% of the people complaining about the new gameplay mechanics played RE1, 2, or 3 was at least 3 years ago when they got upset about RE5, if not longer. The point I'm trying to make to you, the potential buyer, is that Resident Evil has changed. Not for better, not for worse. It's just different. If you're hoping for a survival horror experience, it won't be found here. If you're expecting an RE revival, forget about it. But if you're interested in a quality, A-list third-person game with some horror elements, a lot of gore, and a plethora of fight-for-your-life situations (which typically involve ACTION, regardless of the game) then go pick up a copy.What eventually drove me to write this is going back and reading reviews of RE1 and 2. The complaints for those games are:1. The camera2. The aiming3. The pacing (too slow)4. The controls (move like a tank)5. The ""stupid"" puzzles6. Not enough ammo7. Can't move and shootNow the complaints for RE6:1. The camera2. The aiming3. The pacing (too fast)4. The controls (move like an action hero)5. The lack of puzzles6. Too much ammo7. Moving and shooting is lame8. Zombies body parts fall off and can't shoot them in the same area anymore (someone actually complained about this)			"

												When I first bought this game I hated it with a passion. It was not because the horror elements were gone – I was already used to this by Resident Evil 4/5, games I liked for what they were, even though I have the most fond memories of RE1 and RE2. Of the newer RE games, ""Revelations"" is my favorite and atm I'm a real happy camper regarding RE HD remake. But my hate for RE6 was not because it left survival horror fans in the lurch, it was due to other things: 1) The game starts off with an irritatingly long and superfluous prelude, which one has to trudge through before the real game starts – and even then, there’s not happening much in the first 20 minutes of Leon’s campaign (which Capcom meant us to play first). There’s way too much handholding - you can’t run, you can’t shoot etc until the game *finally* lets you. That section is obviously meant as a tutorial, but it comes across as longwinded and boring (especially after that prelude). And to top it off, it even utterly fails to give you an overview over and insights into the most important functions like sliding, taking cover, quick-shoot, counter, dodging etc.2) Once Leon’s campaign picks up, for a time RE6 seems to be great fun after all – until all is smothered by lots and lots of atrocious quick time events, some of which are seemingly impossible to master. I made it through the first campaign - but I was enraged and determined to abandon the game, never to pick it up again.  And then something happened: First I heard QTEs for RE6 were patched – you can now let the game do most of them for you. Second, I read that the QTE’s rage inducing difficulty was often simply due to lag. If resolution and graphics settings are too high for your system, not only do controls start to feel sluggish and clunky, but the timing for the QTE’s is totally off. Third, I read a FAQ detailing the “advanced controls” for movement and fighting, which the game itself does not bother to explain. In that FAQ, I also read that there are options where the FOV for the camera and aiming can be vastly improved. I eventually decided to give RE6 another go.And what shall I say – I suddenly fell in love with it. If the settings are chosen just right, the controls handle like a charm and the game finally gets a chance to shine in its combat modelling. I also came to appreciate that the campaigns play vastly different: Leon/Helena get zombies and puzzles, Chris/Pierce is like playing a tactical shooter, Sherry and Jake get hunted by a “Nemesis”-type enemy (and Jake as an unarmed combat expert plays very differently from say Leon). Then there’s finally Ada Wong: She is also good in unarmed fighting, has some puzzles, stealth sections and her campaign ties up the remaining loose ends of the interweaving story lines. The story itself is ambitious, but of course campy as usual. Its main shortcoming is that the main adversary is not very impressive this time around. The boss fights, however, are all very good and the enemy variety overall is definitely the best in any RE-game as of yet. The sheer amount of content this game has to offer is huge! I eventually even began to like the sections where you have to drive a car, fly a plane etc. – these are all welcome diversions that add to the variety. My conclusion is that RE6 is severely underrated. For the most part, this is Capcom’s and the game’s own fault, but still! I will recommend it to you like this: If you liked RE5, then by all means give RE6 a chance! Buy it on sale, and if you heed the things I wrote above, you should be able get a lot of fun out of it.(Edit: typos)			"

												Once again a game I can neither recommend nor downrate which proves there should be a ""neutral"" button. It is difficult to evaluate this game considering the issues and also the good parts it has. I am in between and being offered the two extremes only is not sufficient.The good stuff:--- The game offers not one but four campaigns! This is pretty cool considering the 4 couples you have which means 8 characters - each with a different personality, extra attack or weapon and importance when it comes to the storyline. Also, enemies approaching you differ in each campaign. The same goes to the locales. While Leon and Helena traverse through the big city, a cemetery and a cathedral offing dozens of zombies Chris and Piers do the same but in China. They are attacked by J'avos - these are infected people with the ability to plan their attacks and can also use firearms.--- Graphics / cutscenes / sound effects -> production value. Well, after episode 5 it was obvious the creators would take this to another level.  The game looks stunning and the atmosphere is there. The coop and action sequences once again decrease the horror elements but nobody can say they did not try! Also, there are dozens of cutscenes and in the game's menu you can rewatch all. Altogether I'm sure it will take at least 2 hours to go these in one sitting.--- Longevity. Once again we have collectibles that come in the form of emblems. I have found many but could not find a lot either. There are no more treasures as collectibles. Instead, there is something else that is dropped by the enemies and they represents points. This amount can be used to purchase skills. These can then be levelled up. 3 skills can be active at a time and there are enemy-specific ones, too. So, you and your coop partner need to work together and decide who equips what. Multiplayer also returns in the form of Mercenaries and there is now a new game mode called Agent Hunt.The bad stuff:--- 4 campaigns: In terms of story and characters this is really good but there are too many intersections. In fact, there are boss battles you need to play twice. Really? Of all this it is Ada's (4th) campaign that is the worst. First of all, almost all the areas are familiar and you encounter hardly any new enemies. Throughout all the campaign you know what's going to happen and the ending is a total letdown. Not only this but Ada plays alone. Your friend assumes the role of a so-called Agent - a guy who's just there so that the creators can tell they did really make a coop game. Agent wears a mask and does not have a real name.  In the cutscenes you see Ada alone and throughout the campaign Agent cannot interact with anything. You cannot open doors or chests, you cannot solve any puzzles and no QTEs for you (which is actually good). You can pick up bullets, of course and fight with Ada but feel like an unnecessary character who does not even have a story.--- Cheesiness: If you thought episodes 5's dialogue was bad you are in for a great surprise. Some of the conversations the protagonists have are just dumb. In fact, you can easily guess what will happen next. The script should have been reworked at least 3 times to eliminate some of the worst dialogues this franchise has ever seen.--- Boss battles: They are waaaaaaaay toooooooooo loooooooooooooong! You battle the same guy while he assumes at least 3 different forms one after the other. The tactic is different as well as the environment. It is not necessarily a problem but the game is very difficult and also you are 100% sure you eliminated your foe when he returns once more to annoy you. I have to admit the enemies are great (each one of them poses a real threat) but you battle them for too long. This gets boring and aggravating considering the difficulty of the game.--- Difficulty level: This game is annoyingly difficult. From time to time you get a QTE which is next to impossible to complete for the first time. Missing it will result in a death cutscene - well, I appreciate the developers wanted to show me what cutscenes they had conjured up in their mind but this is still pretty annoying. Boss battles can be a pain and the controls do not help either. It is a sad thing to say since this game enables you to do pretty much everything: you can run, do fistfight, dodge and even slide. And finally: you can walk while aiming at an enemy! The problem is with the turning and the speed. Also, the camera does not help and sometimes you get attacked because our heroes are looking at what's going on elsewhere in the distance.For me Resident Evil 6 was annoying. I could handle 5 but the latest instalment was just too much. Campaign and firefight was good but Ada's story was a silly way to end a game and the difficulty level did not pose a real challenge (it was annoying instead).If you are a newcomer, do not start with this one. If you liked the predecessors you can pick it up but buckle up as the ride will be long, tiresome and irritating! Of course, for hardcore RE fans the 6th instalment is a must.			"

												== Long Review (please select a different one if you want only a short overview) ==Let's start with the positive aspects:- There are three different campaigns  plus a forth one featuring the all-mysterious Ada Wong which was originally a DLC- the total length of all campaigns is okay => For the first play-through it took us around 25 hours to finish.- the graphics of the game are decent- the soundtrack is okay- the co-op play is really great- there are hidden emblems which unlock additional story content like secret files or collectibles - different skills can be purchased and upgraded, too- the cinematics / cut scenes are good - there are some truly epic scenes in this game, but I will not spoil them for you here.- the difficulty level on normal is acceptable for an average player.- the story is complex, but good: All four campaigns are woven together and the protagonists often cross their paths.- there's competitive multi-player modesSo far, RE6 looks like a decent sequel to RE5 (which was an excellent game IMHO). Here's the part that can break an RE fan's heart:In essence, RE6 miserably fails to deliver a good gameplay.1) I have always liked the RE cut scenes and I think they are a vital part of the game. But interrupting the gameplay every two minutes simply ruins the atmosphere. I cannot even begin to fathom why the devs chose to script virtually everything in the game. And it's not just the cut scenes: In almost every level you will find that your protagonist struggles to keep on his feet: Ground shaking, ceiling collapsing, plane crashing, diving, sliding, etc. While that may be realistic, it really bugs me if the surroundings constantly throw off my aim when I am trying to survive through a nightmare of collapsing scenery. 2) You will be set under pressure. A LOT of times. Generally, enforcing time limits on the player in certain scenarios can help to invoke a dramatic flair and it will get your heart pumping. However, if you constantly put the player into hour-long scenarios where you have to run / escape because virtually everything around you collapses / explodes / gets flooded is a sure way of ruining any meaningful gaming experience. Exerting some pressure is okay, but please - for god's sake - let me look around the world. Take in some of the details. Let me do some strategic planning and not wildly running off from one cinematic to the next.3) You will be forced along a very narrow road. In many of the action sequences when there is a time limit, you will be forced to follow a fixed path which is often not clear to you. Instead, you will often barely notice that the camera perspective is shifting, and that you have to run somewhere before you notice that you actually took too long and - of course - die instantly.The problem is not that it is actually difficult to survive the countless Quick Time Events, no. It is that you often do not know what you need to do before it is too late. 4) For some reason the devs thought that it would be a great idea to erratically and unpredictably fix the camera in a completely different perspective from time to time. Of course, that means that your character will automatically change direction if you keep your buttons / keys pressed while the camera changes. This is simply ridiculously bad.5) Countless times, you will find yourself in a situation where you are fighting an infinite number of enemies, forcing you to quicken the pace and find a solution to one of the game's (mostly) lame puzzles or to quickly leave the current part of the level. This is both mindless and boring at the same time while adding virtually nothing to the gaming experience.6) Where are the Zombies? Though you will face some of RE's most-famed enemies during the first campaign, you will suddenly find yourself fighting ""mutated people / soldiers / mercenaries carrying firearms"" almost all the time. This is one of the most criticized facts about the game that partly it feels more like a generic shooter like COD than like any RE part prior to it. The fact that you can also (slowly) move while aiming / firing your weapon and even dodge to the side / to the back does not really help matters. In fact, in earlier RE games I rather enjoyed having to weigh the consequences of fighting off an opponent with my weapon (but having to stop running) or running away to get in a better position to fight him.7) One of the strongest aspects of the RE series are the bosses and the boss fights. While RE6 certainly comes up with some of the meanest, biggest and most impressive monstrosities of the series, the actual boss fights are either:a) totally lame (because you have to wait for a stupid NPC  to finish something)b) totally scriptedc) totally counter-intuitive (because you have not the faintest idea on how to hurt the boss)d) totally ridiculous (because the boss is invincible)8) Skill System. The game offers you to select up to three different skills, improving your damage, aim or abilities.  Skills can be unlocked and upgraded using skill points found during the game. While this sounds interesting at first, it gets boring quickly: You will soon notice that many of the skills are simply too ineffective or too specific to be useful on more than one occasion. 9)  The menu system is needlessly cumbersome.10) To find all the hidden serpent symbols which unlock the collectibles of the game is quite difficult. That was the same in e.g. RE5 and is not a bad thing in itself. What I truyl disliked is that at least one symbol is hidden in an action sequence where it is pure luck whether you initially pick it up or not. Missed it and wanna go back? Forget it. You have to restart the whole level again. Frustrated? Angry? Be my guest! 11) While trying to tie the four campaigns together in the story, the devs have decided to have many overlaps in the level structure of the game. While this helps to certainly invoke a feeling of familiarity, it gets boring too quickly: Fighting the virtually same boss twice (just controlling a different character) is lame. Ironically, this will happen numerous times.What really frustrates me the most is this: RE6 does have a huge potential. The first campaign of Leon and Helena is really good (leaving out the final levels, of course). Why Capcom has chosen to abandon the mood and atmosphere altogether in the subsequent campaigns will remain their secret. RE is about having a great atmosphere. There's almost nothing left of that in the game.Once you have finished the whole game and watched the credit roll (which you cannot skip and which takes approx. 5 minutes, by the way), you will realize that many dozens of people were involved in making this game. Didn't they ever realize that RE6 falls back behind its predecessor RE5 in purely every aspect of the game play? Didn't they ever realize that the replay value once you have soaked in all the cinematics is minimal?Didn't they ever realize that constant pressure on the player and endless quick time events cannot compensate for a lack of atmosphere?We will never know. I can recommend RE5 without hesitation to you and had RE6 been at least half as good, I would have recommended it, too. If you are a die-hard RE fan, you might want to get this game anyway, but honestly you can also look up the story in a let's play and you will not miss much.I can only pray that Capcom will turn back to make RE7 more like the earlier titles of the series...

												The most misunderstood game in the series. It's a fantastic action 3rd person shooter that excells at what it's supposed to do. Fluid controls, satysfying gameplay with tons of variety, great replay value (especially with friends), beautiful and or atmosphereic level design, and TONS of content that will keep your playtime peaking in the hundreds.Let's look at this in more depth Gameplay: I've been playing shooters my entire life and never have I encounterd such a game that matches the amazing controls 6 has to offer, tank controls in previous Resident Evil games are non existent, so expect to move like a butterfly and pull off some intresting tech. For instance, you can slide down through a enemy's gap between his legs, plant a bomb WHILE you're sliding in his legs, get up and watch him explode into bits. There's a ton of variety in the gameplay as you're pit up with a VAST amount of weapons, enemies and bosses to fight, melee combat is also different with each and every character you play as, without spoiling anything, expect to never get bored of what the game has to offer. The content this game has to offer is something else, you have bonus modes such as Mercinaries or Mercinaries No Mercy. Both of those  will easily satisfy anybody who wanted something more out of the game, you're set up on a stage and character of your choice and you have to survive, while killing the most amount of enemies in a given time, each stage has it's own set of enemies and design to give, most will give you quite a challenge. There's also Agent Hunt and other DLC content which I haven't bought yet.Replay value in this game is huge, there's a new game plus mode everytime you beat the game, in that you get to keep the items you picked up during the campaign. There's a lot of difficulty and edits you can make to the gameplay to suit anyone's needs. If you want something where ammo is more scarce and you run the risk of dying very fast if you're not carefull, play on professional mode. I once had to KNIFE 2 enemies to death because I used up all my ammo, and I was being very carefull with them too! There's also little skills you can add to your character, such as infinite ammo, not being revived by an A.I partner, more damage with weapon x, etc.In short, RE6 shines in a lot of areas, however the gameplay will sit just right with anyone Story:It is what it is, without spoiling anything, expect to have a moment for everything, sad moments, happy moments, funny momemnts and everything in between. I've also found the dialogue to be amusing at times to, though it does vary.Eveything else:Soundtrack fits every moment, and expect to find a few songs catchy. As I've said before, level design is very atmospheric and well done, it ranges from very creepy to beautifull neon lights, though this isn't the prettiest game of 2013, it sure as hell makes up for it with asthetics. Let me know if I forgot anything, feel free to ask me anything about the game. "

												Is the story good? OMG NO.How about the protagonists? Bland cliches. All of them.Is it scary? Not at all.Is it survival horror? Not even close.What is it then? Well, If I had to explain it, I'd say it's something Michael Bay would do.Is it even fun? HELL YEAH.WTF? How does that even work? I have no idea. RE works in mysterious ways.In all seriousness though, everything said to be bad about this game is absolutely true. However, that doesn't keep it from being a very entertaining experience. If you treat it like a RE, you're gonna hate it. If you play it for like it is or you just want to have some mindless fun, you're going to have a blast (even more so if you play it with a friend). The ""so bad It's good"" thing applies perfectly to this title.			"

												I rather enjoyed this game; When I was young, I played Resident Evil 1, 2 and 3 and I think that's the problem here with a lot of people. People expect it to play like a game they played years ago; Completely ignoring the fact that the industry and even players have changed.If Resident Evil #1 released these days, It would be flamed. The controls were terrible by today's standards, There's no hand-holding whatsoever and the limited inventory just don't work when compared by today's standards.""But what about the HD Remaster?"" - Well, As you well know Resident Evil is a massive franchise with fans of the old games that many developers dream of. The nostalgia alone sells copies. But don't get me wrong; It's a fantastic game - Like really, really good. But not one that would survive without the Resident Evil brand these days.Games have to update; Change up their mechanics to fit in a world where the games today aren't the games that players were playing years ago. This is Capcom's attempt to introduce a new generation to the Resident Evil universe. Using characters from the old games (As well as some new additions), Capcom have updated the gameplay of the classic Resident Evil games (To be more in line with what gamers ""Want"") and sprinkled some innovation on top and it's a fantasic game that I highly recommened.The reason I've mentioned all that stuff above is that a lot of negative reviews are from people who haven't realized that games HAVE to be updated mechanically as well as aesthically to stay relevant these days.It's the exact same reason MK X doesn't play like MK 1, 2 and 3. You just can't pull something like that off anymore. The compeition is different, the customers are different and the tools that are around these days are fantastic stuff.If you're still not convinced; Think of the freakin' Beatles. They couldn't go on making soppy pop-love songs their whole career; They had to update their image, Change their style. To fit in not only with the change of fans but with the music industry as a whole.This is Capcom's ""White Album"" and I have to say it's a rather fantastic one. I noticed looking at the forums on Steam a lot of people have reported bugs; But I managed to complete the game reletively bug-free; In fact, I don't think I encountered a single bug in my 13 hours playthrough.I hope this review has helped some people and I really do hope you give the game a go; It's definately a fun experience!

												Last Update: Nov 2016.I'll try to keep this as short as possible.Resident Evil 6 is not what an oldschool/hardcore gamer would call a ""RE game"". It's an attempt to make the game more over the top, action-y and cinematic as much as possible while having that cheesy dialogue and plenty of references to older titles. Hence it's an action game with barely any horror. If you're able to accept that then you'll also be able to enjoy it. The game has 4 co-op campaigns that have 5 chapters each (average chapter length is 1 hour), 2 characters you can play as in each campaign and 5 difficulty settings. Considering it's a co-op game you should probably play and laugh with your friends, but in worst case scenario you can also play with the AI. Unlike RE5's Sheva your AI partner is completely self-sustaining and you don't have to babysit. The mechanics here are the most advanced in the series and a lot of people enjoy Mercenaries mode because of it. Now that I've mentioned the campaigns - we can say that to complete the on 1 difficulty with both characters already will take quite a while, now let's multiply this by 5 difficulty settings and we hell of a lot gameplay time. The game has huge replay value (far bigger than RE2 or REmake) and with a right friend you'll be able to enjoy this for quite a while. If you want more then there are competitive DLC modes. If you're looking for people to play with then you should check http://steamcommunity.com/groups/re6mpAMD users should be aware that latest drivers result in the infamous black screen on startup. If you wait for a couple of minutes the game will load. The time depends on how juicy your system is.Again, If you're going to play this game because it's a RE title then you'll have a bad time. If you're in for some laughs and co-op then this is easily the best co-op game of that year.And if you're looking for actual horror then you should get Resident Evil Remake Remaster and Resident Evil 0 Remaster.Finally, here's a list of alphabetical pros and cons.Pros:-Agent Hunt. A special game mode in which YOU take control of the enemy. You can join any open lobby and try to take down players that are just playing the game. Requires patience, skill and preferably a partner.-Characters. RE6 offers both Chris and Leon as playable characters in separate campaigns. Not only that, there are total of 8 (campaign) and 13 (no mercy mercenaries) playable characters.-Collectibles. Just like RE4,5 RE6 has some collectibles that you can find (serpents than unlock documents and figurines).-Completionist friendly. There's a lot of things you can complete in the game and boy you'll have to spend more than a few hundreds of hours to do that.-Controls. The controls now are less tanky and more action-y, fluent. You can manually dodge, counter, slide, etc. After playing RE6 for a while and returning to RE5 you'll see what I mean. The only downside is that you have to learn and master the controls yourself (which is not an easy thing to do). Be sure to check Archon's ""Basic and Advanced Mechanics"" guide.-DLCs. They offer fun competitive multiplayer minigames and extra achievements for them. These game modes are as fun as Mercenaries. Survivors is a deathmatch mode (standard and team, up to 6 players, most popular). Onslaught is a mix between Dr. Mario and Mercenaries (kill enemies to send them to your opponent, 2 players only). Predator is the mode in which you take control of Ustanak and try to defeat other players (up to 6 players, 2nd most popular). Siege is a BOWs vs humans team match in which you have to try to save an NPC (up to 6 players, least popular).-Enemies. Quite a huge variety of them this time. Also they can mutate on the go. They act, look differently and have different attacks.-Events. residentevil.net offers different types of events so you can unlock some in-game on website goodies.-Melee. You can use knifes and your fists/legs to punch bould... enemies and execute them in most brutal ways. Source of the wrestling simulator game jokes.-Mercenaries. Many people (sometimes jokingly) say that it's the only reason why you should get this game. Well, they're not far from the truth either. This mode offers a fun solo/duo survival challenge on 10 different maps, provides you with all characters and special costumes for each. There's also a PC exclusive ""No Mercy"" mode which is a Left 4 Dead crossover (characters and enemies) and it's even more challenging.-Nemesis v2. The game has an enemy that is similar to Nemesis from RE3.-Options. The game allows some nice tweaks including camera placement, FOV and crosshair swaps. Be sure to check the options in the main menu (they're more advanced than in-game's).-Ranking system. You can earn ranks on each chapter for each character. Great thing from completionists. Ranking is based on your accuracy, kills, time and deaths.-Replay value. The main story offers a lot of content that can be replayed many times.-Skills. You can earn points and purchase skills that can alter the gameplay a bit.-Soundtrack. Many people either forget about it or it gets lost as background noise. The game has a great huge soundtrack that adds a lot to the game.-Statistics. Residentevil.net offers advanced game statistics.-Story. Many people would say that this is BS, but I think that RE6 offers better, brighter and more silly, over the top story than ever before.-Unlockable free content. You might say that it's similar to an on-disc DLC, but I don't think it's bad. On residentevil.net you can unlock special files and costumes for your minigames.-Variety of weapons. Knives, guns, machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbow, grenade launchers, magnums, remote bombs, grenades, etc.Cons:-Bugs. The game still has some connectivity issues and sometimes it crashes. Some issues might appear if you have incredibly high ping.-Camera. Might be one of the reasons why you'll die a bunch of times.-Controls. Some people may find the controls a bit too difficult/messy. They require a lot of time to master and even an experienced player may not know all the tricks. On top of that, an experienced Agent Hunter can easily take down newbie agents.-DLCs. They're not free. You have to pay for them. It's hard to find active sessions, but people are playing them.-Enemies. While there are still ""zombie"" BOWs now there are also J'avos, that can use weapons, can communicate with each other (similar to plagas infected).-Graphics. Generally OK, but texture-wise this is a console port and there are plenty of dodgy textures.-Puzzles. Some of them are ar simple (stupid), just like in oldschool REs. But due to fast paced gameplay you don't stumble upon them as often as you'd like to.-QTEs. The game has quite a lot of them, but they aren't difficult and not as unforgiving as in RE4/5. QTEs can be turned off completely.-Single player. Playing alone isn't as fun as it's in co-op. You can't disable your AI partner either.-Story. You could say that it's too over the top and less realistic than before. Some may say that it's a B-movie, just like RE1.-Survival horror. Barely any left.FAQ.Q: I've launched the game and I'm greeted with a settings screen and then the game starts. Where's the main menu?A: Upon first launch you're greeted with a 15 minute prologue. It's infested with QTEs that luckily aren't even in the main game.Q: Can I co-op the prologue?A: Prologue is actually a modified Leon 5 chapter. So yes, by playing chapter 5.Finally, I can't keep everything in mind, so remind me about things I forgot about in comments.Final verdict: Would I recommend this as a RE game? No. Would I recommend this as a game? Hell yes. If you like the combat and the challenge - it's simply enjoyable.			"

												At first, I did not really like what I was playing, so I was thinking of just stop playing. The camera is so zoomed in, it kind of hurt my eyes. But then later on, I found out that you can zoom out in the option settings. Thank God, it really helps a lot. And well, I decided to just play just to see how the story goes. It is true, the game is actually pretty radically different from the previous Resident Evil games, as the game is no longer a survival horror like it used to be. But.... I think Resident Evil 6 is still in a way, a survival horror game still, kind of. There are basically tons of zombies that you can kill, but you do not really get much of ammo in the game. Meaning it is necessary to save ammunition and just keep running. The stages are huge, especially the Leon's story, and it is basically recommended to just run rather than dealing with those zombies one by one. I thought it was kind of interesting, because I guess this is a little more realistic than having to deal with every zombie that you encounter. The control has gotten better and I did not really find much of issues with it. As many have complained, QTE happens a lot in this game, but I am not sure. I don't think it was ""that"" bad, as you still get the chance to redo that part right away even if you die anyway. And many people also complained about the difficulty of the game being too hard even on normal. I am not sure if the game has gone through some radical changes with the updates (I know it did for camera), and this might be the reason why I do not really find this game that bad. The game is certainly playable and enjoyable from start to finish. For someone like me who likes Call of Duty style action a lot, Resident Evil 6 is certainly the game that I can recommend to any action game fans. Not every RE fan would find this game fun, but it was good enough for me. Good stories and beautiful endings for Leon, Chris and Jake, too. I didn't really bother with Ada's story, as it is kind of boring. Overall, great game. Looking forward to Resident Evil 7. 9/10			"

												Resident Evil 6 has a really big change as compared to Resident Evil 5 in terms of gameplay and control performance. The most noticable features is the multiple character selection and different campaign routes. Below will be a list of pro's and con's that I've summarized from my experience with this game.Proz:1. Chargin' strike! Melee isn't just standing on the spot and doing a slash that is literally face to face.2. Execution from melee combo! This was from RE4 but was somehow removed from RE5 so I'm really glad it's here!3. Characters. Each character has their style of attacking so have fun exploring them all!4. Serpent emblems are bigger, and more easily spotted throughout the campaign.5. Vehicles isn't just limited to cars anymore.6. Dodging buttons. Many others say this feature is useless but I think it's kinda useful for doing side rolls through vents.Cons:1. No more weapon upgrade feature or portable gatling guns :(2. Herbs are incredibly rare after Chapter 1 of any campaign.3. Camera angle in certain zones. Experienced RE players will know the struggle.4. Online community is pretty much dead. Either that or there'll be some rushing jokers with a lifespan of 6 seconds speeding through the game.5. Inventory is a joke. I understand that for story's sake, each character will not have a shared bank system like RE5 but this is the main contributing reason why I'm stopping every now and then because I have to choose between herbs or ammunition. If Christ can stuff an entire grenade launcher AND a sniper rifle in his pocket, why can't he do the same for the rest??!?6. 8 skill slots and only 3 skills for each. You can only select one slot at a time. I strongly don't see why anyone would need up to 8 slots.Overall rating from me would be 7/10. It's a good game that you won't regret. Long hours of gameplay and the unexpected QTE's are the ""fun"" features of the game.			"

												After reading all the bad reviews, I was skeptical to make the purchase but when I was able to snag it for under $10, I figured what the heck.To my surprise, I ended up greatly enjoying it although I can see why others may have been disappointed at a higher price point. It's weird to call this game Resident Evil as it plays so differently than previous titles but if you're able to disconnect the two, what you end up with is a very enjoyable action game with amazing graphics and a cheesy but passable story line. Leon's campaign is by far the best but Chris and Jake' are worth playing too.A common complaint in older reviews is how QTEs plague the game into unplayability but Capcom must have patched those out because there are not nearly now as many as it sounds like there used to be. I ran into no technical issues during any of my play throughs. If you're a big RE fan like me, I think you can find a way to appreciate RE6 for what it is.			"

												This must be one of the most boring games I've played in years. Where Resident Evil 1-3 were all about horror, 4 more about action/horror and 5 more action than horror, 6 has finally come to the point where there's no more horror at all, and it's all about the action. Granted, it's campaigns are long and to complete them all will take you well over 20 hours (1-1,5 hours per mission). But I couldn't even finish the journey. So far I've finished Leon's campaign and am near the end of Chris', but it's mostly shooting, with an awkward co-op partner at your side. The animations of Leon were wooden and there will tons of QTEs, yet Chris' animations were fine and his campaign had practically no QTEs. It's like they were made by entirely different teams. The Japanese influences can be seen in all of the campaigns and maybe that's what makes the game so boring. Instead of moving forward it looks like they went backwards when compared with Western developers. I can't really explain, it's just a feeling, and the fact that it's absolutely not scary at all, when, well, it should be. I heard good things about the Mercenaries mode so I'll be sure to give that a try, and I might finish the campaign over the next couple of weeks/months, but for now it's just too damn boring.Edit: I finished this later and unfortunately it never improved. So my original review still stands.[Rating: 65/100]			"

												I passionately love this game. I would definitely recommend picking it up and trying it.  Something I find very impressive is how smooth playing with people in different countries is (living in the US, I can easily play with a friend in Siberia with no issues whatsoever). The gameplay is fun and exciting, and while there certainly isn't the horror of previous games, if you enjoy action games, this certainly fits the bill.			"

												LOL. Capcom has taken the gloves off. They aren't even trying any more. The character interactions are a joke at best. The bosses are CLICHE, and that's being generous. It really feels as though Capcom is slapping the american gamers in the face with some of the sh!t they pull.The game play fails on every end.  You are clunky and not in full control over your character.  The amount of times the game is going to take control of your camera and force you to look at something useless is insulting.  Because it happens in the midle of a fire fight! It's not a survival horror game, because it's way to cheesy for that. It's not an action game, because you are most offten short on ammo when you're playing as Chris. The enimies have unlimited ammo, but don't always drop it when killed.If you are going to play this, just play Jake's and Leon's sections. As leon, you are at least killing zombies. And Jake... You will laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off if nothing else. If you ask me, $20 is twice what its worth. This game is hardly worth one play through; re5 was better.  That should say something.

												Terrible game sadly- too many cutscenes (many of them are unnecessary)  that makes the game really slow - way too many times you will die cheap deathes - many QTEs and this is not a good thing- if you finish one campaign the others will feel redundant if you want an action packed RE game then play RE 4 or if you want the survival horror RE then wait for RE 1 remake, even if you played all RE games still i would recommend staying away from this game.P.S. if i would recommend one campaign then i would say go for Leon's, it is by far the best out of the 4 included in this game.

The once famous and greatest survival horror game hast turned into the best action packed, co-op based third-person shooter I know of. And I'm not talking about Halo-style of co-op or gears of war-style of co-op, I'm talking about a game BUILT ARROUND THE CO-OP. There's no going alone here at all. You either play with a friend, a stranger or an AI partner. The AI is not all that bad actually. But just in case it screws up, your AI partner can't die. So all the complaints about the ""stupid RE5 partner AI"" fall off here. TL;DR:If you can stop wining about how ""this is not Resident evil"" and like co-op based games. This is a must have.			"

												Resident Evil 6 at its best is a varied and fun co-op experience that will keep you guessing what sort of scenario you'll find yourself in next, with some of the best controls in the series and some legitimate fun and tense segments. At its worst, it is a confused mess of ideas that tries to be everything, but doesn't quite refine or completely solidify any of its concepts. I almost reckon Resident Evil 6 to a grab-bag. It throws a lot at you; one moment you'll be in a ruined neighborhood in a zombie Apocalypse as chaos springs around you, next you'll be near-naked maneuvering a completely-white environment while stealthing to avoid setting off alarms, then flying a plane Ace Combat-style over the ocean, or scaling the side of a building as a colossal monster climbs right after you.If you're the type of gamer who enjoys sometimes complete nonsense with a friend, but also the variety of situations appeals to you, this will be right up your alley. It is a fun co-op game, the combat isn't well explained and can be frustrating at first, but once you begin to 'get it', it actually is rather in-depth, and Mercenaries is a lot of fun (the most similar comparison I can give is to the game Vanquish, if you have played it, as the combat focuses a lot on dodging gracefully and sanctification from pulling off insane stunts by risk and reward). There's a lot of content here, with four campaigns (each completely different) that last 5-8 hours each, as well as an addicting Mercenaries Mode and a rather throw-away but still good for a few laughs mode where you control the monsters in other peoples games during certain gameplay segments.But Resident Evil 6 is riddled with problems in its design, ranging from poor level-design, missing the sort of weapon upgrade system the last few 'action' RE titles incorporated to allow one to pick weapons by choice, the boss fights range from okay to dreadful (they're often more cinematic flairs than strategic or actually fun battles, which I felt RE4 and RE5 had), and simply some segments of the game just are not fun. And if you don't take the time to adjust to how the game plays (its pacing, controls, and the like on face value appear to be very much in-light with RE4 and RE5, but actually playing the game like those games isn't a lot of fun as the game is designed quite a bit differently) it is very possible you will not enjoy your time with it. It should also be mentioned that the story is terrible. Not cheesy B-fun like RE5 and RE4, not so-bad-its-good, but most of the story is just bad. I did enjoy some development in Chris's story, and the relationship between Jake and Sherry is cute, but outside of that, the basic 'plot' to the story almost feels like a fanfiction to the series.But still, I had a lot of fun with it. Something about never knowing what to expect, going from one ridiculous scenario to the next with a friend, and coming to terms with the game and actually feeling pretty awesome fighting off a fairly large array of enemies in Mercenaries Mode was worth it for me, and for those who just want a good, often ridiculous time with a friend, Resident Evil 6 can deliver some good laughs and some high peaks in spades. Just expect to waddle a bit through some drudgery.PS. I find a lot of people like different moments of the game the best, for the campaign, I will say my personal highs were (in no order) Leon Chapter 1, Leon Chapter 2, Jake Chapter 3, Jake Chapter 5, Chris Chapter 3, Chris Chapter 4, Ada Chapter 1, Ada Chapter 2, and Ada Chapter 4.

 I got RE6 through the recent Capcom Humble Bundle. RE6 is an uneven experience, lacking the input of either its masterminds (Mikami and Inafune) and relying on a ""let's do it all"" mentality backed by unrelenting budget, resulting a decent game buried somewhere beneath layers of sloppy execution and odd design decisions.Pros:- Nice graphics, varied scenery and competent art direction.- Unobtrusive music, great sound effects and terrific voice acting.- Workmanlike story and writing with pleasant storyline intersections.- When it sticks to the basics, the game plays great. - Lengthy campaign featuring four large ""acts"" with multiple playable characters.- The Mercenaries minigame can be great fun, even solo.Cons:- A metric ton of QTEs, some are easy, some are demanding, some are pointless and some are inhumane with insta-kill on failure.- A metric ton of ""sequences"", those either rely on QTEs or on contextual actions. (tap button infinitly to do this, tap buttons in rhythm to do that, etc)- The game often messes with the camera or strips you of control either to focus your attention on something or to show you a small, pointless cutscene. - Game mechanics aren't well realized: cover is useless, sliding is useless (good for breaking boxes though), dodging is almost useless, skill system is limiting at best, Combat Gauge bar needs deeper integration.- Atrocious inventory and inventory managment: you have to fumble through weapons/items with the wheel or with prev/next hotkeys like it's 1999. Also no hotkeys for weapon slots, which is a big blemish on the otherwise thorough KB/mouse support.- Online community is near non-existent.All zigzag, nothing else!Buy if you have to and at the cheapest price possible...!

												I like this game- hold it! Hold your tomatoes and hate for a moment! Look I get it, Resident Evil was a fun horror series with a totally different gameplay style and was horror focused and I agree that's how it SHOULD be. However- capcom dun screwed up and this is the result. On it's own the game is fun co-op, I'm sticking to that for this review as I've only ever played it co-op so just keep that in mind, however I'm going to try to limit comparing this to the other games because franky these may as well be called: Anti-Terrorism Heroes: EXTREME FORCESThe story is dumb, incredibly dumb over the top garbage with things that make no sense and are outright impossible. I'm all for silly goofy games like Earth Defense Force but this is TRYING to be serious. Though let it be noted no Resident Evil game ever really had a good story, it was more about the atmosphere and survival aspect. The lines are well acted for the most part but some things no matter how well acted if the writing is dumb, it's gonna be dumb. In short: do not buy this for the story. The gameplay is fun and keeps things moving, you have several campaigns to play through with all different characters and even enemies to deal with. There's all different guns and mechanics to how characters attack (with Melees and what not). It's a fun game to play through, the gameplay is solid and with a friend it's just a load of fun. The game really works well co-op, say what you will you actually have to work together at times and it makes it that much more enjoyable. Also, it's co-op online and split screen, that's REALLY uncommon with PC games so this is welcomeThis is only enhanced by the Mercenaries mode which is far far, FAR better on PC- how? They have a mode for PC only that has something like 5x the enemies in the game, it's insane how hard it can be to play and it's great for it. Mercs mode is a sort of survival/time trial mode, it ends when: every enemy has been killed, time runs out (extendable by melee kills or time icons). Each character is playable and has their own different equipment, so there's a lot to be played here- again extended by the PC version having Left 4 Dead 2 characters in it  <=awesome. Is it a good game? Well gameplay wise yes it's very fun with a friend, the story is dumb as hell but it ...keeps things moving I guess?Look is it as good as the old R.E. games? They're just not comparable, they're different and yes it's a shame they pulled a left turn with the series like this, especially with RE1 having such an incredible remake. But I can't deny this game has been a lot of fun. I know the hate is huge but screw it there's new horror games coming out and we'll get to enjoy those, capcom just ...isn't doing what any of their fans want. So, in short: Fun 2 player local/online co-op game, lots of time to put into it, variety of enemies, characters and weapons if this all sounds good? Give it a go, it's good.  "

Not Resident EvilI dreaded playing this black sheep of the franchise. Everywhere I turn on the internet this game gets critically slammed as being too distant from the originals. There's no suspense or horror here, it plays more like a standard third person cooridor shooter with an unfortunate abundance of QTEs. The series blight item management finally takes a chill pill, leaving you with plenty of room to store what you need and enough ammo to bring down everything. Bosses are the real highlight of this game, and while a couple might overstay their welcome, the battles themselves always finish spectacularly. The humorous, campy overtones from 4 are entirely gone, I'm guessing that's to dintinguish this as the serious zombie game (compared to Dead Rising). You'll spend over 20 hours playing the 4 intersecting, uniquely themed campaigns. I vastly prefer the masterpiece that is the original RE. Even so, don't snub this game just because it's different. For the ten bucks I paid for it, this game is a blast.There wasn't a single giraffe in this game though, ♥♥♥♥ing Capcom.			"

												This game is atrocious. It is so bad, I am not sure where to even begin, so let's just start with the intro scenes. The introduction takes about an hour to get through, and that is primarily because it seizes from you your ability to control the speed you move. You're literally forced to walk for most of the introduction. As though the creators thought that wasn't slow enough, you're also forced to escort people who move even slower than you do.Once you trudge through the horribly boring introduction, you can look forward to continuing to randomly have your ability to control your speed revoked. You can also look forward to inconsistent controls. Sometimes a melee attack will hit an enemy, sometimes not - I tested this after a checkpoint. To add to the unnecessary difficulty created by bad controls, you cannot attack the enemies that will stand up to attack you until after they do. This means that if you're supposed to walk across something that will try to grab your legs, you can't shoot it ahead of time, you literally HAVE to let it try to grab you before you can harm it.This game is clunky, slow, frustrating, and has taken several steps backwards from previous games. If ever there was a Resident Evil game to skip over, it is this one.			"

												I've been playing Resident Evil as far as I can remember. I remember popping open my PlayStation to play the Director's Cut of the original and being truly terrified. There was really no game like Resident Evil. Even as it went on, it just seemed to get better, especially with it's master bomb in 2004 with Resident Evil 4. But, as always, with great success comes imitators. Along came games inspired by the RE series, like Left 4 Dead, Dead Rising, etc. When this happened, this is when the RE series went downhill.Resident Evil 6 is the most different form in this franchise to date. For that, it has received a ton of flak and haters has been tearing it to shreds.The big changes come in the form of being able to move and shoot at the same time and the stories intersecting at certain points allowing for 4 player co-op at some points throughout the gameThe story itself is good if you follow the Resident Evil series. I thoroughly enjoyed the game's campaign in every way playing with friends in co-op, although the game is much less survival horror and much more horror shooter now. I'd like for it to go back to its roots but I'll take it as it is.For those who wondering why RE 6 Became disappointed for you, I will tell you why.Because of how much Capcom loves their Baby they decided to bring every cooking chefs to cook this game very well to become Tasty. but what happened is, when you bring too many chefs the Food will be too much cooked and will burn.meaning is. they cooked it too much.Overall: from RE old school player I enjoyed every RE game and I always take them as they are no matter how much they changed them. RE 6 is a Great dramatic action Packed & half horror game.As long as you like the story of the Resident Evil genre then this game is for you. If you can't look past the changes then you can always play the classic Resident Evil games.			"

												Oh my... god.I don't think I was quite pre-pared for how terrible this game is. To give a bit of a frame for that statement, I think Remember Me is a decent game, the basic functionality you expect is all present and while not perfectly polished it doesn't deliberately get in the way. Well, in Resident Evil 6 it deliberately is in the way pretty much the entire game. Everything bare shooting is contextual. Which means that not only the levels are on rails, but that what you as a player can do is extremely on rails. Limiting freedom and as a direct result, pretty much negating any experimentation to be done, making the whole game a monotone press A feast (or what-ever the equivalent keyboard key is).At least... that is what you'd think, right? Sadly, even with everything so heavily restricted it still doesn't quite work right. Executions not working, despite the prompt being visible was an all too common occurrence.Another quip to be had with the technicalities is that it is literally a console port. Textures, details, effects and graphical options are all absent or of sub-par quality. While I can forgive some of that, textures in particularly should have being an easy addition for the computer version. If I wanted to stare at Doom like textures, I'd just launch Doom, at least that game works and lets me do what-ever I want, while looking terrible for today's standards.Now, as for story, as someone whom gave out on Resident Evil after part 2. (I've played some of 3 and 5, at a friends) Well, all of it didn't make sense. It is entirely uninteresting for anyone that isn't knee deep in the universe its lore. There's no other motivation than ""Let's shoot some zombies"" to bind anyone other than the Resident Evil Fan. Why? Because the character stories are laughable, spoiler for the Leon part ahoy!As you start of the Leon part you'll begin by shooting the president. Apparently, that's very shocking, but not shocking enough to build up toward that occurrence, instead you may, right after escort random person A and random daughter of A whom will turn into zombies. It might be me, but it will probably be more... interesting to, you know, combine the two... escort someone the characters care about. But the game apparently has no time for that, because soon after you're stuck with another group of survivors, oh, my bad! They are all dead. Oh, but we've got to rescue your sister, no Leons sister, he doesn't have one, or does he? Here the game fooled me, actual story! Or well, so I hoped, just mystery now, but someone to save. I even have to rush down with her on my back while Leon fends of the zombies! This might go somewhere. Aaaaaand she turned into some kind of naked spider zombie. Yay. Something about revenge after that, but honestly who can give a crap after tossing every bit of potential out of the window?Well, that was a waste of money.			"

												╔══════ஜ۩۞۩ஜ══════╗ ║ＲＥＳＩＤＥＮＴ ＥＶＩＬ б ♥║╚══════ஜ۩۞۩ஜ══════╝The release of Resident Evil, back in 1996, marked a before and after in the world of video games. Sixteen years later, Capcom presents the sixth installment of the series numbered. Are expectations are renewed?Before starting the analysis itself, I want to stress that I am a fan of the first games of the franchise, of which scary, of which coined the term survival horror in the industry. With this in mind, I invite you to keep reading.► ＴＨＥ ＧＯＯＤ ◄ ✔ Resident Evil 6 is an ambitious bet (more than 600 people participated in the project), and this is reflected in a complete, comprehensive product with many alternatives to have the disc in the console for several weeks.✔ We start three seasons at our disposal: that of Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield of and Jake Muller. Within each, we have the option to choose characters, allowing us to play individually or cooperatively (either online or offline).✔ Thus, Leon and Chris have debutantes escort to Helena Harper and Piers Nivans, respectively, while Jake is accompanied by the adult and Sherry Birkin.✔ Each campaign will require us approximately six or seven hours. And when you hang unlock Ada Wong's campaign, with the loose ends they left previously joined. In total, we can talk easily 25 hours of play, something unusual for a third person shooter.✔ The campaign is very replayable, since we have the ability to play via online with someone else. In fact, there are times when stories are intertwined, which can generate meetings of up to four people. A very interesting element.✔ In addition, there are challenges that are rewarded with titles to decorate the plates that identify us in the online game. And collectibles, which this time are emblems that allow us to unlock art.✔ Besides, we have the classic Mercenaries mode, but with a change from the first deliveries. we will not have to go from one point to another avoiding monsters, but now we face waves of enemies in a challenge trial.✔ As you can imagine, it can also be played online (something highly recommended). As we are setting records, we can unlock additional characters and costumes. But just three scenarios, giving us lights come where the first DLC the game.✔ Another interesting addition is the Chase Agents mode, which can throw into a jail to a zombie or one of the many mutations that appear in the game, making life impossible for someone who is going on the campaign. It is an attractive alternative, I admit, but does not give enough to keep you hooked long time.✔ The Predator mode we find the classic game 'all against one'. One player will be a Ustanak, and duty will kill other players. Meanwhile, the human team will have to track her down and eliminate or outlive their stalkers skills. The winner of this game will be the mode you gain more points Ustanak round (each player will play 6 which supports once as this bioweapon B.O.W.), and the truth is very entertaining.✔ Survivors mode DLCS one of the best that could have this wonderful game honestly is like a very dynamic versus mode will change as players between humans or zombies in a struggle to win as the last survivor. If you kill human being, you go to an enemy; but if you just under infection with a human you become reborn as such. Games can be 2 to 6 users, and the last player (or team) one standing, or get the highest score will be victorious.✔ Finally, Invasion is nothing more than the version of Resident Evil 6 'horde mode' so fashionable in action games, with some modifications. This mode pits two players individually against waves of enemies, however, they wiped creatures performing combos will be sent t✔ And in Jake's campaign we have a persistent Ustanak steps following us. This monster would become a more agile (and with a hairstyle ambiguous something) version of Nemesis. In short, we can say that there are a variety of enemies. That is guaranteed.✔ Another highlight is the sound effect. All explosions, screams of zombies and mutations and even the dialogues have a very high level. At the same time, the soundtrack features successful pieces that reinforce what happens on screen.► ＴＨＥ ＢＡＤ ◄ ✘ The plot of Resident Evil 6 is loose and despite the divisions of history and logic crosses, does not add much to the universe created by Capcom. Albert Wesker died, the writers had to find a new antagonist and this ended up being a wimp, a mock boss.✘ What at first it seems an intricate, interesting and even intriguing story is diluted in the early hours. Everything is predictable, everything has an obvious explanation and many nods to previous games were wasted awkwardly.✘ To make matters worse, every time we have a pointer that will indicate our destination and the distance we have to travel to reach it. And if that's not enough, it is at our disposal a kind of GPS will tell us where to go. Easier, impossible.✘ While Resident Evil 6 was sold as a game in which sought to please all fans of the series (ie, a mix of action and survival horror), the end result ends up being very different.✘ But to be an action game, control is not entirely polished. We have a vague and even illogical look, with a laser pointer that moves arbitrarily regardless of whether the target is already focused.► ＴＨＥ ＵＧＬＹ ◄ ✎ As I stepped forward, Resident Evil 6 was sold as a game for all fans of the saga. However, the three major campaigns seem too each other, presenting all repetitive shootings, including sneaks occasional confrontation with a deputy.✎ Puzzles (both pledged) are incidental and obvious solution. In fact, the protagonists complain about having to fix them. And worst of all is that, due to the nature of Resident Evil 6, these puzzles end up cutting the pace of the game.✦ Conclusion : Resident Evil 6 is a game that will not go unnoticed for fans of the franchise. It is a fact. Much has promised demo and increased expectations. However, the end result is far from what is offered. We are facing an action game with zombies and mutants including (a kind of Gears of War?). But ends up being a bad action title, since its gameplay is not quite polished and, even worse, the camera complota against us. As a fan, I had to play Resident Evil 6, but leaving aside all the survivors mode is the best that could have this game but would be a total disgust and that alone recommend it.And you, have you played Resident Evil 6 ?, what you think of the game? Do you recommend?			"

A combination of everything.Resident evil 6 is the 6th entry to main 'resident evil' series. I began playing 6 after completing revelations, 4 and 5. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this game after looking at reviews and what not. However, after playing it for a while, I found that it has strengths and flaws.StoryHonestly it's a mess. The story is split into 4 campaigns. In each campaign you get to experience the story through the eyes of 1 or 2 characters. The problem is that their segments happen at different points in the timeline, so if you just play one campaign you will definitely be left confused. I was able to follow the story by completing one segment of a campaign, quiting and checking cutscenes menu to see which character's campaign level came next (ultimately playing all four at once). This did somewhat disrupt the gameplay, but definitely made the plot more understandable.GameplayForget horror, Resident evil 6 went full on action.  To explain clearly Resident evil 6 is like getting Resident evil 5 and giving it crack and polishing. The controls are the best in series yet. You can move freely while aiming and have the ability to freely dodge at a press of a button. Movement feel fluid and not clunky. Inventory management also makes a comeback, with items stored into horizontal segments.  You have a variety of weapons available including rifles, pistols, magnums, grenades, flash bang, flame grenades and knife. You can't upgrade weapons like previous entries. Instead, before starting the next campaign segment you can select and upgrade perks. Perks include increasing damage with weapons, getting more money, health, etc. There are no stores to buy weapons, health and ammo. You have to scavenge for them in the map or corpses instead. Unlike in previous entries where close combat was a dangerous affair, Resident evil 6 allows you to easily dispatch foes via melee attacks. You face a wide range of enemies including range, melee, wolves, zombies and bosses. there is plenty of cover available for you and your enemies to use. In a sense, this makes the game feel more like a third person shooter rather than a horror game. An issue I had with this game is the number of QTE (quick time events). There are so many of them during gameplay and cutscenes that kinda ruined the emertion with the game. There is an option that allows you to succeed all QTE during cutscenes, but not for gameplay unfortunately. Another issue I had was the camera suddenly changing POV, which takes control away from the player (forcing them to look in a particular direction) and made it cumbersome to navigate areas. The gameplay types are somewhat split amongst the four campaigns.Leon/Helen Campaign = Action, zombies and puzzlesChris/Pierce = ActionJake/Sherry = Mix of everythingAda = Stealth and puzzles GraphicsDefinitely an improvement over previous entries. Character models have good detail. The same can also be said of the environment as well.AudioAudio is acceptable. Voice acting is good with no annoying characters for a change (I'm looking at you Ramon Salazar, Ashley and Irving). Weapon sound effect are good as well.ExtrasLike many resident evil games there is extra content to find and unlock. Each level in the campaign has a set of 'serpent medallions' for you to find and shoot (similar to BSSA Badges in resi 5). For each one you shoot, you collect documents which contain background information on the various characters in the campaign. If you complete a row of them, you unlock character trophies. After completing one of the campaigns, you will get the option of playing ""New Game +"" which transfers all your weapons and items in your next playthrough. There is also a section which allows you to view the cutscenes which you have seen during the campaign.Mercenaries mode also makes a return. If you are unfamiliar, mercenaries mode places you (with or without another player) as one of several selectable characters in a map trying to hold out until the timer runs out. Each map has unique enemies, which come at you. There are items such a healing, ammo etc scattered around the map for you to collect. Time bonuses are available to extend the time to rack up a higher score. At the end of the round you get a score. Depending on how high the score is, you may unlock a new character to play with. New stages are unlocked by completing previous ones or playing the campaign.No mercy mode is similar to standard mercenaries. The difference is that there are more enemies present at once so you can rack up higher scores. Also you can play as Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D) characters and Face some L4D 2 monster as well.Final VerdictIf you are looking for a classic resident evil game with horror, stay the hell away. If you are looking for a good action game to be played with friends, this game will satisfy you.			"

												This is a game that is very confused on what it's trying to be. It's not awful but honestly if you're looking for any of the fun or feeling of Resident Evil 4-5 than don't buy this. You will be sorely dissapointed. It's just an average Gears of War ripoff now. Very sad to see the Resident Evil series sink this low. 4/10			"

												Now with 50% more explosionsThe newest game in the Resident Evil series, this game covers a number of characters from earlier titles, including Chris Redfield, Leon Kennedy and Ada Wong, as well as newly introduced characters like Jake Muller, as they deal with the newest virus outbreak. StoryA new terrorist organization calling itself Neo-Umbrella has managed to release their newest virus, and you will get to play through four different campaigns to find out exactly what is happening. There are a few surprises through the story, and I recommend leaving Ada for last as her campaign will spoil quite a bit otherwise.PresentationGraphically, the game is beautiful. Capcom didn't skimp on the visuals, with enemy models showing damage as you take them down, and the human characters looking pretty great as well. Locations are nice, and blurry textures were pretty rare during my time with the game. On to the sound, and most of it is good here. For the music, it rarely did much to get me scared, but it never got irritating. The sound effects are a lot better, and the voice acting is well down, with the growls and moans from the zombies being just what I want to hear in a horror game. ControlsBreak out that 360 gamepad. Dealing with quick time events on the keyboard was a pain, and this game has a fair number of them. Its a lot easier to pull that stuff off with the gamepad.  Once you are using one, controls shouldn't be a problem, the mapping for it is just fine.GameplayAnd now for the most important part of any review, how the game plays. Sadly, this section is where it starts to get disappointing. Resident Evil 4 and 5 were shifting the series away from survival horror to an action game, and it seems as if this is finally done. Helicopters attempting to gun you down in the streets, running for your life as everything explodes behind you, gun fights everywhere you look, the series has changed a lot since the release of the original Resident Evil. While there are still a lot of zombies, mostly in the Leon campaign, most of your fights will instead be with the J'avo, mutated humans who still have access to all sorts of guns and other weapons. Would will be spending a fair chunk of battles taking cover from your enemies and popping out to let off your own bursts of fire. Damage their body and they may mutate further to deal with it, such as growing new limbs to replace the damaged ones or becoming beast like creatures which require more work to bring down.LifespanHere the game isn't too bad. As well as a campaign that can last about 20 hours, there are a few extra modes like the classic Mercenaries mode, the multiplayer Agent Hunt mode, and a few others which can be purchased as DLC. Mercenaries has you against a large number of zombies and dealing with a timer. Rush to take them down, with each kill granting you more time, but trying to stay alive won't be easy. There is also the No Mercy mode for Mercenaries, which allows co-op and includes content from the Left 4 Dead series from Valve.Agent Hunt is an interesting idea. In this mode, you will take control of a random enemy and connect to a game of another user. You will then get the chance to attempt to kill the user yourself. Should he manage to take you down, you will simply become yet another creature in that map. As well as the bonus modes, there are a number of collectables to find and destroy during the campaign, which unlock profiles and character models.GlitchesOne rather annoying problem I had with this game was a glitch that causes the game to take a fair bit of time to start up. This doesn't effect everyone fortunately. I only need to wait on a blank screen for three minutes, but while looking on forums for help, I found others who were waiting up to fifteen minutes. ClosingDespite the shift in focus for the series, this isn't a horrible game. It can be incredibly fun if you just want to mow down hundreds of enemies. Sadly, it isn't anything impressive, and with the glitch I mentioned above, it only gets a 6.			"

												While Resident Evil 5 was a bad Resident evil but a good TPS,  Resident evil 6 is a bad Resident evil and a bad TPS.The fact that it's not a survival horror game anymore doesn't bother me that much, hell, I enjoyed RE5 a lot. But this one, ♥♥♥♥ me : The story is awful, the controls are clunky, the J'avos are one terrible idea, you have, like in 5, way too much QTE's... but more than that, the real problem with this game is that everything is scripted. Every single thing this game has to offer is scripted. For example, you can't shoot an infected faking death on the ground. You ♥♥♥♥ing can't do that. You know that this thing is going to bite you as soon as he is able to, but no, you have to wait for the game to activate the ennemy and tell you when and where you are going to kill him. That's insane. You're on rails from the beginning to the end, and there is nothing you can do about it. That's the Resident Evil 6 experience.The only thing saving this game is the cooperation mode, everything is way better with a friend. But even with that, it's still a mediocre game. If you're in the mood to play some zombie action with a friend, you should play Dead rising 2 and 3, Dying light, Resident evil 5. Hell, since you're trading bullets 75% of the game in RE6, you should give Gears of war a try.What a waste Capcom.			"

												I just played and finished RE4, RE5 and RE6 and I really enjoyed playing Resident Evil 6, it has a very big movie like cinematic feel and I loved how all FOUR of the campaigns were interwoven and worked together to tell the story, it was fast, it was fun.  This game is NOT the RE 1,2,3 ""Horror Survival Experience"", things change and evolve and after RE3. RE 4,5,6 are more of an ""Action/Horror Experience"", to me in my opinion it is almost like trying to start comparing both Star Wars Trilogy's, they are both Star Wars but they are both very different and I enjoy all six of those movies as much as I enjoy all of the six core Resident Evil games and that is including RE6 which does get allot of hate. But anyway, I will say that Leon's campaign has the most RE feel to it and while it can be a good argument that RE6 has a few too many ""QTE"" Quick Time Events RE6 is fast , fun, good story, great graphics, Co-Op and the added PC mode of ""Mercenaries No Mercy"" is just a blast to play Solo or with friends and with the characters from ""Left For Dead 2"" added it just puts it over the top awesome....

												If this is a bad game, I had too good a time to notice that fact :).After playing the second trilogy of Resident Evil, starting with RE4 and slowly building my way to the climax, Resident Evil 6 did not suprise me in how huge, ridiculous, goofy, tense, and fun it was. The fact that this game has gained as much hate as it has shows me that this series is personal to a lot of people, and everyone has a definition of what Resident Evil means to them. To those who define Resident Evil by the first trilogy (third person fixed cameras with survival horror camp), the hate is understandable. For those who played a majority of the first trilogy (I myself played/beat RE1 and 2, watched 3, and played Code: Veronica) and went on to embrace the larger plot which really did call for more of an action horror slant, Resident Evil 6 tied up everything with a huge bang as a lot of our favorite Resident Evil heroes save the world.After playing a majority of the Resident Evil titles, I now know what Resident Evil means to me. As much as I love the original trilogy, I realize that RE means Chris, Jill, Leon, Claire, Barry, Rebecca, Ada Wong and numerous other RE heroes saving the world from Umbrella and various viruses in good old B survival or action horror camp, and enjoying the ride, no matter how ludicrous. If that rings a bell with you, read on.(God bless you for reading on)First lets deal with the technical. The game looks really great. The soundtrack is exciting and can be eerily quiet at times. The AI partners are not stupid (yes, Shiva from RE5, I'm looking at you!). I never had to worry about my partner running out of ammo unless I wanted to turn that option off, and I trusted that my partner would have my back. While the AI partner does help in a fight, it is you that has to deal the final blow to bosses. When I died, it was due to my lack of ability and not my partner doing their best to keep me alive. The combat was very smooth. I didn't always have to worry about lack of bullets, although they are scarce, because I could do martial arts. I loved being able to roundhouse enemies if I had too, and then stomp on them. Also, each character has a different fighting style. Some are fluid martial artists, while Chris is a soldier who isn't busy showing off his kung fu but throws a heavy punch showing off that famous bicep ;). The first technical negative I found was the different menu systems. They were a pain. Remember when you had one menu and you could do everything from that one menu? Well apparently thats too simple. In one menu, you can see all your stuff, but in another menu you combine herbs and reload your weapons. Trust me, when in the heat of battle, it is infuriating. Also, there really isn't a pause option. When you hit pause, your character will kneel down to look at their phone, hoping that whatever changes you need to make will be done quickly because the monsters are still attacking you. That was annoying. Also, remember in classic RE when you unlocked weapons and outfits, and they were yours? Well now its a little more complicated. Now you have to gain points by doing killing combos and then using said points to buy the weapons or outfits you unlocked. This may up the replayability but to me its just a slap in the face, adding more work when I technically feel that unlocking abilities and costumes should make them mine now!The voice acting was superb. The script was very well done, with one liners that stood apart from the rest of the series (no Jill sandwich homage here). The relationships forged between partners was real. They had me tearing up at moments and then giving me sighs of contentment at others. Also, not every moment on this game was explosions and Sci-Fi Channel zombie ridiculousness. Sometimes the games was tight and quiet, and that to me was a nice nod to us old school RE fans that enjoyed slowly walking through corridors, wondering what C virus abomination we would face next. Or if we would run into the boss that just refused to die! The motto for the heroes of this game is never to get up. Well apparently the bosses overheard that pep talk and decided that was a good idea, because my goodness they just won't die! To me, the goofiest thing about the game is the sheer determination of this games bosses.Now the campaigns. I loved them all for very different reasons. Leon's campaign by far is the most ridiculous and goofy. I bet its his campaign that gives the game its bad rap. Plus, there is no Claire. Leon is the one that is targeting the main antagonist of the game, and I enjoyed the exciting progression through the game. It was nice to see Ada Wong cross his path (though to be fair Ada Wong crosses everybody's path). Jake's campaign is awesome in that it pairs him with Sherry Birkin, a nod to all us RE2 fans. Now we get to see what happened to that sweet girl we protected all those years ago. While I have shipped other RE characters, this campaign definitely had a kind of underlying attraction between the two characters as they go from warily trusting each other, to sparks of gratitide and attraction. Its heartwarming amongst all the mutated zombies. Then Chris's campaign, which at first I didn't think I'd like because Chris is leading his soldiers on a different front then Leon or Jake, but that ties in perfectly with the story. It's much more than Chris and his squad shooting zombies. It is definitely more psychological, and telling why would be spoiling ;). After playing Leon's, Jake's, and Chris's campaign, the story will still not be complete. A few puzzles pieces are missing. Thats when you get to play Ada Wong's campaign and what a payoff. Ada knows what is up. She is behind the scenes tweaking the scenarios that in the other campaigns will make you think, ""Well that was convenient! How did that happen?"". Ada is happening everywhere, behind the scenes. The only puzzles you really will encounter are in her campaign, and they are nothing compared to the beginnings of the series, but then again they weren't a big thing in RE4 or RE5. By the end of Ada's campaign, you will know the whole story, and the trilogy is neatly tied up, and in my opinion Resident Evil is successfuly concluded.Resident Evil is a mutation of a game series that has changed and tried new things. Honestly, I don't think this game deserved the amount of hate it got. When I play a RE game, I want to save the world from zombies as one of my favorite STARS members, or their family members and best friends, get scared or at least very concerned, and have fun. For me, this game checks off all the necessary boxes.			"

												Resident Evil 6 is a decrepit dog with a lamp-shade collar strangling its neck; it's pathetic, drawn-out, and somehow endearing. The game is spread across four campaigns, its legs trembling to stay on a cohesive ground. It doesn't know whether it wants to appeal to the Gears of War crowd, the Metal Gear Solid 4 lovers, or those who loved the survival action of Resident Evil 4. The sorry folks looking for a return to the tank controls and stark survival challenge of pre-4 RE games have long been angrily foaming at the mouth due to the series' action-game evolution. With 6, those mouths will continue to foam an ocean. Each campaign allows for a non-frightening co-op experience of shooting, moving, shooting, and kicking. Bring a friend along and laugh at cutscenes involving zombified Presidents and action movie cliches that have been outdated since 1998. Cackle when your partner keeps dying because of a poorly telegraphed scripted event involving a careening van. Through the laughs and the spastic camera, you may learn to warm up to this thing. The melee combat and head splattering can often be a crunchy delight. Chris Redfield's biceps have somehow shrunk since the last game as well and it feels like progress. I would compare this game to a ""B-movie"" if I didn't know about the IV money drip that Capcom pricked into this specimen. RE6 is like knowing that Armageddon's IMDB rating has been slowly rising over the past decade and resigning to the idea that everything will be OK. RE6 is an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet in small-town Oklahoma with the 1990's Capcom startup jingle playing on loop through a jukebox. Pay no more than 7.50 and slurp it down. You know you want to, you mangy mutt.			"

												Resident Evil has changed a lot over the years and the changes are not why I would not recommend this game.  The negative review comes from the fact that the game has a lot of flaws in my opinion.  I would really like to point out the things I like about the game first.  RE6 has great co-op features including the ability to play as monsters.  There are multiple characters that you play through and there are multiple story lines because of that.  This gives the game a lot of replayability and variety.  The story paths are split up into pairs of characters played alone or co-op, except for one story that is single player, and the story lines cross over each other allowing up to four player co-op at times.  Right now I bet you're saying, ""WTF!!!! This game sounds awesome, why the negative recommendation?"".  Well, that's because the save points are terrible making huge parts the story being replayed if you quit.  Another bad point is the fact that there is no way to kick a partner which can leave you stuck between quitting and replaying huge amounts of the story or being trapped with complete jerks at times.  Now I think this game will appeal to a lot of people too.  It is basically a third person corridor shooter so fans of that genre will most likely enjoy this game.  I just find the constant switch flipping and running back and forth in corridors a bit tedious.  RE6 is one of those games that is really on the border of being enjoyable for me but the drawbacks just slightly outweighed the assets.			"

												A flawed title which hides some of the deepest and most fun combat mechanics in a TPS, but only for those who are willing to go beneath the seemingly shallow surface. As, unfortunately, the game barely bothers to teach the player anything about them.			"

												As a ""PC"" game this game is a mess. The UI is confusing, the HUD Is unclear to a new player, the menu system is atrocious. Coop is annoying on several levels. The coop player cannot perform story actions, but that includes opening doors, finding items in rooms that can be ""activated"" or similar. If you had an option called ""Action reaction (on/off)"" what would you think it did? give up? Friendly fire.			"

												A great game if you consider it for what it is, an action game with some survival horror aspects and good enemy AI. Although it has a simple storyline and poor graphics in some areas, it delivers fun and entertaining gameplay with progressive challenges and rewards. I would recommend buying it on sale.			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Resident Evil 6 Xbox One 

			Views: 9,239		

			Resident Evil 6 was recently released for next gen consoles. Is it worth a revisit? Find out in our review! Review: Trent and Nathan Edit: Valente Audio: Josh		

Resident Evil didn't invent the survival horror genre as we know it, that distinction belongs to 1992's Alone in the Dark, but it is the franchise that popularized the genre and as a result has become the standard bearer. Over the series 20 year history, it has evolved and changed to stay keep up with modern gameplay and mechanics; pre-rendered back drops were ditched in favor of fully 3d modeled environments. Grid based tank controls and fixed camera angles evolved into a tight over the shoulder perspective with swifter character movement and a dedicated single player experience has been replaced by co-operative gameplay. While no one can accuse the franchise of failing to evolve, it's entirely fair to criticize what it has evolved into. Starting with RE4, the series morphed into a more action game, alienating purists but ultimately appealing to a larger audience. Resident Evil 6 is Capcom's attempt to give both purists and newcomers an agreeable middle ground by splitting the game into four smaller campaings with different protagonists and gameplay styles. The problem is that Capcom's attempt to please everyone has given us a game that fully pleases no one. 	Players take control of Leon Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong in four separate but interwoven campaigns in an effort to combat the C-Virus. It's a globe spanning whodunit, though players will have cracked the game's mysteries long before the reveal. Players will benefit from having played the other titles in the series in order to have an understanding of the backgrounds of each character. The problem with Resident Evil 6's narrative is that it attempts to be a bigger, more bombastic version of the events in previous games but it only manages to feel needlessly convoluted and dry... The narratives of previous Resident Evil titles have had a silly B movie charm while lovingly fleshing out the game's mythos with countless files and documents. The increase in scope and size ruins the B movie charm but is still too absurd to have blockbuster appeal. The characters have been written into corners and their individual narratives are so complex and independent of each other that this attempt to write these series favorites into the same chain of events is forced and clumsy. It's clear that a narrative reboot is in order for the franchise to retain the charm and quality the first games were known for.	Gameplay has received and overhaul that moves Resident Evil further toward pure action. Characters can now aim while moving and heal with the press of a button. While these tweaks are convenient, they take away much of the tension present in previous entries to the franchise. A clunky Gears of War style cover system has also been added pushing the gameplay too far from the series' roots. Puzzles are restricted to Leon and Ada's campaign further betraying the roots of the series. In addition to these changes the game features idiotic cinematic action sequences on motorcycles, jets and snowmobiles that offer needless spectacle. The attempt to force these visually complex and flashy moments into the game cheapens the whole experience. Between the gunplay and watching your characters survive plane crashes, car crashes, helicopter crashes and surviving falls from high places a few zombies don't really pose a credible threat. With its ultra resilient characters Resident Evil 6 could be reskinned as a Justice League game with little effort. As with other action games expect an irritating amount of stick waggling and button mashing thanks to copious quick time events. A spare controller might be required. The melee system has been overhauled as well offering a number of context sensitive commands that frankly make it completely overpowered. Seriously, you can punch your way through half of the game on professional difficulty. It has never been easier to conserve ammo in a Resident Evil though it's not like the game isn't generous in that regard anyway. Speaking of conserving ammo, you will actually be spending most of your time dumping it on the ground thanks to a miserable inventory system. Your characters carry around more guns than John Matrix during the finale of Commando but it doesn't leave much room for bullets. There is also no item swapping between AI or human partners and the UI itself is atrocious. 	Each campaign generally offers a players a different flavor and some try to recall previous games in the franchise. Leon's campaign is our favorite since it is generally the most traditional. There are a few puzzles and the environments in his campaign are among the most atmospheric in the game. Chris' campaign is pretty much an unofficial Gear of War title, emphasizing gunplay and taking players through a fictional war torn eastern European country called Edonia. It's the weakest campaign in the game as a result of it's fixation with bullets and chest high walls. Jake Muller's campaign is interesting at first since he and series darling Sherry Birkin have to face off against a Nemesis-like creature called the Ustanak. Unlike Resident Evil 3 and Resident Evil 2's scenario B featuring Tyrant, the game design telegraphs the appearance of the Ustanak killing any tension or sense of unpredictability this unstoppable beast might have otherwise provided. The Ustanak also facilitates some of the obnoxious  action set pieces that force players into watching ♥♥♥♥♥♥, bloated cinematic sequences while mashing buttons during quick time events. Since Ada takes her campaign on alone it's more about stealth and offers several puzzles. It works well enough and comes out as one of the stronger campaigns. Having several interconnecting campaigns also means that you replay the same segments with multiple characters and it's completely unnecessary and lazy. If you are not playing the same sections with different characters you can expect to experience the same gameplay gimmicks; like finding three keys in a labyrinth of hallways while being chased by unkillable regenerators. It's like waking up in Bill Murray's shoes in Groundhog Day. Only worse.	While it may sound like this is the most awful Resident Evil game to date, the truth is that it was one of the best action games on the market when it was released. When seen as a competitor to games like Gears of War it's stumbles and inconsistencies are more forgivable. The frustrating thing is there are moments in the game that are excellent and are a sign of what could have been if this game was focused on being a Resident Evil game first and pleasing a mass audience second. We expect moody atmosphere, slower paced gameplay and tension from anything in a box that says Resident Evil. In their attempt to give everyone something to like about this game they have created a game that lacks cohesion and focus. After experiencing one of Resident Evil 6's stand out moments, it doesn't take long before the game has your trudging through more cover based shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or waggling your stick like you're having a seizure. It's four campaigns plus Mercenaries mode equates to over 100 hours of entertainment for fans. Each campaign attempts to use some of the best aspects of previous games to give players a total package. Yet, when it all comes together the only thing that makes it feel like a Resident Evil game are the familiar faces of Chris, Ada, Leon and Sherry. In an age where we often get so little for our buck, Capcom tried to give us everything fans could want but it's so inconsistent; wasting time and effort to give players glitz and spectacle instead of tension and scares. It would seem that the survival horror genre that we fell in love with in the 90's is dead. The twitch fodder hide and seek games that are now considered survival horror are mechanically shallow. I hope that the RE2 remake will remind Capcom why the franchise was brilliant.			"

												The Good: Lots of content, with the different campaigns have quite different feels; some nice, atmospheric setpieces; plenty of fun co-op gameplay.The Bad: Too much annoying fake difficulty with lousy camera angles and the game snatching away your control; takes itself too seriously and doesn't embrace the cheese. None of the villains live up to the ones in RE 5 for example.The Ugly: The BOW escape in Chris/Piers campaign. If you're not using a controller, you're out of luck, as the stupid camera changes and insanely hard timing mean you have to grind this one setpiece a couple of dozen times.I would recommend this to people who liked RE 4 or 5, have a lot of patience, and a controller. Because screw that BOW escape sequence, seriously. Anyone else... not so much. "

												i read the reviews and still i had to get this game, (knew what to expect which was little but as an RE addict i could never NOT purchase an RE game)i tried many a forum and could not get this game to play without glitches, i really hope that this franchise will change some things up & change the game play and crazy long cut scenes, no one loves resident evil like i do (well no one i know over 40 like i am) truly like revelations but still the game play is goofy after playing a game like bioshock or dishonored, the RE franchise could be so much more and hopefully the future will see things improving and getting back to old school scares w updated game play.

												I don't know why there are so much hate for this game. RE6 doesn't totally suck. In fact, I enjoy playing it with my partner. I love the Co-Op. We're still going through with the entire campaign and so far, loving it! Although far from perfect, I enjoy playing this game than Revelations (Sorry, I just have to put it out). Revelations is awesome, Jill is awesome, but zombie factor? Nuh-uh. I love the Bosses/Special Zombies kn this game. But yea sure, we miss the classic RE style,(the game feels less Survival-ish, and more Mission-ish) and we wish the chances of playing with other players (campaign crossovers) are high, and we wish they had used some characters we missed, still, the game is good. I do miss the classic RE where you have to figure out on your own what to do, which way to go, and how to do it unlike this one where everything is almost handed out to you. All you have to do is click or tap. (but since technology has advanced since then, well, it makes it kinda realistic I guess) I love how there are more than one campaign to play and the Extras are fun! I love playing Mercs with other players. Overall, I say you guys should give this game a try! I recommend it!			"

												+ Mechanically it's Resident Evil 4 and 5 combined into an actual coherent combat system. On PC this game is more enjoyable than the console iterations from the simple fact that alot of ""gotcha"" instant deaths can be avoided from having mouse aiming alone.- There is no atmosphere to the game. It has nothing in terms of exploration for side story such as reading notes from long dead persons who inhabited the world before you could explore it. It's very much a ""press onward to victory through combat"" type of game.All in all it's better played as a great co-op action game with friends.			"

												11/27/16 - NominatedEach one of the 4 campaigns focuses on a different aspect that the RE games have covered. Starting with Leon's campaign we have a more old-school and slower-paced experience that aims to recapture the urban pandemonium of Raccoon City, except on a much larger scale as it takes us into China. Zombies and their assorted variants are the only enemies you'll face here (with the exception of the Rasklapanje, which shows up in all the other campaigns, and Ustanak) and you can tell that Capcom made a conscious decision to make sure that any other types of enemies did not appear within this campaign. The overall theme of horror is maintained all the way up until the middle of the 4th chapter when all hell breaks loose. Ending in true Resident Evil style via the use of a rocket launcher on the antagonist of that campaign.Next up is Chris' campaign. As you'd have guessed after playing Resident Evil 5, his campaign focuses on mostly action with one segment that is a tribute to Yawn from the original Resident Evil. Enemies in this campaign are strictly the gun-toting J'avo and their subsequent mutations. The J'avo are not to be confused with zombies, and as such do not fit any criteria of that word's definition. J'avo are the main reason for the more action-oriented segments within that campaign. Chris' story ends in one of the more dramatic scenes in Resident Evil history that truly sets the overall theme of redemption and sacrifice which his campaign covers.Jake's campaign sees the illegitimate son of Albert Wesker being pursued by Neo Umbrella. I'd say that if there were one word to best describe the aspect that his story covers it would be ""Retreat"". Appropriately so, as the C-Virus B.O.W ""Ustanak"" hunts Jake down every step of the way in a clear nod to the Nemesis Tyrant from the game of the same name. Again, J'avo are the only enemies you'll encounter within this scenario.Lastly we have Ada's campaign which is the most varied of all the stories, though it focuses more on stealth, survival and puzzles. In it you'll fight both zombies and J'avo as you try to unravel the mystery of Ada's doppleganger.So now that we've covered the overall themes of the campaigns, let's get into what really sets this game apart from other Shooters. This game easily has the most fluid controls of any TPS I've ever played. Though at first glance, the game's controls seem pretty straight-forward for a TPS. L-trigger aims your weapon, right trigger shoots when your weapon is readied and melees when it isn't, while L3 makes you sprint. There is a cover system as well, but it's rudimentary and not nearly as elaborate as something like GoW or AoT. (Think of its inclusion in the same way that multiplayer functions in Dark Souls. It's implemented on a basic level and usually won't be used, but still useful when you find yourself in a bad situation.). Here, the game passes itself off as a generic shooter until you actually discover the dodging and melee mechanics. There is a good deal for me to cover, but let's start with the basics and a video of how well the combat system works when mastered 


YouTube™ Video: Resident Evil 6: Mechanics Guide

			Since this is my first video, don't expect the editing work to be absolutely flawless. I did the best I could for my first time using a program(s) I'd never worked with before.		

Hitting A or L3 (360 Controller) while your weapon is readied will cause you to dodge in place. Combining this with different directions on the left stick will allow you to dodge in the corresponding direction. Releasing the left trigger allows you to resume normal movement, but holding on it will cause you to lie prone with your weapon drawn. While prone, you can move in the same directions that you can while standing. Flicking the left stick will cause you to either roll to the left or right, or make you scramble backwards. This is an invaluable skill to learn for dodging/animation cancelling and setting yourself up for retaliatory attacks.Sprinting while hitting the L-Trigger will cause you to slide on your back. This can be useful for getting through a bunch of enemies relatively safely, or to stun them for a melee attack. As with dodging, if you keep the L-Trigger held after sliding you'll go into a prone state. Quickly reversing your direction while keeping your weapon drawn will also allow you to flip yourself in the opposite direction while going prone. Next up is Quick-Shotting. Quick-Shotting is (as far as I know) a mechanic unique to Resident Evil 6 that allows you to fire a non-precision shot at your target. It is a crucial mechanic to master for quickly dispatching enemies with melee or for stunning them so that you can get into a better position. A Quick-Shot is performed by hitting L and R at the same time while using either the left or right analog stick to aim the direction of your shot. Keep in mind that the tracking radius for Quick-Shotting is rather small and it will target the nearest enemy in the direction you aimed. A Quick-Shot is always a guaranteed stun on most standard non-mutated enemies. Finally we have counters. Countering in this game is a mechanic that allows a player to evade an enemy attack and respond with one of their own. A counter can be performed on most non-boss enemies by hitting the R trigger (without your weapon drawn) at the appropriate time. Not only does this grant invulnerability frames, it also allows you to dish out a massive amount of damage within a short time (and is particularly useful for extending the Time Limit in Mercenaries mode.). Some enemies have counters unique to them (such as Bloodshots) that allow you to severely damage, if not outright kill them.So yeah, sounds complicated? And you're probably wondering how well all of what I've mentioned in the previous paragraphs functions together. Well, sometimes Quick-Shotting can hit the wrong target if you fire it into a group (Though this rarely happens if you're keeping track of where enemies are around you.). The contextual action to parkour while sprinting is also a bit too sensitive, but can be easily managed by learning what you can and cannot parkour over, and when you should sprint. As for the cover system. You'd think that going into cover when your weapon is drawn and you're close enough to something would be a horrible game mechanic, but the game is very, very strict about how close and which way you have to be positioned for this to even happen. The cover system does its job well enough despite lacking a bit of polish, as this isn't a cover shooter. Control of the camera in this game will also be sometimes taken from you to focus on a point of interest or objective during the campaigns (you are usually invulnerable while this occurs, though enemies still move around), but generally not in a way that feels disorienting as long as you're actually paying attention to the game. Though, since you're not invulnerable once the camera control is returned, it can somtimes lead to enemies getting a cheap hit in on you. It's a minor issue, but is something that happens from time to time. There are a fair amount of QTEs in the game, similar in number to RE4's, but if you were able to handle the QTEs that RE4 threw at you, then RE6's should pose even less of a problem to you. There are also about 5 brief driving segments in this game (they're not really anything special, but they're handled well enough for what they are). Most bad reviews of the game like to hyperbole the camera and QTES in the game to absurd degrees. Again, as long as you're paying attention, you should not be failing the QTEs in this game (and there is an option that was patched in to allow the game to perform them for you, for the most part). One last thing to note is that the progression of chapters is pretty much straight-forward and linear (though there hasn't been an RE game since Dead Aim that wasn't as such).Overall, the game has a lot to offer for those actually willing to learn and master its controls, despite some poor design choices.8.75 out of 10Video review can be found here:

Product received for free
Resident Evil 6 is a game I will never forget.Was it for the gameplay? The cinematics or the style? Or simply because it was a Resident Evil game?It was for all the reasons. Resident Evil 6, just like 4 and 5 have combined action elements with horror elements.I can understand if alot of old school fans might get a bit upset over just the fact that these 3 games have a whole lot of action. But since I grew up with Resident Evil 4 and 5, I'm used to this mixture.Resident Evil 6 is an amazingly in-depth game on every angle!And the game has 4 single/co-op campaigns that are each like a full game experience on their own. - Leon's campaign has a slow tension building feeling and it focuses alot on horror instead of action. It even brings some nostalgic Resident Evil 4 feeling as well. It's great for those who prefer horror more. - Chris's campaign plays heavy in action on every level and the drama is crazy. This campaign is packed with emotions, goosebumps and adrenaline.- Jake's campaign is very in-between and has a small bit of drama, a bit of horror (There was even a hide n seek level!) and not too much or too little action. Jake's campaign plays rather smoothly compared to the rest, I'd say.- Ada's campaign has a very old-school feeling with puzzles and mystery with not that much action. But it's well enough to bring a very calm and somewhat relaxing campaign.New combat system!Resident Evil 6 takes player controll to the new level in the series. You can roll, dodge, counter-attack, punch, kick, slide, tackle, wrestle all by your own now. In the past we've had quick time events on knocked down enemies and very limited movement. But now you're in full controll of your character!Cinematics are beautiful, insanely beautiful!The cutscenes you see in this game looks extremely polished. The emotions, the action, the drama, the graphics. It all feels spot on perfect. Honestly I would'nt even complain to pay 29,99€ only to see the cutscenes! It really immerse you into it, really well written. I will honestly say that watching all the cutscenes in this game beats any movie that I have ever seen (Hundreds) and I don't think anything I've ever seen can beat the thrilling experience that is the Resident Evil 6 cutscenes. Co-op with a twist!You can now jump into someone else playing a campaign and play as a zombie. I bet it's one big dream for many players. And the best part? It's so well done that you get all the abilities of the mini-bosses and normal zombies, including weapons and all alternative forms. It's really well made, I'm at a loss for words.What you take is what you have!There is no store for inventory items in this game (Skills store is a different thing). So this time you keep it all on yourself. You need to explore to get stuff, you can't take advantage by buying your way through. There is also a skill store where you can buy small buffs and infinite ammo. It's a very fair store I would say since you can only have 3 skills and you can't have infinite ammo for all the firearms.Mercenaries!Mercenaries is back and wow is it crazy. Tons of new enemies, cool maps and really fun to play especially with a friend. You even have a left 4 dead 2 colaboration and you can play a alternate mercenaries where you have even more enemies at once, including the enemies from left 4 dead 2 and the main characters: Nick, Ellis, Rochelle, Coach.Got it for free!I can't thank my brother enough for giving me this as a gift.He knew how much I played and loved Resident Evil 5 (PS3) so he gave me the ultimate gift.ConclusionThis game has such a in-depth experience that I will never forget. This game lies deepest within my heart and the cinematics just blows my mind. The game feels you, it knows you. I don't think I've ever played any game ever that nails the drama, action, horror and cinematic glory so perfectly as Resident Evil 6. The replayability is always there. You need alot of points to even get all the skills unlocked, you can look for unlockables, you can get further in mercenaries to unlock more characters and stages, you can pick one of the 5 difficulties to play around with, try out one of the many game modes.I would really recommend both with or without friends. If you ever decide to pick the game up then I highly recommend going through the campaigns alone so that you can immerse yourself into the atmosphere and then play with a friend afterwards because replaying the campaigns are just as fun!10/10 You can call it too high or too low, but I'm speaking from my own personal heart. We all have different perspectives and I'm glad that I've found my best perspective on this game.It has so much depth, so many gameplay hours, so many gamemodes, so much fun, so much character controll, beautiful cinematics, huge amount of character on the personalities of the main cast, bunch of new enemies, well thought-out levels, huge replayability. The Resident Evil 5 Chris was my favourite but the Resident Evil 6 Chris is SO WELL MADE!!!In my deepest opinion, this game is the lovliest thing that I have ever seen on this planet!!!I'm in love...

												Resident Evil 6 is considered a deception by the fans of the this game´s series, but the fact that the game is relatively cheap  (on promos) and can still bring a lot of fun (playing with someone else is even better) makes this game worth the award of ""A deception but still a good game""			"

												A solid, powerful and substantial game that I never get tired of playing again and again, even after the three and a half years that have passed since its original release. Maybe not the perfection that Resident Evil 4 was, but Resident Evil 6 is very close to that. We get to play as three of our long-known and favourite characters (Leon, Chris and Ada) plus a new addition to the saga, which is Jake, Wesker's son. As an alternative, you can also play the three main campaigns (Leon, Chris and Jake) with the characters' partners (Helena, Piers and Sherry), which is recommended as the experience is very different with them. Unlike the bad partner programming in Resident Evil 5, in this game the partners never cause you problems, they have their own inventory and they come to your rescue whenever you need them. But overall the gameplay is excellent anyway; each character has their own fighting style, others are quicker (Leon, Piers) others have better melee (Helena, Sherry) or are great at going stealthy (Ada). There are four main difficulty levels, ranging from piece-of-cake kind of easy (Amateur) to really tough stuff (Professional) plus an additional extra hard mode (No Hope) which is basically of the Professional level, but without any perks and skills. The story of the game is divided in four main sub-stories, and at some point theses stories intersect. As a result, there are a few stages that you have to go through more than once (ie, you have to fight the mutated Deborah with Leon and then with Ada, or the creepy Ogromen with Chris and then with Jake). This may get slightly boring after some time, and there's a possibility that these particular stages may feel like a chore. However this doesn't really take the fun away, if you think about it, because with each character you may have to apply slightly different strategies and this is very interesting and enjoyable. Atmosphere-wise, each campaign has a different feel: Leon's campaign is a strong reminiscent of the classic Resident Evil games, with all the zombies infesting the towns, the labs, the cemeteries and the cities and what not (there is even a police car to make your escape, and the - almost always present in zombie-themed stories - gas station in the first chapter), Chris's campaign on the other hand has a dominant feeling of war, mostly due to the overwhelming flashback, Jake's campaign is a refreshing change of pace with the two chartacters being constantly on the run and Ada's campaign is a lonely journey of our lady spy (well, unless you play co-op in which case you have a nameless and speechless soldier for partner) through most of the places that we have seen with the other characters. Back to the gameplay, which is particularly important in this game, everything works perfectly; however there are a couple of situations and quick-time events that may cause issues. I don't know if these are bugs or something random, but I found out that in these cases fiddling with the screen resolution and/or the FPS fixes the problem. Other than that, the game is almost flawless; each character has unique melee attacks and counter attacks and a special weapon or fighting skill, and there's decent variety in weaponry as well. There are also many moves, other attacks and finishing moves that you can perform, plus the amazing quick-shot, which can be executed in different styles and ways depending on the character you are playing with. However the game is not so generous with ammo, which makes it significantly more demanding in this light. There is interesting and in-depth character development, though it may not be easily appreciated on first look. The character design is gorgeous, the moves and expressions are incredibly realistic. Overall this game is great, definitely one of my favourites of the Resident Evil series.			"

My Personal Score: 2.5/5PCGW Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: none experienced during playthroughs.DLC: 4 new game modes. All 4 DLC are required for achievements list completion.No Hope Left[www.nohopeleft.com] was an ARG, made by Capcom to promote the then upcoming Resident Evil 6. It featured pictures of ""No Hope Left"" graffiti around the world, and videos of ""survivors"" saying their last goodbyes, after a supposed viral outbreak that hit the globe. NHL set the mood for what could be the most terrifying RE title to date. Too bad that the game failed to deliver on the expectations that Capcom set themselves, and ""No Hope Left"" became an inside joke in the RE community, pertaining to what what fans felt for the future of the series.RE6 is an action game, and that's all there is to know about it. Ever played a TPS in the last decade? Chances are, you're already familiar with the game mechanics in RE6, albeit QTE-laden and includes an unreliable camera. Sure, there are zombies, mutated freaks, and hulking beasts, but I see no difference from the cannon fodder that runs into my view, while playing other action games. What used to be creatures that terrified me, are now minor obstacles that litter the path between point A and point B. This isn't the Resident Evil that I knew of, and it's bad at being one.But of course, franchises change to better suit the modern trends, and what's hot in the market right now is the explosive Hollywood experience - something which RE6 emulated well. While it did throw off the tension and atmosphere out the window, RE6 kept the B-movie antics which became a defining trait for the rest of the series. Combine that with an over-the-top plot, and you've got yourself one hell of an explosive ride. Just don't wrap your hear around the fact that this is an RE game. It's better that way.And there you have it.			"

												The way how to ruin a good franchise: - Remove any decent story elements and add really dumb plotholes.- Ruin characters by avoiding the creation of any moments for empathy- Add extreme action, I mean, Dolph Lundgren would be jealous. Oh and make this action as unrealistic as possible, that you can only laugh (if your the humorous-type) or cry (if you can't believe what they have done to Resident Evil).- Start Cutscenes while Zombies attack you! Don't worry, they will keep on attacking while you have to watch the cutscene.- Add as much quicktime-events as possible, to make the cutscenes so much better...There is more what is totally wrong about this game. I can't enjoy it, and hell I'm a Resident Evil-Fan, watching the movies, playing the games, etc... but I really have to force myself through this... A friend of mine have a good laugh about all the non-sense happening, but there is no feel of horror, tension, or interest in story... Wow, the story, seriously... I hope you are as braindead as those zombies, otherwise you will not be able to endure all the terrible ""lucky incidents"", ""surviving-the-impossible-scenes"" and just jumping from one scene to the next, which leaves so many questions open about how the protagonists got their, that you might think, you skipped a whole level.Urghs, I wasted enough time writing this review for Resident Evil 6... If you are young and new to the franchise, lock yourself in a dark room, start Resident Evil 1 - 3 (no matter if HD, classic or whatsoever) and stop right there... (well, maybe consider Outbreak and the Lightgun shooters as well... and... Code Veronica)...			"

Body art is very good, the end of the body of different characters are very handsome power is also very large, and the physical strength of the body has limited too strong, very balanced design.Collecting information is also great, let me in the free time to understand the background story of the game!!

												Where do i start with this game. They took the suspense and replaced it with cheap jump scares mindless explosions and annoying quick time events, way too many. You always run out of ammo when things get hairy. Since this game has turned into an action game at least the game should have a decent amount of ammo around. You face the same bosses over and over again.  The ai is what you'd expect from a game with monsters they just run at you face first and they are bullet sponges. They try to make the game longer by having 4 different campaigns which see's every characters point of view leading to the conclusion. The only problem with that is you will run into the same environments over and over again and that makes the game tedious. This is the most ambitious resident evil to date cause it's the biggest one. Also what doesn't work is that they try to add in lot's of turret sequences and those suck. I will admit the scene where chris flies the jet and he has to shoot down the virus filled rockets was pretty fun. The 4 campaigns took me over 20 hours to beat. theres multiplayer but i never tried it. I doubt anyone is playing multiplayer. Overall I think capcom should have made the game 10 hours long and go back to the roots of what resident evil is all about. The only thing about this game that was good are the graphics and sound design everything else was disappointing. I had no problems running the game although the game did crash on me once. If you like resident evil go back and play the older ones cause their more fun. Overall i felt disappointed by this game by being another action game and capcom trying to cash in on the call of duty effect.			"

												Honestly, this game is not worth any money you pay for it.  I only purchased it as to play through it in co-op with a friend, and it really was a nightmare.  We ran into to numerous gamebreaking bugs in every campaign, in Leon's we would instantly recieve a game over after a late game cutscene, after fighting the snake boss in Chris's campaign we would get disconnected after walking through a door, and in Cherry's campaign certain doors wouldn't open depending on who was host.  The game also fell to major technical problems such as framrates dropping to single digits 3-6fps, for no reason, and this was after several patches to 'fix' prior issues.  Story is a mesh, it could have been told better in a much tighter 10-12 hour single campaign.  Characters are flat and 2 dimensional, secondary characters really have no place as they appear and then dissapear within the same level.  Overall there is just nothing to bring me back to game since completing the 3 main campaigns in co-op, no lasting appeal.			"

  PROS CONS   + Good longevity (~30h of singleplayer)+ Good graphics+ Good voice acting+ Well-crafted character and facial animations+ Multiple campaigns, each with a different pair of characters to play+ Campaigns can be played in co-op mode+ Excellent plot presentation, each campaign offers a different perspective on the story (and provides the missing pieces of the bigger picture)+ Location recycling actually done right (justified by the plot in a way that makes sense)+ Interesting enemy designs and transformation animations+ 144hz support, no forced 30/60 fps cap - Opening the menu does not pause the game (you need to press the ""pause"" key) - seriously, guys?- Asinine autosave system, where ""checkpoints"" and ""autosave points"" are two completely different things - this is extremely confusing at the beginning- Frustratingly broken controls- Cheap deaths caused by said controls- Very limited key re-binding capabilities (most of the complex action keys cannot be changed)- Some areas are way too dark (you can't see where you're going)- Some enemies are simply too bullet-sponge'y (it doesn't make sense in some cases) Notes:* Much more action-oriented than previous games, not everyone will like that			"

												Honestly, I hated this game when it was released for console... now, not so much.This game is potentially entertaining. However, they went with a qauntity over quality approach because of having three different story lines go off into one game. It was interesting and I kinda would like them to try it again one day. But with jamming so much into something so little really caused the game to feel not as constructed as a solid game. There are many annoying aspects to this game and most of them have to do with the mechanics. Once you try out escaping the helicopter at the docks via Chris playthrough, you'll know the pain. Spoiler, run mechanics are broken as heck. Another thing to add is that you can trip over dead bodies which is painfully annoying.The three style stories have a unique style of game play;Leon: More survival horror based, slow tankish enemies, generally took this part slowlyChris: Full of action, guns, bullets flying everywhereJack: Running simulatorOverall, great coop fun to shoot em' up and not over think the game as being some successor to resident evil.

												Resident Evil 6 is a bloated, sluggish behemoth of an action game weighed down by Capcom's inane desire for the series to be all things to all people. Part Resident Evil, Gears of War, Uncharted and Call of Duty, Resident Evil tries to be the jack of trades but succeeds only in being an example of why trying to appeal to everyone satisfies no-one. The aiming is awful, the player feedback is non-existent and it has some truly appalling quick-time-events. As a 30 hour game, I don't think there's another experience where the quantity is inversely proportional to its quality. You owe it to yourself not to play this game.			"

												Rating: 7.5/10Overview: Third Person ShooterThe Good:+ 4 campaigns each with 2 characters to select from (except for one campaign). Each campaign has a different feeling to it and depending on which character you select allows you to experience certain parts of the game from a different perspective giving you an incentive to replay the game. At certain points, the campaign stories arc will cross each other which is cool and gives you a different perspective. Each campaign is roughly 5-8 hours long. + Lots of graphical/gameplay/camera options+ Lots of different weapons. Certain characters have their own unique weapons+ Combat has been modernized. You can now move while aiming, roll, dodge. The most flexible combat in a main title Resident Evil.+ Mercenary mode makes a return and its probably the best yet given the new improvements to combat. Plenty of levels and characters to choose from. + Agent Hunt mode allows you to invade another players game as an enemy. The Average:+/- Game has some neat gameplay mechanics that are never explained properly or not at all. Checking a guide will help.+/- Cover system is poorly implemented and feels clunky compared to almost every other third person shooter on the market. +/-The story like every other resident evil game is stupid, crazy, over the top non-sense. It serves to hold all the campaign stories together and shoot monsters.  +/- The game really holds your hand the whole way through. Need to open a door, no problem, the game will pinpoint where the keys are, need to pull a lever, the camera will zoom in on the exact lever etc. The developers don’t seem to trust the players to figure things out on their own. +/- Killing enemies and breaking crates allows you to collect skill points which allows you to upgrade a variety of skills. You can equip 3 skills allowing you to choose the ones that fit your playstyle. A good system but feels like a downgrade compared to Resident Evil 4/5 where you can manually upgrade each gun’s damage, accuracy, reload speed etc. +/-The Bosses are big, ugly and feel epic to fight but they go on for far too long to the point where its no longer fun. The Bad:  -This game is littered with quick time events. You can’t play for more than 5 minutes without being bombarded with a quick time event. This game came out at a time when almost every developer decided to abandon qte’s because of how bad they were. Resident evil 6 doubles down on them. - There are certain sections of game that are terribly designed. Worst of all these sections seem to drag on for far too long. This game has a lot of content but not all content was created equal. Conclusion:Resident Evil 6 throws everything at you in the hopes that you will end up liking something it has to offer. This is a difficult game to review because for everything this game does right it has equal parts that are just as bad. After replaying all the resident evils multiple times, this game doesn’t hold up all that well despite the improvements to combat.  This is a game that is a jack of all trades and a master of none.

												I want it to be clear from the beginning – I am a Resident Evil fan. And I liked most of new Resident Evil games. Most, but not this one. While I completed totally unfriendly RE 4 PC without mouse support mods and enjoyed the hell out of RE5 by playing both single and local co-op with my brother, this game just fatigued me after a few hours. Its main problems is terrible controls allocation and a ton of useless commands spread throughout most of the keyboard. Don’t fool yourself – you’re not going to use even 30% of them, and if you try you get dead while you look for the correct kay. I honestly cannot imagine if the controls are easier with the gamepad, since some of commands required two keys, plus a correct direction key. Another issue is  that it’s bloated to four separate campaigns whose structure is at least inconsistent. So is storytelling. I was disappointed when after completing the first (Leon) campaign I got through most of weird Chris Redfield campaign, and discovered, that some sequenced I did from the same perspective, instead of opposite. The pinnacle of WTF was when at the end of first campaign i reached the part already shown in prologue, and it was completely retold in different way. That’s not how you are supposed to tell viewpoint related stories.What’s good about it? Probably graphics are okay, but they don’t impress me much after RE5, or rather introduction of X360 generation graphics. Really nothing else was better than in 5. The graphical low point for me was the new image of Ada Wong, who now looks as a china doll with much too wide cheeks, and too small mouth. Maybe it was an attempt to make the game more realistic, but I preferred the more manga-like version from RE4, and CGI movies. The worst part is that I was genuinely interested in the story, and gave up on it near the end of second campaign. My recommendation? RE Revelations is a much better game even though it was converted from Nintendo DS. So either try this one, or wait for the upcoming sequel.  "

												Great game to co-op with a freind. The story really sucks you in. It's very cutscene heavy but if you are ok with that kind of game you will enjoy it. Playing with a controller the movement and fighting mechanics seem really fluid, which is something  that i definatley could not say about re-4 and re-5.  Basically if you are looking for something good to play through with a good bud this should be on your list. As far as single player goes I don't really know if it would be as good.

												The epitome of bad game design.A mishmash of AAA game clichés slapped together with no polish or focus resulting in a glitchy, disorienting and soulless experience with mechanics that do not function more than half the time. That being bad enough on its own this is stretched out over a 20+ hour campaign with a story that is so convoluted and all over the place that it is hard to even find humor in its bad writing because you cannot even tell what you are witnessing most of the time.It is also somehow aesthetically inferior to its almost decade old predecessor.There is nothing redeeming about this game sans the few moments slogging through the hours of bad cover shooting and QTE's where you can just laugh about how terrible something is. Even then the amount you have to endure to get to these few moments is not worth it. "

												Straight to the point: Awfull game. Bad controls, bad camera and half of the game is full of button smashing QTE's.I've always enjoyed every RE game up to 5, and was really looking forward for this this one, even tho I had heard lots of negative comments and reviews of it. And I should have listened..I tried playing it, for like 15 minutes and had to quit, it was so bad. Later I gave it another shot, played few hours and again, had to quit. The game feels more like an annoying chore than a game. After few weeks I decided to really get into it and thought if I just look past all the negative stuff I might start enjoying it. So I played it almost through with all characters, and I'll propably never touch the game again. It's amongst the worst games I have ever played and nothing can fix it, not unless Capcom decides to fix the clunky controls and terrible camera.I would give this game a 3/10 rating, and thats only because I love the series so much.

												I am a big fan of co-op games.  I wish there were more games with as much focus on co-op as Resident Evil 6 has.Co-op is built into the story and gameplay in fun ways.  Lots of opportunity for you to work as a team, and even rescue eachother.I love the combat in this game.  I find the weapons, melee, and movement to all be very smooth and responsive.Mercenaries and especially Mercenaries No Mercy are a lot of fun co-op and solo.  No Mercy seems to spawn about twice as many zombies as normal, and in co-op it is a ton of fun annihilating big crowds of zombies.This is one of the most fun co-op games I have ever played.If you have a pal you really like to game with, and you are looking for a great game to play, this is a must buy.

												Well, this game is honestly a hot mess ... The bad thing about it is mainly in the story mode. At many times the game forces your camera to shift and makes it difficult for you to play it your way. Too many pointless button command options. Weird glitches in the entire game and too many pointless boss fights. Now on the good things about RE6:☑ Leon Kennedy☑ Ada Wong☑ Chris Redfield & Piers☑ Jake☑ PREDATOR MODE☑ ONSLAUGHT MODE☑ MERCENARIES & NO MERCY☑ Overall pretty good story☑ Ada's imaginary friend☑ & my husband, Leon Kennedy in case I forgot to mention that!

												I got this in a Humble Bundle and I have to say... it was one of my favorite games of all time.It reminded me of a mix of Resident Evil and Houst of the Dead... it had all the visual flair and style of a triple A title with all the fun and diverse gameplay of an arcade title.It wasnt as much of a horror-adventure as other Resident Evil games (it was more action) but it did everything right.Definitely recommended. I bought all the DLC, which I look forward to playing.			"

												This game is a steal for the current sale price of $8.39.  And yes I meant the $8:39 because the main game (great Co Op experience) and the extra game modes are fun and are worth getting.  So grab Resident Evil 6 Complete, grab a friend, play all 4 of the main campaigns, play the extra game modes (the more people that hop on the more people we have to play together, but even with a just a few of your friends the extra modes are fun), and thank me for it later ;) .This game never deserved the hate it got back when it came out nor does it deserve it now.  Is it maybe left a little unpolished here or there?;, yes, but what it lacks in polish in some areas it makes up for in sheer content and new fun concepts/gameplay.This game is like getting 4 games in one!  Seriously though it is.  And people that don't really really try the game enough, don't understand just how great the combat/movement is now.I know the changes in RE 6 take some getting used to and personally I think that's a big reason why people don't give it enough of a chance. The demo does a poor job of showing the game's potential.The controls are a little different now (coming from Re5) -not having the knife handy felt odd at first but for the trade off of being able to roll out of the way to either side, being able to slide, being able to quick fire, being able to duck, being able to jump to your back, roll foward, run+slide+quick turn around (can run from an enemy slide then turn around fast to fire on him while on the ground), etc. it was worth it.  NOTE: that Leon's story angle starts off not letting you use all controls right out of the gate, give it a second and they become available so don't play it for five seconds and go, ""these controls suck"", calm it down wait for them to kick in ;) .Also at first the Healing/Herb Use set up feels weird but once you understand how it works it's actually pretty cool and doesn't stop the action, which I believe is the point of the new inventory set up:1.) There's a button combo you can use to automatically combine your best herbs without even opening the inventory.2.) As you combine herbs the dots you see on the herb result are how many life blocks that get added to your case for instant use. Put one herb that has one dot in your case and it gives you the ability to instant heal one life block (via heal key), combine a red and a green herb and it gives you a 6 dot herb to add to your case and thus you can heal 6 heal blocks just from it; the more herbs you add to your case the higher your instant heal potential can be.Also I think People complain because starting with Re5 they think that the games moved away from what the series was, but infact the series was morphing into something that fit the storyline perfectly like it or not: -Umbrella was looking for a way to weaponize biological weapons to their fullest and what better way than to make creatures that can do even more but will listen to what they are told to do.  Thus as much as we didn't like it, half smart zombies that could efficently use guns, axes, etc. showed up as they fit Umbrella's agenda and thus the story line.  And with more crazy badies the action picked up and thus became an action co op horror instead of just lone wolf survivial horror.However that does not mean Re5 and 6 are bad games, quit the opposite really they are plain Action Co Op fun taking down horrible monstrosities.Back on track though More on RE6-What Resident Evil 6 is, is really a love letter to it's previous games, to it's fans, and an ode to one of the other greatest zombie killing Co Op games of all time, Left 4 Dead.Where Resident Evil 6 may lack some polish here or there it makes up for in the meatiness of the game; your basically getting 4 games for the price of one.You play through 4 different angles of the storyline (which at some points intersect, and thus your game could have 2 other real people playing with you and your buddy, if they are playing their game and are at the same story line point your team is at the same time) with each angle being Co Op and having different partners for that angle:Leon and Helna Campaign- an ode to oldschool RE Style (slow moving, not so smart, back to basic zombies) and an ode to one of the other great zombie games of all time L4D (Church, Ammo shop Areas, etc).Chris and Piers Campaign- Re5 style action back in play(run and gun), cranked UP and with a more military twist (Chris finds out it's hard to be a leader of a squad, and he's struggling getting over the emotions brought on from Re5).Sherry and Jake Campaign- an ode to Resident Evil Nemesis (Run!) with a touch of martial art super human fun (I'm lookin' at you Jake, good thing you got your Dad's blood or that injection might not of went so well huh?).Ada and Agent Campaign- ode to 2 of the greatest known yet unknown characters of the series (atleast till now; I'm lookin at you Ada...I mean you are wearing tight leather pants after all, erh I mean...your story is expalined more in this game, erh umm yeah that's it), Ada and Hunk, erh umm Ada and The Agent, which is clearly Hunk to me (note Agent is not totally fleshed out as Ada's mission was at first just set as a single player experience, as in he's not in the cutscenes with Ada and he kinda teleaports to where she goes when using her zip gun, but still totally worth it to have yet one more Co Op Campaign; he was thrown in extra for that exact reason last min. and he's still cool as hell---love his freaking punch in mercs mode).I won't spoil the storyline, but I will say this is a Resident Evil game so you gotta expect someone trying to destroy stuff and a little cheese, but all Re Games have that horror/slapstick aspect to break it up, but that's what makes it Resident Evil imo.Then there's the extra game modes!-Oh and I almost forgot once you beat the game with any of the three starting Campaigns, Leon and Helna, Chris and Piers, or Sherry and Jake (Ada and The Agent's Campaign is an extra Campaign that used to be an unlockable as well, but now is available from the start I think), you'll unlock Agent Hunt mode.  Agent Hunt mode allows you to control various monsters throughout another person's playthrough of their Campaign (at certain points) if they have it checked as an option when they start their game!   And you don't have to go it alone, there can be more than one human controlled monster via Agent Hunt mode so you may have another person join up as a monster as well and together you can cooridinate an attack.Just like Resident evil 5 this game has an extra mode The Mercenaries. In The Mercenaries mode, you have a set amount of time to try to stay alive and kill as many monsters as you can till the chopper arrives, shooting for a high Grade rating, however you can up your timer and your points per kill in various ways.  There's also The Mercenaries No mercy mode that's pretty much just like The Mercenaries mode, but a lot tougher and has the option to play as the characters from Left 4 Dead 2 and has some of the boss type character from L4D2.Not to mention the Predator extra game mode from the DLC (if you listen to me and get the Complete version for the $8.39 sale price right now), that's a lot of fun, where you can run around as the big baddie from Jake and Sherry's Campagin trying to catch the other players or vice versa depending on how it starts, but no worries everyone gets a turn ;) .-And as a sweet extra feature you can unlock extra costumes for these modes as well.There are a few other extra game modes as well both from base game and dlc's I believe, but those I mentioned were the most fun to play to me.Anyways it's getting late here now, but this game is TOTALLY worth the sale price, and especially if you play it Co Op.If you've been on the fence just grab it, enjoy it, and thank me later by up voting this review.Thanks,Sid.

In terms of an actual game, Resident Evil 6 is one of the most fun and satisfying adventures I've ever played, especially with co-op. If you're done crying about how bad the game is because you fire your gun more than in RE4, I'd highly recommend picking up this awesome game.			"

												Несмотря на все негативные отзывы по поводу сюжета,RE6-отличная игра для тех, кому просто хочется разнообразия. Согласитесь, постоянно играть в старые добрые резиденты, где каждый патрон и каждая полоска жизней на счету, немножко выматывает. Иногда нужно спустить пар и как следует помутузить бедных зомбарей, да еще и в компании других игроков, в том числе зомби.

												If you are looking for a true blue zombie killing resident evil game that's scary and meaningful, then don't waste your time with this game. If you have a good friend and want an action packed thrill ride, then this game is for you! The only reason I enjoyed this game was playing co op with a friend. Me and him had tons of fun and I'm glad we played together. Honestly, I think I'd have enjoyed RE 5 more if I had played CO OP. It is far from a good game, its kinda garbage. Still, it's a great co op game and I had a lot of fun. If you are looking for a great co op game, then get this game. If not, then I wouldn't reccomend it.			"

												Very different from the other Resident Evil games, since you're provided with extreme mobility, like jumping in any direction, lay on the floor AND shoot, raise from the floor and turn backwards, dodging, you name it. There're 4 campaigns, where the 4th one feel like crap in coop.You gotta create herbs into pills that you can store, which is a nice little thing.Every campaign has it's own playstyle (so to speak), such as - Leon is the spoopy one, Chris is action and the last one is where you have to run away from this huge dude, which is fun c:Co-op is perfect, movement perfect, communication is perfect except for that you have to use Steam chat, which is fine since they sit down with their phones every time you chat to each other. Graphics are a plus as wellWhat I DON'T like about the game, is that you don't trade or decide who gets the items, you both get it. For example, if there's a new shotgun laying there, you take it, and your partner still sees it, so he can take it as well. Also collectables, you shoot the emblem and the other still sees it being there.I don't mind the inventory system at all, but honestly I prefer the one in 5 still.Overall, I'm in love with this game			"

All the characters are there, the idea is still there, but I feel they tried too hard in order to make this game. I am completely let down by this game.  I should have listened to others who have said that it wasnt good, but it was on the Halloween sale for pretty cheap so I decided to try it anyways. I wish I wouldnt have wasted my money for it. I love all the other RE games but this just left me wanting to play a different RE game. Im not really sure how to explain this game, but just know from a die hard RE fan that this was lacking and I was extremely disappointed in this.			"

												I really wanted to love this game after having so much fun with RE5 with my fiance, but this is just.. so much worse. I know RE5 may not have been the best game in the series, but it was memorable because we got to play it together.The story is really predictable and terrible. You'll notice the trend right off the bat once you start meeting people in the game. It's also really easy. At least there's less quick time failing to deal with. (I am HORRIBLE at quicktime because all I really want to do is shoot things in the face.) Oh, and skill really doesn't matter much.. Just keep shooting things and you're good. There's no real point to the zombies in the game anymore because really, it's like any other monster-fighting game now. Absolutely no fear at all.So.. if you choose to buy it, go in with a sense of humour and giggle over the fabulous scarves that certain characters display proudly. Insinuating homoerotic subtext is probably my favourite part. You're not going to find any joy in the storyline. Might as well make up your own.			"

												A prime example of a very badly designed game. Clunky controls and poor combat design throughout the whole game, made even worse by the pathetic action camera that screws up movement during key phases - especially during boss fights. This leads to having to endure and undergo the whole painful process again and again which gets stale and annoying. The only saving grace is that it has a half-decent storyline, yet it is such a pain to play through. Not worth the money and definitely not worth the time trying to play it. The extent to which it lets down the Resident Evil franchise is disgraceful.			"

In Adas campaign there again a few puzzles to solve to the beginnings remind a little of the series .I like also that you also always have the option to use melee attacks and abilities to level with skill points.A very good game in my eyes makes it in single player mode as well as in the cooperation a lot of fun.All campaigns have a long playing time.Thanks for reading and Sorry for my bad grammar			"

												I don´t know the first Resident Evil Parts only Resident Evil 4 and 5. This part has some bugs. For example if you shoot an enemy   while he is jumping on you, the bullet goes sometimes through his head without damages (it happens seldom). If you play the game solo, then the real horror begins. Your computer character helps you only when it´s too late and you are dying - your partner don´t attack the enemys. The ressources which you can find are slightly. The story is good but what is a story without fair playing in the game? So the game is only for Resident Evil fans. If you don´t know Resident Evil then don´t play this game ... it has no love and good ideas !Update: I´m playing ""Resident Evil HD Remaster"" and understand why the Resident Evil fan community is angry about the newer parts of the Resident Evil series. Resident Evil 6 isn´t a horror survival game - it´s a shooter with zombies instead of human enemies !!!			"

												""Good:"" lenghty campaigns with lots or running, gunning and melee actionBad:- run of the mill plot- lousy camera and controls, had to quit two campaigns (Leon and Chris) due to (1) controls not responding fast enough (snow scooter escape), and (2) camera not showing playable character and its actions as a response to key presses (silo escape from big monster). In both cases a time-sensitive sequence was in progress, failure to react lead to player character death. Extremely frustrating and now way to circumvent (difficulty level (""amateur"" or ""normal"") has no effect).- enemies have no health indicator- guns feel underpowered- guns cannot be mapped to hot keys, have to use mouse scroll wheelIf you get the game cheap give it a shot, else don't bother.

												As a long time ""fan"" of the resident evil series, I went in really wanting to like this game, but it would seem the game on the other hand just did not want to reciprocate those feelings. With what feels like a cutscene every few feet, and a quick time event to accompany, the game rarely let's you even play. It can be an ok cinematic movie for fans the first time through, but on repeated playthroughs you start to notice just how little of the game you're actually playing. Top this off with controls that somehow manage to be both quick and sluggish in awkward ways, and you have the recipe for a complete mess. If you're looking for a Resident Evil game to play on PC with a friend, pick up Revelations for a far more enjoyable experience.			"

												The story/dialogue is completely nonsensical, probably more so than its ever been which says alot and the action is unrelentless. I've only finished one of the four campaigns so far and i'm completely exausted. Strategy isn't necessary for this one because you'll have plenty of ammo and herbs and the bosses are defeated with ease. I really miss how in RE4 and RE5 you sort of develop a system for taking out enemies but in this one I've had a hard time figuring one out.Overall the game is fun but it's definitely the weakest compared to RE4 and RE5. There's a grand scale to it which is cool and there are a couple clever moments but there are a lot of minor changes to the core gameplay that erk me.There's alot of game to be played here (main story is 20+ hours) so I'd say it was worth the $10 but I wouldn't spend much more than that.

												THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING BAD.   Ok I love the RE series have since I was a young kid. This game trys to be to many things and doesn't stick to its roots.  First off you got Leon's campaign.  This was actually a decent expereince for the first few parts and also cause there using zombies you know that enemy that made RE.  Yet it fails horribly with a boss fight that takes to long for its own good.  Other then that though if they would have just fleshed this one out and said screw it to the other campaigns I think we would have had a good time here. Leon's partner actually isn't annoying and has valid♥♥♥♥♥♥to say.                Chris's campaign is probably the worse one of the bunch which is a shame.  It goes all out for the action but there are way to many repetitive cutscenes that force you to watch as enemies come out of the wood works, couldn't I have just watched this happen in real time so I can shoot back and not be surrounded because the game forces you to watch as they come out.  I walk into a room a cut scene happens in real time im getting killed but I have to watch the cutscene cause it was so F-in important.   If you do get this game skip that campaign.Jake's campaign is what I like to call boy meets girl.  This campaign is mostly about how Jake the big badass mercenary finally hits puberty and falls for girl. It suffers the same♥♥♥♥♥♥with Chris's campaign to many cutscenes that take away from the experience.  I will say I did enjoy the boss fight when you go one on one with a big badass other then that you go through the same♥♥♥♥♥♥you went through in Chris's campaign because there campaigns are intertwined which makes replayability low.Ada's campaign is so-so.  At least it shows you alot of what was going on in the side but other then that it was pretty bland like this whole game was.Bottom ♥♥♥♥ing line if you love the RE series this will be a kick in your balls or vag because it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. The story was too convoluted and really it just makes for another stupid sequel unless Capcom pulls their head out of their♥♥♥♥♥  Capcom really ♥♥♥♥ed it on this one guys.			"

												Amazing game. loved it. The graphics are damn amazing and storyline just throws you into the situation of the main protagonist (whichever character you are playing). 7 players (3 females and 4 males) are very good each of them has their own skill and style to fight. Even if you have finished the game with all the players you can play multiplayer with your friends. Even if you have bad connection just switch the receivers voice and microphone off. The game also has many DLC to play like siege mode, Mercenary (this comes along the), Mercenary - No Mercy ( this too comes along ), Predator mode, etc. Predator mode allows you to play as ''Ustanak"" which is 8th playable character, it has its own storyline which is AWESOME too!Also, you can play as Zombie. Be a zombie and eat all the players who are acting to be a mercenary x) and show them who is the real mercenary xD. Controlling zombie is also easy and lets you be a pro at controls :D.Thank you for reading, and my rating for this game is 100/100			"

												This game is only fun when playing with a friend, so find one. My favorite campaigns 1-41-Jake SherryGood story, many action and Jake has the best lines in the game. Their character development is good. *Edit--> Worst part of this campaign is finding the keys in the snowy mountains. Good luck with that and what comes after it =D2- Chris PiersNon-stop action, Chris is a mad man, too bad he doesn't get to kill boulders this game. But I think those rock looking things you fight is close enough. 3- Leon HelenaStarted off real slow and wasn't as amazing until the final boss. Best part about this is that the theme is RE4 like for Leon. Rainy, castle-ish, etc. 4- Ada WongIt was fun to see Ada help the 3 groups throughout the stage, but some of the things I had to do was annoying and how I had to do it. I couldn't get away from the damn bug guy, or the chainsaw guy was mad annoying as hell on top of the bus. Overall, you must play this game with someone who likes it or you'll uninstall it right away. That was the only way I was able to actually play the game, is because I played with someone who liked it and guided me through the way. The campaigns are nearly not as memorable as the past RE's. Final Score: Resident Evil (6)/10 [Campaign wise]			"

												LONG REVIEW - BE PATIENT. The best advice I can give if you are going to play RE6, is start with the Leon missions. Do missions in the order they appear; Leon, Chris, etc. I thought you chose one character and played the whole game with that person and skill set. I chose Ada, the last character, and it was incredibly difficult with hardly any ammo. Sheer desperation made me mention how hard it was in a forum, and I was told start with Leon. The game is cram packed full of cut-scenes, either long or short. The short ones are on average about every two minutes. It constantly pulls control away from the player. It might just be that  the ground rocks, but then you lose control, the camera sways, and the character wobbles. Then you have to press your control keys again to get going. There are parts of the game where it happens less, then there parts when it's non-stop. There are even times when it takes camera angle control from you and expects you to carry on. Over-all though it is a constant wrangle to maintain control. When you get to a ledge, you can't just jump up it. You have to wait for it to say 'space', then you can press space and jump up. Nearly everything is controlled in this way throughout. Endless, endless pressing keys. That brings you onto the quick-time-events. Non-stop button mashing that has nothing to do with normal control. It's Ok to an extent, but even the most patient person gets annoyed. You think, ""what is this for"". Then onto how difficult it can be. There is one part I recall. 3rd Chris chapter, you have to run across a load of boats and moorings. You have to make it within time, or wherever you are you die. Checkpoints make you repeat it until you get it right. I can not tell you how bad that whole event was. I was screaming. (Not the only time I was screaming in this game either.) 5/10 is generous, but I don't quite think it's a 4/10. It's strong points are that sometimes the combat is great. The sets can be OK, but mostly they are dimly lit. The cathedral chapter in the Leon campaign is epic. If only they had made the whole game like that. The bosses are just unbelievably annoying. The Leon boss kept coming back at various latter stages of the Leon missions. I became sick of the sight of it, and sick of shooting it. Completely stupid method to kill it. I had to search online to find out how. What they have done is build up the difficulty over each character's campaign. Only it doesn't work. It feels like catastrophic insulting garbage from the developers, and you want blood as compensation. They try to make it a huge experience. However all it does is fall flat on it's face by kicking you in the teeth non-stop. Falling over is something that happens a lot with your character. Endless boom, flat on your back. It's noisy a lot. In fact they should have called the game - 'Boom, flat on your back'. I honestly don't know if I can finish it. I have given it a good go. I sold RE5 (CD-copy) unfinished as well.

One of the most satisfying gaming experiences I have ever enjoyed.My gaming fellows have expressed concern as to the graphic quality of the game, though the overall effect was what won the day. it's not so bad, it's really playableI maximised every setting possible.I found the protagonists surprisingly mature, nice to be with, & listen to, their wit and comment through-out. All through this refreshing experience looking forward to playing my other BIOHAZARD GAMES. (whenever possible of course:)The settings in the chapters were imaginatively created and varied, the game had my attention from start to finish. I never got bored! ! :)The duration of the game is extensive, it is not open world, it has a set story for you to follow. If you enjoy the story like myself you won't feel restricted by it I found it entertaining.The connection between the different episodes is interesting, I do try to keep up. I advise you to look that up as you may be surprised what is a sequel or prequel to what  LOOK UP THE CHRONOLOGY HERE[www.residentevil.net] The development of the main menu and the HUD's is interesting to note, in this game specifically between the campaigns-the HUD's differ.Each game released I have found interesting & engaging.I just finished watching the movie RESIDENT EVIL The Final Chapter, the journey ends[www.google.co.zw]. It so made me want to RE-PLAY this very RE6, the MERC's the settings, the monsters like from this game & RE5. Right there in the theatre wanted to play it. A lot of criticism at this game for diverting from RE formula, but there are times we enjoy what we played here immensely.Game On			"

												EDIT: I know I have upset  alot of people with my last review so Iet me clear a few things up.Anyone who is looking for a real survival horror experience look else where cause this game isn't what resident evil was when the first 3 games came out,  playing chris redfield's mission is by far the worst out of all the characters, it was like I was playing gears of war. You will have more enjoyment playing resident evil's the older titles than playing this game which franchise has changed drastically from survival horror to a mere action game.			"

												I tried....I tried so hard to like this game but I just can't. There is just nothing resident evil about it, be it the controls, the atmosphere or every feckin time you have to hit E or V or R to conduct some way over the top move. It's just too much and played more like something you would see in a Hollywood action movie. If that's your thing, go for it, but I was born and raised on Resident Evil 1 on the Playstation 1, and I have kept with the games ever since despite the clear decline in standard. Some people will love this game. I hated it.			"

												+ Somewhat novel, functional, and aesthetically pleasing UI that changes with each campaign+ QTE is actually quite fun (I used mouse/keyboard setup)+ Very easy and fun to mod+ Very, very short load times+ EXP is represented as tangible items that must be acquired manually; this adds to the feeling of risk and reward when levelling up+ The four different campaigns all follow somewhat divergent paths, and intertwine at various intervals; interesting way to tell a story, and the other playable characters feel like cameos+ Skill system is simple to grasp; upgrade with EXP, spend additional EXP to take skills to next level for added bonuses, rinse and repeat+ Co-op gameplay is one of this game's greatest strengths, and can be immensely entertaining- Poor lighting effects- Absurd, campy, borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogue; virtually every spoken line in the game is horrible- While the way it is told is a refreshing turn from the norm, the plot itself has no merit whatsoever; it is poorly introduced, terribly-written throughout the entire length of the game, and very little is explained or follows any kind of cohesive narrative (I have no idea what this franchise is about, anymore)- No weapon customization (something I remember enjoying in RE4)- Absolutely horrendous environmental textures; 90% of the work went into textures for (playable) character models, presumably to dress up the cut-scenes- Boss fights are terrible; all of the bosses are poorly-designed bullet-sponges with no redeeming moments, no novel mechanics, an no replay value (they also take an inordinately long time to beat, being constantly dragged out with cut-scenes)- The creature designs are seemingly the product of one guy doodling on a napkin while the oxygen is slowly being sucked out of the room- Pausing the game does not actually pause the game; your character crouches and you are vulnerable the entire time (I suffered a number of deaths while trying to refresh my drink)- NPCs are lifeless, cookie-cutter shells with no personality- Unimaginative, dull and often unintuitive 'puzzles'- The guy drawing on the napkin also wrote the endings; they are awful- While the QTE is marginally entertaining in this installment, any enjoyment is eclipsed by the inordinate reliance this game has on QTE in general; the game really shoves it down your throat- The little things: This game has no charm, no fear element (except poor attempts at cheap jump scares), and no attention to detail; more than I enjoyed the game, I would notice little things that make no sense - the game feels like a cheap imitation of a bad RE fanfiction that nobody liked... with explosions- The game plays like a rail-shooter; it has more in common with the House of the Dead arcade machines than the earlier installments of this franchiseLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												The single player is worth about $19-25, it's playing with friends that really makes this worthwhile: Resident Evil 6 is a great Co-Op game. It's got an entertaining story that intersects through the 4 campaigns. The wide range of  difficulty levels allows even the weakest of Co-Op partners to still enjoy the game. You can do split-screen on lan and control the game with one keyboard/mouse and one Xbox controller, or two Xbox controllers.Multiple copies of the game can also play Co-Op over the internet, and you can invite people off your steam list to join you provided they own the game. If you are playing an online game, you may find certain sections where 2 online co-op partners may also join your game for a 4 player story-based event or boss battle.Regardless as to whether you are playing Split Screen or Internet, you have an option for your game called Agent Hunt that will make the game harder if you decide to turn it on, explained below.There is one and only one REAL downside to this game that I have experienced, QTEs or QuickTimeEvents; the release for this game was blasted in reviews for it's QTEs where you'd have to mash buttons during cutscenes. If QTEs are not too your liking you can enable ""Auto Action Button"" in the menu as of a recent update, yup, they fixed it!For players whom want to be competitive, there are two mutliplayer modes in addition to Co-Op. The most well known is Mercenaries where you can fight in Deathmatch against one another...However where the fun really came in for me was in the AGENT HUNT mode, where you join another player's campaign as a zombie, and you and your fellow zombie players are tasked with hunting down and killing the human player(s). You naturally move a LOT slower than them, but you can make up for that with quick-travel vents and other holes that human players can't move through. How you win? MAKE THE HUMAN PLAYERS DIE OR FAIL!If you choose to register at residentevil . netit will keep track of all your player records, and you will earn EXP toward ""Agent Levels"" that can be used to unlock costumes and other bonus content. The website will also host ""events"" every week that players can participate in. The winner of an event will have that win permanently placed on their profile.As with many, many other games the true value in it is using it as a social tool, co-op, death match, or agent hunt all make the game great.

And don't ♥♥♥♥ing get me started on the quick time events, you'll be going from leaning back to watch a cutscene to nearly falling of your chair from being caught off guard by a QTE (Because leaning back to relax and watch a cutscene is for ♥♥♥♥ing casuals apparently) play this game now, you'll have peasant tier reactions if you don't. 10/10 would smash WASD and SPACE again.

												HANDS-DOWN, ONE OF THE MOST ABOMINABLE OPENINGS TO A VIDEO GAME...EVER.      I mean, I do appreciate that some Resident Evil fans actually prefer a zombie-kickboxing simulator to a more atmospheric gaming experience, but seriously, does ANYONE out there actually like all this mechanics-breaking, quick-time-in-lieu-of-a-cutscene ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?!  Okay, so maybe The Walking Dead games get away with some degree of it...but if the Resident Evil games are now aspiring to the level of immersion and emotional depth that THOSE games achieve, they may want to start paying some attention to concepts like themes, storytelling, and characterisation, don'tcha think?   The opening sequence of this game is sooooo painful, they even give you an Achievement for getting through it, appropriately entitled ""The Longest Night"".  They even have the gall to call it a ""tutorial"", when it teaches you precious little other than how to die repeatedly because you don't understand the poorly-explained on-screen instructions of how to RUN...in a SINGLE DIRECTION...and then force you to watch the same ten-second snatch of cutscene OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN to atone for your aforementioned sins.  Next time, Capcom, just hawk up a great big loogie and spit it straight in my face, eh?    Things then start to look a TINY bit more hopeful, as Leon and some chick we've never seen before make their slow, moody way through a super-darkened government building, which is seemingly full of spooky noises but no actual undead. It isn't long, however, before we're spin-kicking and pile-driving zombies, and trying to work out just how the hell you even switch from guns to grenades or use health items (all adventures in their own rights, believe me)!  On the whole, there's really nothing terribly intuitive here...not the controls, not trying to estimate how close you can get to a zombie with your flyin' feet before they can get at YOU...the early part of the game is a constant struggle, or at least it was for me, and I played this straight off the back of Resident Evils 4 and 5, and all the DLCS and ""bonus episodes"" attached to those (undeniably superior) games.     Overall, there's really not much respect given to long-term fans: this may as well be a big-budget rival company's rip-off of the RE franchise for all the continuity it serves up, both tonally and mechanically.  It's far from the worst game ever made...but it's definitely one of the weakest Resident Evil games, period.  (And I've even played obscure, long-forgotten♥♥♥♥♥♥like Dead Aim, the Outbreak series, and the Survivor series, for what it's worth.)     For much of its length, this is barely even a horror game.  It's an action game with unfeasibly dark lighting and horror undertones.  Hell, as zombie-action games go, it's a long way from bad - even slightly ""thrilling"" upon occasion - but it's hardly honest-to-God HORROR, at least seventy-five per cent of the time.  And for all its attempted surliness, its ""grit"" never surpasses that of a Michael Bay movie (nice stubble, Leon, but you still have pretty-boy hair); and when all is said and done, it's still every bit as corny as a field in Summer (""Mr President, please don't make me do this!"" blubbers Leon, unwilling to shoot the prez, even though he's clearly turned into a FREAKING ZOMBIE)!    A message to the developers of Resident Evil 7: stop catering to the undiscerning fans of those awful Milla Jovavich movies, and stop pandering to whatever is de rigueur in video games right at this very micro-second in time.  Multiplayer and/or A.I. partners DO NOT MAKE GAMES SCARY.  Quick-time events DO NOT MAKE GAMES SCARY.  Endless kickboxing moves DO NOT MAKE GAMES SCARY.  And making parts of your games so visually dark that you can't even tell what the hell just wounded you, IS JUST FRUSTRATING, NOT SCARY.     Pretty pretty please, let's do a little better next time, eh? This series is still pretty good...but it used to be GREAT.  The Revelations games seem to be heading in the right direction...how about lifting the game of the MAIN series, whad'ya say? Verdict: 7.5/10.   (Oh, and PS to the devs: there's this thing they invented a while back, called ""save points"", and you shouldn't feel obliged to limit yourselves to only one every half-hour or so of gameplay.  Just sayin'...)			"

So the short and skinny of Resident Evil 6There are 4 campaigns to play through that intertwine with each other that can lead to a lot of similar fights and locations being revisited. This can makes the game campaigns feel slightly lazy in comparison to previous games. However, other than the final campaign mission that was offered as dlc, each campaign is approximately 4 hours long. You couple the repetitiveness of the main campaign with some very Bollywood action sequences and it really is a toss-up whether or not you will enjoy it. Personally, I had no problem with it because if you can accept monsters, mutants, and zombies then you might as well suspend disbelief on the rest as well. Where the game really REALLY shines is the mobility of play style and improved combat system. There is sliding, rolling, jumping onto your back, running (like really running, not just the light jog from previous games), countering attacks, and a bit more.  Oh and it has LOCAL COOP, the fact is, if you have one friend, just one friend that will visit you to play games Resident Evil 6 is fantastic. Sure, the way the split screen works is a bit funky and very poorly implemented but I personally have zero problems with it. Therefore, if you have a single friend to play games with and an extra controller I promise you your game play will generally be a lot of fun. However, if you play Resident Evil 6 alone, the game will be a bit of a slog at times.Despite some obvious negatives you do get your money's worth when purchasing this game.			"

												This is by far the biggest and the most ambitious RE game to date. Unfortunately it is also, in my honest opinion, the worst one of them all.Things I didn't like:There are a lot and I do mean a LOT of QTE's(quick time events) in this game! QTE's are not a bad thing when done properly. But, when you need a QTE for pretty much everything from opening doors, leap over and across obstacles, fending off zombies, fighting bosses, dodging attacks, etc'... Then it becomes a chore and most of the time just frustrating. Some QTE's will get you killed when thrown at you and you were expected to react in a superhuman speed! It felt like the designers just wanted you to fail and die in some parts of the game... speaking of.. look out an ambulance........BAM YOU'RE DEAD! Bullet sponge enemies will make you beg for ammo and when you actually find some crates you will be disappointed to discover skill points instead of ammo which you desperately needed. Some parts of the game are just 3rd person shooter which is OK, but when it's done with scarce ammunition system from a horror game than it is just a BAD game design!A lot of the time I felt like the game just doesn't want me there. Constantly striping me of control over my cherector, taking away control over the camera, making me trip over dead bodys(which I found to be the most stupid thing I have ever seen in a game!), knocking me down when bullets hit me(You will spend a lot of time on your back when playing Leon's compaign).What is it with RE games and the lack of boss health bar?? For once I would have loved to know how am I doing! Am I supposed to be shooting that big♥♥♥♥♥monster or run away? The game does terrible job at telling you when it's time to fight and when it's time to run or what you're supposed to do in that matter.The cover system is horrible and most of the time just useless because the game spawns monsters behind you as well as in front of you.Weapons upgrade system is gone and replaced with a useless and not very rewarding skill system in which you can only equipped 3 at a time. You will need to grind a lot to upgrade everything.Boss fights are terrible, you will be forced to beat the same boss again and again and again and well.. you get the point.I can't say much about the story because I was playing with a buddy and I wasn't following it that much. But what I do want to say is that fighting the same boss  twice with diffrent characters just because you came across these two other characters you played in a previous campaign is just dumm game design!Things I like:- Clever enemy design. I liked the fact that some enemies evolve after you shot them but at the same time it was very annoying because you are very limited with your ammo and you just want them to freaking die already, again that is just poor game design!Gameplay: 2/10Graphics: 6/10Sound design and music: 4/10Story: 2/10Final verdict: 3.5/10Edit: The co-op in Ada wong's compaign is just terrible!!! Your partner has absolutely no intersection with the world what so ever!!! You just stand there and watch your friend play the game! Resident Evil R.I.P!			"

												One thing, Combat fluidity.   RE games are supposed to make you feel restricted in movement. It is what makes them hard. CAPCOM did a nice job finding the balance of old RE4 and the new combat mechanics for RE6.   Player satisfaction is high when achieving that awesome melee attack after stunning your enemy or counterattacking(bloodshots am I right??? :)  I hope they continue to improve on responsiveness when executing certain actions. RE6 is not really big on the horror. There are points when you may feel some urgency to get things perfectly executed but no beads of sweat should be dripping.  Not too many jumpscares.  Jumpscares are really only good the first time around then you can anticipate them,   If you want some RE style jumpscares I recommend RE4(for similar mechanics) , or RE2. One thing I didnt like was the QTEs.   CAPCOM decided to go nuts on Leon's campaign with it,  Im glad the other campaigns had very little.   Sometimes you just want to sit back and enjoy some story but not be immersed into a sudden button press that you will miss and die from. 2013 graphics compared to 2015 graphics....  They are okay, but what if they waited to release it for the XBOX 1 and PS4?  It would have been beautiful.   Witcher 3 has set the bar high for my tastes.			"

												This game is fantastic, provided you know a few things before you play:Learn the controls before you play! Seriously, this game has an excellent, deep combat system, which it makes no effort to explain to you. You'll have ten times the fun if you look up all the stuff you can do and have a bit of a practice before you play.Play co-op if you can! It's no secret that the campaigns in this game aren't fantastic. You'll have much more fun in co-op.Play Mercenaries mode! This is, in my opinion, the real reason to buy this game. The combat's brilliant, and it shines brightly in Mercenaries. I've finished the game, but I come back time and again to play more Mercenaries.So, having said all that, if you want to try the best TPS mechanics I've ever seen, go right ahead and get this game. You (probably) won't regret it.			"

												  This is probably one of the best examples of ""mixed bags"" that I can think of. Resident Evil 6 is both great and horrible in so many ways I won't be able to go over them all but for that reason alone I feel it's a game for anyone who considers themselves a ""gamer"" should play at least once to see what I mean.   RE6 is an action title with the occasional horror aesthetic thrown in to tie itself in whith its lineage. While best played with a friend it's very much playable solo. Players will take control one of 3 pairs of characters (or possibly an additional duo or a single character for the fourth campaign) as they experience the story of the game from three different perspectives and this is where the idea of the mixed bag begins. Instead of a single cohearent script, its divided amoungst three different stories that constantly leaves the player confused and in a stupor. Even with all the campaigns completed I had to read some of the in-game lore from the easily missed extras menu once I shot enough blue emblems in the game. While the Resident Evil series isn't known for its story, previous entries were at least easy to understand, not the case with this title, often throwing characters at the player that even veterans have no idea as to who they are.  Controling the characters is another issue for this game. In many games designed with a controller in mind, often times a button is used as a modifier for every other button. In previous games, what would be holding down the left trigger would then make the character aim at which point the right will fire. While that is a simple method, RE6 has layers of these that are poorly explained if at all. New players should take their time figuring out the controls as even into my second campaign I was still learning what certain combinations of buttons and motions did. However once learned, the complex control scheme actually makes for excellent stylish feats but not everyone will get used to them.  Probably one of the best things about the title is how it can incorporate multiplayer into the campaign. With certain options selected, a player can allow others online to join the game as a co op partner, random players to take control of basic enemies for a little extra challange, and even run into other players who are in other campaigns in overlapping story sections where up to four players can take on a segment of their campaigns together. The only problem with this is that due to the small playerbase many of these things wont happen without coordination with other players such as through Steam groups.  While there is definitly more to say I feel that these are some of the biggest issues. I do enjoy the game despite all its faults, however I will say that it may be my least favorite of the RE series that I have experienced. Many others damn this game as complete garbage, and while not all of their complaints are invalid or wrong, it does have entertainment value and some excellent points. If you are looking for a coop third-person action title, there are not many on the market but you should not settle for this unless you are already played through better titles. Give it a look but be aware it is flawed.			"

												I would like to recomend this gamebut sadly I cannotThe graphics may be pretty, but the game doesn't seem to easily let you switch the domenant hand, this stressed me out as I find it uncomfortable to look over the characters left shoulder rather than the right, and while we talk about camera views, the character takes up about half of the screen.The game is limiting, I quit this game within 30 mins of playing due to its restrictions, I want to get to understand the story, I like the cutscenes but walking down a halway shouldn't trigger an event which stops you from controlling your character every 20 seconds, the main word I must use for this game is stressfull.I found myself almost smashing the keys on my keyboard becuase I couldn't do anything while the characters describe the enviroment, the game is pretty and it could possible get better but after the tutorial the game becaomes an awefull experience which stressed me out to the point of quiting the gameI would recommend if you do play this, birng along a friend and get a mini window of tetris up becuase you will have control taken away from you to many times to comprehend so that the characters can discuss pointless stuff that adds nothing to the story.+Tutoral was full of good game design+Good PC port with nice extra content-To restricting-Story self contradictions-Stressfull to play!

												This game is like the great movie the producers. Capcom despirately wanted to lose money on this game, so they can finally write off the franchise. So they got there top designers team ready, and man, they did succeed. The whole game has that great lackluster-epic feeling, that is so hard to get exactly right: They really did some nice innovations: During most boss fights you can just go smash some random boxes and search for some extra 9-mm bullets. When you smashed all boxes in the area you can check if the boss fight is still going on. Sometimes you are lucky and a cutscene start where the boss fight is moved to a new area. Otherwise it is best to start to shoot some bullets.The art design is also very special. Nobody else can make a grey house, an grey outdoor level in a grey American village, grey corridors, a grey catherdral, grey walls, a grey dungeon, grey rooms ,and a grey US city all look so much allike. It all has that same special RE6 feel. It is very consistant, and it is probably a shoutout to Wistler's mom. From Star Trek they have borrowed the red-shirt principle. If in a cutscene a person wearing a helmet is talking to you you know he will die soon. So please never wear a helmet.They also included many game mechanics that people really like to write about on the internets. So it got the briljant keymashing, instant-kill QTE. The game is very dark (illuminance not atmosphere) so you can save on your electric bill. It also has an erretic difficulty curve, so you are always on your toes. And as a spoiler, here are my final 15 minutes I had with the game: ....In the end I got to the invisible wurm boss, had a really long, drawn-out and boring fight and then there was a chase sequence where you are attacked by a helicopter and you have to jump from boat to boat, sounds like fun but wasn't.  The controls are just as bad or even slightly worse than for RE5. So I just uninstalled the game instead. I think that is the only way to win at this game.In conclusion, maybe if the women wore skimpier clothes I could have enjoyed the game a bit more.			"

												Resident Evil 6 is not a terrible game. It is not a very good game either. In Resident Evil 6, there are 4 different storylines: Leon and Helena, Jake and Sherry, Ada (and ""agent""), and Chris and some weird kid. After you play through two of them (I played Leon and Helena and Jake and Sherry), the game gets very repetitive and dull. The odd thing is that, none of the campaigns are really the same. Storywise, they meet at the same events but they are four different people in different areas with different bosses. It's difficult to describe. (The Ada campaign is pretty much a very difficult single-player mission. However it can be played coop with an ""agent."").What I absolutely dislike about this game are the controls. They are one of the worst I have ever dealt with since there are so many. If they made the game less of an ""over the shoulder"" perspective and more ""free movement"" then I have no problems. But you can't. It's locked into that position and you can't see or move easily especially with the poor controls. The covering system is just beyond bad. You will cover behind anything and even up to walls if you aim (and are close) enough to it. The camera changes sometimes into the weirdest perspectives too and it becomes very hard to see where you're going.This is the second RE game I've played after RE4 on my Playstation 2 and it's very ""meh."" I didn't like the aim scheme then, and I didn't like it now. They don't even tell you how to use herbs, they're just there. Combine them or use them, there is no difference.Obligatory Score: 6/10Add: Oh and this game is dark, very dark. Turn up that brightness if you can.Edit: I completely forgot to put this in. There are parts of the game that have QTE (quick time events) and they are the most annoying thing to grace this Earth. If you thought that Tomb Raider (2013) was bad, this is significantly worse.

												Resident Evil 6 is not a Resident Evil game. The story travels so far off the tracks that this franchise is hard to save at this point. T-Virus, G-Virus and now the C- Virus, six hundred different kinds of enemies and over the top cut scenes that make the action in the Paul WS Anderson movies look tame. Subplots make little to no sense. Nothing is explained. Villains are just there because the world needs villains. As for gameplay, the co-op element as fine. I'm OK with that existing but why the overuse of cutscenes while your partner opens a door? Or pulls a lever? Is this game trying to compete with Metal Gear Solid IV? Let us play Capcom!  I cannot even recommend this game for the co-op and I definitely would not recommend playing this game solo. Why does the game need to spell out the objective for us? Or where the entrance to the next area is? This is the same developer that gave us Resident Evil, a huge mansion to explore and solve puzzles and this is the best they can do in 2012? Capcom should do us all a favor and reboot the series, start from the ground up because seriously, I couldn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥you're  so desperate to connect the franchise together you feel the need to make Sherry Birkin a playable character.

												The game is ridiculous and hilariously over the top but I love it anyway for the hi-octane action and wrestling with zombies/J'avo/ugly mutants. The plot makes half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sense but I enjoyed seeing what the characters, new and old got up to. I embraced the sheer unrestained glee the game seems to revel in and really liked it. I give this twenty more thumbs up for the intense and aptly named No Mercy Mercenaries mode where I  play around with Nick from Left 4 Dead 2, holy granoly, that makes my night when he unleashes the hellfires of his grenade launcher into a Witch's damn face - it is satisfying to say the least.P.S. Piers and Chris were obviously into each other. Thank you Capcom for dashing our dreams once again. "

												Hello everybody, my name is Shaun Meyers and I'm the writer for a game review website known as Universal Gaming Reviews. I figured I'd share my latest review for Resident Evil 6 with those that are interested in the game.To be complete honest the game is mediocre at best and filled with tons of cliches and cheese. The checkpoint/autosave system is atroscious and the game has no ability to pause during gameplay. The game feels really lacking in uniqueness and it feels like Capcom isn't really trying anymore, too much focus was put into it's graphics and not enough effort was done in making the game unique. The boss was lame and felt like he was there just to drag the game on further and being the only boss there it felt pointless fighting him. While the combat system is definitely improved over 5 the game as a whole feels watered down and tasteless. I wouldn't really recommend the game unless you're a die-hard fan of zombies or Resident Evil.If you'd like to read our full review for the game you can find it here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/resident-evil-6-overview-review/Thanks for reading, happy gaming!

												Not for 30 bucks.Never.This is probably the worst Resident Evil game, tied with ORC.Starting with the gameplay. It's a mess, you can slide, make jumps to the right or left, roll over and throw yourself on your back. Besides the slide move I've never used any of these moves during my first playthrough, because they feel so unnecessary and out of place. Gunplay is downright horrible. You have a crosshair with a dot inside, which will jump all over the place after you shot your gun. The problem is that the dot will stay at a random position inside the crosshair, it won't be at the center. The recoil of a shot only pushes your crosshair upwards, guns feel like toys without any force. Did I mention it doesen't have licensed guns? Capcom said that fans of RE4 requested more realistic guns, That is why RE5 had so many awesome realistic guns (except for the upgrades of course). In RE6 we get guns called ""Bear Commander"" or ""Wing Shot"". Resident Evil was always fairly realistic when it came to guns.QTE's everywhere, you can disable most of them but why did they even add them in the first place then? The vehicle segments are horrible aswell. There's too many of them and the controls are super awkward. Fyling a jet or helicopter feels like playing table hockey.Now for the graphics. Yet another step backwards from RE5. The only thing that looks decent are the character models, everything else ranges from 2002 to 2008 level graphics. Gun models are super low-poly, same goes for most texture resolutions.Don't believe me? Check these out:Raw Lightning Hawk model/textures[www.imfdb.org]Low quality environments Skybox texture a la Deus Ex (2000)I don't want to bash a game due to it's graphics, but considering that RE5 had much better graphics...there's no excuse for that, Capcom.Furthermore, we get some ""high quality"" level design , like pillars in front of consoles (see pic) or corridors that lead to nowhere. Now for the worst part...the plot. Seriously, you thought RE5's plot was bad with Jill's mind control and Wesker becoming some god complex villain? Trust me, this game puts ""bad writing"" on a whole new level. The dialogue, the cutscenes, the characters...just everything. It's not even ""funny"" bad like the voice acting of the first game, it's just plain bad. Chris is now a drinker who talks about nothing but Ada and Leon's voice seems halfway faded. I miss the ""No thanks, bro."" kind of guy. I think the character that stayed the most true to it's former self was HANNIGAN, and she has like 4 minutes of screen time.Now I'll talk about the decent parts of the game.The best part of the game is the mercenaries mode. There you just aim for the highest score possible, without the stupid plot being constantly showed into your face or dumb vehicle segments.Personally, I still prefer RE5's and even Mercs3D (yep, that game for the Nintendo 3DS) mercenaries modes over RE6's because of the basic gameplay, but from a mechanical standpoint (like killing a specific amount of enemies in a specific time window will trigger a boss to spawn) you can't deny that RE6's mercs is the most developed one (thanks to Dfactor for some explanation).Next thing is the melee system. Now, I'm not saying that it's good, I'm saying that it's okay-ish.While it can be fun to throw an enemy at another one and seeing them both smashing into a table, it just feels out of place and even overpowered. You can melee ANYTIME, which is my biggest point of criticism on the melee system. It's just way too focused on melee combat overall, which makes me think ""Resident Fighter VI"" would have been a more appropriate name.Lastly, the amount of content. My first playthrough of all campaigns took me about 20 hours. Now that would be a big + if the game itself wasn't bad, and if I didn't have to force myself through the last two campaigns.That's the end of this review. If you really want to try this game, then get it during a sale.I know it seems like I'm hating on this game, and yeah, I am. I don't even deny it, I hate on it and for good reason.			"

												Were to start !! Wow this game is fun,fulfilling and dam right enjoyable. Resident evil 6 offers a variety of chapters for missions offering 4 storylines in the order you chose, and weapons ranging from a close quarters knife to a long range sniper rifle. This game offers an enjoyable experience from casual and professional gamers alike. Along your journey to combat the dreaded C-Virus you will have a companion aiding you with there skills and friendship, and of course there gun. Unfortunately if youare looking for scares this is not the game for you as it is some what lacking in the department, and  it is more chapter dependant. Leon's chapters more gut-churning zombies,Cris has more futuristic C-Virus victims. Anyway enough said i would definitely recommend this game as it is very entertaining and gratifying.			"

												Not an horror game. Not very surprising, since the Resident Evil franchise became more action oriented since RE2. The story is pretty cheesy, but it never was the strong point of Capcom's games. What about the gameplay then ? It's far from perfect, but there are some good ideas, like the dodging mechanics and the ""quick shot"" attack (which is very efficient against high-mobility enemies). I recommand you to play it in Co-op mode with a friend for more overall enjoyment.			"

												WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.I have not completely finished this game (only played through Leon and Jake's campaign) but I love it so far! Definitely one of my favourite games I've bought this year. I like the game mechanics, though the odd angles can sometimes be annoying (such as suddenly making me have to use S to go forward when I normally use W) and cause me to die. The storyline is good, besides from the fact that some of  the J'avo mutations are a bit crazy - such as those weird grasshopper things or the many, many times that Simmons changes (I thought he'd never die).Pros:Storyline is quite goodGame mechanics aren't too confusingPuzzles were reasonably easy to solveInteresting character development (especially in Jake's campaign)Cons:Can be a bit overdramatic or repetitiveOdd anglesPuzzles were reasonably easy to solve (not a con for me, but could be for you)			"

I actually played this game on the PS3 when it came out and loved it. I decided to revisit it when I saw it on sale and I still love it now. It's not the best resident evil game, but it tried at least. The controls are a bit weird and the distrubtation of ammo/healing items are sometimes very rare because of the skill points. This becomes extremely frustrating when you need to fight hordes of zombies/javo but have little to no ammo. ( Unless your playing as Jake). So save your ammo and healing items if you can. I can't think of anything else to say, so I guess this is the end of the review...			"

												I understand why fans dislike this game but I personally love it! Very satisfying blowing zombie heads off and beating them to death. Get a friend and play coop as offline play with a bot ruins the game experience. It is a shame that the online community for this game is relatively small.			"

												Resident Evil 6 (RE6) is the third Resident Evil game I’ve played (only played 4, 5, and 6 since I don’t have a Playstation). The game has a relatively low metacritic rating (69 last I checked) but I found it to be exactly what I expected after playing RE5 a year earlier. If you’ve only seen the Resident Evil movies then you may not be aware that the games have a completely different storyline and I think they’ve been retconned a few times as well.  You would probably recognize a bunch of the characters though since almost every Resident Evil character I know appears in RE6.The game is a third person “over the shoulder” game played in coop with another person. Just like Resident Evil 5, if you don’t have a friend playing with you, the computer controls the other guy. There are 4 campaigns for you to play and in each of them you can play one of the 2 characters. The campaigns all intersect multiple times so you might be playing the Leon campaign and run in to Chris Redfield. Then when you’re playing the Chris campaign you run into Leon and play as the other side of the encounter. It’s a great way to see the plot from various viewpoints and you’ll understand why characters are acting in a certain way. After you’ve completed the game you can go back and play as the second character in each campaign as well. There’s over 50 hours of gameplay to be had in single player alone. Each campaign is divided into chapters and each chapter into sections, for example Leon Campaign Chapter 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc. The game saves at checkpoints during each section, so if you’re knocked out and your partner doesn’t revive you in time, you restart at the checkpoint. Your inventory is saved between sections and you can replay previous sections freely. There is no more “inventory screen,” now it’s just a quick menu where you hold a button to display and scroll through your items. There is no level up system, but you can gather “exp” points to unlock perks such as improved damage or better aim stability. Then you can pick which 3 perks you want equipped between missions. So you can replay levels over and over for more exp or replay some of the bosses a few times for fun.I believe the complaint that a lot of Resident Evil purists had was that beginning with RE5, the games aren’t really “survival horror” anymore. Now the focus is on action and shooting. I remember in RE4 that conserving ammunition was a big challenge so you use melee attacks as much as possible. The melee system has been enhanced a great deal since then and ammunition has become a lot more plentiful (you can also replay levels to grab ammo and then just save + quit). You’ll definitely do a lot of shooting, but you should definitely master the hand to hand (or knife fighting depending on which character you’re playing). Storywise, the game picks up a few years after Resident Evil 5. The world is continuing to circle the drain as various warlords around the world use biological weapons to create zombies and other super powered monsters. Each campaign has its own antagonist though they cross over a lot, as mentioned earlier. If you haven’t played the previous games you might not understand a few “peculiarities” of the playable characters. I certainly didn’t know who some of the people were and the ways that their backstories drive the game’s plot.  It is mostly understandable though if you play the whole game through. Just accept that everyone knows each other from previous games.Pros:+Excellent built in co-op play for the campaign, and for different game modes like Mercenaries. Steam sells the “complete pack” that includes everything, kind of like a Game of the Year edition.+Very long game (at least 35 hours even if you rush), you’ll get your money’s worth.+A lot of replay value (you can unlock “perks” by grinding for exp).+You can play as a monster! Join someone’s game and ♥♥♥♥ them up. A few people tried dropping into my brother and my games, but since we were on levels with only normal zombie enemies (so they spawned as normal zombies), we blew them away easily lol.Cons:-Multi player is kind of dead now. Hard to find a game to join unless it’s a friend inviting you or vice versa.-According to Resident Evil “purists” the game is more action than “survival horror.” If you’re new to Resident Evil games and just looking for a co-op shooter, this won’t bother you.-There are a few times when you need to run through an area in a short amount of time (like escaping a giant enemy) and the camera keeps subtly shifting so you slightly change running directions and hit a wall or something, then you die. This is VERY annoying but only happens in a few areas. Most of the time you can play leisurely.Overall I would definitely recommend Resident Evil 6 if you like action games and / or zombie bashing games. The visuals are disturbing and the monsters are grotesque, as expected in a Resident Evil game. The game is 100% better if you have a friend to join your game for coop play. And once you’re done with the campaigns you can spend a lot of time on the various game modes that are included, most especially the Mercenaries mode, which returns from Resident Evil 5. It’s kind of like a survival mode where you try to live to the end of the timer killing as many enemies as you can. The enemy types keep changing until you’re fighting mini bosses.  "

												As long as you can pull your head out of pre- RE4 game style in the series, you will probably enjoy this. Top quality game, replayable as any of the characters (with 3 stories from 2 perspectives each) with unlockables and plenty of tense moments.  yes, it is partially action, not precisely survival horror, but a top notch game in any genre. will play some more, eventually.

												Story: 8.5/10I found the story to be enjoyable and keeps to the main idea of zombie outbreaks. Yet, the story kept me hooked thanks to reintroducing old favourites in the Resident Evil cast such as the likes of Leon Kennedy, Sherry Birkin, Chris Redfield and Ada Wong whilst introducing new characters with more unique personalities like Jake Muller. The story is quite lengthy but the interesting story makes up for it.Gameplay: 9/10The gameplay may have changed drastically where gunfights and brawls are the main whilst the horror element has diminished in comparison to previous Resident Evil titles which puts off most Hardcore RE fans who came for the scares and suspense but it's still a great game nevertheless since the number of actions you can pull off have risen. They should have implemented skills like rolling, dodging (when you want to) and countering. The challenging part of RE6 is pulling off counters at the correct time since the prompt only appears for a split second before you miss the prompt and lose some health. QTE's are common throughout the game which I'm not a big fan of since the controls are a bit clunky and the buttons fail to register even though i press them clearly but they make it more challenging and forces the player to stop being a lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and do something about it. Co-op in this game is really fun when playing with friends and talking via voicechat. The Mercenaries gamemode makes a return and new gamemodes such as Siege and Survivors make the game replayable and competitive to play.Controls: 6/10As mentioned before, the controls are a bit clunky since sometimes buttons you hit don't register properly or on time which is expected of a PC port from consoles. All the controls ingame are evident of this however Capcom kindly gave PC players shortcuts (most likely after several patches) to commands which would have taken multiple keys to carry out before. Crouching has been binded to 2, Rolling to 3 and Mixing Herbs to H which saves us so much time when we're in a pickle.Sounds/Music: 7/10The sounds are great and the music is underrated. I think that there are some wonderful soundtracks in there but most of the songs are slightly lacking in contrast to classic RE games like Resident Evil and RE3. Gun sounds are on point and the ambience really reflects on the mood of the game.Graphics: 8/10I'm pretty fond of the graphics in this game. Looking back at old RE games, I can really see that Resident Evil has come so far since the first release back in 1996. Though the graphics have improved immensely, it still doesn't compare to most titles nowadays or even games released back in 2012/2013Overall: 8/10In short, get this game when it's on sale, especially the complete edition since there are DLCs but I would definitely recommend this game.

												So I have heard a lot of negative stuff about this game being not true to the series and playing this after finishing RE4 and RE Revelations, I can see why. It doesn't have any real jump scare moments like how past RE games and there is a lot of action in this one compared to any of the other games of the main stream RE Series. However, I don't think that makes it a terrible game because it's defies what makes Resident Evil a horror survival game. I personally had fun through all 4 of the campaigns and even without the horror, I didn't mind. I will say the cover system does feel out of play in this game, but gameplay wise I had fun. It prob won't be anyone's favorite RE game in the series as of now, but it certainly isn't a bad game to play through.			"

												It is not the best Resident Evil game that has ever been made. The Gameplay is okayish dont expect some new milestones here, it is  nothing new even for 2013.But it is fun for what it is. It has 4 ""Campaings"" that are interlinked with each other at some point, connecting the whole Story together.Some people say there are a lot of Plot holes in this game, wich i can partially agree but it doesnt spoil the fun in playing the game. The most annoying thing for me is the Inventory Management and the ingame voice if you play with a coop partner both these things are atrociuos!I liked the game and i still play it from time to time, so if you are a RE fan and like the franchise as a whole i would recommend you buy it when it is on sale.

												This game is really fun for those who have a friend to play cooperative campaign with. There are some frustrating moments where the game forces your camera around and leaves you disoriented and not to mention all the QTEs that are bound to make you destroy your keyboard. Good visuals and good amount of content with a captivating story to each of the 4 campaigns. Would recommend if you can pick it up for less than 10 bucks like me.			"

												+Good game, good story line, good plot twists.+Good graphics, good visuals and great boobs everynow and then.+Fulfilling fights and shake offs.-Messed up camera views, most of the time you'll die because of a stupid camera view. The director of the game did a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job.-Messed up NPC interractions. You have to face dirrectly to an object to interract with. Can get you killed in certain situations because you are not facing it right. BUT!!!!!! When you need to quicly climb up a place and run like hell, the character can simply turn around and drop down from the same place you climbed up from because the run button and interractin buttons are the one and same, EVEN WHEN YOU TURN YOUR BACK TO IT!!!!!! Got me killed more than 10 times in a row with Ada in a certain chapter. Because I would jump down from the very same place I climbed up from.-Messed up character actions. Sometimes it can take 4 or 5 seconds to get to a ladder, gets yo killed again if you need to be fast. Your character acts like a large truck taking a slow turn instead of a person simply turning right... When you run from the edge of a bridge or something, you can stumble on litteraly nothing, so that your character supposedly avoids falling down, only to get slaughtered like a sheep because you are TOO late running...Also, just as with the ENTIRE RESIDENT EVIL SERIES, the game itself could be unplayable in certain visual configurations. All things said and done, this game worths every penny you pay. Sucky badge and badge rewards though...			"

												Terrible game. There's a lot of content, but it's stretched thin. Has multiple campaigns with quite a bit of recycled content in each one. Makes you watch the same long cutscenes repeatedly. Controls are awful and inventory management is unintuitive and clunky. The melee combat is frustrating; moves are supposed to be contextual so when you go to strike an enemy on the ground you should stomp on them, but sometimes your character will decide to swing the air above them instead. I was in a coop game where my partner had a zombie pin him on the ground, so I turned around and repeatedly roundhouse kicked the air above the zombie while it ate his face off. The button to run is the same button to climb ladders and jump up or down ledges so you will frequently do one thing when you meant to do another. It has bad checkpointing so you'll replay tedious sections repeatedly. It's full of unecessary and annoying quicktime events that cause instant game overs, far more than any other Resident Evil game. It also has a major bug in Jake's campaign that halts progression in coop that requires a workaround to continue progression. The worst part of the game is it frequently takes away control to make you look at something the game wants to tell you is important, unfortunately the enemies don't stop when this happens so the game is full of cheap deaths where you will be killed by an enemy that approached you and jumped on you during a cutscene. See a zombie approaching you? No problem, I'll just take out my shotgun... no the game wants me to look at some random door that I would've found myself... and I'm on the ground with the zombie on top of me and I'm dead. The game is full of heavily scripted sequences. The game wants you to conserve ammo, but it is also full of scripted encounters with bosses with high health pools, and shooting them will either damage them or not depending on whether or not you're in a scripted sequence or not. It is beyond frustrating to use half your ammo on a boss only to realise that you can't actually damage him yet because the game hadn't decided you're at the scripted point in which you can. Once you have played these encounters out a few times you will begin to wonder every time you reach a boss whether you should shoot him or not or wait for a truck to run him over (often the correct decision). It doesn't just affect bosses but normal enemies. During quicktime events your partner will often not be able to do anything to help you. In my coop game a zombie grabbed my partner and slowly killed him over the course of about half a minute. During that time I unloaded half my shotgun ammo into him, a zombie type we had encountered before and typically took two rounds to take down. But because the game decided the only important thing was whether he passed the quicktime event, that zombie was invincible. You will also run into zombies lying on the ground numerous times that you know are obvious threats. You can shoot them but your bullets will have no impact. Even though you know they're a threat, you have to walk past them where they will  stand up and are only then able to be damaged. The coop is poor compared to Resident Evil 5 or other coop games. There is no resource sharing so if your partner runs out of ammo and you have a ton, that person is just going to have to go on a punching spree until they find some more. You can't give first aid kits or medical supplies to your partner either, although you can use them on them. This is such a basic feature and it was important in Resident Evil 5, so its omission here is glaring. It doesn't play like a survival horror game; I don't have any problem with that in itself but the game is trying to be an action game instead. When you compare it to other action games it doesn't hold up well at all. If you are considering buying this game, get Gears or War, Bulletstorm, Spec Ops: The Line, or one of the newer Tomb Raider games. Or Resident Evil 4. They're all significantly better than this game and tread the same ground.			"

												Hmmmm..HMMMMMMMMMMMM..Resident evil 6 was my second entry into the Resident Evil franchise and i can pretty much say that i genuinely like it. My first RE game was the Revelations which was fantastic since it was mostly centered on heavy survival with that special claustrophobic setting. RE6 is a different story.. bigger spaces, weird enemies and GUNS,GUNS EVERYWHERE!. It might be to much action-ey and quick time event-ish but you can get past that.Story wise the game is excellent because it offers the same storyline with 4 different outcomes. 4 Campaigns with 4-5 chapters.To explain the game without spoilers:1. Leon campaign: ""HELENA,HELENA,LEOOOOON,QQ""2. Chris campaign: ""PEW PEW PEW UGH""3.Jake campaign: ""RUN PLS""4. Ada campaign ""HIDE HIDE+ The MERCENARIES A fun lil' time killer that can get you annoyed and pumped at the same time. Different characters,costumes and weapon loadouts. Excellent game modeOverall the game is awesome and you should definately buy it! 12/10 because Helena Harper			"

												Resident Evil is great way to spend time with your friend. Although there is single player, the game definitely bases on cooperation mode.Things that were good:Multiplayer works great as long as steam servers works.Automatically checkpoints, you can restore game every time you want. Useful when you have not much time.Many chapters and characters with different but connected story.Things that were... at least bad:If you are playing on keyboard and mouse, you might have lots of problems with choosing right grenade or... doing anything. The controls were hardly made for pads.Some aspects of the plot were... just stupid.You have to kill the same boss at least 3 time, till it will be finally dead. That's annoying.Puzzles were predictable and you might fell like child in kindergarten playing with toy to fit square to square hole, triangle to triangle hole and circle to circle hole.You can not kill enemies till they finish their transformation, or any other animation. At the beginning you can waste lots of ammo shooting to them with no results.Like everything else you have to try it yourself. If you do not have any friends to play with, it is not a game for you.Anyway I recommend this game. I estimate it as 6,5/10.			"

												This game steps out of usual Resident Evil mechanics. You are now able to move while aiming and your character runs by default instead of walking. It's no longer a survival horror game, it's a survival ACTION game....it's not scary at all but the action is fun and intense. Ammo is scarce and enemies are many so you will have to count your bullets and engage smartly. It's divided in 4 different campaigns; Leon and Helena, Chris and Piers, Jake and Sherry and a bonus campaign with Ada. Each has it's own story that eventually intertwines with each other which is fun. Overall it's a great action shooter, it has it's bugs and stuff but it's a fun game to play co-op!			"

Product received for free
												Just played almost 2 hours of the game, Leon campaign, in PC (already played in consoles, so, I have more game time).My last experience with Resident Evil, really good, was with RE 4. With 5, played a little bit and dropped.This one is fun, but I expected much more.The camera is horrible most of the times (I play in a very big screen) and when you have a lot of zombies and you need a fast combat, it's just bad.I like the way they did the mellee combat and kicks and stuff. Guns has better ammo for you to use and also you can have many guns inside your pocket. I wonder when they will make a better real RE (this is for my taste, I like it). You need to shoot almost 3-5 times in the head of the zombie... really?There are many tense moments, but the exploration part and good parts of it are just dumb. There are parts where you just have to take a quick decision with keys and it is confusing also (you will get used to it, but until there, expect to lose health and die a few times). This is me playing normal difficulty and I am used to FPS / TPS games (that's why the fault is on camera, controls and zombie behaviour). Again, I wonder their QA on this.In overall, game is good, but not that good compared to what I expected.I got it on sale (80%), so I recommed it. But I am happy that I did not pay full price for this.			"

												Starting with the cons Resident Evil 6 is quite a mixed bag...it seems to have favoured quantity rather than quality for the campaigns- being brutally honest they are pretty bad (they can be fun if you have a friend to play with and you just kind of joke around with it but they all kind of feel a bit messy). Alot of quick time-events, In RE4 and RE5 they were pretty well spaced out but here besides maybe the first half of Leon's campaign there is an overflow of QTEs. Most of the good modes are DLC. And last there is NO mention of Jill what so ever in the game (which I would have been fine with if Chris wasn't there- oh well mod Jill BSAA over Helena and you're good I guess?) Pros: There is no shortage of content with 4 campaigns of very familar faces unknowingly work towards the same goal to stop the latest bioterror threat- some replayability with challenges, achievements, REnet events and difficulties. The combat is surprisingly satisfying like RE5 where you have a wide arsenal of guns, melee weapons, grenades, bombs and for 1 particular character (2 if you count Sherry) crossbow arrows + explosive arrows. Also the melee attacks for most characters are pretty diverse and its fun to chain in combos with them reguardless of the mode you are playing. The main reason you will probably like this game is the mercenaries and the mercenaries no mercy, very fun mode like re5 where you work alone or together (with mods it can be up to 6 friends) to kill as many enemies as possible while maintaining the overall combo and extending time remaining/ with no mercy doubling the total enemies you'll face. Predator and Siege are DLC modes that are up to 6 players which are pretty fun especially with friends. Overall I wouldn't have got this game had it not been on discount but seeing when it is on discount it seems to be really cheap (70-87% disocunt) I would say RE6+predator+siege is worth your money but wait for a sale that it's included in.

												What happened to the Resident Evil franchise? They are BUTCHERING it! The first real problem that I noticed when I started playing this was the brightness and darkness...the game is either too bright when theres light or too dark when there's no light. There's no adjusting this on the brightness settings. No matter what I try, it's the same. The shadows and lighting are terrible. Graphics are subpar. And like everyone says, this is not really a survival horror anymore. The old Resident Evil games used to give me the creeps, the current ones have no such atmosphere or gameplay. I feel like they are just trying to suck the most money out of everyone just like COD does. Yes, the same arguement as what everyone is saying, but it's true.			"

												It looks pretty, but without a doubt it has all the fun and playability of a dead sloth. If button mashing is your thing then you may well suit the game, however if your like me and find needlessly dieing due to a badly timed random button then give it a wide berth. It amazes me that with a franchise as well established as this that they still can't seem to get the camera view to work properly.Will look elsewhere for some entertainment, spend enough time at a real job for me to ""enjoy"" games like this.

												Worst in-game controls I've ever encountered. Even after remapping the keys it's a pain. On top of that, game only saves once in a while, checkpoint saves mean nothing, they don't actually save the game, if you leave. Combine this with the fact that there's no actual 'Pause"" option for the game, and it makes for a very poor experience. It is extremely frustrating playing on PC. Keyboard controls often change when a new camera angle is forced upon you, making several parts of the game extremely frustrating, where one second W is forward and then you have to use S to move forward. Obviously, it happens in sequences where milliseconds will decide if your character will live or die.Unless you are ready to pay out of pocket for a XBox controler for PC (by the way, this game has ALSO issues with Logitech joysticks, so don't bother using one), don't waste your money on this game.This is the WORST RE, and I've played them all. Looks like the franchise is dead.			"

 What the ♥♥♥♥ happened here? This isn't survival horror, plain and simple. The only survival horror you get is when you play the first 2 chapters of Leon's campaign, that's it.Overall, Resident Evil 6 was one of the biggest dissapointments of 2012. The game isn't bad, gameplay wise it's great. But it's story and everything else is pretty bad. Capcom tried so hard to make this a great Resi game for the fans by adding all these returning characters like Leon and Sherry, instead the game suffered greatly by it's mediocre story and terrible segments. The fact that you can carry every weapon in the game that you find at once completely destroys the whole survival horror aspect. The ability to dodge at will without quicktime events, and the improved movement in general, is a great addition, but it's not without it's flaws. The strict movment in past games was made because it made the game felt more tense. It generated fear of not being able to dodge anything, and you knowing you had to take out what was in front of you or you'd get hit and you only have yourself to blame. In Resi 6, all that is thrown out the window thanks to the new movement. It further solidifies itself as an action game rather than a horror game, which we all know is NOT what Resident Evil is ment to be.Overall, I'd have to give Resident Evil 6 a 4/10. I wouldn't recommend this game if you're new to the series. Start with Resident Evil 4 instead, or even better, start with the original Resident Evil.			"

												A fun game from start to finish. I have over 100 hours on the Xbox and decided to pick it up for the PC as well.The game is being bashed on meta-crtiic, I can only assume that those bad reviews were made by people who did 0 research before buying the game, or even looking at the trailers.This is NOT a horror game. Sure, there might be scary moments in Leon's campaign, but do not go into this game thinking you will be scared.This is a GREAT action game with a EXCELLENT story, especially for those (like myself) who have a special place in their hearts for the Resident Evil story and characters. You can experience all the goodness with a friend even!The BEST thing about this game is the controls; I have NEVER played a game with so much freedom and fluidity in a third person shooter before. I have NEVER been constrained in this game. If someone says it this game has crappy controls then they are simply an idiot who did not take all of 5 minutes learning the controls.I guess that is the bad thing of this game; the game does not give you a good tutorial about the controls, you have to find out yourself (there are several fairly open areas where you can practice, or you can load up a mercenary mode game and try it out).This might not be a good horror game, but it is a GOOD GAME nonetheless. I even made a video review of it a while back, I will link it here.

												As someone who has played every single Resident Evil game since 1996 I can safely say that this game does NOT feel like a Resident Evil game, not even RE5 or any other RE title that has ever been released. The game itself feels like some sort of third person shooter fighting game combined with *A LOT* of quick action events. Some people have told me that in some parts of the game it feels like a third person version of Call of Duty, but I seriously couldn't play through the whole game (I had to force myself through the first 2 hours of gameplay). The levels and the detail on the characters look pretty good, gameplay itself doesn't feel like a horror game and the controls on mouse and keyboard are terrible, if you really want to purchase this game make sure you do it during a sale and make sure to have a controller!If you're new to the series and you really want to play this game, you might like the co-op mode which is probably the only good thing about this game but if you really want to play a 2-player coop RE game I suggest Resident Evil 5 which is far from the survival horror genre but it's a fun co-op game, one of the best ones I've played.TL;DR: Worst RE game ever, good action Co-Op game, get it during a sale.

												I've been into Resident Evil since I was a kid. Even as I got older, I still enjoy going back to the older games and trying them out. As far as the differences between Resident Evil 1 and 6 go, you can't compare the games that much on gameplay. However, one similarity the games share would be the memorable moments I've had with the series. Even with the changes in the audience it's tried to reach (or stumbled across), I still find it a very noteworthy experience. And even from a game like Operation Raccoon City (that is admittedly kinda broken), there were probably more memorable moments playing that than other games like Dead Space 3 or Borderlands 2. It should be noted, I don't play this game by myself (I play with my brother).As the mechanics are concerned in this game, it's pretty good. There are moments where I'm stuck huddling against a wall or my view changes while trying to make a hastey escape. I assume the mechanics are designed largely for combat (which fail on occassion) and not much else. Some areas involving stealth I couldn't quite get into them until my second play through of the game. However, the game did introduce the ability to roll and shuffle very well, making your characters feel much more nimble (despite when they've planted their butt on a wall and their face in the crotch of a zombie). The game's not perfect, but it is definitely an improvement over Resident Evil 5's on-rails feel (for lack of a better term).Resident Evil 6 is fun. The campaigns are long and enjoyable. I'm not opposed to quick time events, and found they were the cause of some memorable experiences my first play through this game. The replay value holds up quite well, especially with extra content like The Mercenaries mode. The story is a tad predictable and cliche, and I would (and have) also described it as, ""Trying to be too epic.""I also kind of felt it succeeded. Plus, I don't want to trash every story out there merely on the idea it seems like I've seen aspects in it somewhere before.My biggest gripes with the game would be the clunky controls. Because of this, there were some parts of the campaigns that I would have prefered being removed or altered.As a whole, I recommend this game for anybody looking for a good cooperative playthrough with a sibling or close friend. Just, try not to judge this game on whether it's Resident Evil 1 enough for you.			"

												STORYbio terorisme menyerang dunia, membuat semua orang ketakutan, dan siapapun yang terkena virus pasti berubah menjadi zombie. Sherry, chris dan leon dari BSFAA , kembali jadi tokoh utama untuk mengembalikan kestabilan dunia dengan mencari penyembuh dari virus ini , ditambah dengan tokoh cantik yang misterius si Ada Wong yang suka bermain di air keruh. Di game ini juga disimpulkan siapa sebenarnya ada waong itu , dan siapa si jake itu, yang masih ada hubunganya dengan serial RE sebelumnya.GAMEPLAYCampaign dibagi menjadi 4 campaign dengan memainkan 4 karakter berbeda. yaitu Leon dengan sidekicknya Helena, Chris dengan sidekicknya Rick (lupa gan) , Jake dengan Sidekicknya Sherry dan Ada wong dengan sidekicknya petugas neo umbrella .  yang menarik setiap campaign mempunyai benang merah dengan campaign2 lainya. Jadi kalo kamu memainkan campaign leon ada cutscene dimana nanti kamu bertemu dengan chris dan jake, sherry dan ada. Dan begitu juga bila kamu main campaign chris , ada cutscene dimana kamu bertemu dengan leon, jake dan ada.  Yang unik , setiap campaign acak, kamu bisa mulai dari character yang mana kamu suka. Ntah itu chris, leon , jake or ada. No problem. Atau bayangkan dirimu menonton film, disebuah film ada empat cerita berbeda yang berjalan secara paralel yang mempunyai akhir2 yang berbeda, tetapi satu tujuan untuk menyalamatkan umat manusia dari virus keji. Ketegangan ala2 horor yang dibangun standard lah , kalo pemain yang sudah maen RE ini, ga lebih serem dibanding game2 horor lainya.GRAFIS: cocoknya buat pc dengan spec med- end  kalo mau maenya enak , tanpa patah2. Cukup kerenlah, misalnya kalo basah abis berenang, efek2 basah2anya terlihat nyata. Ekspresi character terlihat jelas, dan cutscene2nya  lumayan menghibur.SOUND: Standard game action horror gan, kalo lagi alurnya lambat , musiknya kalem, kalo lagi tegang2nya , ato perang2, background soundya  pacenya cepat.+PROS :1.	Multiplayernya asoy gan, bisa coop campaign, jadi bisa minta tolong temen buat nyelesain campaign entah itu local coop (1 komputer 2 player dengan split screen) ato onlince coop dan ga ribet, tinggal pencet R, buat invite temen.2.	Bagi yang membeli DLC , banyak mode2 game lain selain campaign, jadinya ga gampang bosen3.	Mempunyai nilai replayable yang  tinggi, karena walaupun kamu udah selesaikan 4 campaign, masih banyak achivement yang masih unlock dan skill2 yang masih belum terbuka.CONS :1. Savean cuman di chapter2 tertentu saja, ga bisa pencet F5 buat save , ato quick save, jadi kalo mati , ngulangnya agak2 jauh.2. Kadan♥♥♥♥da aksi2 dengan angle kamera yang bikin kagok dan menyebalkan, jadinya harus ada penyesuaian dulu.  3. Makan hardisk lumayan banyak diatas 20GB an4. Harga mahal gan di SteamS tore , $40 gan, beli kalo lagi ada sale aja, ato cari2lah seller lagi kasih harga spesial.5. Ga ada fasilitas in chat dalam game.Kesimpulan :Buat penggemar seri  RE, harus punya nih.  Disaranin beli ori gan, supaya maen multiplayernya lebih enak ga perlu ribet. Btw maen RE 6 bareng ane ganIni id ane :http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198093867839 "

												If you want a rather solid Action based Third Person Shooter to play with a buddy, this is a great game to playIf you are a diehard Resident Evil fan that wants nothing more than a solid Survival horror experience like previous installments, don't buy thisGameplay is rather fun, might be quite some QTE's but you can turn the bigger ones off if you don't wish for themEvery campaign has something different going for itLeon's campaign features zombie enemies and a bit more of a horror-ish kind of thing except for the endChris' campaign is more like a traditional Military based TPS, focusing on action and firefights with the always mutating J'avoJake's campaign also has a focus on action for the most part, also including the J'avo, but switches it up with vehicle segments, exploration segments and an occasional stealth segmentAda's campaign focuses more on puzzles and stealthy segments for the most part, it was initially designed to be strictly a Single Player experience, but you can play it in co-op, but the Second player will be limited to just shooting and can't interact with any puzzlesIf you are done with that, you can always play some Mercenaries, regular or No MercyRegular mercenaries is the same as it's always been, No Mercy is pretty much the same but will throw giant waves of enemies at you without stopping, make sure you are capable of surviving or be prepared to die, a lotTL;DR: Only buy this if you want a solid action game to play with a buddy and don't care if the story's over the top, and specifically don't buy this if you are a Die-hard fan who can't give RE taking a different turn a chance			"

												I can't wrap my head around all these horrible reviews this game is getting? I understand this Resident Evil chapter in the Resident Evil series is unlike the originals (ex.. this is is not a survival-esque like the earlier games in the series) but haven't they all been like this since the release of Resident Evil 4???? All these nerd as$ fanboys are complaining and moaning that RE lost its roots. This is downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.... Not all of us are into that♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is one of the best in the series and I'm barely moving on to Jake's campaign. Every minute of this game is has been straight up entertaining. I agree some of the boss battles and zombies are not up to par with tyrants of it's earlier predecessors but damnit I still enjoy it.Pros of RE6:-Fluid Controls-Fast Paced Action-Quick time scenes ( I actually Enjoy)-New zombies / monsters-5 campaigns (9 if you play it from both of the characters campaigns)Negs of RE6 (Only Negatives if your a fan boy nerd of earlier series)-Clunky Phone Menu thing-Not survival horror ( making every bullet count / knowing when to run / rationing everything aka boring )-Zombies arent really zombies just mutants ( get over it )-GAME IS TOO FAST PACED AND ACTION-EE WAAAHHHH Wahhhhh ( that's a baby crying )All in all I strongly recommend this game to new and old RE Fans of the series. I have been playing RE since RE 1 on my old Grey Playstation. Yes, RE6 is not like the originals but why are people complaining like it's a bad thing?? Games progress and try new things, and in this case... Change isn't really a bad thing. Only you can decide by picking up this game :]			"

												**Spoiler free**Low playtime on steam, this is because i owned it on Xbox360 and played a few hundred.Let me start off by saying that this is a bad resident evil, but I think it is a good game.It is a bad resident evil as there is no survival aspect. Sure, they brought back real zombies for a campaign, but that's about it. Even then, most of them jump around and♥♥♥♥♥♥and swing weapons all over the place. No. Thats not how they should work. Inventory management is GONE. Once you pick up a weapon, thats it, you can keep it forever and not worry about switching them out. All you gotta worry about is inventory for ammo, herbs and grenades which doesn't come up much. The other campaigns are the same, but its more like gears of war as enemies are just infected people again with guns. Where's Marcus' dad?Gonna be honest, even for RE the stories are horrible. Jake's Ending? AHAHAHAHAHAHHA no.As a game, I did have fun. The movement is really neat, and melee combat is quite nifty. You get a LOT of playtime for every campaign, as there is a lot of story to go through. Agent Hunt is a really neat idea, where you are a zombie and attack players as they do the story, but it's not executed too well, I remember hating it. The stamina mechanic doesn't fit in with the game, but it's quite neat for the mercenaries mode.Mercenaries is what makes this game for me. I've spent hundreds of hours in this gamemode and never get bored of it. It's just fun at its best. If you enjoyed RE5's mercenaries, you're gonna enjoy this just as much. Only complaint about it on PC is that there doesn't seem to be as many levels as on console. I remember buying several map packs for it, and I'm not sure if they're in here, but I doubt it. I'll update this part if I get confirmation.It runs really well for me so far, but the FOV seems low and the FOV option didnt seem to change much. It's a solid port.All in all, if you're expecting classic resident evil (not likely) turn away. If you loved the mercenaries in RE5, for the love of god buy it. If you like gears of war and stuff, try it out, you might like it.			"

												Explosion jerkfest , QTE out the rear, Bad Controls, Lame story, Wrestling or kick boxing zombies more then you are shooting them because you rarely get ammo. This game is like if Micheal Bay made a video game and Capcom pried open there Rectom and took a masive crap on it.  It feels nothing like a RE game. It feels like a Shooting game (and not a very good one ) more then a Survivle Horror game. Leons story mode is so-so. It vaugely resembles a RE game. Chrises Story is a lame generic shooter where you don't even get any Ammo to shoot any thing, and Sherry's is about the same. I'm at the point with this franchise where i think I'd rather see it go away. If Capcom can't get RE7 done right then i just wish for this series o Die off before it falls down further in to the toilet.			"

Seriously, none of the playtests told them it was a BAD IDEA?SecondlyI love shooting zombies, the zombies as we know them.If you give the opponent a gun. Make the opponent duck and dodge then what do we get? YES A SHOOTERwhy would I play this if I can play BATTELFIELD or a different shooter which is BETTER AT THE GENREI bought this because I like zombies, STOP WASTING MY TIME WITH NORMAL HUMAN ENEMIES IN A ZOMBIE COSTUME.

												The latest edition to a phenomenal zombie franchise.

												Game play wise & for the most part story wise, probably the best Resident evil game to date. It's hard to explain over all the negative reviews, but I will plea my case the best that I can. This game hits all the right notes until it comes to the parts in the game where you need to drive, or run the gauntlets or from point A to B. That can be a pain for one mistake sends you back. That is the only downfall to this game. The story of all the parties ( don't want to spoil anything) I feel had to take a lot of thought on how to make them interesting, yet come together. The game itself which got rated under Resident evil 5 blows my mind. I know Resident Evil 5 is the last of the classic RE, but RE6 has these things over 5. First instanced Loot,  so if you play with a friend you each get your own loot rather than trying to find out who needs what ammo, or who needs the green herb the most. You can run and shoot, doesn't seem like much, but play RE5 where you are bascially a turrent and you will see why. This is minor, but when you standing infront of object you need the partner to help assist with even that has more interesting options than any previous RE that is Co-Op. Incase you have made it this far and wonder which of the RE series is my favortie that would be Code Veronica.  Which is in the old school style, but besides the first RE it had the second most intrigue behind it, yet you see the return of one of the most infamous villians of all time Albert Wesker. Thanks for reading.			"

												This is from the perspective of someone who has played the Xbox version first, and the PC version second. The Good of this port is the same for the Xbox version, and I will review it as an action game, not a horror game. It is clearly not meant to be scary, but to be fun and make you feel awesome for breaking through all that it can throw at you. If you are unable to accept that Resident Evil is no longer meant to frighten you, you will likely hate this game for straying so far from its roots and reputation for scares. If you are able to look past the reputation of Resident Evil, read on.The Good: (what to consider when purchasing)Resident Evil has never had such tight, fluid controls. The new movement and dodge mechanics make you feel like a badass, tucking and sliding out of the way in real time, through your own skill rather than a contextual quick time event as it used to be. Reversal attacks add a layer of cool that no other entry in the series before it has had. You're now able to turn the flow of combat from hectic run-and-gunning into a scene straight out of a kung-fu B movie, rewarding you for your quick reflexes and giving you much needed breathing room when the enemies swarm you. What could be more awesome than grabbing a leaping zombie out of the air and stomping on it before whipping around, kicking another so hard it spins backwards on its heels, then slamming it into the ground with a DDT from behind? Probably while doing it as classic Resident Evil characters, which this game thoughtfully provides.The gameplay varies between campaigns, as you would expect. Leon's focuses more on melee combat than the rest due to scarce ammunition and the zombies' resistance to bullet damage. Expect to be punished harshly for not getting your reversal timing down, as zombies behave unpredictably; Leaping at random, tripping over their own feet, lunging from the floor to pull you down with them, etc. Chris' campaign is full on testosterone infused action, hardly a dull moment to be found and plenty of fun enemy types to encounter and learn the weaknesses of. J'avo are much more predictable than the zombies, but are able to use ranged weaponry, making combat much more reliant on cover. Ada's campaign is a little more like the Resident Evil we recognize, with more puzzles and being rewarded for avoiding enemy contact, though obviously that's not possible most of the time as this is still an action game. Jake's campaign is a mix of the three, combining the over-the-top melee combat of Leon's campaign, the cover based shooting of Chris' and the enemy avoidance of Ada's. It works well, though can be a bit schitzophrenic as you would be required to change playstyle often.The game has a wealth of content because of these four campaigns, and if playtime is something you consider when buying a game, you'd get your money's worth here for the sheer amount of it all. It's not Skyrim levels of vast, but for the type of game it was aiming to be, it certainly could have been a lot less. *cough-cough-OperationRaccoonCity-cough*The Bad: (nitpicks and gripes)While all that's well and good, there are moments where the camera will suddenly yank away from your perspective and focus on something in the background, but still have combat continue around you. This leaves you helpless as enemies are allowed to swarm in closer, or your precious ammo is wasted as you start shooting at a door that just opened because the game insisted on pulling the camera away to show it to you. Though the gameplay is varied between the campaigns, all of them begin to lose steam half way through. Leon's campaign recycles boss fights to the Nth degree, so much so that you may get frustrated as you have to repeat the same fights over and over with little to no variation between them. Past chapter 3, Chris' campaign just throws more and more enemies at you in the despirate attempt to heighten tension more than it had the previous chapters, though because there's nothing really different from them it just feels like an annoying slog. There is a moment where you take control of a jump jet, but it never happens again and it's over in about five minutes. Jake's campaign remains the freshest the longest, with cheesy car chases and one liners that put a smile on my face, but his final chapter reuses a fair amount elements from Chris' campaign. That's to be expected though, as Chris and Jake are meant to meet here, but they still feel a little too similar at times. Ada's later chapters recycle a lot of the same scenes from the other three chapters with minor tweaks here and there, so you end up feeling as though you're going through the motions, tying loose ends rather than playing as a seperate character.The Ugly: (the game's major failings)The PC version's load times and compatibility issues with most computers and hardware make it unquestionably inferior to the console versions upon which the game was built off of. It can take anywhere from 8 minutes to 15 minutes just to reach the main menu even on a good computer, while far more graphically intense games zoom past it, which is completely inexcusable in this day and age. It absolutely cripples this port's lastability by comparison, and though infrequent, the occasional crash will make that 8 - 15 minute wait between startups feel all the more brutal. That the game has been out this long for PC and still has these issues is a shameful neglect of its players who are already wary of this game's reputation for being so unlike any other Resident Evil. There isn't even a chat box to use and communicate with the rare person who joins your game, so if you don't have a mic, you're left with only the character's generic ""thanks!"" or ""look out!"" commands. It's no wonder the PC multiplayer lobbies of this port are ghost towns when it takes so long to load and your ability to communicate is being harshly limited without such a basic feature. Imagine having no way to explain a monster's weakness while your partner continues to get hurt by it, not noticing what the monster is doing and soaking up resources for it. It would be very frustrating, naturally.Final Verdict: (CONSOLE version) 7/10Resident Evil 6 is a very functional, varied game full of cheese that'll give you many hours of brainless fun. If you go into it with the same mindset that you would when approaching a John Woo action movie, you'll have a blast. It's silly, but it seems to be fully aware of that, and just tries to do its own thing.However, and I cannot stress this enough, play the console versions.Were it not for the load time, the occasional crash wouldn't be such a big deal and would have remained merely in the Bad, but when combined it makes the experience of playing the PC version not worth the awesome collaboration with Valve's own Left 4 Dead 2 gang and the inclusion of the 250+ enemy minigame, No Mercy mode. Were it not for the lack of a chat box, newbies wouldn't be such an annoyance, but without the ability to explain a bosses weakness or where to go, they simply slow down your game rather than help you in any way that your AI partner couldn't do better than them. It all contributes to the game's lonely multiplayer scene, with more than a third of the game's content going purpetually unplayed (nobody plays Mercenaries, No Mercy, Agent Hunt, or even the other campaigns, just Leon's). It seems unlikely at this stage, but I hope dearly that Capcom fixes the unforgivable startup times, as well as the compatibility issues for many common brands of graphics card. Until then, I recommend Resident Evil 6 as a whole, but not this version of it. There is no excuse for missing basic PC gaming features and 8 - 15 minute load times in the modern era of gaming. Shameful display.			"

												Amazing game with an awesome plot. I recommend this game for both those who played some/all of the previous games and those who never did. Here is a little summary of the game's features:CAMPAIGN & PLOTAfter years and years ""playing safe"", this time, things really get out of control. Bioterrorist attacks take place in some major places worldwide. This time, just like Raccoon, you get the feeling that you just can't save everyone.In this game, you get to see more than meets the eye. You're able to see what hapens ""behind the scenes"" at certain events, thanks to more immersive cutscenes provided by different campaigns.Story intersection is another curious feature. I've never seen anything like that in any other game. It is really fun to play with 3 other players in campaign, specially against Ogroman and Ustanak.Old friends are back, and some revelations are made.I really liked that they brought Sherry (that's right! It is NOT Ashley, for Christ's sake) back. She was missing since RE2, and all we had after that was an epilogue file in RE3 saying that the US government wanted her. Capcom really loves to disappear with some characters.IMPROVEMENTS & ADD-ONSThe combat system has improved a lot since RE5. Dynamic cover, dash, counter attacks, dodge and melee dedicated buttons are in the features list. The most interesting addition, however, is the Skill system. There are tons of things to choose from: enhance your firearm power, melee power, defense, aim, etc. It's very nice.CO-OPCo-op mode in RE6 is more dynamic than it was before. The host don't need to restart the game or stop whatever it is that he/she is doing to allow someone in. The lag seems to be less of an evil this time around, but it is still an issue, specially at some QTE events, where the game should sync the players before the scene, but that's not the case everytime.But putting that aside, it was a real pity that Capcom got rid of the lobby system for each separate chapter (like 1-2, 3-4, and so on) and the ""magic chest"" where you could store your items. I find it extremely annoying to always have my inventory full. Got too few space for so much different bullets, herbs and grenades.DOG TAGSThat was an interesting add-on. You can customize your dog tag your way to distinguish yourself from other players.EXTRA CONTENTIn Agent Hunt mode, you join another player's game as the enemy. Your goal is to kill the player.Mercenaries is back, just like in the previous games. Thankfully, still very familiar. The notable difference is that Coup de Grâce and Counters add more time to the clock.If you're a fan of Left 4 Dead, you might want to try Mercenaries No Mercy. I think you'll enjoy.Onslaught is a fun mode where you kill enemies to send more enemies to your opponent's side. You can't see each other, though.Survivors is back, too. But, this time, it is much more fun. You can play with up to 6 players in the same room. Melee moves, little ammo to spare, random spawning weapons and enemies lurking around will turn it into a challenge.In Predator mode, you play can play as Ustanak, a virtually indestructible creature, which reminds me a lot of Nemesis. Each turn, someone will play as Ustanak and try to defeat as many Agents as it can. This mode can be played with up to 6 players.			"

												I really don't know why this game got a bad rap when it was released, I could think of a few things but they all involve ""change from the series"". Don't listen to the naysayers, Resident evil 6 grows on you like a boil...or something. It may not have the progression or character building of RE4 or RE5 but it makes it up in other areas.Firstly, the intersecting stories. Amazing what Capcom have done here. It's not overly complex but interesting to note that with different characters you play, the story is intertwined, maybe it's just me but I'm the kind of guy who needs a purpose, a story and capcom have done it well here.  On the story though, OK, I'll admit the overarching story is dull, it's epic but dull.....you'll have to play through it to understand. There are a few ""WTF, Darth vader is Luke skywalkers father!?!?"" moments but the story is....meh, Ok. Graphically, man, my PC is ancient, yet the game runs perfect 60 fps on full settings, that's saying something. It might not be Witcher 3 fantastic but it has it's moments. Things I didn't like were dying. It seems you go a way back, or if you exit the game and re-enter, seems you have to start a while back in the piece. Regardless, RE6 is great and for some reason, I think it will be the last we see of Leon, Ada, Chris and all the RE regulars. RE7 is looking great but I think the days of the true resident evil canon are over. Well, I hope somehow it returns.  "

												Great game, doesnt deserve the hate that a lot of the fanboys give it. Although I do respect the decision that was made to bring back the roots of the series in RE7, I do also think that they did a very good job regarding how they did the transition with this game for the series towards more of an action theme. I personally still felt the Resident Evil feeling with this game instead of feeling like it was something completely different. I recommend this game to anyone that isn't a sensitive fanboy that can never be pleased. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those kinds of people.			"

												Is this what I want Resident Evil to be? No. It strays too far from being scary and it should try next game to be more of a survival horror title.That being said, do I like the game? Absolutely, I love it. It's action through and through, but to me it's well-made and offers a great blend of types of action game. There are slower-paced action pieces, high-octane chases, some cover-based gunplay peppered in here and there, and lots of close quarters combat.People complain that it was a QTE fest, and in some parts of the game I completely agree. There are far too many QTE setpieces that try to build off the intense Leon/Krauser scene from Resident Evil 4. Overall it wasn't too bad, but there were definitely problem spots that need to be excised from the next installment.In short: Do not expect horror. It is an action game. However, it's a GOOD action game and I recommend it.			"

												There's a key phrase that aptly describes Resident Evil 6:""Flawed, but fun.""This game takes its' predecessors pedestal of being the most polarizing entry in the series, although it may divide players more than ever. Each of the 4 campaigns present will appeal to certain players and not so much others. The same can be said for some of the features in the game such as the intersections, Agent Hunt, and the co-op mechanics. The real safe bet is that if you're an action fan who likes to play with friends, Resident Evil 6 is an easy recommendation. It's not the greatest action game and it's definitely not a good horror game, but there are some fun moments and good replay value to keep you coming back for more.However, if you come at Resident Evil 6 expecting another Resident Evil 1 or Resident Evil 4, then you will not only be severely disappointed, you will hate this game immensely. This is a game for open-minded players who like action, players who are willing to take the time to adapt to its' systems, and players willing to overlook the flawed design choices and story to have a good time.There is a lot to enjoy here, but only if you're willing to sit down and enjoy it.

												This might not be a better resident evil game but it is actually an outstanding action packed horror game. Sure, it is different from the previous resident evil and the ""lost and found"" feeling has gone BUT if you wish to experience something new, then you will find out, you have no reason to avoid it. Its worth how much it is. Put simple, RE6 is not and never a bad game, its just not what the fans expected it to be and thats why the haters were born. Ignore them! Enjoy the game! You will never regret! It does actually beat many popular games.Btw, I started the franchise since RE3, and I <3 all the series!			"

I tend to enjoy this, it was interesting the storys great, the combat is beautiful and if you computer can handle it, the graphics will be lovely aswell.Just a word of warning though, If you tend to get this game because you want to play co-op with someone random on the internet, may take awhile to find someone willing to have a calm game of RE6 with you. I assure you, playing with a person you  know is the better Idea here, And most certainly for the DLCs.			"

After finishing all the campaigns, I was surprised to see how long this game turned out to be. The PC version runs great in all aspects, and I highly recommend it! On to RE7!			"

												Underrated, unfairly tarred game with lots of valueIf you're a Resident Evil purist, look away immediately. This RE is not a survival horror game in the slightest; you'll be better off seeking such thrills in the throwback Resident Evil: Revelations rather than the action movie-themed 6.There are a number of drawbacks marring this game. The story is a bit convoluted, spread out non-chronologically among four different intersecting campaigns. The narrative itself isn't anything to phone home about, adhering largely to cheesy action movie tropes. The textures and environments are a step-down from the stunning RE5. And the gameplay, which is a departure from 4 and 5's more straightforward ""shooting gallery"" mechanics, seems a bit unwieldy and clunky at first.Once you get the hang of the mechanics, though, RE6 turns out to be a surprising bit of cooperative fun. Unlike previous games in the series, 6 is a melee combo shooter hybrid. In most cases, you're encouraged -- though none of this is properly taught to you via in-game tutorials -- to quickshot stun enemies, then run up to them and combo them with your character-specific melee moves. Doing so proficiently provides an unusual flow to the action somewhat reminiscent of the Arkham Asylum series and conserves precious ammo.The four campaigns, while somewhat disjointed, provide an immense amount of value. You'll easily clock 20+ hours to beat them all; I personally logged over 30. Such game length, and value, is pretty much unheard of in the action game genre.Those looking for a solidly entertaining action game, particularly in conjunction with a buddy, can't go wrong with RE6, particularly if they can pick it up at a budget price. Survival horror fans should look elsewhere, however.			"

												While it might not have consistency of Resident Evil 4, or the atmosphere of the early games in the series, Resident Evil 6 stands as an incredible action game without peer on the PC(and only beaten by Vanquish on the consoles). The complexity instilled in every inch of the game's mechanics, and the incredible sense of mobility and maneuverability make it a game worth learning and replaying. Much like God Hand it will be a game remembered in a few years as something, that despite its flaws, was given an unfair reception at launch.Also is host to a top notch port, with easily scalable graphics and 60 FPS without any issues.

												I heard many comment about this game.Someone say good someone say bad.Review:-Melee attack is best in all resident evil project,you can kill zombie without gun(Wait for stamina too!).-Gun can aim easier but sometime may be hard to change.-Inventory system is easier you haven't to manage your inventory like RE4,RE5 so waste time.-Life system is okay have two bar 1.Hitpoint 2.Stamina-When you fall you can stand up for yourself but warning for your 4 direction enemy.-Reduce some horror but you can play different style such as Leon-Survival horror,Chris-MMORPG-Online mode is well, play with freind is the best.Communications are enough for you to tell your partner-Ammo is too much that your remain ammo is more than 100 when clear all chapters.-DLC game mode is very fun but few people play(Why? TwT).Warning:The worst thing in RE6 is you can't pause a game.Hope you enjoy this game :) 9/10			"

The story is ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING the gameplay is simple and easy and over all alot of fun. Mercenaries is a fun mode for friends to just avoid the DLC.

												Resident evil 6,  was by the time of the original console release, a massive blunder thanks to a lot of problems within the game, such as terrible camera, too much focus on action, sloppy controls, bad level design and inbalanced difficulty. Now updated to fix some of those problems and with the benefits of being in pc....its still a letdown; but an interesting, entretaining one.The game has a massive amount of content: 4 different campaings, each one of 5 plus hours alongside with various difficulty levels, the now classic mercenaries mode, including all eight main characters along with an extra outfit, which changes their weapon setup and the flawled but interesting agent hunt, in which you go online and control the enemies other players fight during the campaing mode. However it feels obvious that there was not enough communication between the 600 hundred people(!) who worked in this game. During campaing mode (all of them) there is an obvious dissconect between the gameplay and the level design, for not mentioning the dissapointing musical score and the cheesy, hilariously over-the-top cinematics, full of bombastic action, unnecesary explosions and idiocy in general.Now to elaborate on the gameplay... its simply awesome. You have your standar 3rd person shoter fare and control settup, but with new features and actions, such as dedicated inputs for elaborated melee attacks, (there are over 8 different of them, for each character) counterattacks, quickshots, manual evassive inputs (No qtes) slides, and more. Mowing down hordes of undead was never this fun in this kind of games.However the level desing is against this awesomely tunned gameplay. Its constricted, dark and filled with corridors when in reality what you need are open spaces with lots of movility to enjoy all the actions you can do. There are times where entire leves are just a big, giant hallway with some dead ends and a good deal of ""cinematic cutscenes"" that makes playing through the campaing a total hassle, as if the stupid story and horrible character interaction was not bad enough....Im giving this game a possitive review in the end, just because of the Mercenaries minigame, in which you have to mow down hordes of enemies in limited time, scoring points for sucessive kills and dealing with lots of high level enemies IN OPEN SPACES, WITH LOTS OF OPTIONS, WEAPONS AND TACTICS TO USE. Its obvious that this game was made with high speed action shotouts in mind, but they ♥♥♥♥ed up hard with the level design and tone of the game...for gods sake the first thing you do in the game is to shot a zombified president of the US in the head; somehow the game still takes itself seriously after that right throught the end.Long story short: Recommended...for ten bucks or less, not 30 bucks, let alone 60			"

Choosing Leon/Helena story allows you to focus on more undead-kind foes, solving ancient riddles and defeating huge bosses. Choosing Jake/sherry story will focus you on trying to escaping threats and being hunted by a unkillable hunter. Choosing Chris/Piers story will focus more on B.O.W and army duties. Choosing ada story allows you fight unbelievable strong B.O.WsThere are also other kinds of gamemodes like: agent hunt, mercenaries and mercenaries no mercy. Agent hunt allows you to play as a undead/B.O.W against player controlled agents. Mercenaries allows you to fight against hordes of enemies. Your given a timer in that time try to kill as many foes as you can. The no mercy one is the same as the normal mercenaries game. But: more enemies, easier to kill the common ones and allows you to play as one of the left 4 dead 2 survivors andxalso fight against l4d2 special infected.This game has a cool melee, mission and skill system.

The whole story is told through playing each characters campaign. I honestly think they could have done a better job telling the story because at times I was confused. Your going have to play though the entire campaign to really piece the story together. Other than that the story wasn't anything special to really talk about . And like previous RE games the controls can be clunky and annoying on occasions.

												I just wanted to say that I do not recommend this game just purely on the lack of proper save points. Today I reloaded the game and I was so sure I had replayed the level; turns out I was put back almost 1 hour of gameplay because checkpoints aren't actual save points. I am sorry but for a single player game this is inexcusable. On to the game proper; the graphics are really quite poor for a game released not that long ago. I mean the textures look like they were from RE4 in places. The inventory, whilst simplified looks horrendous compared to the old RE5 box. The gameplay is virtually identical to previous games but the issue is that the pistols still do not sound right (like pea shooter) and don't have much ""weight"" in a shot. Resident Evil should be about survival and I really would prefer there was less ammo but my bullet does more damage.			"

I see this as a very descent game to play with a friend.			"

												President Evil 6 / Big O Hazard takes place exactly three years after Obamacare was set in motion and caused the entire world economy to collapse. Zombies and juggalos take over the world or something along the way. You play as four sets of heroes from various classic Konami franchises, such as the reanimated corpse of Leon F Kennedy from Call of Duty: Black Ops, Chris Rumsfeld from NBC's The Office, Jake Bueller from inFAMOUS and Ada Dong from the hostess sections of Tongue of the Fat Man.The game was made with Silicon Graphics Computers™, the same technology that brought you Donkey Kong Country and all of the wonders of The Mask. This game is a BLAST, but then again, it's not so great either. Some will like it, some will not, who can tell?Resident Evil 6 is the game of the week.			"

												RE6 was mostly savaged by users and critics when it came out, but when I played it, I found a game that while not having much of a focus, gameplay wise, it's a game that is goofy and fun and wants you to have a good time. if you are open to some jankiness in your games, pick this up!

												This game is difficult to recommend. Where on one hand, it has a fun, overly complicated, Resident Evil storyline, they completely reworked the combat so it just doesn't feel like a RE game anymore. I Found myself wondering if I was at an arcade with a plastic gun in my hand, not at home in the dark wondering where a box of ammo is an what scary thing I won't be able to fight is around the corner. Another major issue I have is you cannot pause the game. It is 100% design for co-op so the game is ""live"" at all times, even when messing with options. This makes optimization difficult, or taking a break, because there is always something around that wants to kill you. I haven't put as many hours as I want to because playing feels like an awkward chore. I just want to experience the story but just can't bring myself to make it through. "

Combat is very polished, the game offers a varried and highly satasfying selection of difficulties and there is a LOT of content on display here.I do enjoy classical Resident Evil, and this isn't it, this is a straight up corridor action game with a lot of co-op mechanics, good combat and a story that NEVER attempts to take itself seriously unlike the current landscape of overwrought ""feels"" titles.If you liked RE5, paticularly in co-op, and you feel like you'd want that but faster, flashier, smoother and even goofier, then check it out.

While this isn't exactly a bad game, it just seems to be missing something.. and it also happens to be the only game in the series that I have not finished. I completed just one of the campaigns and feel like the game just doesn't have anything else to offer. There just aren't a lot of ""resident evil"" moments to be had here..   I liked RE5.. and played through more than once.. I loved RE4.. and logged countless hours... I would still be playing if I hadn't lost the disc..

												In early 1996 the original Resident Evil was released and PlayStation 1 players could play what would become one of the unquestioned kings of horror-survival games.  The games have evolved and change over the years and now the sixth installment of Resident Evil brings back the continued story of the terrible biological experiments conducted by the Umbrella corporation.The Good: This game had some of the least painful network I've ever used.  Simply invite a friend from your steam list and off you go!  The graphics for this game are also absolutely exceptional.  Only water looks a little off and even then it is not by much.  A movie done with this games engine would be easy to watch and still be immersed.The Bad:  Absolutely Phorking Every-Gord-Dammed-Thing Else!  Resident Evil 6 is the sad, discouraging, despicable end to a wonderful series that will leave a horrible taste in your mouth and keep you wondering how this series could have gone so wrong.  This game has no redeeming qualities other than some clean networking and graphics and, let's face it ""good graphics"" only mean anything for the first 1-2 years after release at best.  The frustrating and slow, maladroit player controls, the labyrinthian and discouragingly non-intuitive UI, the ""thanks-for-that-one-captain-obvious"" dialog from start to finish, the excruciating predictability, the painfully relentless stream of cliches and the unentertaining grind of fighting the basic monsters make this game much more of a chore than a game.  I was stunned when I started playing RE6, I thought to myself, ""this MUST be a joke, this is SO BAD nobody could have possibly actually though that anyone would play this game and say to themselves 'hey, we've got a solid game here!' but no, it is actually this bad.  The engine for this games feels like your character is extremely dizzy and running through waist deep water, QTE's (which is a whole separate rant I will spare you) absolutely ruin any form of immersion the game could have had.  I am not kidding when I say that there are no redeeming qualities to this game.  The only way I was able to stomach the few hours I lost to this game had nothing to do with the game itself but rather the fact that I had a great co-op buddy to endure this game with.  We were like Tom Servo and Crow from Mystery Science Theater 3000 and made fun of each and every dissapointment this game threw at us.  Much like someone bleeding to death that is telling jokes to stay conscious, humor was the only way we made it to the end of one of the campaigns in this game.  For the love of all that is good and holy DO NOT BUY RESIDENT EVIL 6!  THIS IS A TERRIBLE GAME!  Care to read more about how unbearably bad this game is?  Read Jim Sterling's review on Destructoid, after reading what he had to say and after enduring (not playing or enjoying but enduring) this game for 14 LONG! hours I can honestly say his review is 100% spot on!  (http://www.destructoid.com/review-resident-evil-6-235326.phtml)The Funny:  If you are the kind of person who can laugh at horrible jokes AND if you have never played a Resident Evil game before then you will be able to laugh at how poorly the otherwise wonderful Resident Evil series will ends.  If I didn't like the series I'd laugh it off as the death of a fantastic series that was snuffed out just two years before it's 20th aniversary.  Since I did like the series however, I am dissapointed and angry that this tidal wave of frusteration is how Resident Evil goes out.  Imagine the worlds greatest pianist playing Beethoven's 9th symphony and right at the crescendo they stop playing, run over and slap you in the face, take a♥♥♥♥♥♥on your lap and then give you the finger as they run away screaming ... that's how it feels to like the Resident Evil series and then to have this game be released with the Resident Evil name undeservedly written across it's title screen.Summary: Seriousley fu(k QTEs, fu(k AAA titles using wonderful old series to turn a quick buck and fu(k who ever was responsible for this God-forsaken train wreck of a game.  If it had been a stand along game that we could all forget that would be one thing but it's not, it's a beloved 18 year old horror-thriller series!  It feels as if Brandon Sanderson replaced the end of the Wheel of Time with a picture of his nut sack (that's not an invitation Brandon, please don't do that and keep up the good work!).  I give Resident Evil 6 a 2 out of 10 and since I had a great co-op partner I give both of those points to us, not to Resident Evil 6, since we were the ones who made some tiny pittance of fun out of a game that offered not one iota of joy by itself.Summary: 2 out of 10			"

												I liked getting this game on a steam sale for pretty cheap with all the DLC as well since I love the franchise but this isn't a Resident Evil/Biohazard game. It's just not. RE6 is more like Die Hard starring Leon, Chris, Wesker's demon spawn and Ada. I'd say it's more like Left 4 Dead but those characters are literally in the game. There's always some Burning Semi-Truck that is running you over as soon as you finish doing whatever it was that the last one broke. If you like action shooters and it's on sale then go for it. But if you are thinking survival horror where running to conserve ammo or like puzzles where the solution isn't literally right beside the problem then this may not be the mindless shooter for you.P.S. RE6/BH6 is a poor fps now with the a bunch of the same action and not enough horror or (challenging) puzzles.P.P.S I can't wait for the remake of Resident Evil 2/Biohazard 2 that is being completely reworked!

												I imagine, when the game was being developed, some important person must have been walking around the studio yelling ""MORE CALL OF DUTY!  I WANT SNOWMOBILE CHASES!  I WANT A MOTORCYCLE CHASE WITH A FRIGGIN HELICOPTER COMING AT THE PLAYERS!  THEN, I WANT A PART IN THE GAME WHERE PLAYERS FIGHT A T-REX, FROM A HANG GLIDER!""  And everyone had to listen to him (except for the hang glider part).  It's just absurd.  	The movement and hand-to-hand combat system is fun as hell, but players may find it difficult to use when the game constantly flashes to tedious cut scenes or forces your camera angle to look at some minuet detail going on in the background.  These interruptions or hiccups in gameplay happen far too often; it was as if the developers were concerned that players might not catch the small details they inserted, so they force you to look at them, every time.  This insecure tactic hurts replay value as many will get tired of being forced to look at the same cosmetic event over and over.  	You want enjoyment out of this game?  Grit your teeth, play through the storyline, and unlock 'The Mercenaries' mini-game.  The mini-game is the only way you'll get to utilize any good aspects of this action game, unhindered (except, obviously, by the time-limit given).  Because, face it, there is no survival horror aspect in a game with tanks crashing into Chinese castles, helicopter fights, snowmobiles chased by avalanches, train riding, bus riding, hummers chasing sports cars, and a nu metal-monster, with mechanical arm, monkey-leaping form heli to heli(lol).  There just isn't.			"

												The alternating story lines of game allow certain varities that other survival horror lack or in this case ""dramatic horror"" by capcom. If you like the horror aspect the storyline of leon will prove much of a horror aproach closest to past RE games , while Chris's is mostly centered around action and if you want a bit of both then theres Jakes campaign. The gameplay mechanics of this game will please some and annoy others, for example the annoying and atrocious camera locks in some points of the game is VERY annoying coupled with the constant studdering whenever your in combat or in a chase sequence is very frustrating to deal with due to the fact that it will get you killed in the most stupiest ways ever. In the end I had mixed feelings to this installment of RE6 lacking any spirit of the past RE games in actual horror or true puzzles but is instead filled with redicious cliches, another is there  not being  much of a high replay value as in the Re. games in post game content besides skill upgrades. So if you are in it for resident evil and capcom (crapcom) this is the game for you.			"

												This game... I cannot express what a dissapointment it is other than saying that it is a disgrace to the Resident Evil genre. This is not even close to all the other RE games. Different gameplay (worse), poor storyline, poor, gameplay, pathetic camera, controls etc. The game doesn't incorporate the puzzles like other RE games. It has a strict course you need to follow, extremely stupid scenes that happen to ""spice things up"". It is so dark that you cannot see anything most of the time and the ""flashlight"" doesn't help at all. One of the worst games I have ever played and I regreat paying for it. DO NOT BUY!!!I would give it 2 of 5, and only because it is a RE game. Otheriwise I would rate it as 1. I will play it only because the story may be relevant to future RE games (which will hopefully be better, a lot better).			"

												EDIT:Through further research, I found out that the biggest reason people drive away from this game is because it doesn't follow the same genre aspect as the previous titles. The previous games in the series follow the survival horror genre, while both this and RE5 follow a more action/adventure road with horror aspects thrown into the mix, which lots of people didn't enjoy. Seein' as I haven't played any other Resident Evil titles, this wasn't as obvious to me.I may not be the fittest to write a review to this game. Reason is because I've played this and Resident Evil 5, and that's it. I know lots of people here have been around since RE4, and maybe even earlier than that! Eitherwho, this is my view of the game and I'm gonna explain what you should expect if you're interrested. I'm also gonna make some comparrisons towards RE5, and keep in mind that I've played through that game tens of hundrads of times(most damn literally) with the greatest of joy and I know how all of it's mechanics work. Somethin' else to keep in mind is that I'm more for the experience rather than nitpicking on some small details. ANYWAYS, LET'S GO!(I'll put a tl;dr at the end if you don't want to read this entire review)MODESThis game has several modes you can take on. Of course, there's the classical campaign, but it's divided into 4 different parts, each part is played by different characters. You can chose right of the bat which campaign to start with and which character to play, and durin' the gameplay, you will bump into the other campaign characters. How you play it and in which order is completely up to you. Somethin' else this game brings back is Mercenaries, the mode where endless hordes of zombies come and attack you, and your job is to fend em' off and gain points while keepin' the timer clockin'. There are more special modes such as Survivor, Onslaught and whatnot, but I haven't played those, mainly because they are DLC's that not many people own. Plus, I'm more of a solo guy, so that explains it.MECHANICSIf you've played Resident Evil 5, you will know what I'm talkin' aboot. The game is built around the combat techniques and loads of QTE's(which is a very bad thing for most, but not as much of a big deal for others, includin' me), and RE5 was no exception. To be exact, there were two buttons in RE5 specifically, one to ""use"" and pick up other objects, while the other one was for partner actions. Now these two buttons were used all the time as QTE's, where you had to press either one or both of them to survive. In this game however, they stepped it up quite a bit. By default, left mouse button does a simple melee attack, while right mouse button aims with the gun you're currently holdin'. Pressin' the left mouse button while aiming will then fire the gun. Space is used for sprint, as well as usin' some objects(jump over a gap, climb a ladder, etc. You will also perform these moves when already sprinting into em'). Regardin' QTE's, they are very situational and may cause severe rage inducing tendencies, so if you are easily affected by such, well, you were warned.There is also skills you can purchase, both for the campaign, mercenaries and the other modes, which are purchased with skill points, which you can get in pick ups, as well as earned when completin' mercenaries games. Some of the skills increase melee damage, firearm damage, more frequent specific ammo pick ups etc.Somethin' more to keep in mind immediatly is that you can walk around while aiming, which you couldn't do in RE5(You actually stood entirely still when aiming). One more thin' I wanna mention is that you can manually perform dodges and rolls whenever you want. For instance, if you press space bar while aiming, you will perform a quick duck. If you hold A and press space bar while aiming, you will perform a left barrel roll. Same goes for W, S and D. These are also set to the keys Z, X and C, however you can press them whenever without the need to aim in order to roll left 'n right or throw yourself on your back to avoid an attack. Also, you can perform some epic counter attacks(known as coup de grace) if you press the left mouse button just as an enemy attacks. This also applies to many actions in the game, makin' this game very fun to play!PC RELATED SETTINGS(how good the port is)I'm no stranger to stuff like this, cus' I wanna play PC games on my gaming rig rather than console ports, and I wanna be clear when I say that this game is most certianly(and luckily) NOT a console port! There are enough graphical settings you can change(textures, refresh rate, vsync, resolution etc. Pretty much everythin' you'd need), and everythin' in this game regardin' the mouse and keyboard controls can be changed(however there's no secondary controls). You can also enable a gamepad(however you'll need to do some editing in some game files to get the Playstation button prompts, cus' normally you get buttons like 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. Other settings such as your preferred position(camera left or right to the player), laser sight or reticle, laser sight color, camera position, FOV(both default and when aiming) and lots of other goodies are available.PROS+Great remappable controls(you don't even need to use some of the controls, such as Z to roll left, since you can use the method I explained earlier)+Characters from earlier Resident Evil games are playable+Mercenaries mode(No Mercy mercenaries are also available with L4D2 characters)+great PC port!+Satisfying combat+Overall optimization+quality of textures are great, however some elements could be improved.+Plenty of campaign difficulties, includin' ""No Hope"" that was added because many argued that ""Professional"" wasn't dificult enoughCONS-Situational QTE's which take some time gettin' used to(not to mention that some of em' are impossible to complete without dyin' by em' first)-A somewhat cheesy storyline+events(There are lots of parts of the story where somethin' happens that makes you go ""How the hell did he do that?!"" or ""That's just impossible"". A big action movie vibe if you ask me)-Playin' co-op will enable Steam's in-software microphone thingy, which has rather poor quality, not to mention a rather big delay(at least back when me and a friend played together, wahich was literally on day one when the game was out). This can fortunatly be disabled within Steam, so there's no need for tedious game file changin' to fix it-Somewhat lacking in gun customization, primarily because more focus in this subject went on to the skill system(more guns are found within the game, so no need to worry 'bout that)-There are lots of cutscenes, both short and long, that -could- ruin the immersion in gameplayNow, do I recommend this? I'm gonna say that I personally had loads of fun with this game! However, this is certianly not for everybody, and even the most dedicated of Resident Evil fans would dislike it. So wether I would recommend you to buy it or not is entirely up to you, but remember that the QTE's will haunt you...Thanks for reading my review!~Melee-Chan			"

												Junk.  (and my first really negative review - ever)If it's a horror story with environement you're into, find something else and if it's action - again, find something else.  This doesn't combine them decently and both sides are weak.  ""Time sink"" comes to mind on this thing with plenty of hunting around for ammo to fight.Without all the ammo issues it might be an entertaining action game but not how they chose to do it and we'll not go into the laughable ""horror"" side of this game.  The biggest horror you'll face is how you managed to waste the money to buy this thing.I seriously wonder at the ignorance of a game designer who enables an unlimited ammo mode but only *AFTER* players have beaten this game.  Players look to up their difficulty, not downgrade it for later play-throughs.  Bone-head dev stunt there.			"

												Pro:+ There's a co-op mode.+ Surprisingly playable with a controller.Con:- There're needlessly long cutscenes every few minutes in the game, which you cannot skip.- You can't even access the main menu without playing a 20 minutes long tutorial.- You can not pause the game. Never ever. You have a phone call? Restart from the last checkpoint and watch the cutscene again.- Ingame HUD popups (e.g. inventory, menu) have different keys for closing them. If you accidentally open one, you have to search for the correct key to close it and continue the game. While you're being attacked, of course.- You can't attack bodies that lay around. Not until they start attacking you after you walked past them.- You can't explore the maps, there's only one path from point A to point B that you must walk, and there's no chance to walk  up to any other door or corridor.

												I had many doubts going in. It was a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥show rating wise when it came out for consoles, and I made sure I avoided it. So when it popped in a steam sale recently, I thought what have I got to lose, and I have a PC that can handle it. And I'm very glad I did.The positives first:  RE6 is  a good looking game. If your machine can handle it, crank up the graphics settings. Rain glistens off the characters as it falls, hair and clothes rustle in the breeze, and of particular note, the enemies are truly vile and horrifically disgusting, and I mean that a high complement. The spider-like enemies in particular always made me lean back from my monitor whenever they showed up, from their creepy scamper to the thick hairs growing off their bodies.There's an over-arching story broken into 4 campaigns, with the occasional crossover with the other protagonists at certain points. The individual campaigns play very much like a greatest hits package of previous RE games styles. Leon’s campaign is like a retelling of RE4, from the cathedral setting down to the Ganado-like enemies. Chris's campaign is more like RE5, heavy on the action and broad daylight set pieces in a urban/military environments, and Jake's campaign is more like RE3 as him and Sherry are chased by the Nemesis equivalent UsterNakk (sp?). The last campaign of Ada Wong weaves its way through the previous 3 three explaining her presence in each, along with her own motivations. Each campaign has 5 chapters that take ~1 hour complete, so 5 one hour chapters per campaign x 4 campaigns is a pretty hefty 20hrs of action content. It’s all playable co-op too, and the AI holds its own. It also can't die, so you don't have to baby sit if you are playing solo (like I did). There’s certainly not a lack of things to take on. The story took lot of flack when it came out, but frankly, resident evils' plots have always been pretty ludicrous. At the end of the day, you are there primarily there to blow away zombies and all manner of disgusting bio-freaks, which the game serves up in droves. What probably threw people off is that the story doesn't unfold linearly and jumps all over the place as you complete each campaign. You can pick each campaign chapter and there are lists online of an order in which to play the chapters to get the story as is unfolds chronologically, but frankly i think that's unnecessary as it’s not that complex. It can suffer from pacing issues but you are thrown in some pretty large scale set pieces at least once per chapter so the slower parts are basically quiet before some zombie♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. Plenty of difficulty levels depending on the level of masochistic pleasure you desire. Overall, lots of replay value.Once you learn the controls (an issue which I’ll touch upon later) You will realize they have made some much needed (and appreciated by me) changes to how the game plays. Characters are no longer tanks, turning laboriously left and right. There are standing dodges, back, forward and side rolls, and a first for me, laying prone is actually a useful and viable strategy (it recovers stamina very quickly). All the moves are very well animated too. Also, there is now a dedicated melee button, which is long overdue, and makes it easier when you run out of ammo and are surrounded. Its balanced by each melee attack consuming stamina, and when you use it all you have an exhaustion period during which you can't melee at all. The new additions truly shine in mercenaries mode, which arguably stole the show for me. The now standard score attack kill zombies for time mode is surprisingly addictive. the new melee and movement options really benefit the fast paced gameplay, and you will find yourself getting hype off of some John woo acrobatics that you engage in, pulling off a satisfying headshot, then physically countering an enemy trying to cheap shot you, and finishing them off  with a stylish quick shot. Very, very satisfying and just-one-more-round inducing (also I did them all solo, Co-op would be an even bigger blast as it does get hectic). Score an A rank or higher and you'll unlock a pretty funky alternate costume for that specific character, along with a remixed weapons loadout. Another benefit I didn't realize was that Capcom and valve did a PC exclusive left 4 dead 2 crossover with the characters of L4D2 appearing in mercenaries mode. Not only are the characters fully voiced, but their levels throw absolutely insane numbers of monsters at you at once. There are some multiplayer options, but these can easily be avoided, as the active online community is long dead and you can save a couple of bucks by not opting to purchase them with the rest of the game. Of course there is the other side of all this positivity. RE6's biggest issue is how poorly it conveys necessary information. The game tells you how to move and shoot, but that's about it. Nowhere, not even in an in game resource of some kind does it explain how to dodge, or other critical actions like quick shots and character specific quick shot combos. These is particularly baffling as several of the characters have character specific moves, like Jake's hand to hand combat and Leon/Helena's crowd control shooting maneuvers, which come in extremely handy. Fortunately there is an excellent ultimate survival guide on the steam forums which details all these things, but without that I doubt i would have stuck around for even a third of the game (which i'm sure many people didn't, which is a shame). Another valid complaint is that the default camera is much to close to the player. Makes for great screenshots, but also allows monsters to sneak up on you and get a cheap shot from behind in. The fix for this is adjusting a slider, but that option is obtusely buried in the game's title screen settings, Easily fixable, but again, i wouldn't know that unless I googled the issue. The last irritant i had was that the game suffers from the dreaded Bosses-that die-but-not-really syndrome. You fight and put down so mighty impressive creatures, only to quickly realize that you'll fight the same creature again in another similar 10 mins later, except slightly remixed (the second time in a confined space instead of an arena for example). It robs the encounters of any real weight, as you never feel like you accomplished anything, as they are back lickedy split minutes later with no sense of damage that they supposedly received.But overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by how fun the game is. The campaigns chapters’ each have a how-can-they-top-the-last-encounter.feel, and you are guaranteed some sort of final epic boss encounter for each one. I would run through them again with a friend who was willing, but I'm glad I at least finished them each solo. The real draw will be mercenaries mode.  "

												I regret buying this.  My initial assessment was that it seemed pretty good.  The gameplay quickly degrades however.  It seems like this game is trying to emulate games from the COD or Gears of War franchises.  This could be ok if it didn't seem like actual gameplay was an afterthought.  It's as if they designed these set pieces or scenarios and then thought about how to shovel in gameplay afterward.  The first realization of this was in the gun shop scene: WE ARE IN A GUN SHOP WHERE IS THE AMMO?!   I'd assume the owner wouldn't be so stingy because it's a zombie apocalypse, but perhaps I assume too much.Ok, then aftewards Leon and Helena are on a bus where a big fat zombie is holding up the front tires so they can't get away.  They have to survive other zombies' attacks, while trying to emtpy enough rounds into the big one's head through the front window.  Zombies come into the bus, they melee them, they shoot the bus lifter, rinse, repeat.  It takes too long to get enough ammo to do this.  I'm ok with making a game challenging via ammo crunch, but this just breaks the tension and gets BORING.  Not to mention our big uberbadass Leon has a fatigue gauge where he can't kick a zombie if it runs out.  When we're surrounded by very dumb NPCs (who don't shoot the ranged spitter zombies) and trying to survive by doing super badass moves (more on that later) it was very frustrating to have this happen.  Game to player: give zombies running bulldogs and sweet roundhouse kicks!  Player:  Ok sure!! Game:  Oh wait we gotta be like all realistic and like the other big blockbuster games, so nm hobble around.  Oh also player, you can't keep like a shovel or 2 by 4 these guys try to attack you with to attack them back.. cuz like, we wanna kinda also be like old arcade games.  We'll just keep the worst of both worlds to make it frustrating.  Player: Damn this kind of sucks I hope the next encounter doesn't suck like this.So that gets done and it gets to the cathedral.  This was like in Wolverine Origin when they get to the island.  The game is cruising along, not good, not bad, and then the wheels just fall right off.  First off, this church has security statues with laser guided crossbows.  I'm assuming it's some kind of facility b/c of what happened next... so why would they have an odd, inneffective security system of this style, instead of some kind of modern sentry turret, or ya know, a locked door.  So that part is also really dumb.  Then there's the boss fight where a zombie will pick up Leon and tentacle♥♥♥♥♥♥his face if you press buttons wrong.  This was the last straw for me.  I get that in games, especially horror games, your character will meet a grisly fate if you mess up.  The scene was just so gratuitously revolting.  It must have been included solely for a gross out, I guess.  Well I don't play games to be grossed out.  Again, shouldn't the gameplay be on the forefront of the designer's mind?  There was quickly a draught of ammo and melee did completely nothing to this boss while NPCs shot at nothing with their guns that apparently had infinite ammo.  Oh wait this boss also spews gas which turns people into zombies but Leon and Helena aren't affected, they can just stab each other in the heart with a syringe and then take herbs like mints and are fine.So in a comparative summary:Resident Evil 4 was 90 percent great and 10 percent manure (button mashing sequences and the block sliding puzzle should have been editted out on the re-release)Resident Evil 5 is a little more on the manure side but that's still far outweighted by the good parts of game,  It has button mashing, but during one, the main character punches a boulder out of the way because he's just so damn jacked.Resident Evil 6 starts off pretty good but quickly becomes a chore, but might appeal to those who value images of homesexual♥♥♥♥♥♥in a game over decent gameplay.

												Don't let its title fool you: Resident Evil 6 is not a survival horror game, but action-shooter.If you seek to enjoy titles similar to Resident Evil 1 and Resident Evil 4, then, this game is not for you. Resident Evil 6 is more like a World War II game, more, or less.Cons/Pros of the title:Pros:+ Great character depth and realistic personalities (Piers Nivans, Helena Harper, etc).+ Four major campaigns (Leon's, Chris's, Jake's, and Ada's) with 5 chapters each.+ Multiple Protagonists (over 7) for you to play, across these 4 different campaigns.+ Partner system, like in Resident Evil 5, with the only difference that the partner in Resident Evil 6 has infinite ammo and infinite health if controlled by the AI. (Thankfully! No more notorious AI Partner deaths!)+ Huge variety of enemies and bosses - From the classic zombies to the J'avo. (J'avo are infected humans, similar to the Las Plagas from RE4 and can carry weapons and feature many mutations)+ Each of the 4 major campaign offers different atmosphere / theme:++ Leon's campaign has the dark classic theme - contains zombies, dark corridors and is closest to Resident Evil 1 and 2.++ Chris's campaign has the World-War-style acton shooting theme - the most ""american"" of all 4 campaigns, and is close to Resident Evil 5 in terms of action and shooting.++ Jake's campaign has the Tyrant theme. You are being chased by a Tyrant-type of monster like in Resident Evil 3.++ Ada's campaign... well, for this one... I leave this to you to see what it is all about.+ Character/Story crossovers - during the story you meet some of the other protagonists, controlled by others or the AI.+ Skill system, that allows you to influence various aspects of the gameplay.+ Different graphical UI styles for the inventory and menus. Each of the 4 campaigns will have different visual UI style, as if you are playing a completely different game.+ Herbs and ammo boxes are here like usual! Lets refresh our memory. 1 Green Herb + 1 Red Herb, what does it do? :)+ Melee combat moves / Extended combat system for certain characters.+ Dashing and running system.+ Excellent Dodge system. With proper timing, you can dodge almost any enemy/boss attack in the game, if done right. This allows you to leave the battleS unscratched!+ Each of the 7 protagonists have their signature weapons and moves which others cannot obtain/learn. Ada for example has her trademark weapon, the famous crossbow, when Sherry has her unique Stun Rod and Jake is skilled in the Martial Arts and can deliver great blows with his bare hands, etc.Cons:- Your weapons and firearms cannot be customized, upgraded or improved. The ability of upgrading your gun stats, from Resident Evil 2, 4 and 5, has been removed completely from Resident Evil 6. This means, with simple words, that, whatever weapons you may have, will stay the same forever. - Camera is your biggest enemy. Causes troubles at times, especially when you need it to stay on your character's back but it doesn't. Super annoying!- During cutscenes, the player's character can die. When a cutscene plays, your character will stay frozen solid, but the enemies will not. This means, if it happens there to be enemies nearby when a cutscene triggers, they can (and will) attack your character and kill him! And, no, it is not possible to defend your character from these hostile attacks, as you will have to wait for the entire cutscene to finish playing (!) and then for the camera to return back to its position over the character's shoulder (!) before you can resume control of your character. And if you see the Game Over screen after the cutscene, it means your character got killed and that you will have to start all over again... How shameful of Capcom's part to let a such oversight in a modern-day videogame like Resident Evil 6 to happen. Trully shameful. The Game Over screens right after cutscenes shows how poor job Capcom has done with Resident Evil 6.- Most cutscenes can be skipped, but there is a good amount of them that cannot be skipped at all when the appropriate button is pressed.- Way too many Quick Time Events. At least x10 times more QTEs than in Resident Evil 4.- The game is trying hard to impress the player by adopting a Hollywood-style gaming  experience, at the expense of the player's own joy and comfort. Too many explosions and destruction in the surroundings, (such as cars blowing off, etc), can get repetitive and boring... And the camera leaves your character's shoulder way too often...- AI is very stupid and poorly written. Enemies could come for you, pass by you, and then forget about you,- Your partner has ""body mass"" and thus, you cant walk through him. This often leads in him blocking your path, especially in narrow areas and corridors. The problem here is that, due to the stupidity of the AI, he wont realize that he is blocking you from passing through a door, and thus, he won't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about that. For example If you want to pass through a narrow door (narrow = wide enough for just only 1 person to pass through it) and it happens that your partner is standing in the middle of that narrow door, you wont be able to pass, well, at least not right away... So, if you are in the middle of a gunfight and you want to get past a door for cover from hostile fire, your AI partner may prevent you from doing so, and thus, increasing the risk of you dying or getting hurt, especially on the higher difficulties...- The Cover system (Cover = taking shelter behind obstacles such as fences, corners and walls to protect yourself from enemy fire) could have been better... You enter into Cover Mode even when you don't want it, all just because Capcom decided that it was very practical to have the button for the Take Cover to be merged with the button for Weapon Aiming! Yes, you read right: if you hold the Aim button to shoot at an enemy with your firearm, but your character position happens to be near a corner, a crate, a fence or an wall, you will, instead of aiming + shooting, go into Cover Mode even if this was not your intention... how frustating! Capcom, you screwed it...- The game's story spans 3 continents (America, Europe, Asia), but it lacks any depth. It could have been better.- Your partner, when he is controlled by the AI, will rarely use the dash ability unless it is scripted to do so. This can be a problem, especially if you are seeking to get good timing scores / planning to do a speedrun in  chapters that feature very long corridors and paths.- Graphics could have been better. The game allows you to visit many different places, such as cities, mountains, ships, etc, but the graphics in some of these places feel really outdated...- It is not a survival horror title, despite its name. It is an action shooter title. It seems that Capcom took Resident Evil 5 and added a tons more unecessary action to its successor, distancing Resident Evil 6 even further from the series's successful and memorable roots.- No costumes or extra weapons unlocked once you beat the game.Capcom has utterly failed all my expectations for this game. Story is poor, no gun upgrades besides using skills, etc... But, at least, it got some funny steam achievements. And as a true Resident Evil fan and an Achievement completionist, I cant help but play this game for at least 400 not-so-entertaining hours. But once all the 50 Single Player Mode achievements are unlocked, I am gonna uninstall the game. And I mean it. The game is having problems and it isnt really worth of taking disk space in your computer if what you seek is to enjoy and experience a true successor of Resident Evil 1 or Resident Evil 4... Lets pray that Capcom wont repeat the same mistakes with the upcoming Resident Evil 7 title. We can hope that the Resident Evil Revelations or the Resident Evil 4 will be used by Capcom as examples on how to make a true AAA Resident Evil game title... We can hope at least... After all, hope dies last.			"

												Only ~30 minutes in, so this is not an entirely objective review, but the controls are sooooo clunky I can't play any more, and I don't mean the input implementation, I mean the direction of it - taking away control, scripted switching from running to walking, camera control that tries to build up scripted events for better effect but is just a huge immersion breaker. The sheer number of design mistakes here is just awful, and I don't even mean the story, only the feel and controls of the game. Will not play again.			"

												I can't recommend the campaigns at all, they're a complete mess, even if some of the individual chapters are good. However, I can't recommend Mercenaries mode ENOUGH. It's that damn amazing. Easily the best Third Person Shooter since Vanquish. 60 FPS and No Mercy mode make the PC version the definitve one.			"

												(Wish there was a nuetral opinon not thumbs up or down :/)Have you ever drove a bus over top of a land whale and then balanced it on a cliff then get hit by a semi somehow and fall about 60ft while at the same time shooting zombies laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off because this game is blowing your mind with how ridiculous it is? Then at the bottom the bus explodes but somehow you and your friend crawl out and the only injury is being slightly out of breath. Well in this game you can experience that. This is not really a true Resident Evil game. In fact its so far from it that I dont even know how to classify it. I guess it would be a Survival Action game? I dont know.This game tried to be different and did great with being different but failed at the most basic level of making an interesting game. Sure Resident Evil 5 wasnt really a ""horror"" game but at least it made an attempt, with this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥you have Leon ♥♥♥♥ing R'KOing zombies over chairs and♥♥♥♥♥♥ It so over the top and doesnt make any sense about 99% of the time. Operation Racoon City had a more coherent story than this game which is sad because it was a spin-off that is considered non-canon. This game is not really fun per-se but its funny if you're playing with a friend that hates it as much as you do. You and your friend can play through the campaigns and make fun of all the crazy cutscenes that dont make any sense. Im just gonna list some pros and cons becasue I cant even find words to describe my experience anymore.Pros- -Fantastic Optimization-Okay-ish controls-Will definetly make you laugh-""Good"" Co-op experience-Best version of mercenaries out of any of the gameCons--Story is garbage-Everything is just so over the top-Each Campaign is very short (Which i guess makes sense but eh)-Some textures are very noticeably bad and out of place-Not fun solo-ZERO replay value-No weapon upgrades-No treasures-Lame puzzles-Never in danger-Always have ammo-Never enough healing items due to them all being ammoI guess if you can find this game on sale for like $10 or something (I got mine from Humble Bundle) Then its worth it if you have a friend to play with but if you're an experienced Resident Evil fan thats looking for more I'd say skip this one and pick up Revelations or maybe even the Zero remake			"

												very entertaining, Well executed, nice graphics and a fun campaign mode. However, controlling the characters with the keyboard, could be a mess...Use a gamepad/joystick for Windows. Exactly what you expect from Resident Evil , I must say that I love this game. I love the addition of four stories instead of the usual one story with three difficulties. Like RE5, there is a co-op option, which I do take advantage of, since AI's are useless in every way aside from healing you. There is more to try to achieve with this game, unlike the others. You can track your unlocked files, achievements and game progress. Each campaign has an interlocked story, but they each have different overall skill usage. Leon's campaign is more defense, since you can stay safe in most all boss battles by just keeping distance of rolling on the ground. Jake's campaign is more melee, since there are parts of the game that you can only use Sherry's stun rod and Jake's hands to fight, they also don't give you a lot of ammo in this campaign. Chris is more firearm attacks, since they give you enemy after enemy that can't be taken down easily and they give you enough bullets that you'll have to shoot to make noise to keep room in your inventory. Ada's is mainly puzzles and quick thinking, since a few parts of the game are a race against time, and if you so much as run into a wall for too long of a second, you die. This was an excellent addition to the game, so it doesn't feel like the chapters and campaigns all run together. All over, this was a very great purchase. The game is a clean and easy install with no patches required for full function. The graphics are amazing. I have this on a Windows 7 x64 system .			"

												★ = Poor★★ = Fair★★★ = Good★★★★ = Nice★★★★★ = Awesome ✔Heard quite a lot of bad reviews for this game. Don't see why is it so bad. Is it because you can't kick noob players? Your Campaign story suddenly turn into a versus game? First of all, why are you even playing it with strangers? If you don't want to play it with strangers, why not disable the co-op option in the first place?Sudden unwanted Agent Hunt invasion? Why did you even enable Agent Hunt when you don't want it?I know Resident Evil changed a lot, it's not like what it used to be, it's becoming more of an action game. But I don't really care whether it's an action game or a horror survival game, I'm here for the storyline and I really like it a lot.I like how the loss of accuracy after aiming for too long or firing a shot.No weapon upgrades anymore meaning no more overpowered weapons.No more annoying cut scene QTEs.Four different Campaign with unique storyline which are linked to each other.Playable infected characters.Ability to perform melee attacks and dodges with free will.Ability to move around while aiming.For those who don't like it, I have to say this is not the game for you and I really feel sorry for you to have wasted your parent's money.

												Resident Evil 6 is a very complex game. It took almost 100 hours for me to get use to controls. The game itself is very replayable, fits perfectly for people like me, but if you are the type who likes to complete the whole game in 15-20 hours, you will be bored quickly. In previous series I was disappointed about the fact, that you cannot punch nearby zombies. So far this is the only game in the series where you can initiate physical attacks without having to daze the enemy first. I only hate that every character has his own weapons, but even this can be fixed, if you know how ;)Mercenaries brought tons of fun to me. Bad thing is that extra skins for each character are terrible.I didn't expect any good game to come out since Left 4 Dead with good versus mode. But RE6 is another one like this. Too bad Capcom are too busy or lazy to fix some bugs like rapid fire from shotguns and sniper rifles which are used by some pubs. In private lobbies it's funny to play using melee only, like Chris vs. Wesker (reskined Jake). Me and my friend done it a couple of times.In conclusion I'd like to say that I got complete pack for the full price and I don't regret it. 10/10. Good job, Capcom.			"

												I really enjoyed this game so far because of the story and I hope you do as well.Here is some Pro's and Con's for you, and this is how the game worked so far for me, some friends have gave me feedback on there gameplay as well.This game is mostly Combat wise and best played with a friend during Co-op Modes.Pro's: Good Graphic's.Good FPS.Fast loading screens unless you play online with 6 people then it will take a while.Fast action.4 Campaign's.Lots of guns.Con's: Not much of a Horror game but its still fun too play.If you have Windows 10( just so you know I use Windows 10) just make sure you have good specs on your Computer.And if you don't have good specs then don't get the game.Because you will lag like heck or the game may not run on start up.

												The four campaigns are full of awful scripted events that serve no purpose other than show Capcom desperately trying to appeal to the Call of Duty crowd. The tutorial is also atrocious and doesn't tell you how to play at all. Did you know you could roll? Did you know staying prone regenerates your stamina faster? Did you know you can counter all enemy melee attacks if you press the melee button at the right time? Did you did you did you did you well now you know.HOWEVER, the combat system is surprisingly quite deep and it's worth buying if you want a game that's an excellent mix between a shooter and a brawler. Buy it for u$30 or less, play through the acceptable 15 hour long campaign and sink a million hours into the Arena mode like I have.			"

												There are a lot of games that I wouldn't recommend playing on their own, but would recommend playing with friends. Left 4 Dead is one of these games. Resident Evil 5 is one of these games. Dead Space 3 is one of these games. Even Daikatana, despite what many believe, is one of these games. You'll notice that there's a trend in these games, in that each one is worse than the last.You'll also notice that Resident Evil 6 is not on the list at all.Resident Evil 6 is a game that includes 4 campaigns, starring Leon, Chris, newcomer Jake, and the formerly secret Ada campaign. These campaigns total to around 30 hours in gameplay, with each of the first 3 campaigns being nearly as long as Resident Evil 5. You may think ""Wow, what a bargain!"", but you're missing one key component: almost none of it is worth playing. The game takes a severe quantity over quality stance, and even when the campaigns aren't directly overlapping (which is a feature, in which you might've been able to play with other people playing different campaigns in 4-player co-op at certain points if anybody was still around to actually play this game) you'll probably feel like you're just playing the same campaign over and over. Resident Evil 6 isn't a survival horror game, but it's not an action shooter either; it's just a third person shooter with really awful, gimped controls that are only worse when brought over to the PC. The only parts of the game that are even slightly redeemable are Leon's first chapter, which is about an hour long (some people will tell you that all of Leon's campaign is good, but those people are liars - all of Leon's personality and charm has been drained and given to Jake, instead) Jake's campaign, which is the only portion of the game that I would consider actually slightly worth playing at all, and the Mercenaries mode, which is as fun as ever. The story is a convoluted mess that puts literally anything in a series full of convoluted twists to shame, to the point that it makes Wesker suddenly returning with superpowers seem like a natural character development that was planned from the start. Resident Evil 6 is, as a whole, just an absolute mess. A disaster. A waste of time, effort, and money. It feels like Capcom just got together 1,000 people and said ""hey, make a video game"" and let them each try to decide what horror is, and while Jake's campaign has an extremely noticeable increase in interesting locations and mechanics, the game as a whole just feels like a mess of ideas that don't go together at all and overall leaves the game feeling bland and mass-produced, and it's just not worth it. Even if you do play with a friend it's barely worth it, since it's not even good enough to play for the sake of laughing at since after more than an hour or two of 3 of the 4 campaigns your soul will have been stripped of the concept of laughter. Ada's campaign is bafflingly not even built for co-op in a game that spends 25 hours reminding you that co-op exists, and if you do happen to drag some poor soul into the game with you they get stuck playing as ""Agent"", a character with no dialogue, no background, no cutscene presence, and no physical prescence - he can shoot enemies, and that's about the extent, since he can't open doors, solve puzzles, pull levers, or generally do anything except get carted through the levels by teleportation whenever Ada uses her grappling hook.I can't even begin to recommend this game to anyone. There are some games that I hate that I can understand other people liking, but I have yet to see any sort of defense of Resident Evil 6 that didn't absolutely baffle me. For $30, you could buy Resident Evil 6, but $30 also buys you a ton of bleach that you could drink and have a way better time.			"

												Not much of a horror game but it is much fast-paced action movie game squeal then the other Resident Evil games. Co-op experience is also good but sometime it will lag maybe because of distance lag or whatever and also you can join in some other people's game for Co-op. There is some camera, controls and bug issues for example I have to be at that specific place to trigger the event and etc. Out of 10 ratings, I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10 ratings, it's a ok game that is not so bad or good, the game kinda lost the oldschool Resident Evil and have changed to a Action Squeal game. But it's still ok for Capcom to try something new once awhile so I'm gonna let it pass for now. Hopefully next game will not be too much of a disapointment. If you guys are looking for a oldschool Resident Evil games then should not pick this game because it's a action squeal game but it's recommend for newcomers.			"

												Resident evil 6 is a very good third person shooter game. i can tell you its definitly not a generic shooter game. killing the enemies does not get boring very quickly and the levels are everything but forgetable unlike actual generic shooter games. the game of course does have its negative aspects like the most obvious one, its not a horror game . the lack of weapon costumisation, changing and upgrading can be very annoying sometimes. there arent much of boss battles like previous resident evil games. and the camera can be very klaustrophobic sometimes. but i PERSONNALY think the removage of the tank controlls is a god gift. the ability to melee, counter, dodge, walk whule aiming, dashing at any time is more then just helpfull.the amount of enemies is also very neat. there is a huge amount of differences in enemies from the normal classic zombies. tougher zombies bloodshots (wich are waay to easy to counter BTW) to the new kind of enemies like ganados wich appeared the first time in RE4 also known as j'avo and their very many different mutations. every different enemies needs a different way to kill it wich is like a minigame for each one.the story is a little luckluster. since its pretty much just some rich snob wants to F*ck ada.but the story can be ignored because its not getting shoved down your throw like other game wich i want name here. i dont like the inventory system of this game. i think RE4 & RE5 did a much better modern inventory. i really dont like the fact that you can have all weapons at once. not choose wich ones you want like older RE games.but yeah in overall. this game is not perfect and oh boy how it sucks for being a resident evil game. but its alot i mean ALOT of fun. with a very high replay value. i recommend it to everyone who likes TPS or atleast loves the resi characters.its not even close as good as RE6. but it IS better then RE5. good game. not perfect. but good			"

I would recommend this to people that just want to have fun smashing in zombie heads, and if you have a friend then go ahead and smash them together, but don't compare it to the other games as it really doesn't fit in with the style, it's a blast in its own way.

												Resident Evil 6 is the latest intallment to the series. The first time I played RE6 I thought, wow, this game feels allot different then the other RE games, like the combat, camera angles, and story telling; Even though the game is different from the rest, that doesn't mean that the game is better; Change is not always a good thing.Combat: The devs wanted to make a game that was more fast pace, and more appealing to new players in RE6; But by doing that they took away so much of what made the games so great. Resident Evil 6 feels more like an action game then a survival game now. one of the reasons the other games are so great is because of the combat system, you really had to think about what you were doing, and you conserve lots of ammo, and strategize allot, about where to shoot them, and what zombies to kill. But in RE6 the combat is way to easy, you can go in, run and gun with no consequence's at all.Camera Angles: I can safely say that, the camera angles in RE6...SUCK! The angles of the camera is centered on the screen, and the guy is way too close to the screen; It is really heard to see around the guy. The only time you can really see good is if you ADS then the camera will center over the guys soldier, like the other resident evil games.Story Telling: In past games there were one story in the game, but in RE6 there are 4 story's! And all the story's feel like they were half♥♥♥♥♥d. The only good campaign was Leon's Story, all the other stories had some cool sequences, but with out any spoilers, Leon's Campaign had the most going for it.The Verdic: I did enjoy playing Leon's campaign but all the other campaigns felt extremely half♥♥♥♥♥d. The camera angles were extremely annoying in places, and the combat was way too fast paced. The only game mode that is really good with the combat system is the Mercenaries, especially the No Mercy Mercenaries.Well I just gave you my honest opinion about the game.I hope this review helpes you decide.This is Death Wish Signing off.

I can see why people are so upset with this game i feel they just tried to add to much and try to many different things at once and in the end was to over the top for a RE game but once you can overlook certain aspects about the game it will offer you ALOT of fun and enjoyment. and one last note aobut the QTE's they are no where near as bad as i thoguht they were going to be, the only time they♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was when a zombie gets to close to you and instantly throws you into a QTE that♥♥♥♥♥♥pissed me off ALOT			"

												Ok so lets get the Elephant in the room out of the way...Alot of reviews have said `Well its not Resldent Evil really is it...`. Well that is utter tripe. It is a logical continuation of the RE  franchise.Sure it isn't classic Survival Horror but that has been done countless times in the series and things need to move on. I for one would not want another game stuck with the frankly horrid and awkward controls we have been saddled with since RE:1. People do not rotate on the spot, neither are they incabable of walking and shooting and it's about time that convention died a sad and lonely death.This is a good game and has plenty of old and new characters meeting across intersecting story lines. So far I have played Ada's campaign and had a blast. There are plenty of secrets to find, icky things to shoot and the odd classic `makes zero sense` puzzle thrown in.There is a ton of Co-op, Versus and Online action to be had across the various DLC packs and plenty of replay value. That is the pros out of the way, sadly there are a few cons you should be aware of:There are more Quicktime events than in the Tomb Raider reboot and that is really saying something. I personally HATE QTE's and just wish programmers would sod off putting them in games already. My percentage scores for Ada's campaign is tragically low due to the amount of times I died because I failed yet another QTE mini `game`. Games are fun, QTE mini games are not.I can handle dying because I played like an eejit and ran out of Ammo or walked into an obvious Ambush but failing to waggle the joystick, press X at a specific time then hit RT in the right order at the right speed is annoying beyond beleif.The Controls are way better than previous iterations and being able to run and shoot is a godsend. However  there are ALOT of contextual actions and sometimes things go a bit wonky and you end up running into an enemy rather than actually pulling off some awesome takedown.Other than those negatives this is definitely worth your time and money if you have any love for the RE series in particular or action games in General.

												VERY fun gameplay all the way through. As usual, dont expect horror from this resident evil game as thy've stepped away from that aspect of the franchise a bit to appeal to a larger demographic. The ending is a bit of a let down though. IF YOU DO PLAY THIS GAME the recommended scenario order is found here: 


Resident Evil 6 Recommended Chapter Order 
A Guide for Resident Evil 6 / Biohazard 6

			As some of you may or may not know, the order in which the campaigns are organized does not reflect actual story progression. That being said, the overall story might get pretty confusing if you're trying to keep track,...

												Long time RE fan here (RE1 on PSX )! It was very hard for me to hit the recommend button for this game, and there are basically only three reasons why I am recommending it. 1: It does offer a lot of content. This has four normal sized campaigns, even if some of them have a couple of interlapping scenes, it will offer you plenty of hours of playing.2: With a good co-op friend this game can be extremely fun. People give these modern RE's a hard time because of the less survival horror, or the fact that they are co-op, but I think co-op is actually one of the series biggests strenghts now. In a world with very few co-op games, this game is a fun time if you have some good friends to play it with. I highly recommend playing on the higher difficulties. 3: It's the Resident Evil universe. It's more of an already cool universe with enjoyable monsters and enjoyable characters. Yeah it's not perfect but it's still more RE. Now what do I not like about this game? The controls take awhile to get used to, I don't know why, but they just feel more awkward than even the older titles. I think pair that with the extremely tight corridors in some of the campaigns and it just makes it feel extremely sloppy. While the stories aren't bad, I felt there wasn't a good protagonist on the level of Wesker. I did like Chris's target for the first half, but although there was build up it did not end the way you would expect. Leon's story I felt had the most boring / easy monsters, as well as the least inspired easy boss fights. I feel like Chris's campaign was just better over all.Then you have some minor nit-picks on things that they took steps backwards from RE5. No DirectX10 support, no LAN support, and over all I'd say RE5 even looked better. The share system for swapping items is gone, and unless someone tells you picking the setting as the host doesn't actually change the other persons difficulty setting. I think what disappointed me the most is that RE5 was basically a better game in every way. The only thing RE6 had going for it was length, but length is not important when RE5 just has more replay value. I think because I enjoyed RE5 so much more as a co-op game I will always just feel RE6 was one of the biggest let downs in the series. Don't get me wrong I still enjoyed it enough to recommend it, but barely.			"

												I really have a love/hate relationship with this game. I can only recommend this game to people who wants a solid COOP game or is a sucker like me and buys anything RESIDENT EVIL related. Hey, at least it's more fun than OPERATION RACCOON CITY... right?One thing that really bugs me when I return to RE:6 though, especially when you're playing other RE titles at the same time, is the controls are kinda wonky. It just feels off somehow, like they run a bit too fast or something, really hard to explain. REVELATIONS 2 is running the same engine and pretty much same controls but feels much more refined and tighter. If you play both side-by-side maybe you'll see where I'm getting at. I never really noticed this when I first beat the game on XBOX 360 but now it's really starting to bug me. Surely it's not just me.Anyways, I think the game is good, not the best RE title by any stretch but it's still an enjoyable COOP game. The story is ridiculous and forgettable and RE:5 and RE:6 is now so far removed from RESIDENT EVIL that we really should be calling them something different now.

												This game is considered to be the worst main story of the franchise, it is true that it is not at all as scary as the older games were, but that doesn't mean it is a bad game. Graphics are decent, characters are interesting, Ada's campaign is just great and if you do this multiplayer it is just awesome. I would recommend this to people that just want to have fun smashing in zombie heads, and if you have a friend then go ahead and smash them together, but don't compare it to the other games as it really doesn't fit in with the style, it's a blast in its own way.

												I was always a big fan of the RE series, Got the dreamcast just for Code Veronica which later got released on multiple different platforms. ANYWAY, I kind of went away for a while, missed RE4, RE5, came back to this after a Steam promotion, I saw a lot of negative reviews however I thought there wasn't much to lose given in to the price it was being sold for. Well folks! I was amazed, I did enjoy the game, it's good to see the characters back in a higher definition, the game play is good. not as creepy as it once were, very few puzzles that require back tracing, the game is pretty much linear and straight forward, it took me less than 10hours to beat all the different campaigns excluding the additional stuff. I had fun, the story kept me intrigued to keep on playing the different characters.The downside though was the lame camera angles during fast-paced action events where you gotta run away from harmfull junk that chases you. it really annoyed the living sh*t out of me, let alone the glitchy corners where the camera would kind of struggle to adjust to it's set angles but once you get over that, the game is fun to play. I liked it. "

												Great game, very enjoyable CO-OP (not really meant to be played solo). Amazing action cutsenes (probably never even seen any better), game really sucks you in with it's story and characters. Shame that it has pretty terrible MP (lack of content, poorly executed modes) and for that I'm taking 1 point out of 10. 9/10 Overall. Awesome story and CO-OP campaign with high replayabilty value.

												I really have a love/hate relationship with this game. I can only recommend this game to people who wants a solid COOP game or is a sucker like me and buys anything RESIDENT EVIL related. Hey, at least it's more fun than OPERATION RACCOON CITY... right?One thing that really bugs me when I return to RE:6 though, especially when you're playing other RE titles at the same time, is the controls are kinda wonky. It just feels off somehow, like they run a bit too fast or something, really hard to explain. REVELATIONS 2 is running the same engine and pretty much same controls but feels much more refined and tighter. If you play both side-by-side maybe you'll see where I'm getting at. I never really noticed this when I first beat the game on XBOX 360 but now it's really starting to bug me. Surely it's not just me.Anyways, I think the game is good, not the best RE title by any stretch but it's still an enjoyable COOP game. The story is ridiculous and forgettable and RE:5 and RE:6 is now so far removed from RESIDENT EVIL that we really should be calling them something different now. RESIDENT EVIL Over The Shoulder Pew-Pew COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION!			"

												If you have a bro to play trough the campaigns with, it's pretty fun. It's not amazing by any standards, and it's not a survival horror game. The story can be stupid at points but it far from deserves all the hate it got when it was new. If you don't have anyone to coop with though, I suggest you stay clear.			"

												Make no mistake, Resident Evil 6 is no longer a (survivor) horror game; it's a full blown action game with horror themes here and there. The story is rather poor (great characters interactions but overall the is full of cliches and most of the backstory is crammed into documents you get by shooting snake emblems) and the campaign itself is full of highs and lows. When it shines, it really does - you get great setpieces, boss fights, interesting over the top action sequences etc. But when it blows, man - it really blows: you will rage in frustration over instadeath QTEs, stupid design decisions, frustrating stealth sections, slow-walk sections (the whole beginning of Leon's campaign), camera control being taken away from you (while enemies can still move and hurt you), annoying vehicle sections... ugh, there's a lot of that.However, the combat system is fantastic... once you learn it, because Capcom forgot to include a proper tutorial to teach you how to play the game. But when you do get how to play - it's marvelous. It's the most technical and versatile third person shooter that has been released in years, topped only by Vanquish. Forget about boring pop and shoot cover shooters that flood the genre nowadays; this game is all about slides, dodges, counters, stunning enemies and performing melee combos. :D If you spend most of the game hidden behins a cover or standing in place and shooting enemies, you're playing the game wrong. :PAlso, Mercenaries is the best bonus mode ever. EVER. Very addicting and time consuming and at the same time, very satisfying, mostly because it focuses on the game's strengths (the combat system), while throwing away everything else (those highs and lows from the campaign design).The game is definietely worth checking out.

												Resident Evil 6I know a lot of people are not playing this game anymore, a lot of people hated this game for not being the nostalgic resident evil feel, and I know that this is more action oriented than horror.  Nonetheless, this game is amazing in its own rights.  If this game was not titled Resident Evil, I know this game would have favorable reviews, but it is.  If you are looking for an action packed zombie feasted game, then maybe give this game a try.  Don't expect to be horrified by the fact that the previous installment (not 5) had a horror feel into it, but accept the game as what it is.  This game tried to be ambitious, and though it was ambitious, it didn't cater its fans.  It didn't respect the fact that Fans can think, fans can boycott, and they might go against Capcom and not buy any of their games.  Regardless, I very much liked the game.  I enjoyed its action filled gameplay, did not enjoy the quick time events to be honest. Almost each cutscene has it and its stupid, but the game was good. I had over 30 hours of gameplay and if you have someone to play with, and just want to have fun then it might be the game for you.  Remember, don't play this alone and play it through Split Screen, Lan or with someone over the net. It's much better and less frustrating that way.			"

Cons: - The controls are a little strange to get used to but doable. (My dad and I both used defaults through all of it)			"

												RE6 is a lot of fun. I was very pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed playing through the game. After RE5 I was ready to write off the series, but this corrects the course (mostly) for the franchise. It's like a big dumb summer action movie that never gives you time to catch your breath. This is definitely a newer, faster-paced RE even with the clunky controls. There are parts that harken back to the old school actually scary RE games where I'm collecting keys, I'm solving puzzles and it made me sad for that fantastic style is all but extinct these days. Action games are a dime a dozen, but a good horror game is something special. However, I gotta say, there's just something really cool about getting into fist fights with huge mutant monsters. There's always something getting shot, punched, stabbed, burned, blown up or crushed. This game has a lot of 'that was just cool' moments. My favorite was when one of the monsters gets run over by a school bus. There's four separate intertwined campaigns that take over 20 hours to finish the first time. The game is highly replayable. The story was utter nonsense, of course, but it was fun re-playing events from different perspectives. There's also a horde mode where the L4D2 crew are all playable characters. That was fun to see them in newer, spiffier graphics up to their old tricks, kicking zombie♥♥♥♥♥ There's even a few special infected along for the ride. I heartily recommend RE6!			"

												I played enough of this game to recommend it to you. There's everything to love and nothing to hate. If we consider the last trilogy, Resident Evil from 4 to 6 this is easily the best of them all, the culmination of the action Capcom offers. You can do all sort of new moves which are awesome, you can slide, dodge, land on your back and shoot from the ground (which can be done when enemies drop you too), you can fight in melee with combos or switching to a melee weapon. I really like the fluidity of the game and it's even more fun with a friend. The coop of this game is great, you are not helpless per sé, you can counter enemies' grapples, you can even ""stand up"" for yourself if you survive long enough in a down state, but, of course, it's a lot easier if there's a team mate helping you out but that may not be always possible due to tactics gone wrong or levels where you have to stay apart for some time.There is much to explore, some campaigns have more exploration than others, graphics are really good for my standards (which may be low since I don't really care) and it goes at 60 fps even if the benchmark told me it would go at 20-30. The campaigns are a great idea, different enemies, different characters, different playstyles and it's a hard game too! I play at Professional difficulty, invested 23 hours in the game right now and I'm something as halfway through (I'm doing chapter 3 with Chris now after doing 3 chapters with Jake and Leon). I really can't find anything wrong with this game, it gives me the challenge I seek, the adrenaline, the fear (the fear of dying but there are some jumps too), the gameplay is perfect as I see it, this was much more than I anticipated, I'll definitely play this multiple times.

												Bought this as a means to play Co-op with a long distance friend. It feels like a radical departure from the previous installments (granted I only played 1 and 2) as early on there's moments of heavy artillery and gunfire just raining down along with armed zombie gunners?? The camera angles shift, there's wild explosions and everything feels like WTF? Also, the game heavily relies on animated cutscenes that feel like unecessary cutscenes that makeup a huge amount of game time.To say it simply: the gameplay is very awkward and cumbersome, which I guess it part of the franchise. Resident Evil has always been a clunky 3rd person adventure game that has frustrating game control. So that's the bad part.Now to sum up other bad parts that are actually really good. My advice: Play this game with a witty friend as it can be the funniest game experiences ever ala Myster Science Theatre 3000. Seriously, this game is so full of hilarious cliches that are worthy of commentary that it makes it a true gem in casual gameplay.The positive: It looks fantastic. I'm a huge Resident Evil fan but I guess I've missed several installments. This one looks incredible but suffers from the legacy of awkward gameplay. (You can run up to a zombie who's holding a fully automatic machine gun and proceed to kick him in the teeth)Currently, we've just finished the first Campaign.  Hopefully the other campaigns are as humorous and enjoyable			"

												Am a huge fan of RE franchise, and I simply don't understand why people hated this game. Yeah honestly game evolves from puzzle soving type of genre into a shooter game and later into an action one where u roll, do counterattacks and so on. Although it's a really big change overall, I found this game really enjoyable, if you are thinking about buying it, it is worth it the try, you can always refund anyway, but I don't think there will be a reason for doing so. The only thing you should consider is that it is a next shooter, not the original RE game, many old gamers tend to stop playing RE games just because of that, so, if u are the veteran RE type person, there is a chance that u won't like this game, although I liked this change and I love the game, that decision will be up to you. And shortly to the story, you've got 3 main campaign, including famous character such as Leon S. Kennedy or Chris Redfield, + one smaller campaign including Ada Wong. I like the plot and everything around it as always, and the thing that they actually met in the game is just briliant for me, I love it all the way. So yeah this game for me is 8-8.5/10, just because it's again a new genre which developers have jumped into, although I recomend this game, everybody who loves RE should play this, no matter if the person prefers Shooter game or the puzzle game.

												Recommend or not recommend - it’s not easy with this game.At a 7.50 sale-price, you get a lot of content for your money. But how about the quality of said content?The parts of the game which are fun to play, thrilling and exciting are “infiltrated” by parts which are not that much fun to play and can even feel like a chore. Sadly, some sections seem to exist solely to fill time, to give some variety or for narrative as their implementation (controls mostly) is mediocre at best.There are lots of quicktime-events - which is not bad per se - but some of them felt out of place, at times annoying.Obviously the creators had a big action-flick in mind, but the lack of execution in many parts make for an inconsistent experience.I think if you play this game with your expectations not too high - ideally in coop-mode - you might have some fun with RE6. If you’re looking for a polished, focused experience maybe not.Recommend for 7.50 or less.			"

												Resident Evil is another franchise that to have any hope of enjoying now, you have to forget what it used to be. There is nothing for survival horror fans to enjoy here. Of the 4 campaigns, Leon and Ada try to pretend to be horror, but there's still too much action, and its pointless putting hidden key puzzles in completely linear maps. Leon also has to suffer countless unforgiving QTEs. Chris and Jake play like a standard 3rd person shooter, and therefore more enjoyable, if that's what you're in the mood for. Although they do have some frustrating running at the camera sections and dull turret sections. The story is okay but you need to play all campaigns to get the whole picture. One area I can't fault is value for money. It took me 24 hours to complete all campaigns, and only Ada's felt too short. Coop partner AI is vastly improved on RE5. My advice is to buy it on sale, wait until you're in the mood for a dumb shooter, then play Chris and Jake, and treat the rest as bonus content.			"

Компании Огромны, поэтому игру проходить долго, что я и не сделал до сих пор. Краски больно тёмные, везде ночь, зомби хорошие, много типов. Порадовал режим игры за зомби, где нужно другим игрокам проходить игру, хотя и зомби очень медленные. Есть выживание - отстрел зомби, конечно же за награды. В каждой кампании есть напарник, и теперь уже и в кампании Ады на ПК (На других консолях у неё нет напарника). Итак, игра хорошая (8/10).			"

												Good, but not perfect.   In short, this is an experiment in the Resident Evil series with some experimental results. It offers some fun gameplay that takes RE to places that it's never been before.   Along with that, there are a few shortcomings that gnaw the overall experience.  If you're one of the pure traditional horror and tension over all things than you might want to look elseware.Is it better than RE5?  In my opinon, Yes, but I still like RE5.   Is it a groundbreaking horror-fest like the first several RE games?  No, not even close but that doesn’t mean that this is a terrible game.  Expect for your characters to be the most mobile that they have ever been before in an RE game. Even more mobile than in many 3rd person action games. You can run, roll, side roll, dodge, fight from the ground, evade while on the ground, engage in physical combat, and that's just a bit of it. This is a godsend from when I was playing RE2 back on the N64 in 2001. I always found myself cursing at the screen because of the bad camera angle or when Leon or Claire just couldn’t figure out how to use some low level martial arts against many enemies that had negative IQ's. Some people are complaining, but I enjoy many of the changes.  Not saying that there wasn’t times when I cursed at the screen while playing this game. Although most of those were due to the few camera angle and controls that tried to stick to the series. RE6 is much faster paced than previous RE's. This can be a big problem when a camera angle gets stuck and you can’t see your character or when your character jumps in the exact opposite direction that they were supposed to (the run button is the same as the leap over obstacle button). Thankfully this only happens a handful of times between otherwise good gameplay.The area where I had the most fun with this game is the same that I had with RE5.... The Mercenaries No Mercy.  Its basically a time attack horde mode where you get points for combos while you survive until the time runs out or until you kill 300 enemies. An impressive amount of said enemies can be on the screen at a time.   This teamed with online gameplay makes this game a worthwhile venture if you dont mind action (and a bit of WTF were they thinking) in your Resident Evil game.			"

A Screenshot of Resident Evil 6 / Biohazard 6
By: GuyOnAChair




Fan boys hate any negative review of Resident Evil 6 and are easily upset with any further dead horse beating where as fans are torn if it's almost a decent action game or just a bad shooter in addition to being a jack of all trades and a master of none. That's before even getting into how it either fails to or doesn't do horror. I don't care what genre a Resident Evil title is or if it's even a ""faithful"" entry at the end of the day it just has to be a good game. To reiterate so long as it's good or at least so long as I have a good time I'm okay.My Steam review originally talked about the mechanics, story, controls and graphics but since people hate hearing about Resident Evil 6 so much lets talk about Pacman as it's a better survival horror game with great action. Pacman is less linear and has a far more cohesive albiet simple and less obtrusive story and if you really don't care about the narrative it can be skipped. The ghosts are more memorable and threatening than every enemy in RE6 combined too because they actually trap or kill you and have distinctive behaviors that test your limited limited resources.  (If you disagree with the last part you haven't played Pacman). In conclusion buy Pacman instead.			"

												Probably one of the most underrated RE games.  You have a bit ofeverything you could want in this one package.  Survival horror (Leon and Helana playthrough), to great action/shooter (Chris and Pierce).  You have so many stories and reasone to play through again, what is there not to like?  I am not an original RE player.  My first was RE-4 and I have loved each one since.  I am also not at all interested in team play, and these games still offer the best solo games out there.  Story, character development, and game play are absolutely still the best you will find on any game available.  Can't wait for RE-7!!!!!			"

												This game doesn't play like other third person shooters, and even less like previous Resident Evil games. Instead, it's one of the most rewarding action games out there.There's a reason why Mercenaries is unlocked from the start, because it's the best way to experience the huge variety of enemies and weapons. Make sure you practice parrying, because nearly every attack in the game can be countered. It's a fantastic risk/reward mechanic, since you're punished for doing it too early or too late, but when done right is the best way to take out most enemies, especially the bloodshots (skinless zombies).Even though Vanquish is still my favourite third-person shooter, Resident Evil 6 fixes my two problems with that game, which are the harsh punishment for using melee moves and the lack of extra content.

They have infinite ammo and health, and you don't have to worry about their inventory either.

												An incredibly underrated game in the Resident Evil franchise. While the story isn't particularly good or believable (but when was the last time a Resident Evil story was?) and the game isn't even remotely scary, it has arguably the best gameplay mechanics in the series. Plenty long and great for co-op.			"

												Es un excelente juego, las armas, los zombies y todo tipo de mounstro que te llega aparecer hacen de esta entrega algo bueno. Son ahora 4 historias en paralelo donde lo ideal es jugarlo en modo online, es necesario jugar con todos para entender muy bien toda la historia. Para terminarlo al 100% necesitaras muchas horas de juego y sobre todo jugar con cada personaje en todas las modalidades. Muy recomendable !!!			"

												The greatest game ever made. Has 3 50 hour long campaigns with incredibly well written storylines that braid themselves into the deep, evocative lore and mythos of the Resident Evil universe. Gameplay takes everything you love about the original resident evils (exploration, inventory management, limited gunplay, upgrades etc) and throws it out the window cause that sh!ts old yo. In its place we have Generic Third Person Shooter, the gameplay style that has been determined to be superior to all others and fits in every franchise no matter what. Mind blowing graphics and action will make you say to yourself ""I got into gaming with COD MW, but now I want to play a sequel to a series ive never heard of because its been made into a bland title with only superficial similarities to its predecessors. Capcom, I am the Call of Duty audience, and you've got me by the balls."" Truly the 'Citizen Kane' moment for gaming.			"

												I don't get why this game gets a lot of hate.I mean, it isn't as scary as the older RE titles such as Re4 or Re3 Nemesisbut it's still a great game.You get 4 campaigns (starring iconic RE charachters such as Leon and Chris and the return of Sherry Birkin from RE2 and many more) which are pretty good fun specially on co-op, (co-op is avaiable both Online and offline in Split Screen and so is Mercenaries)not really scary but more action oriented actually though, kicking Zombies/J'avo's butt's is fun :)and the Mercenaries mode is awesome and this time, it has the biggest roster and stages list ever seen in a RE game.Sooo, yes, the game is definitely worth purchasing, you may encounter some trouble's at finding players for playMercenaries since the majority plays the campaigns in co-op but there are some RE6 groups who organizesdaily Mercenaries matches and sometimes with the DLC's game mode's as well			"

												Resident Evil 6 has the content that's well worth the price it is given. The game offers 4 connected storylines of different characters each has its own unique ""style"" to it.The game deviates away from its original survival horror and clinging towards the action horror genre. Despite many people bashing the game for this, I think it is understandable given the context of the story.Anyway, good game. Worth the time.			"

												This game gets too much hate. I've been playing Resident Evil since the first one on the PS1 and I think 6 is a great game. Just because it's different from the first ones, it gets crap reviews. The series evolved, get over it. People complain about the QTE's. Why, though? Is your timing horrible that it makes you lose? You think instant deaths are ""unfair and stupid""? Resident Evil 4 had QTE's and people loved that game. Enemy grabs you? You get a chance to make a comeback with a QTE. Enemy about to make a lethal attack? Time it just right, and you can turn the tides. It adds depth, it not just ""get hit and that's it"" you have a system that awards your fast reflexes. I can understand why people wouldn't like QTE's in say.. cutscenes, but many games do this as well, it's not just RE6. I didn't mind them, keeps you on your toes.The story line is crazy, yeah. I enjoyed it, I don't know why people QQ'd over it. Three intersecting story lines? Common, that was great how that played out. Cheesy dialogue? Yeah, every RE has it, nothing different, right? I don't see the big deal.And even after the story is over, you get to play the amazing mini game, Mercenaries. Gotta keep that combo up! The pressure of needing to keep killing is awesome. Combat system is great, I really feel like this is the most underrated thing in RE6. On PC, shooting the undead is really satisfying. You get great mobility and evade tactics. You have to strategize to get a higher score and a higher combo. Utilizing items that the map gives you, meleeing enemies to gain time. Mercenaries alone is worth it even if you think the main game is garbage (which like I said, I don't think is the case).Great game Capcom, I loved it and you have a satisified fan eagerly waiting the next Resident Evil.

												I've been a fan of the Resident Evil series since the late 90s. I avoided this game for the longest time due to the negative reviews, and even laughed at many of the things I heard about the game. I was wrong to have avoided though. The game is far better than I expected. I'd even go as far as to say it's better than Resident Evil 5.True, Resident Evil hasn't really been survival horror in a long time, but for a horror-themed action title, this game does very well. It's over the top, it's crazy, but it's damn good. Some aspects of the game feel unpolished, but others are crisp and clean, and there is a lot of content here. I don't know if it was worth it at $60 when it first hit, but I'm counting far less sins here than MGSV. If you're like me and you were uncertain, you may very well be surprised. It's not an amazing game, no, but it's still a fun ride.			"

Posted: April 6, 2016
												Would I recommend RE6  to someone? That's a half-hearted yes. I wish Steam used stars instead of a simple thumbs up or down. If you're a fan of the series and you like the characters that have grown on you over the last decade or so, then yes, RE6 is a good play. On the other hand, if you're really just casually into the series from a distance or haven't really been following all the games to this point, I'd say, just go ahead and watch the full videos on YouTube to get the gist and skip this purchase. The Good:  A lot of people really hated on this game in strong ways, and the criticism has some validation. But let's start with the good. Graphics - A nice improvement from previous RE games, though at times the lighting makes it hard to tell as such. There's several different campaings to go through in this game, each one has some pretty nice visuals and character design. Gameplay - This is both in the good category, and the bad category. The good part of the gameplay is in the improved combat structure. Overall all the control scheme plays a lot more like a normal 3rd person shooter, making it easier to aim and shoot on the fly. Veterans of other games should pick up the controls fairly intuitively, and I'm glad to say that ditching the old tank-style controls from previous fames feels like quite the improvement. Characters - We've got some old favorites coming back for long time fans, and some new characters in the form of Helena, Piers, and Jake. Helena is paired up with long time vet of the series, Leon Kennedy, and Jake Muller is paired up with Sherry Birkin, now in a starring role. Chris and Piers have an interesting dynamic as Chris has fallen into a rut, so Piers is almost the spitting image of who Chris was back in RE 1. No matter who you play as, the characters flesh out pretty much the same, but it is entertaining to see how some of the characters have either matured or fallen into disgrace, (like Chris). Story - This is another category that's both good and bad. The good part of the story is that there's actually 4 whole campaigns to work through, almost like 4 entire resident evil games. Each one takes on an archetype: Leon's is dark and tense, Chris' is very action themed, Jake's is mostly a chase sequence, and Ada's has a lot of the classic puzzle solving and intrigue. The Bad Gameplay - Man, despite all the new 3rd person changes, there are some very head banging moments due to unnecessary Quick Time Events (QTE) and bad camera angles. I died more times to stupid button pushes and a poorly rotated camera than I did to any creature in the game. Jake and Sherry's chapter was the worst offender. Story -  Oh man, where do I begin? It's fun to have 4 different interweaving tales, but the downside is that you really get to a point that you just want the game to GET TO THE POINT. You have to do several boss fights several times on several characters, which can feel very repetitive. But my main issue with the story is that I didn't feel that any of the characters really found any major progression, with the exception of newcomer duo Jake and Sherry. At the end of the game, Leon is still Leon, Ada is still a mystery woman, and Chris is reset back to where he was at the end of RE5. Nothing new gained. Jake/Sherry, Piers, and Helena change, but nothing new with returning cast members.Characters - The villains in this game needed a lot of work. A LOT. The enemy types are fantastic: tons of work went into making the J'avo and zombies in this game different and creepy from other games. The bosses and lead villains however, have very little in the way of explanations for why they are doing what they are doing it. This is pretty typical for Resident Evil in general, but I really felt the bite of it in this game. You'll find out who the mastermind is of a plot and basically shrug your shoulders and say, ""but do I care?"" Instead of villain development, you may just have to fight that same boss 3, 4, or 5 times, which in no way substitutes character development. At some point, players want a payoff for their hard work: they want questions answered, they want to see what makes the characters tick. Don't expect that here. The Ugly	Cheapness - Yep, I'm calling shenanigans. I'm a big fan of the Dead Space series, which has a few cheap tricks in the form of jump scares or regenerating bad guys that♥♥♥♥♥♥you off sometimes. RE6 had this in every campaign. So let me define cheap: despite your ability to annhilate waves of undead and using your nearly omnipotent hand-eye coordination, you fall victim to a boss mechanic you didn't know existed. Or, you fail to rotate the left stick fast enough, since you weren't expecting a QTE. Or, you do exactly what you were supposed to do, but the camera flips on you so instead of it being behind you, it's now in front of you and you have to change what you are doing. Yeah... cheapness.And let's not forget my favorite: the 'protected by the plot' enemy. You're walking down a hallway full of corpses you know will probably come alive. You aim carefully for a headshot and squeeze a bullet off, which passes harmlessly through the body as if it was ethereal. Once you get close enough though, it comes after you, and now you're in a bullet spraying/melee frenzy. I find that extremely cheap. Gun Inefficiency -  I don't know what happened to firearms between RE5 and RE6, but bad guys just don't take bullets like they used to. Aiming at a hand or foot in RE4 or 5 and popping off a shot, even with your first pistol, resulted in a body lurch from the bad guy that resonated a satisfying impact from your bullet hitting their body. None of that in RE 6. I might as well have been shooting water pistols instead of a figgin' magnum. One thing I love about Dead Space as a series is that each weapon has some serious weight to it. None of the weaponry in RE6 feel like they pack a punch, with the possible exception being the grenade launchers, and even those don't have nearly the splash damage and impact you'd like. This game tries to add in more of a melee component, where you either stun a guy with bullets and then finish with a melee strike, or vice versa. To say I hated it would be an understatement. What the hell are firearms good for if I should just be slugging my way through the apocalypse with my dukes?! Even with every boost you can get for your firearm skills, expect them to feel woefully under-powered, especially during Leon and Helena's campaign. Even when you get a shotgun in that campaign you're wondering why you bothered with it.Ridiculousness -  A tank chasing you through a building? Check. A sudden avalanche chasing you down a mountain while you race down it with a snow mobile... while the ground erupts earthquake style under your feet? Check. Literally, this list goes on and on. Resident Evil has always had it's moments (Zombie SHARKS?! = RE 1) but this game took it to a new extreme. There's actually a lot of good moments in this game where the action is feeling tense, but then it's broken with yet another ridiculous chase sequence, or button spamming QTE, or monster that won't die from bullets, because, REASONS.In conclusion: Some of the game can be pretty fun, (more than I was expecting, still frustrating at times), but there was definitely some ideas that didn't pan out in this game. Too much genre mash-up, too many QTE's. The game does have some good visuals and atmosphere at times, but if you're looking a pure survival horror experience, you'll probably want to pick up Dead Space 1, 2, or 3. If you're a fan of Resident Evil/BioHazard and want to check in with some of your old favorite characters, by all means, pick up this game, but be ready for some shenanigans.			"

												This game doesn't play like other third person shooters, and even less like previous Resident Evil games. Instead, it's one of the most rewarding action games out there.There's a reason why Mercenaries is unlocked from the start, because it's the best way to experience the huge variety of enemies and weapons. Make sure you practice parrying, because nearly every attack in the game can be countered. It's a fantastic risk/reward mechanic, since you're punished for doing it too early or too late, but when done right is the best way to take out most enemies, especially the bloodshots (skinless zombies).Even though Vanquish is still my favourite third-person shooter, Resident Evil 6 fixes my two problems with that game, which are the harsh punishment for using melee moves and the lack of extra content. Co-op is also implemented really well, but when playing in single-player your partner is never the burden they were in RE6. They have infinite ammo and health, and you don't have to worry about their inventory either. You're capable of holding plenty of weapons and ammo, so there's no need to use your partner to hold all the stuff you aren't using.To see how the game is meant to be played, with this LP: http://lparchive.org/Resident-Evil-6/The game's tutorial doesn't even scratch the surface of what you can do, so this is an essential read:https://www.pdf-archive.com/2012/10/11/resident-evil-6-advanced-controls-guide-ps3-1/ "

												Out of the 2 hours of play time.Only 25 minutes are of actual gameplay the rest trying to fix game so it would play.Luckily my Brother was home visting so he could fix nearly all glitches.Currently working great on Windows 10 & Xbox One Controller.Although to get Xbox One Controller to work it took a bit of trial & error.However the game is running now lovely on 4k & decent FPS.I Already have RE6 with all EX skins on PS4 Pro & Xbox One S.But you have to do all over again to get all EX & costumes again.On PC RE6 really looks & plays way better then on my Consoles.If you can get RE6 to work on your PC & it's on sale under $10.00 Dollars then it's totally worth it.PS connecting with friends is rather hit & miss(mostly miss) RE6 Online modes seem kinda dead.The story is very long & the Merc No Mercy is so much fun,plus on PC we get LFD2 Costumes & a few exclusive enemies.In short decent game with a lot of replay value.Never ever worth $60.00 Dollars not even $20.00 Dollars but under $10.00 Dollars it is really worth it.8/10I would buy more Resident Evil games & other games if they finally would completely remove that terrible Games for Windows Live.FYI RE6 doesn't have Games for Windows Live in case anyone wanted to know.

												To avoid confusion RE6 is a dynamic 3rd person action game with post-apocalyptic content. It is NOT scary or filled with building up tension. Instead of that game is mainly focussed on QTE ( Quick time events ) and interesting ( Yet Hollywood like ) story that is divided into FOUR relating to each other campaigns ( At least 16+ hours of gameplay ).Within the story mode if you choose to you CAN co-op with other players or allow them to become one of the ‘biohazards’ in your game. Unlike classic franchise releases game does not posses option to save on the go. Combat system, controls and camera behaviour within the game are fairly easy to get used to. Yet it is a matter of personal taste and devotion to the title.Multiplayer and all of the DLC content is NOT highly populated hence this game is mainly limited to three modes (CAMPAIGN, AGENT HUNT & MERCENARIES) For people that like to compete residentevil.net is hosting live events quite often.

												A horror/zombie action game with all the wants and needs of a good experience. Characters and story arcs that entice you to love and hate characters. Blooming unlikely love story. Unexpected partnership based on mutual trust. Unresolved and mysterious love interest. PTSD hero, who loses more than he wanted, and gains much more only to lose some. Deceit and disillusionment. And twisted unrequited EVIL love.It is action, zombies, guns and knives, grenades and gritty puzzles. Not only do you use your skill, but also your brain, something most zombie games don't have. What is truly terrifying is the fact that the 'zombies' are not mindless killing machines (for the most part) but are capable of organisation.Downside is the ANNOYING camera angles, that though you could get used to after a while, certain campaigns force camera angles that keep changing and warping into almost unworkable conditions that result in your death. QTEs are a pain sometimes but are exciting - thought it depends on you. An overusage of it - in my opinion - but there is an option to turn them off, so that's good. (I'm looking at you Chris/Piers)Bottom line a product worth its blood and gore. There's a million ways to die and so satisfying when finished - not only cos of the action element, but also the story element. Graphics ain't half bad either, and is plenty reliable as compared to other franchises that are trying to up their game. This Resident Evil has done it in the most balanced way.			"

												I guess this is the only RE game I cannot put my mind to finish it. The control is all over the place. Lost the feeling of RE as a survival horror and into the action game category.  Furthermore, you can taste the pattern on each stage. Graphics, on the other hand, is fantastic. However, sometimes there is so many stuff that happening on the screen that you cannot enjoy the beautiful scene. The sound is average. I guess you cannot expect anything better than average in Resident Evil game. Voice acting is pretty well done, I can hear they put effort into it. I can feel how mentally damaged Chris were as I play through his campaign. Although it is an average Resident Evil game, the lost of traditional survival horror and the repeat quick time event etc did pull me out of the game. However, if players like how Resident Evil 5 gameplay structure than I will recommend this for you. Notwithstanding, this is a skippable series. The story is plain (expect Chris campaign is very dark), not much replay values. I will rather play Resident Evil Revelations 1/2 than 6.  "

												Played co-op with my gay friend. We passed through all the co-ops. It's really intresting to see through every groups perspective of what crazy things are happening all around them. (SPOILERS KINDA) The best campaign is Chris and Pierce. They have an epic journey where the two main characters built a brotherly bond together. Near the end, one person saves the other for the greater good of the planet. After losing all his friends, losing this one meant the most to him. It's a really good gameplay, I would recommend playing this with a friend, it's an amazing expierence you won't forget. Plus it has great boob jiggles.			"

												Resident evil. A popular name in movies and games... This game gave me both a fright, a rush and a serious headache...(this is the first RE game i've played, but I did look into the earlier releases)The gist:Pros  - Fun, refreshing combat (at times)         - Very interesting story arc         - 4 different perspectives on the campaign to play through, each with 2 characters to choose from         - Big variety of enemies and weapons (surprisingly)         - A very decent port to PC from consoleCons - A port from console to PC         - Stereotypical Japanese intensity and overreacting character personalities...         - It is either really easy, or frustratingly unfair         - Annoying as f**k cinematics and animations         - Really stupid design choices         - Did not come with contact details of the developers, so I can punch them all in their faces The big one:The biggest and most glaring issue with this game are the forced in-game cinematics you HAVE to watch every time your partner opens a path way (that I can clearly see is opening), or calls a switch to my attention or ties his shoe... Many many times these cinematics led to my death because the enemies continue to attack you while you stand there watching the camera show you the inside of a tunnel for 30 seconds...The explanation:The design choices really irk me badly. From the attempted phone/PDA style menu that does not pause the game to the entire idea of releasing the RE series for consoles primarily is something I don't understand. Though having a game like this on console seems like the better choice it really isn’t. I say this because the combat focuses heavily on the player to precisely hit limbs or the head of an enemy if you want to be ammo effective on harder difficulty settings. I tried playing with the Xbox controller for PC, but I always felt out of control and slow.There are a lot of bad choices ranging from map design to camera angles but In all honesty, those bad choices are not stopping me from playing through the entire game... Because it is interesting and fun.I can't tell you whether this is a better RE than the previous ones but what I can say, is that it is fun, cheap and a bulky amount of story to uncover and take part in...

												PROS:+ It's a fun co-op experience+ You can unlock infinite ammo+ There's Mercenaries Mode, which allows you to fight off hordes of zombies with, or without, company+ There are multiple campaigns, each with 2 playable characters+ They tacked on No Hope difficulty. It's harder than Professional and it disables infinite ammoCONS:- I discourage anyone from purchasing the DLC, it's hard to find a match in either Siege, Predator, or Survivors without arranging it beforehand			"

												Best Res. Evil since 4 imo. Some of the dialogue is pretty janky (Leon) but that's part of the charm I guess. Graphics are decent with only a few muddy textures here and there. Enemies and areas are varied and entertaining. Controls seems pretty much standard for the series, bit tighter than I remember from 4 and easily playable on M&K or controller.			"

												This game is not a must have. I give a ""YES"" then I am a fan of the Reisdent Evil series but more from the old ones as the new ones. They are to flexibel, the enemies are to much ""human"" (can shot with weapons and more). In Coop it can make fun, but when you want S ranking on higher difficulty its better to play with a player as with the AI. The AI can't die and have always infinity ammo but thats all. The DLCs are normal and new ones give it too.Mercenaries is okay. No Mercy Merc give it only on the PC, Onslaught make fun, Survivor is not mine (like peoples must show his ego), Predator mode is funny (to play as Ustanak).The graphic is really cheap many times in this game. RE have better one and of course its older.I would give 6/10 points			"

												I beated this game full co-op, dissapointing the quantity of bugs and ""cutscenes cinematics"" you have to follow, guess and press in order to do things right. It gets very repetitive and tiring to try one cutscene cinematic (press SPACE or R at the right moment, press A and D a lot of times and after that SHIFT + R) over and over again until you get it right, of course it was fun in RE4 but not in RE6. There are boss fights that are based solely on cutscene cinematics.I felt it more like an action game, has no horror elements... or suspense ones. To be honest i had no fun in the last 2 campaigns. I dont recomend it.			"

												Ever since I was a little kid I played and watched by older brother play the first Resident Evil. It scared me to death, I had nightmares for years because of it. So I loved the series until 4. Instead of making them the traditonal ""horror"" games, They turned it into Action-Adventure games. RE4 was not at all bad, It was quite a good game actually, But RE5 really started to go down hill. RE5 was just hordes of zombies you fight and a boss here and there, That's really it, Nothing great with the story. RE6, So far follows that, I figured I would get a few hours out of it. The story doesn't really do anything for me.LSS: only get this game if you like basic action games and/or if it's on sale.			"

RE6 may not be what all of us want from a RE game but it's co-op is actually quite enjoyable (other than Leon's final boss fight)! Further more, while some have complain about the seperate storylines, I thought it was kind of neat how each flowed together. It reminded me of the older Resident Evils like 1 and 2. In conclusion, If you're looking for a fun co-op game to play with a friend, this is for you. If you're looking for survival horror... I guess you'll have to wait and see what RE7 has in store for us.			"

												Ever since I was a little kid I played and watched by older brother play the first Resident Evil. It scared me to death, I had nightmares for years because of it. So I loved the series until 4. Instead of making them the traditonal ""horror"" games, They turned it into Action-Adventure games. RE4 was not at all bad, It was quite a good game actually, But RE5 really started to go down hill. RE5 was just hordes of zombies you fight and a boss here and there, That's really it, Nothing great with the story. RE6, So far follows that, I figured I would get a few hours out of it. The story doesn't really do anything for me.LSS: only get this game if you like basic action games and/or if it's on sale.			"

												Don't just see low scores given from other gaming sites. The reality is just different than that in each person respectively. Resident Evil 6 is a mess, yes, but an awesome mess. It's not like any previous Resident Evil games, it has been changed in many ways, in my opinion, are better from time to time. Good combat system, enhanced co-op mode, great storyline and good free online service ResidentEvil.net are definitely worth its price. As a long-time fan, I rate this game at 8.5/10, -1.5 for ugly graphic details in some scenes - which are not serious, and some fatal bugs at release day (yes, they're fixed, of course).Hint: There's a clue about next installment of Resident Evil franchise at the end of the game, see it by yourself.

												Just played almost 2 hours of the game, Leon campaign, in PC (already played in consoles, so, I have more game time).My last experience with Resident Evil, really good, was with RE 4. With 5, played a little bit and dropped.This one is fun, but I expected much more.The camera is horrible most of the times (I play in a very big screen) and when you have a lot of zombies and you need a fast combat, it's just bad.I like the way they did the mellee combat and kicks and stuff. Guns has better ammo for you to use and also you can have many guns inside your pocket. I wonder when they will make a better real RE (this is for my taste, I like it). You need to shoot almost 3-5 times in the head of the zombie... really?There are many tense moments, but the exploration part and good parts of it are just dumb. There are parts where you just have to take a quick decision with keys and it is confusing also (you will get used to it, but until there, expect to lose health and die a few times). This is me playing normal difficulty and I am used to FPS / TPS games (that's why the fault is on camera, controls and zombie behaviour). Again, I wonder their QA on this.In overall, game is good, but not that good compared to what I expected.I got it on sale (80%), so I recommed it. But I am happy that I did not pay full price for this.			"

												Don't believe the mediocre Meta-Score review; Resident Evil 6 is bad♥♥♥♥♥Resident Evil 6 very similar to Resident Evil 5, except with 4 campaigns, better multiplayer modes, better combat, more enemies, and a massively improved control system. Unlike in RE5, where you couldn't aim and walk, in RE6 they made it so you can actually move and shoot at the same time, not to mention they've added special moves and unique weapons for each character so it's worth going back to give the other character in the campaign a whirl. The melee system too, is fast-paced and very exciting no two playable characters have the same animations.The game itself doesn't choose which campaign you begin in, which allows you and your co-op partner to pick your favorite duo from the beginning. The ""Leon"" campaign features regular, more classical zombies. You know, the kind which are dumb and only use melee? So it's the easiest capaign IMO. The ""Chris"" campaign features a slew of enemies reminescent of the middle-stages of Resident Evil 5; You'll be pitted up against mercenaries who've infected themselves with a strain of the virus that allows them to maintain control and use their guns - They have the most epic final boss fight. The ""Jake"" Campaign is more or less a combination of the Leon and Chris campaigns, where you'll fight enemies of all varieties but it's the most difficult campaign IMO. The Bonus Ada Wong campaign is entirely Single Player and is a ton of fun - Naturally, you'll die a lot without a partner.Most players of RE5 remember the most badass parts of that game were wailing on Albert Wesker with your fists and punching a 5-ton bolder into a volcano. Well, there's no *Albert* Wesker, but his son Jake is a playble character who has some of the best melee moves I've seen to date, and Chris Redfield hasn't lost his Super-Human strength either. Oh, and bonus cookies: Leon can dual-wield pistols.9/10 - Must Play			"

												I can safely say that this is the worst Resident Evil game ever conceived, but as an entity of its own, it brings fresh ideas and lots of content. Namely, splitscreen. On. The. P. C.Merc Mode has never been funner, and Agent Hunt mode is a fantastic twist on L4D's versus mode, which instead drops human-controlled zombies into the single-player campaign, making it feel all the more disconnected and intense (also no vote kicking for giving pills to your buddies or being knocked down even once) due to the lack of communication with the other team (in addition to no racist remarks every time you kill or get killed).Cross-over co-op between campaigns is also a brilliant idea when it works, I just wish it was more natural somehow. I wouldn't recommend getting RE6 for full price, but if it's on sale, consider giving it a shot.			"

												Resident Evil was one of my first games. I´m playing the series for around 17 years and with exeption of the Relevations spin-off I played all RE-games a lot.But even as a fanboy I don´t get along with RE 6.The grafic is ok, but the controls and the story are just horrible. They tried to create a special contol system and they failed hard. The caracters - even the well known badasses like Leon & Cris are just whiney no-brainers.THIS GAME IS TAKING  ITSELF TO SERIOUS!If you want something funny play Left for dead or Resident Evil 4.If you want to spend an evening with your creepy aunts drunk bookclub, reviewing Edgar Allan Poe and you have no fun in whatever you´re doing - this is the right game for you.

												If you like to play games where you don't actually play the game, the sorts of games where you spectate more than you move. If you like to mash keys in quick succession to simulate playing a game, rather than actually playing a game. If you like to play games where you know you would be better off doing something else, but then you think nah... I will spectate my way through a little bit more of this game because uneccessary and intrusive immersion breaking cut scenes, copious amounts of QTE's and the game putting you on autopilot when it feels like it gets me hard.. then this game is probably for you.As for me, it represents everything that is wrong with the series as it gets older. I love immersion and having a game break immersion by popping a set of instructions on how to move away from an enemy by rapidly pressing key sequences ruins the immersion. To be in control one minute only to have the game unecessarily yank control away from you, while it points out something you would have discovered on your own, had the game given you a chance to explore on your own, makes this more of a movie than a game. Honestly I will keep playing the first four games over and over as I enjoy them immensely, however this series is dead to me beyond that!			"

												The best Resident Evil game ever made,great action and some of the most atmospheric environments in the series and the PC version looks great as well,there are quite a few quick time events and some people find them annoying but i don't mind them.I loved playing this game on console and on PC it's just as good and it also has much better graphics.9 giraffes out of 10			"

												Pretty good game overall, although I enjoy it for different reasons than other RE games. Its definitely departed far from its survival horror roots, its much more of a 3rd person action game at this point with a robust combat system that is much more melee and dodge involved. There is a large selection of weapons that you just pick up as you go and ammo is never an issue it seems like, I actually ran into instances where I had to throw some away to make room in my inventory. Its an enjoyable action game though, as long as you have someone to play it with, I would not recommend doing most of the game yourself (although the partner AI is much better than it was in 5). There are several campaigns to go through and extra modes, like mercenaries, so you actually get quite a bit of content in this one. Theres also a bonus mercenaries mode for this pc release where you can play as Left 4 Dead 2 characters and special infected from that game show up, its a neat little addition that changes things up. I'll give it a solid recommendation, just don't expect it to be a survival horror game.			"

												An honest review from a long-term Resident Evil fan, all the way from that first zombie encounter back in RE1 on the trusty old Playstation.RE6 has made no effort to instill any horror elements, nor has it diverged away from it's 'action' seperation brought on by RE4 & RE5. Old and new characters are thrown into the mix, which pleases some and frustrates others. For example, some people are die-hard Chris/Leon fans yet others are getting a bit tired of the franchise having so much focus on them.Regardless - Despite it obviously cashing in on the success of RE4's action roots, RE6 is still a solid shooter - Just not a solid Resident Evil. The gameplay is fun and RE6 sports an absolutely gargantuan bestiary to fight head on, whether solo or with a partner in Co-Op.The story is completely brainless and gone are the cheesy lines and hammy acting - Instead, it's basically a case of just blitzing through a mediocre story with whatever character combo you like across their (total of 4) campaigns, all trying to blend together to tell the overall non-existant story.Sounds pretty negative so far - Yet here I am, clocking up countless hours thanks to the immensely fun Mercenaries - No Mercy mode, having been a Mercenaries fan since RE3 and a sub-game fan since RE2. Having grabbed the game for 15 euro, it's hard to say it wasn't worth it - Afterall, I've been playing that sub-content more than I have some other higher priced 'main' titles - Allowing me the enjoy RE6's strength as a 'shooter' and enjoy the tension of trying to score 300 kill combos while being hunted down by a city full of impressive beasties.I thoroughly recommend action/shooter fans to give RE6 a legitimate chance, yet die-hard Resi fans of the 'older' generation of RE (and aren't too interested in the shooter-style of RE4/RE5) would likely be better off avoiding it and waiting for the upcoming RE7, which Capcom promises will 'get back to the basics / roots'.In short:-Too far away from older Resi's, alienating older fans.-Entirely shooter orientated with no scares and little tensions.-Quite QTE reliant during story-mode.+Good to boot up for the sake of 'fisting a zombie in the mouth' with your favourite Resi Character.+Agent Hunt & Mercenaries is a lot of fun if you have good company to play with.+Good to look at, decent acting, good sound and one or two memorable music tracks.Just an all-round 'OK' game that would have done SO much better if it was not put under the Resident Evil name.

												Resident Evil 6 provides an interesting take on the journey this series has had throughout the years. While it looks slightly dated in comparison to games using DirectX 11, it still manages to mantain a fun experience across all the different campaigns.Resident Evil 6 splits itself up into campaigns that translate roughly into different ""eras"" for the Resident Evil franchise. You have Leon Kennedy, while with the B.S.A. now, feels very familiar regarding the slower paced and claustrophobic gameplay of the earlier parts of the series. You have Chris Redfield, still capable of bench-pressing 600 pounds in his more action oriented and over-the-top military-based experiences. You have Jack and even Ada Wong as well rounding out the people involved.The controls for the PC are a bit awkward, but thankfully it manages to provide for mouse support that hasn't really irritated me in any particular way. Control keys seem to be a bit awkward in their defaults and some keys are used for more than one thing which can cause some confusion in frantic fights.One thing that really bothered me was the number of QTEs in this game. The ""tutorial"" consisted of no ability to save and had far too many QTEs which made the entire segment feeling much more like a zombie/explosive version of Dragon's Lair. Thankfully it eases up over time and while they are still a bit more common than I'd like, they aren't overbearing.Weapon upgrades was another bit of disappointment for me as well. Instead of gathering money during your exploits and spending it on weapon upgrades specific to pistol X, Y, or Z; you pick up ""Skill Points"" and spend them on basic skills that improve things like extra pistol damage, extra rifle damage, round penetration and so on. This feels a bit disappointing since it reduces the impact your inventory has on how you operate in the game, meaning that instead every pistol of every time is suddenly better without any visual representation to show it.On the multiplayer side of things, we have a number of different ways to play. You can essentially ""infect"" another player's game by joining in as a monster or creature with the sole goal of killing one of the human players before they manage to finish the chapter they're on. This is neat as it feels a little like Dark Souls, though lacks the heart-pounding result as it's declared and the human players are well equipped to handle it.You have Mercenaries and the like as well, with Mercenaries also getting a Left 4 Dead crossover. It's the same Mercenaries game mode we've had for awhile with very similar rules. The downside is that the Left 4 Dead crossover feels hamfisted with the characters not really having anything special here as they feel like they were just reskins.Despite it's flaws, Resident Evil 6 proves to be a fun enough game with various different paces to suit many different moods. The crossovers for the stories of each campaign compliments each other without getting in the way and gives you a reason to hop around the chapters once you unlock them all for a second playthrough.

												Okay, this will not be the most sincere review, but it will give you an idea of what the game is made of.So, alas, and ergo, I begin.Imagine a game that played all of the Resident Evil games, yet only cared for 4 and 5, but took a liking some of the words from the others. Words like, ""Umbrella"", ""Zombie"", ""T-Virus"", ""Jill Sandwich"", and ""Wesker."" Then the game watched every one of the RE movies, back to back - everyday, for a week. And then wrote a ""script"" from four different points of view. None of these individual stories make any sense on their own, yet once you've beaten the game(s) and dealt with their UNIQUE playstyles (see: Unfocused, Confused, and Sexually Curious), the story somehow makes 100% LESS sense than when you first had no idea what was going on. While growing up, this game took the whole ""Buddy System"" concept entirely too seriously, and decided to tattoo the phrase across its chest when it turned 18. It was also raised to be severely narrowminded concerning all Eastern European/Slavic peoples. It was brought up to believe that, ""They're a bunch of dirty, war-mongering, genocidal, tracksuit-wearing, subhuman, walking garbage cans, who only cause trouble and kill each other. Plus they're actually monsters."" Anyway, the amount of action scenes, and scripted, ""GO! RUN! STRUGGLE! JUMP! HELP YOUR ***PARTNER*** AND ACT LIKE YOU CARE!"" content makes the whole RE ""film"" series feel like Terms of Enrampagement - No, sorry, I meant Terms of Endearment. I feel a little uncomfortable at the moment, so, in conlusion - Imagine a slippy, slidey, third person Serious Sam game with an almost, possibly, nearly functional, ""cover-system,"" with the narrative tone of The Road, acting equal to that of a six and a half year old Cambodian immigrant, and the rollicking sense of humor of a wet cinderblock with a dead cat on top.

												This game is NOT worth 30 or 40 dollars. I personally got this game on sale for 8 bucks with DLC and its worth that, but definitely not 30. The only good thing about this is the story and even then the length is the ONLY good thing. The gameplay is terrible, you feel like you are maneuvering a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ person who can barely move straight. The melee combat is terrible, the gun use is just urgh, running is like trying to get them to walk in a straight line drunk as hell, and well, you get the point. The dialogue feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and like a 13 year old testosterone fueled child made it.Story 6/10Gameplay 3/10 (Seriously.)Story length 1/10 (I was half way through when saying the story length was good and I had played 20 hours but now that I complete it, it is incredibly short. It took me around 4 hours to beat the last two campaigns, just pitiful. I played on Normal and died A LOT.)Dialogue 2/10Overall game? 2/10 Only high point is the story LENGTH. Not quality. (Edit: There is no highpoint of the game, I take ♥♥♥♥♥ with a better feeling than this brings and best part, its free!) I mean if you are an avid lover and some Resident Evil fanboy, then go ahead but you will still probably be disappointed. I mean I AM a fanboy here and after RE5 I felt like they just gave up on trying to make the game good. I beat all of them, all the way from Outbreak (Which though was a flop, I felt it was awesome.) up to Code ♥♥♥♥ing Veronica. And I loved them all. But now we have these Revelations where they MAKE YOU PAY FOR PARTS OF THE GAME. I just cant stand how these new games are trying so hard to take your money now without even trying to offer at least decent content for your money. Just look at the new Dues Ex, they have ♥♥♥♥ing microtransactions FOR A SINGLE PLAYER GAME. When will gamers say stop? Well I for one don't buy money grubbing games unless they are on sale. Take a word of advice from someone who has yet to regret paying for a game. Buy games ONLY when they are on sale or a series that NEVER dissapointed you. Bethesda, Blizzard, and Rockstar is my favorite but Fallout 4 was really a dissapointment for me. Though I got my play time for my pay out of it so I am not regretting. Still. Next Fallout game I will not buy until I check the gameplay. They ruined my trust. Do not ever trust EA! They are really getting out of hand making you pay for your games. They will reap what they sow sooner or later, all businesses die from it.PS: With just 3 percent less positive reviews, this game would get a ""mixed"" rating. Hey! Peeps! Lets all give this game an actually correct rating eh? Eh?! Who is with me?!Edit: Okay, I officially beat the game and I thought I couldnt get more dissapointed in this game. But I did. The Ada Wong campaign revealed 1 irrelevant thing that really didnt make much sense. On top of that, it took me like 4-5 hours to beat the last two campaigns, after the first two, which took me a good 20 hours, the rest will feel like it was lazily made and quickly put together just to keep costs down. Especially Ada Wongs which took me a good 2-3 hours to beat. Pitifiul. To add insult to injury was the ending but I wont say anything about it, just that it was dumb and pointless. Hell, Leons ending was a TON better. It was like, they literally started the campaigns in the order provided and got lazy half way through. Thats how it feels.This game is a major dissapointment and for a game that costs 40 bucks and offers 24 hours of playtime, this is highly overrated. Sure its DLC offers a lot of multiplayer that nobody plays anymore and offers virtually no actual fun, but hey! Totally worth it right?			"

												Having now played this game twice, I just can't see the overall merit to this one. Somewhere in here is a mechanically rich and endlessly satisfying shooter, but design-wise, the campaigns are all over the place, the design clearly at an impasse between the franchise's expectations and the current game's skill level, which is why the game still feels wonky and unresponsive even with its many agility-based commands. Jake's campaign is almost close to great, with a nice nod to Nemesis and a weapon set that favours the new mechanics and the shape-shifting enemies, but Leon's is awkward and Chris' is unbearable.

												There are 4 campaigns in the game, each played with different pairs of characters. All the campigns are intertwined with each other, showing each pair's journey through the main storyline. There is a LOT of gameplay here if you want to experience it all. Each campaign seems to play differently as well. It's a pretty great setup. Leon's campaign reminded me of Resident Evil 2, while Jake's campaign reminded me of Resident Evil 5. This game feels janky and unpolished a lot of the time. The dialogue is lacking and unimpressive. The graphics are mediocre, primarily from low texture quality and repetitive use of objects, textures and the like. Elements in many levels just feel all the same, with just the geometry changing. Some areas look visually impressive, but it's rare and short-lived. The controls and camera are ridiculous at times, but that's always how the Resident Evil franchise has been. Luckily, there are a lot of custom deaths when you fail quick time events, and they never get old.The level of quality varies GREATLY throughout the game... the beginning of Leon's campaign is just awful, stereotypical, and poorly executed. It gets better later on, though. Jake's campaign felt more consistent and solid, while also being less over-the-top.Despite all the bad, the game is actually fun COOPERATIVELY. I wouldn't recommend playing this game if you're by yourself, since relying on the AI is not fun, and you can share the ridiculousness of the game with a friend. It's like watching a bad movie and making fun of it... it ends up being fun. I highly prefer Resident Evil 5, as it's better in every single way, but if you're looking for another Resident Evil game, there's a lot of content here.			"

												I've been a fan o RE since the beginning and unfortunately I can't recommend this game. This would've been fun if it weren't for all the incessant quick time events and chase sequences. The problem is probably with the port, the game is clearly made to be played with a controller. Trying to run with a keyboard during a chase will drive you insane, especially with all the ridiculous fixed camera changes. Seriously, I'm still trying to finish Chris's campaign, that last chase is absurd! And without checkpoints! Quick time events were the main cause of my deaths. Which is a shame, because when you're going around killing zombies or whatever it get's pretty fun. But before you know it, you're thrust into one those obligatory race, underwater(really?), chase sequences, quick button smashing that all games seem to have nowadays and then everything goes to hell.  The combat gameplay is good, it feels great to be able to take down a zombie with your hands. Every character feels different, the dodging mechanic works (once you get the hang of it) and the weapons, while not the best, definitely doesn't detract from the game. The story is... fine. Your usual bag of cliches. Although it succeeds in creating a frenetic apocalyptic atmosphere.The characters are great for the most part (though I wish there was a bit more of race and gender diversity). It was nice seeing Leon and Sherry again. But can someone explain to me why the hell does Leon have feelings for Ada? They were together for like, 2 hours, in RE2! Ugh! All his scenes where they mentioned this were groan worthy. The atmosphere is really where the game succeeds  Especially in Chris and Jake's campaign, the set pieces looked great, from Europe to China, they all had a distinctive feel. Unfortunately, the first half of Leon's was really out of pace. They tried to bring the survival horror aspect back, but it doesn't work anymore, not with the frantic combat style of the game.Overall I'm disappointed. This game could have been great, but it fails in its execution.			"

RE6 compared to other RE games, even the classic's, gives more story line selection and characters & more control over your game & how you play it. Fun, exciting & sometimes terrifying. RE6 add's 2 story mode's with 4 characters. Gamemodes such as onslaught and merc's. Online ranking & full controller support both xlive & direct input's. Split screen mode allowing you to play with a friend or family. Options & settings are great, story mode is fun & multiplayer is even more fun. Steam also seems to give L4D characters in the merc's gamemode switching the zombies and specials into L4D zombies and specials. Overall, game is well made & worth getting on steam.Overall rating: 9.5Graphics: 10Sound: 8Gameplay: 8.5Fun factor: 8.5			"

												Resident Evil 6 is a a good game, but not a great game. It's something I'd recommend picking up on sale, but not even for the $30 price tag it has now. Its got plenty of action, a more convenient inventory system, and has a nice look; however, the story and gameplay is what doesn't make the cut.The run and gun is probably one of the more satisfying changes I've seen (which is apparently what some people are agonizing about). While it could be re-worked a bit to feel smoother that's not so much the issue. The problem is, how the whole experience just works out. Obnoxious falling over after being shot, the tripping over bodies, crappy cover system, and  terrible camera angles/forced aiming for the sake of a in-game 'scene' all work against the game. That's just a few of the problems which have come with the game. Each campaign (4 all together) has a problem though in their own right. Leon's is probably one of the better one reminiscing more of an old schoool Resident Evil take. The constant falling over after being shot doesn't become apparent until you hit up Chris' campaign. Then, perhaps the worst of all is Jake's campaign. Which attempts to put you into a more cat and mouse type game which just works out terribly for the run and gun gameplay. Some areas where they try and encourage stealth can be laughably avoided by just sprinting past the entirety of it.I applaud Capcom for trying to deliver so many experiences and different play-styles into one package, but it ends up just falling short. Instead of receiving one fantastic experience, we get four different mediocre ones. Then comes the story. Terribly transitioned flashbacks, shallow characters and your typical 'conspiracy' stuff all show up in RE6. The story naturally requires you to play all 4 campaigns to understand it completely. Each campaign is a puzzle piece that doesn't quite make sense til you complete it. The part that really screws it over is just how they stick in details that apparently happen in the gap between RE4-5 to this. Things come up that make you say, ""I don't remember that happening at all!"" Which Capcom then tags in, ""Oh, this happened in that 6 year gap between RE5 and 6 somewhere."" The story isn't necessarily bad, but it's just okay. Since the story is split into 4 campaigns the experience is different and it shows that Capcom gave more love to one campaign vs another.Overall, I had fun with the game. Coop is probably what became this games saving grace for me as my friend and I tackled it together. The segments of the game which have you ""searching for a partner"" are somewhat sad as you'll find pretty much nobody, but the AI that takes the players' place is great. The AI does their objective and they do it well without you having to babysit them. If you're a fan of Resident Evil I'd say pick it up on sale, or if you're new to the series pick it up on sale too. It's a fun game with friends, but not worth the current price tag. Which is why, I will not recommend this game. I paid $10 and felt I got my money's worth (still am), but would not do it for $30. Just wait for one of the many Steam sales and have your fun too.			"

												I have not played any other of the franchise (I heard the others are much better). The keybindings are terrible i.e. 3 buttons to sprint in a straigt line W+Space+Tab. Camera is very jerky and constently wants to center itself. Melee attacks usally go to the front center of the screen instead of the enemy. Then some werid white blurry glow on the bottom half of the screen started to appear and disappear. And yes my rig is very capable to run this game(5760X1080 Ultra constantly over 120fps)			"

												Boring story, repetitive gameplay, the coop consists in opening doors and activate buttons, the controls and cameras are one of the worst I've played. The Leo's part is the only one I enjoyed because the enviroment. The Chris and Pierce part is a masterpiece of crap, boring, stupid and ridiculous: The controls of vehicles such cars or planes are pathetic as it's animation, feels like a 1995 game. The part where the BOW is hunting you is horribly boring and scripted, the controls are so bad you can't even cross doors. I played this game coop with a friend, and we tried to complete the game but instead it completed us. I can only recommend this game for 2$.			"

												Beat this game a challenge from my SO, even co-op it with a friend.This game is not good, it is hilariously bad. This game threw horror and game play mechanics right out the window and I think some of the story got stuck out there too.The story line to this game is absurd and some thing the characters do with a straight face is downright silly. Ada's story straight up pair her with a random no name agent who has no mechanics because it was supposed to be solo. The movement and jumping controls are a mess and the cut scenes are filled with the most inconsistent QTE's I've ever seen (some time space is to dodge, sometimes is space+r, sometime you click etc.)I pity the person who play this game because they loved RE5.

												The only people who don't like this one are all the butthurt RE fans who were super butthurt this wasn't survival-horror when it came out but was even more straight up action-horror than 4 and 5 were. People didn't like the way Capcom was taking the series, hence 7 going back to more survival-horror. This is a much more polished game than 4 and 5 were, has no errors glitches or crashes, is better looking, has much better controls than any RE game before it, the best herb system in any RE game (including 7), better weapons, better inventory system, just a much more polished experience than 4 and 5 were. Which those games are still great games in their own right. One huge thing it has over 7 is its length. It has 4 campaigns and each one is longer than 7, making this game easily 3-4 times as long, not to mention it has more replaay value than 7 as well.One main complaint I had with those games was no zombies. The only enemies in RE4 were incestual hillbillies and in RE5 enemies were shirtless black guys or black sludge monsters. Thankfully RE6 FINALLY brought back ZOMBIES! ♥♥♥♥ing Capcom. One of the only flaws I can think of is that it is pretty linear. But so is every other RE game I guess. This game just doesn't have any keycard item find backtracking. You can re-run a campaign as the second character to make it a little more interesting for a second playthrough if you want. The herb system is the best one yet in a RE game: you find herbs, hit a key to automatically combine them and add them to your inventory as pills, then hit 1 to take a pill. It couldn't be more simple yet some reviewers complained about it. They also complained about there being so many quick time events. QTE's killed RE5 and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it of a lot of fun, easily its worst aspect. They were horrible, especially the QTE Wesker fight. But they are done differently here and are actually fine. Although they are not really a problem here, I do think games in general just need to stop using QTE's period.I'm also amazed this was such a good port because normally Capcom is hit or miss with their pc games. The women are super hot and the game is a blast. 8/10, buy this for sure.			"

												This game has done it's level best to troll me out of my mind. While I went in with low expectations towards the writing and controls, because, let's face it, resident evil isn't really itself unless there's a considerable amount of cheese and unwieldy movement involved, I was unprepared for the sheer amount of annoyance the game insisted on throwing at me.For starters the game is dark. As in 'I thought I had made a mistake while setting my brightness' or 'ohmygodmyscreenjustbroke' dark. There's is some kind of procedural darkness tomfolery involved so that the darkness looks like a laptopscreen slanted at a slightly wrong angle so the colors and brightness looks kinda polarized all the time. And while the characters have flashlights, which they even activate at certain points when the game 'allows' it, it wouldn't have been amiss to be able to activate this flashlight when needed.Secondly, the game flat out forgets to supply ammunition at times. While I admit to not being a crack shot and played the game on veteran difficulty, i.e. the middle of five difficulty levels, there's something insanely frustrating about not having a single bullet to your name and then constantly finding those skillpoint pickups in every crate you bust open. In one area I experienced this I just ran through the entire area, as the enemies didn't really have any means of stopping me, while at a second location during a boss battle where you're supposed to provide sniper fire I had to wait for a zombie to drop in so that I could scrounge up five rounds to actually contribute to the scene. The piece de resistance however was a hallway/balcony where you're in a squad of five other characters, where the npcs hosed down the enemies with gunfire that couldn't kill the single remaining enemy while I meandered about with my knife out because the game at that point had supplied me with skillpoint pickups instead of bullets.If you like, you can set the game with unlimited ammo. For all your guns. As an unlockable skill though it turns out. One that I was hesitant to use at first because it feels like cheating. The more I played the game though, the more it felt like this is how the game is supposed to be played. The game so desperately wants to be a survival horror and gears of warlike game at the same time that it fails at accomplishing either. I lasted until the final boss of the second campaign before realising that the entire map as a whole didn't have enough ammo in it for me to complete the battle, especially not with an AI partner. At that point the game breathed its last in my eyes.Among other joys this game has to offer, enemies will knock you to the ground. Usually this is mostly a tedious break in the flow of the game because you screw up or because the combined number of enemies that can grab you from afar, knock you down from afar, stun you in place or one-hit killgrab you all exist in the same space as you at the same time.But if you loose all your health and get 'downed', then all it takes for you to have to start over again from the last checkpoint (and need I even mention unskippable cutscenes at this point?) is one enemy patiently waiting for you to be revived so that he can finish the job or for the monster that downed you to hit you again. Like the snipers or any late game enemy that happens to be close by for that matter. Being hit like this in a boss battle might as well just have failed you instantly as the boss times his next attack so that you're resurrected just as his next attack hits.I am so happy that I bought this game on sale and happier still that Resident Evil 7 has been announced as a 'return to the roots' with a stronger focus on the actual horror aspect the series was known for. But you know...buy it on sale when it is released...just in case.			"

												After the terribleness of Resident Evil 5, I have to say that Resident Evil 6 has one of the most interesting storylines of any game I've played really, and the way it's incorporated into the gameplay itself, rather than just in a cutscene for example, really shows the direction I hope all games will take.There's a few spoilers in here, but just to touch on just the main concept of the story, I really think that telling a story about how the protagonist becomes a zombie, and how you get to experience the sort of degredation of their eyesight; like they're kind of blind, and can only sort of sense moving bodies around them, is a really exciting story!! Grappling with the overwhelming sense of the infection; still having to fight off zombies, operate various mechanisms, and try to protect your partner while the world goes black around you, and you can only briefly see glimmers of footfalls. A burst of light as a barrel is knocked over nearby!! Seeing a zombie decapitaded by a trap, and then have to blindly make your way past that trap, just hoping you're somehow clear of it and never being sure at all! It was really exciting, and one of the best gameplay experiences that I can honestly remember having!. . . .hmm? Oh, ahm, was that all, just a glitch in the game? Because it was happening a lot, and I thought it was, uhmm, maybe intentionally? Oh, er, the game's just really glitchy? Oh. Yeah, it did freeze up a few times too, and, I guess I was pretending that I had fully become a zombie at that point. . .well, if anyone wants to make a game where the player experiences what a zombie sense, and provides the zombie player with a gameplay experience of how a zombie actually behaves, then this is really the game that shows what's that like!! I don't care if it glitches, I really had a lot of fun with it! It is really, really glitchy, though.			"

												Do I recommend it? Yes, of course yes!  As  a RE fan I played it like really thoroughly, not because of achievements and so, but because I enjoy it. It`s amazing.  All these campaigns and how they are tangled together -  what a great job people`ve done there!  Leon and Helena - the most curios plot, Chris and Piers - the most touching one and Sherry and Jake - the most action full one. And.. Ada`s campaign, well, honestly, I can`t stand Ada. But this campaign аfulled all the gaps in the plot, however. Oh, and the think I liked in 3 main campaigns is the humour. God, immortal Simmons, fabulous Lepotitsa (""You can leave your heat on!""), cuty cuty Chaos thingy and some funny words J`ava and other infected were shouting out. Consider me a madman, but instead of being creepy, they all were so cuuuute. And of high quality.  Of course, due to my writers passions, I more focusing on the plot - well, this game really, really good at it.  By the way, separate gratitudes to voice actors, especially to Matthew Mercer (Leon), Roger Craig Smith (Chris) and Troy Baker (Jake). Guys - you`re awesome!  Atmosphere and camera views are also`ve done some fascinating job! Director of photography is a genious!And his crew as well. And people, who were doing the atmosphere and graphics - I owe you one! But the main benefit of this part are the mechanics. God, I don`t know still yet a game that can have such UI, gameplay and mechanics.. Moving backwards reloading my gun and shooting at the same time browsing inside my inventory..so fast and so comfortable!Gosh! Also the ways of killing enemies, styles of weapon holding, so brutal and cool!  All in all, RE6 crew created something unbelievable and divine. Now, this part has become one of  my favourite RE parts and, of course, my favourite games. Thanks Mikami for creating such a seria..			"

												OK, let's see. Why did I say No to this game? Because I don't want Capcom to make the same mistake again. The game contains 4 campaign, one of which is captivating. I played Leon’s campaign repetitively, like an actual insane person. I can’t say that it has any major issues, expect the game’s general issues, which the entire game has. I know the dialogue is a little more than cheesy, and you won’t really want to listen to the character’s talk, but the rest is fine. The game (I’m speaking exclusively No Hope difficulty, the hardest mode of the game) doesn’t give you much ammo, which makes it much MUCH more survivor than Resident Evil 5, and you’ll have to do a lot of headshots combined with the following melee attack in order to get through chapters. Of course, sometimes it get pretty annoying when killing an enemy is mandatory, you’ve used your bullets judiciously, but the game is refusing to give you bullets and instead keeps showering you with skill points. This campaign is dark and nostalgic. I actually lived through it. I missed Raccoon city so much; I missed the atmosphere of Resident Evil 3, and this game came so close, which I’m grateful for. Thank you, Capcom. The bosses, as always, are needy pathetic characters you can’t grow a liking or respect for (which doesn’t count for a flaw.)Chris’s campaign is where the bugs and issues come to life for the first time, but the campaign still feels like an actual game. Here, you will see enemies actually shooting “through” each other. While you can’t possibly shoot an enemy through another enemy (the first enemy is blocking the other one), enemies can do this. Their bullets fly right through each other and reach you.It has ridiculous artificial intelligence. When you’re hiding behind a wall and an enemy is using a machine gun from 100 feet away to kill you, the enemy will aim at you even when you’re moving behind the wall. HOW CAN THE ENEMY SEE WHERE I’M MOVING FROM BEHIND THE WALL?There are these round and explosive enemies who will explode when you get close to them or kick them. Piers, your partner for this session, keeps kicking them all the while, regardless of where you’re standing. If I had a cent for every time Piers killed me, I’d have a dollar. Then there are the headshots, which is a very crucial thing in the No Hope difficulty of the game. When you do a headshot, then enemy starts crying and pressing the wound, giving you a chance to perform a lethal melee attack. But the thing is, if you do 1000 more headshots, the enemy won’t show reaction again until he’s done crying, meaning you won’t be able to get the enemy to react again until it’s done with his first reaction. Now that’s just a big flaw.Oh, the Camera, the Camera. Do I even want to tell you about the camera? The heroes are constantly looking around, and the camera follows their looks. When they’re done sightseeing, you’re usually attacked instantly, which is hideously annoying in No Hope difficulty, where you can actually die because of that. Sometimes a bus is following you, and you have to dash in order to escape. The character is looking at his front, but the camera only shows his back, which results in you being blocked by some crate or something, and then dying. In Chris’s campaign, luckily, there isn’t much to block your way. But in Leon’s campaign, you can be sure to die at least once. There are these cut scenes that you can’t skip, which will annoy you to death for two reasons. One, the enemy has the ability to move during these scene, but you’re not. And when the cut scene is finished, the enemy will attack you instantaneously, giving you null chance of defending yourself.Now, please pay attention that I got an S (the highest score possible) on every chapter of this game without cheating or using tactics that count as cheating. So I’m not annoyed because I don’t know how to play or anything. The game is seriously flawed. One time, a truck ran over my partner Helena in chapter one, and she died. I’m only made responsible for my own character in this game. Why the hell does my partner die like that at times?I don’t have much more to say about Chris’s campaign. I should add that it’s STILL worth playing. Once you get used to the bugs and flaws, you’ll really like this game. It has beautiful bosses. If you know what I mean by beautiful. Really fun to kill.Don’t even play the third and fourth campaign. I continuously felt like I’m waiting for the game to begin. The chapters were either too short or too long. And they didn’t feel like games, they felt like prologues. Speaking of prologues, the prologue of the game is most boring thing ever. Helena is dying and you have to save her. The more boring thing is that you have to play that part of the game for a second and third time (as Leon, and then as Ada).The story was beautiful. This is the only Resident Evil game with an actual storyline, with character development. It’s no longer about saving a certain somebody and escaping a certain town (which happened for five games), this one actually contain some drama. You may even cry. :D Don’t say I didn’t tell ya’. ;)Verdict:Do not buy this game if you’re not a Resident Evil fanatic, because you’d only be supporting a failure. You’d be rooting for another game of this type. There is much more I can say to dissuade you from buying this game, but I’m not gonna. This is becoming longer than I had expected.  "

												Resident Evil 6 is a game that is constantly throwing new mechanics at the screen to keep things fresh, not actually caring if they are well implemented or even improve the game experience - Yes, you can drive a motorbike, pilot a plane, steer a boat. You can also join another player's game as a creature and try to kill him. Is it fun? Who cares, it's there!The basic shooting mechanics are solid, but the atrocious amount of frustrating QTEs, poor level design, as well as a laughable bad story/dialog make this game hard to recommend even to die-hard fans of the RE franchise.However, if you are still interested in the game, make sure to have someone to play with you throughout the campaingn, as a coop buddy is certanly better than the stupid AI.

												I'm gonna be absolutely honest with all of you -- before I got this game, I would have told everyone in the world that it was a big, huge, slimy, stinking, rancid heap of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥  After playing it, however...If you are looking for a fun co-op game with a totally over the top (hilarious) plot, funny characters, pretty solid shooting, big bosses, and a mechanic that lets you thumbs up your partner whenever he doesn't ♥♥♥♥ up, this game is actually pretty fun to play.  if you are a hardcore RE fan though, you may not be able to stomach what this series has become, but you would be missing out on what can be a pretty fun game if you can put all that aside.

												Not as bad as people make it out to be. This game would probably have had less of a **** storm if it was a new IP. True, it's more actiony. True, it's more linear than RE5. And sure, the game's checkpoint system holds your hand leaving you feel like a little lost puppy who needs to be babied. But, honestly, it's not THAT bad. The game still has some redeeming qualities, and there's a few parts where Capcom did a good job. The second chapter of Leon's campaign is a perfect example of a good level done right. Despite it's linearity and confusing controls there's a lot of good stuff crammed in this game. It's not perfect but it at least deserves a solid 7 out of 10 which, in my book, is ""good.""			"

												This game, even though nostalgia RE gamers might disagree is my fav of the series, not only is it a good story, but i absolutely LOVE the combat in this game, aside from annoying QTE's sometimes. If you get used to it, it becomes fairly easy. I've played it so much by now Veteran/proffesional has become easy for me. I dont know why i consume my time into this game, but it makes me replay campaigns over and over just for that 100% completion, same as old RE games where you just want to get everything out of it. Man i cant think of any other good reason to buy this, just do it. I mean it has Ada in tight leather pants, Leon's hair in HD. A lot of girls bending over in tight places.But mostly, it has Chris with new ""thanks"" voices, so deff worth it.THANKS (y)			"

												This game is not as bad as many people make it out to be. I recommend at least buying it at a sale price and trying it out for yourself before judging it. Many have issues with how the game controls but once you understand how the game works you'll find that it has an in-depth combat mechanic/system that takes quite a bit of skill to master and get used to. The game's problem is giving you an extensive combat system with so many things to do but not explaining how the game works and how you should play. As a fan of the series you'll either hate it or love it but if you enjoy the mercenaries from previous entries, then you'll love the mercenaries of this game.			"

												I enjoyed this game. The story and gameplay were good enough to lure me in. Story:There are 4  different campaigns in this game each with its own style. For example, Leon story has more emphasis on survival while the other two campaigns focused more on action.  All of the campaigns connect with each other in the story's timeline. Gameplay:The gameplay is essentially the same as resident evil 5, only this time the characters can move while aiming.  Quick time events are excessive and can get repetitive. However, quick time events can be turned off in the options.			"

												 The main enemy in this game are not the mutated monsters, but the deffective camera at crucial points, because the vamera it's not following the character controlled by the player, instead, as many other unfortunate games, because the developers wanted to ""SHOW"" their ""marvelous"" creations, there are fixed cameras all atound the maps, bomytol taking the closest one to the player, with catastrophic results ehen you are chased by an enemy invulnerable by a script, and you lose either the view, your charecter hits a wall, and iy;s game over, with an unskippable  horendous animation.

												On the whole, this game is best enjoyed with another player running co-op with you through the campaigns. Graphics are very well done, weapons are detailed and sound fantastic. Voice acting is mediocre on some characters but absolutely stunning on others. Interface can be clunky due to the obvious port from console version. This can occasionally cause movement issues where the camera locks in a certain angle that makes your directional movement very unintuitive. Not really a huge deal except for quick time action sequences that involve running toward/away from the camera; can be frustrating during these times. Otherwise, the controls are effective, not too hard to get used to and the melee combat is surprisingly solid and satisfying.			"

												Melee Masters 6 takes the series to an even more action oriented direction by removing all inventory management and substituting shops and money with perks and xp.Capcom tries really hard to appeal to as large of an audience as possible with their ""woman and a giraffe"" approach.Even though Melee Master veterans will love seeing a lewd woman make her return in this title Capcom has added a giraffe in attempt to get the attentions of players who don't buy games that don't have atleast one giraffe in them.The problem is though MM6 fails to fully cater to anyone. Fans of the woman don't really want the giraffe in their game and the fans of the giraffe don't all really care for the woman.It's no secret Japanese look to America for inspiration and then put their own unique spin on what they learn. It's quite clear when you look at not only the direction game has taken but how Capcom does business these days.But the game has local co-op so just for that I'm going to give the game a solid 9/10.The online doesn't work so that's all you've got really. I mean we all have friends who come over and play games with us regularly right?So yeah as I said, six out of ten.			"

												Well, yeah, I would say this is worth playing, not the BEST resident evil game but well made holding 4 campaign modes, all with their own areas that overlap with others, a good co-op feel and system as well as a really fun score attack mode.One of the things I really loved about this though was the sheer number of contextual actions it allows you, be it taking an ax out of a zombies head to plunge it into it's hear or taking a severed hand attacking you and throwing it into a microwave.Honestly it isn't the resident evil we all grew up with, but that does not stop it being a good game and one I plan to play again, it looks great, sounds great and it shows that some of the people who made it actually cared a lot more then the press hate it got as soon as it came out, get it on sale, give it a go and have fun.

												Its not the originals of Survival Horror we all used to adore and love more an action orinitated horror game these days but its definitely the best Resident Evil title to date, gameplay is solid, its fun, combat is fun, there's tons of hours of content here with 4 different storylines to follow and 7 playable characters, the storys are actually pretty good too, i especially like the Chris story, best campaign for me though was Ada's it had more of the 'old school' RE feel to it.Good points:Inventory system has been revamped, its a wheel based system to switch now, it gets a little getting used to but its much better.Graphics are great.Storys are all good.Some light puzzle solving in parts.The new protaginists are all great characters.Has challenge modes if that interests you.Some replayability with the collectibles.AI Partner isnt brain dead.Bad points:Linear 95% of the game, almost all on rails few moments when you get to deviate away taking an alternative route.QTE's (quick time events) some campaigns dont really have many, then others do, Leon's is a ballache for QTE's.There's a gas boss in Leon's campaign that you have to kill, most bosses in the game have a specific weak spot to exploit, this guys just a true bullet sponge, you have to wait like 10+ minutes while he runs around killing all the civilians before he goes down, other than that the boss fights seemed fine.All in all its a great game i got nearly 30 hours out of it and i only did the campaigns pretty fast, so there's a lot of time to sink in here, especially if your a achievement collector. 9/10			"

												Well, It's a good action game, pretty much like RE5 was, tough much of the complaints about the game are exactly about that. It no longer feels like a ""Resident Evil"" game to be honest (even less so than RE5), but that doesn't mean it's bad, it's actually pretty fun. The 3 different campaigns change things up quite a bit in terms of ambience: Leon's is a little bit slower paced, similar to RE4, Jake's is more like RE5, and Chris's is much more action oriented. The 3 play pretty much the same, but they ""feel"" different, and that's good. There's also a 4th campaign with Ada, which is probably the best one since it feels more like old-school RE than any other thing in RE6.Weapons and inventory systems are poorly designed, just like the ones in RE5. They're functional, but they could've done a better job at it. Weapon customization is gone, replaced by a skills system, which is not too bad, but you don't feel as involved in it as in previous games... you just select a few passives and that's it. Combat is much improved, with more mobility for characters and ways to dodge enemy attacks. Play as Chris and you might think a mutant with a rocket launcher would be worse than regular zombies, but play as Leon and you'll see how dangerous zombies can be. Overall, it's a very entertaining game. The plot is fine, it's great to see some familiar faces again, and the new ones are interesting enough to justify maybe a sequel with only them, who knows. Monsters are varied and fun, and mosts levels offer a decent challenge, and are varied enough too.Mercenaries is no doubt the best of the series, and once you finish every campaign, it'll probably be a good time sink if you're into it. Here is more evident than ever where the new combat features shine. And about multiplayer... almost nobody plays anything else other than Mercenaries, the DLC modes are empty all the time, so they're not worth getting, since you need people to play them with and no one ever does. Integration with RE.net doesn't solve that, sadly. Co-op is nice, and not nearly as annoying as it was in RE5. That being said, in the single player campaign, your partner is actually helpful, not a burden like before.For all old Resident Evil fans, my recommendation would be to treat this game as something else, based on the world of Resident Evil. In the story, over the years things have been escalating, and now everything everywhere is messed up, not just a Mansion/Precint/Small Town, so it's hard to think how we could get back those slow, scary and suspenseful moments from previous games. I know Revelations tried, but if feels dated and comparably too slow and shallow. You'll find some of that tense vibe here tough (with Leon and Ada, and sometimes Jake), but not that often. For anyone else, just try it, it's a fun experience. As an action game, it's great.			"

												I am a big fan of the series. I have played every single Resident Evil title. I have the game on my PS3 so my gametime is more than it is shown on my Steam account. The game is not that bad, but there are some VERY annoying things. Try to walk while aimming WTF?!? Why is Leon hopping? Is he Bugs Bunny with an ACME gun or it is just bugs? I was wondering what game am I playing - WWE or Resident Evil. What are these deadly skills of even Helena? How can a woman wreck you this way? These things do not really happen in real life but whatever it is Resident Evil not Sims. So far I can say that Resident Evil 4 is far better than this game and still the best title from the series. Even all the cons it has an amazing storyline and it is worth a buy!PS- If possible, use a controller xD			"

												Leon's Campaign gets a thumbs up. I am writing this because I found Chris' campaign to be an absolute POS. If we remove the resident evil feel of Leon's campaign and replace it with overly predictable and poorly designed action sequences we get the boring, mildy frustrating, and overall lackluster experience that I would call Chris' campaign. It is the single reason I will not be recommending this game at full price; since a fourth of the game is disapointing at best. If you can get it cheap it isn't a bad game. I had fun with Leon's campaign and the mercenaries mode, but I would just as soon skipped the whole thing.			"

												I consider this Resident Evil out of all Resident Evils as the ""Black Sheep Parody"" of the Resident Evil Franchise. It is so bad, that it's good. The gameplay is entertaining and the graphics, SFX and overall content is great. Now as for the story line absolutely bonkers of a plotline, I mean gee whiz is it goofy. You play through several different campaigns of familiar characters as they all interconnect with eachother through the story which gives you wicked cases of Deja Vu. I am not ♥♥♥♥ing kidding its straight vertigo from start to finish. Now for the rest of the game...LoL #OMG where do I begin.The actual control scheme, camera fixtures and control reactions to this game is gawd awful. The charatcers are so rushed and unfleshed out it's like I am in Die Hard with zombies. The times though that we played through in co-op was just hilarious because of the amount of silliness surrounding this entire game. This game is laid with so much QTE (Quick Time Events) you would immediately just rage or laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off to how much you will die or repeat from this throughout the campaigns in such ridiculous ways. I mean its a joke because the enemies will be so overwhelming and at times endless that you will be getting thrown around like a ragdoll and knocked down constantly, not to mention the bullet sponging (I freaking hate the screamers!) constantly throughout the game with the most irky jerky over the shoulder camera work ever. The cover system is so bipolar, and so are the enemies when you fight them on higher difficulties. The game is that hilarious. For the most part the Co-op is where its at for the most parts, lots of cool modes that are fun if are drunk, high or just looking for a good laugh  to play together to have fun because if you are able to not take this game seriously you will find it funny or entertaining. As for the horror factor? Well hate to break it to you all but...IT DOES NOT EXIST HERE.The game has no horror elements, it feels like an action movie with zombies with one of the most outlandish story plots I still can't wrap my head around by the choices, cliche villians and just trying to understand where this is all going after the events of Re 4 & 5 which were excellent games. Its like I just watched a shoot'em up flick make love to a zombie...it is that bad. But past that when it's all said and done it is why I still recommend this game because it is still a good title because it completely parodies it's own mythology that you will have fun playing just from the sheer idiocy of everything you witness and play through on screen. Like a popcorn flick that you control. And when you encounter the fight with the nipple monster for the first time you know you can't take this game seriously anymore. I mean♥♥♥♥♥♥ what were they thinking!? Game is worth a laugh and a playthrough. Just only advice is don't buy it full price, get it on sale.			"

												Melee Masters 6 takes the series to an even more action oriented direction by removing all inventory management and substituting shops and money with perks and xp.Capcom tries really hard to appeal to as large of an audience as possible with their ""woman and a giraffe"" approach.Even though Melee Master veterans will love seeing a lewd woman make her return in this title Capcom has added a giraffe in attempt to get the attentions of players who don't buy games that don't have atleast one giraffe in them.The problem is though MM6 fails to fully cater to anyone. Fans of the woman don't really want the giraffe in their game and the fans of the giraffe don't all really care for the woman.It's no secret Japanese look to America for inspiration and then put their own unique spin on what they learn. It's quite clear when you look at not only the direction game has taken but how Capcom does business these days.But the game has local co-op so just for that I'm going to give the game a solid 9/10.The online doesn't work so that's all you've got really. I mean we all have friends who come over and play games with us regularly right?So yeah as I said, six out of ten.			"

												Gameplay: 9/10Storyline: 10/10Graphics: 9/10SoundTrack: 9/10Overall: 9.25/10This is a good f**king game... Worth every penny!!The story is set in 2013 and U.S President Adam Benford has decided to disclose the truth behind the Raccoon City Destruction Incident in 1998. The prime impetus behind choosing to do so is to curtain the revival in bioterrorist activity. Leon S. Kennedy, President’s close friend and Raccoon City survivor is standing by his side through this but as luck would have it; the venue suffers a bioterrorist attack and Leon is confronted with a situation he could’ve never imagined. The President has disfigured beyond recognition and now Leon has to make a decision that will change everything. Simultaneously, Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance member Chris Redfield reaches the fictitious city of Lanshiang akin to Hong Kong, which is under a threat of a bioterrorist attack. With all countries exposed to these threats and attacks, the entire world’s population is unified by a common fear and anxiety that there is nothing that can be done.			"

												Well, It's a good action game, pretty much like RE5 was, tough much of the complaints about the game are exactly about that. It no longer feels like a ""Resident Evil"" game to be honest (even less so than RE5), but that doesn't mean it's bad, it's actually pretty fun. The 3 different campaigns change things up quite a bit in terms of ambience: Leon's is a little bit slower paced, similar to RE4, Jake's is more like RE5, and Chris's is much more action oriented. The 3 play pretty much the same, but they ""feel"" different, and that's good. There's also a 4th campaign with Ada, which is probably the best one since it feels more like old-school RE than any other thing in RE6.Weapons and inventory systems are poorly designed, just like the ones in RE5. They're functional, but they could've done a better job at it. Weapon customization is gone, replaced by a skills system, which is not too bad, but you don't feel as involved in it as in previous games... you just select a few passives and that's it. Combat is much improved, with more mobility for characters and ways to dodge enemy attacks. Play as Chris and you might think a mutant with a rocket launcher would be worse than regular zombies, but play as Leon and you'll see how dangerous zombies can be. Overall, it's a very entertaining game. The plot is fine, it's great to see some familiar faces again, and the new ones are interesting enough to justify maybe a sequel with only them, who knows. Monsters are varied and fun, and mosts levels offer a decent challenge, and are varied enough too.Mercenaries is no doubt the best of the series, and once you finish every campaign, it'll probably be a good time sink if you're into it. Here is more evident than ever where the new combat features shine. And about multiplayer... almost nobody plays anything else other than Mercenaries, the DLC modes are empty all the time, so they're not worth getting, since you need people to play them with and no one ever does. Integration with RE.net doesn't solve that, sadly. Co-op is nice, and not nearly as annoying as it was in RE5. That being said, in the single player campaign, your partner is actually helpful, not a burden like before.For all old Resident Evil fans, my recommendation would be to treat this game as something else, based on the world of Resident Evil. In the story, over the years things have been escalating, and now everything everywhere is messed up, not just a Mansion/Precint/Small Town, so it's hard to think how we could get back those slow, scary and suspenseful moments from previous games. I know Revelations tried, but if feels dated and comparably too slow and shallow. You'll find some of that tense vibe here tough (with Leon and Ada, and sometimes Jake), but not that often. For anyone else, just try it, it's a fun experience. As an action game, it's great.			"

												Coming from all Resident Evil games since the first one, I would have to say that they did a very good job on Reisdent Evil 6. Sure, most of the critics have already a foundation of bringing it down since they're already basing it on Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City (and I agree with ORC being bad) but that's them. That's their opinion.It may be a more action oriented Resident Evil but they did quite a lot here just to cater a lot of action gamers in particular. Oh and the action scenes are downirhgt intense so that you can be at the edge of your seat without wiping the sweat on your hands since you need to react on most situations or it's a cheap death for you.Resident Evil 6 may not please all fans of the series but it simply exists here as more of an action game and a fan service on the side as well. If sitting in your desk over the weekend is your thing while looking for some time to kill. Then Resident Evil 6 feels right at home for you.			"

												I've been playing this game since it came out, mostly in its online co-op mode. It sort of made impression on me as a solid 7/10 game. In a way, this game is overrated but still manages to be fun to a large extent. The controls are broken, but some segments seem stiff and clunky. They do not, however, make playing, or even beating the game impossible!Overall, this is a relatively fun game that many will rate somewhat above its realistic quality. CO-OP play is a nice feature and well done. Mechanics are better in RE6 compared to the rest in the series but still far from stellar. Try it for yourself, I know most gamers won't be disappointed!

												Прежде всего нужно понимать, что RE6 это не тот старый, каноничный survival horror, который многие фаныты серии привыкли видеть в частях с 1-3 и некоторых ответлениях, да и вообще не horror, а прежде всего неплохой кооперативный шутер от 3-его лица, с весьма хорошими кинематографичными сценами. Поэтому если простить игре ( уже в третий, хотя нет, второй раз) ее новую геимплейную концепцию, то на мой взгляд это весьма хорошая игра, да и к тому же можно пройти вместе с другом, и кстати, может horror составляющая почти на нуле, но survival (в рамках крнцепции данной игры) там вполне присутствует.Рекомендую.)

												As a huge resident evil fan, I really appreciated 6. The plot was well written and kept me interested throughout play and has a great reunion of all the different characters from the other games. However what really kills this game for me and many others is the overcasualfied gameplay and barely managable inventory system. Some parts demand to shoot a lot of enemies requiring a lot of ammo and the inventory system in this game makes scenes like that unmanageable. I still would reccomend this game however because even with these flaws 6 still remains a great game.			"

												A lengthy game that's split into 4 campaigns; length is around 24 hours in total. There's also some multiplayer modes, but no one plays them. The mercenaries mode is as fun as before, and there are 9 characters to pick from, 16 if you count the alternate costumes. As for the campaigns:Leon: Touted as the best campaign, it's the lengthiest and the 'main' one, since more of the plotline is revealed. Overall decent, some chapters are better than others. Chapter 1 is linear as♥♥♥♥♥♥and a missed opportunity, while chapter 4 and 5 is  the game's crowning achievement.Chris: zombies with guns; turns into a bland third person shooter in chapter 2; gets good again in the following chapter. Overall the weakest campaign because it tries to be a generic third person shooter.Jake: an interesting campaign. It tries being like RE3, but the creature chasing you disappears a fifth of the way into the game before reappearing randomly at the end. Overall it's a level below Leon's campaign.Ada: My pick for the best campaign; it's built as a single player experience with a lot more puzzles and sneaking around than the other campaigns. The entire story comes together here, winds up being kinda silly and simplistic. All in all I'd say around a 6 or 7. It's decent, and if you're into RE it's pretty good.			"

												It may not be the Resident Evil you're used to, but it is much more fun in co-op with a friend. Different intertwining plot lines for characters also take this game's replayability up a notch. Combat is more fluent and less frustrating than in RE5, as characters can dodge attacks and shoot while moving. Overall, movement is easier and doesn't feel like you're controlling a log of wood. Story is good, at least for me, being not the fan and adept of this series from the very beginning.			"

												I do really love RE series, even though I read a lot of negative review of this game I still love it and already playing this game over and over. Yeah this game is a little more action than horror, but it fixed the crappy movement of old RE series. If you think lack of survival, the try NO HOPE difficulty. I had try Leon story and it is really challenging. The story may be a little bit awkward and doensn't make senses sometime but it is a game so just enjoy it. There are still few gliches and minor bug like when I played mercenaries using Chris and I sliding while running the my char was sinking into earth which make me had to end the game. But there are a lot of game with worse problem, so as long it didn't happened occasionally I could stand with it.I played co op mode with my cousin and it really do have double fun since the AI won't make mistakes and have unlimited ammo while my cousin do a lot more joke.Weaponry is a little bit different than RE4 or RE5. I prefer the previous series weaponry which allow me to freely customize and upgrade my shotgun. Leon story bring back the memories of Raccoon city, Chris story has a lot more gunfight like a RE5, Jake story a little bit more like RE3 when ustanak chases him and Sherry over and over, and lastly Ada story just like RE4 when you play a solo game.In the end my suggestion is if you have a friend or family who share the loves of RE series then play this game coop, it worth your time.

												First, let's get through the negatives. Yes, the writing is mostly a joke — it resembles the movies too much, and goes nowhere interesting. The palette is pretty boring, or at least it bored me; there's too many washed out blues, reds, and purples throughout the game. The camera was jerky at times (though the initial complaints of it being too zoomed in was something I never understood). Leon is no longer funny and Helena is even worse. Some enemies reminded me too much of L4D, a game which I was not a huge fan of. Cover shooting is kind of tacked on. That's about it.This game is still good. There's so much content here. 4 different campaigns, each with several different environments you play through. There are SO many environments in this game! There's also a ton of enemies; granted, many of them are just small variations of one another, but it's still an impressive amount overall. There's plenty of weapons, the melee system has been revamped, the inventory has been revamped... Capcom really put a lot of effort into the game. No Mercy Mercenaries is also incredible and totally blows Resident Evil 5 Mercenaries out of the water. The co-op action and content of this game more or less makes Resident Evil 5 unplayable and irrelevant now.Too many people, mostly nostalgia-driven, played this just looking for something to complain about I think. They failed to realize all the great things it did as a result. For example, the campaign intersections — who ever brings those up? Except those were awesome and were no doubt an idea from the director Eiichiro Sasaki who also directed the Outbreak games. The intersections added a layer of immersion not seen before in games, it reminded you that other players were going through the other campaigns and thus made the story feel like it was happening in real-time. This new dimension of campaign storytelling was an ambitious improvement, apparently too ambitious because nobody even recognized how amazing it was! The combat system is also so intricately balanced and complex here, that many people end up just complaining that it's too hard; they say there isn't enough ammo in the game, or the camera is too hard to control, when these things simply weren't the case. I ranked in the top 10 in Mercenaries the first month of release prior to any camera patches, any complaints about the camera are a complete result of utter incompetence in my opinion.Overall it's not the best Resident Evil, and it's not the best game of all time, but it was still a very good game. The hate was uncalled for. If you want to play No Mercy on PC with me feel free to hit me up, I'm down for that any day.			"

												Great story to the campaign, Playing Co-op with a friend really triples the fun, aswell as having random players join your campaign and play as enemies makes it challanging aswell as adding to the fun. Not only that but there are several multiplayer modes to choose from aswell as multiple characters to play as all with different campaigns			"

												This game is butt-♥♥♥♥ed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Everything about this game is.The non-needed, completely convulted interloped ""branching"" storylines; the main villain motive, the gameplay, the QTEs, the explosions (Oh God, the explosion), the inventory system, the zombambays, the monsters, the map designs, the upgrade system, the lack of weapon upgrade system, the untapped potential of invading other player's game, EVERYTHING. Hell it's really understandable if even non-RE player hates it.But you know what, the dumb-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay actually intrigues me. There's a decent and interesting gunkata-and-melee-focused third-person shooter framework hidden in this putrid♥♥♥♥♥♥ Quickshot that stuns enemies, the slide-dodge-and-crawl, the one-hit-kill attacks, the stamina system, the counter ability. All of this gives me a great feeling of a very fast-paced third-person shooter, which only compares to Vanquish by PlatinumGames so far. This -- what I so-called -- framework really shines on the Mercenaries Mode No Mercy, a time-based survival mode. I wish I could try other modes but alas those are DLCs. It would be great if Capcom could flesh this gameplay more. Hopefully on different or a brand new IP.I thought this was a pretty good deal, considering I managed to get a good chunk of 40 hours with about 10 bucks to pay. I'd play more if a /certain friend of mine/ who ""okay'd"" buying RE6 together would touch the game again. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it man, this game is at the very least least hilariously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, just give it another chance!(also it has offline/split-screen co-op, so it's a GREAT plus for me)			"

												I've played RE2, RE3, RE Code Veronica X, RE0, RE4 and a bit of RE5 so far, and out of all of these games, RE0 and RE4 were my personal favorites. This game, Resident Evil 6, has taken the lead in being my current favorite RE to date. I played RE0 and RE4 over and over again, and while RE5 so far is interesting, I don't like how I have to take care of two characters at the same time (unlike RE0 where it was a bit more manageable)RE6 seems to get a nice balance in action, horror, suspense, drama and storytelling. Having four different campaigns makes it feel like four games in one. Having even more characters to choose from when playing, whom each has their own unique abilities and weaknesses, gives a wide variety in gameplay, as well as replayability.The graphics are pretty impressive, the controls are the smoothest to date in an RE game, the companions don't just take over the game, but at the same time, you don't feel like you have to hand hold them the whole way through either.And I haven't even touched the online part of the game, or the Mercenaries / other game modes yet.I hear a lot of pepople moaning and whining about how RE isn't like what it used to be back in RE1 and RE2, but seriously, all the games tell a continuing story with many of the same characters throughout the game series. You can't have them terrified and scared of every door they open or every corner they round over and over. These characters have seen it all and eventually, the scariness of the whole situation drains away from them, just as it would for us players who've played RE for a long time.I constantly see RE evolving into something better. Sure, some mistakes come here and there, but for me, most have been minor and the many fixes and improvements to the gameplay over the years has outweighed much of the things some people nit pick over. You can't keep players attached to a game series for so many years by using the same dated game mechanics as RE1/2/3, etc. people get bored eventually from having to run halfway across the game world to grab some little item to open some door, run all the way back to the door to open it, only to find you need another part and have to run all the way back again. Which leads to boring moments of emptiness in the game because you already killed all the zombies in those areas the first time through and very rarely would one or two new ones appear. Plus the crappy combat mechanics & movement of the older games.All of these things are things players were already complaining about and sales were going down with each following RE title, which is why RE4 came about in the first place. And yet people still complain.TL;DRThis game hooks you into the story, it's fun to play, it takes all of the good things from all the RE games before, including many of the characters, and crams it all into one game for your enjoyment. Yes, there are a few quick time events, but as someone who grew up playing on an Atari, button mashing is second nature to me.Get the game, it's good.			"

												Buy it for Leon's campaign and mercenaries.  Maybe get it for Jake's and Ada's campaigns.Pretend Chris's game is just some horrible disaster made to show just how bad this series could have gotten if Capcom wanted to.Overall I do personally find it better than RE5, but it has worse low points and it doesn't quite hit the highs of the best parts of RE5 (Particularly the first two Wesker fights).

Frustration. I mean if you're just A LITTLE off be prepared to redo it over and over AND yeah, OVER AGAIN.Let's talk about how much the campaign with Chris and Piers suck. Literally, this is the WORST campaign of the game. It has a very boring and generic feel.Got it for $5.00, NOT EVEN WORTH THAT./RAGE QUIT and I don't even ♥♥♥♥ing care. "

												Recommends for its story. But I am quite disappointed at the gaming experience.Even normal is too hard, when compared to some previous episodes. (not 1 though, which is extremely hard)Having to die many times before completing the game is making the experience much less satisfactory, even though completing the game itself may not be too difficult. Instructions for players are lacking. Some bosses do not need frequent shooting but probably just some tricks to tackle, but I am so not aware of them. Having wasted too many ammo on that had made some battles almost impossible. Dying this way is giving bad feelings.I expected a better balance.P.S. Again, a very very disappointing part where Jake and Sherry attempted to shoot down the helicopter. Almost the whole time the helicopter is out of sight, even after all other enemies have been eliminated. Eventually, the helicopter was down suddenly and I had not even spent any of my ammo on it. What was going on? Am I supposed to play the 2nd time to figure it out? Bad experience...			"

												I honestly dont understand what people use this game as a punching bag for. It's actually a suprisingly good game! While no means perfect with some noticable flaws and a small learning curve if your not familiar with previous titles, it can still hold itself up despite its flaws. First off, it is unexpectedly content-rich even for a triple-a title, with 4 whole campaigns that are each about 5-6 hours each give or take (Note at the time of this review I haven't completed the game yet) and each offering a somewhat differentiated experience depending on where you would like to start. Each campaign also ties into the over-arching story (and where else does a campaign commit almost a fourth of its length to it's final boss alone?). After the campaign(s) you can still have plenty of fun just going through the Mercenaries mode where you can still pull off bad@ss gunplay tricks and smug taunts, and generally just have fun.			"

												Terrible game - lots of areas that haven't had nearly as much playtesting they required with blatantly obvious flaws, too many enemies with too much HP that barely pose a threat (on medium difficulty) which, in conjunction with ammo shortage, promotes ignoring everything and just running from point A to B.The entire game lacks any kind of scariness or the unnerving moments and general atmosphere that Revelations 1 and 2 had. Too many explosions, well-lit areas and the moments where you are actually forced to fight back are more annoying than anything.PC controls suck. Sprinting, opening doors and picking up items is mapped to one button, sprint direction is dependant on view direction, aka is controlled with the mouse instead of A/D - even in sequences with a fixed camera position.AI comrade is almost completely invulnerable and doesn't deal any kind of significant damage to enemies - they're basically just there to be there and because the B-movie-niveau story requires them at some points.Too. Many. ♥♥♥♥ing. Quicktime-Events.Not too demanding - character models are fine and the environment looks ""good enough"". The game also runs smoothly at 1080p@60FPS even on dated machines. Cutscenes tend to suffer from screentearing.Bought on sale for 7€, spent 21 hours finishing all 4 campaigns on medium difficulty.Lots of content for little money and if you're into resident evil you will find this game to be useful to fill an evening or two - or maybe four. just don't buy into this expecting the next RE4.Motherboard: ASUS M5A78L-MCPU: AMD X4 965 BE (4x 3,4 GHz)GPU: AMD Radeon HD7850 (2GB GDDR5)RAM: Corsair Vengeance Series - 8GB @1600 MHz			"

												It pains me to not reccomend this game because i had soo much fun with it. But i cant do it on principle alone. This could have been a game of the year and certainly doesnt deserve the hate it got at launch. re hasnt been survival since number 3 (imo) soo no let down there. i was sad to not get to play as jill or claire, but hey maybe some day. My criticism comes from hate towards the game, but hate towards the devs and who ever is in charfe of overseeing their work. The ability to map controls is abismal to say the least. If a game is released on pc it should be manditory that it not only supports mouse and keyboard, but that it refines it so it functions as well as a controler. Any game genre with maybe the exception of driving simulators can be made to funcction properly with a m&kb, its just a matter of integrity on the companies side. lol 3 frikin buttons to roll!!! one for left, right and forward.... REDICULOUS. 3 different inventory screens... what? why? cant assign weapons to keys.. again why? it is survival like when an enemy is cgarging you and your stuck scrolling thru your weapons to get to your desired one. Since the survival asspect was removed soo to should be the invintory limit (minor problem) The amount of times they take away your ability to control the camera are limited but frustrating as hell. They for some reason thought it would be an awesome addition to let your character be able to trip over things... ... WHY? And for the main reason i cant and will not reccomend this game, is because of the dock level in chris's campaign. Maybe this is a breeze with a controller but im a pc gamer and bought this game for pc, so i should not need to use one. I tried this part over 37 time before i got it. Camera control is augmented and you press forward and move backward you run into the sides of things and get stuck on seemingly nothing at all. This part of the game is completely broken because of the terrible controls for m&kb. Shame on steam for selling games that slap you in the face for being a pc gamer. Capcom needs to be punished for being so lazy and inconsiderate of their pc fans.			"

 DISCLAIMER:   Do not let my hours an achievements fool you.  I have played this game A LOT more on my Xbox 360, and even beat all 4 campaigns on professional difficulty, so I have spent more then enough time with this game. Introduction To Review: After playing through this game for WAY longer then I should have on PC and Xbox 360, I find this game to be a long, boring mess that no one should buy.  There are VERY few redeemable qualities about this game, but they are definitely not enough to offset the downsides in any way.Pros  (There's not that many) :-Mercenaries mode is fun-I personally enjoy the combat in this game-The game does not have too many bugs and is playable I guess?Cons:-Have fun with the controls on a keyboard & mouse-The overall story is relatively boring, having no tension whatsoever-None of the campaigns are much fun at all (Leon's is the best, and it's still very mediocre)-This game is filled to the brim with quick time events-There's not much of a reason to play co-op (Unless you're on No Mercy) when your A.I partner cannot die, and there's an ability where your A.I partner has unlimited healing when you're down-There's no ability to change your guns like in previous Resident Evil games (You're stuck with whatever guns you gather in story mode)-They took out the system of having every character have unique melee attacks like in Resident Evil 5-I will always prefer upgrading individual guns like in Resident Evil 5 & Revelations over upgrading your character as a whole like in this game-If you want horror in your Resident Evil game, you will only find a few cheap jumpscares at the most in this game-Almost everything except the main characters and most of the enemies look bad -Did I mention how boring the overall story is?  Because it isTL;DR: If you want to play a Resident Evil co-op game with your friend, go play Resident Evil 5 or something			"

												The best part about 6 is being able to play as the Ultimate Lifeform; Agent. Agent is a co-op partner for Ada Wong. Agent has a rather uplifitng tone in his voice clips, except for ""Excellent"" He says that like a total creep. But Agent has abilities never seen before, Agent can bend reality itself. Ada can grapple up to areas which will activate a short cutscene, and Ada lands by herself. When it ends, Agent is there. Agent can teleport to alot of places during their adventure, even to another part of the sturcture, even if Ada is in trouble. Agent does not appear during cutscenes either, raising more questions. He is also able to consume herbs through his mask that covers his entire face. But his only weakness is surprisingly operational machinery, such as doors, or levers. But all in all, Agent is the most interesting character in the series I've seen in a while.			"

												I bet if this game had a different title it would be geneorusly popular. Sadly thanks to the depressed butt hurt fans who desperately want to return to the past just like any other long running game series (aka final fantasy) the game doesn't do so well in the eyes of the public. To be honest it has the best action, best textures, graphics and the longest bunch of campaigns with so many modes then any of the other resident evil titles before it. The ability to move and shoot was long over do and to be honest people need to just accept that in life things change. So what if it's not scary enough, it sure is hell is fun. Sure some franchises should go back to their roots like Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon. However, Resident Evil has improved both graphically and story wise. Why would we want to return to a game setting that got a place in the guisness world records for worst voice acting in a video game? Like the annoying butt hurt fans of final fantasy who dislike where the series it going, just accept it for what it is now. So please take a chance on this game and final fantasy 15, you won't be disapointed.			"

												Honestly I enjoy this game for the most part. There are minor issues like controls seeming unresponsive at times  or the HUD changing for different characters that irks me a bit, but for the most part it's all gravy.Until you get to the third campaign. It's awful. Do you ever go seeking to play a horror/3ps and instead get stuck with awful quick time events, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle sections with bad controls, and and awful camera angles for uninteresting chase scenes that just make you frustrated because you can't tell when you need to execute a slide or not to keep moving forward?Honestly it's bad. These situations spring up occasionally throughout all the campaigns, and for the most part it's a little frustrating, but only a slight interrupt of the actual good gameplay and then you're back on track. Once you hit Jake and Shelly's campaign though, you're wading through more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics and bad game design than zombies and being forced to remember all the previous sections of the game that you thought were just a one-off.I like the game, I really do. But honestly at this point I'm just completing it out of stubbornness. If I had accidentally stepped into the dog♥♥♥♥♥♥that is the third campaign earlier on, I would not have continued playing. Hopefully 7 doesn't make these same mistakes, but as it is I've already decided not to buy it until a sale whereas I was hoping to pick it up once I get finished with 6. :/			"

I enjoyed the story, and the mercenaries mode is great, so you cant get borred of playing. i would give this a 8/10 because of its story and the great controls, but if it had a better ''Horror'' side, it would be a really great 3rd person game.

												This game is rough to say the least, it had the potential to be amazing and fell short due to poor execution. That being said it is not without its right to be praised on certain features, just as well as it is deserving of being bashed for its poor ones.The Good:The melee system (best feature IMO)- Feels fluidic for the first time in a resident evil game, and its even more satisfying when you're playing jake,no more circle jerking in place by pulling out your knife and swinging like someone having a seizure whilst leaving you wide open too attack.The dodge/ Reaction attack mechanics- Truly adds a sense of control for the character while  being attacked and moving to evade oncoming fire, and its satisfying as hell to stop an enemies attack and return one in kind in one move.Character variety- Every character has some for of uniqueness to them, they dont feel like they all came from the exact same mold, and painted with a different skin and voice actor.Leon/Jake- Three CONTROLABLE baddasses in one game, along side their trusty (AI is still bad) partner (clean up isle my pants). I was extremely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when Wesker was infected with the las plagas and then soon after killed off as he was easilly one of my favorite characters, but godamn does his baddassery live on through his son.The Bad:AI- The AI of your partner in this game is like an eternal punishment consisting of stepping on legos every 30 seconds for the rest of your life, as well as getting a cheese grater forced into your anal cavity everytime you blink or breathe by a demented midget clown in a pink tutu, whos simultaneously tea bagging you.Frustrating vehicle handling- the vehicle handling (particularly the snowmobiles) makes me want to rip off my clothes and start screaming that god has abandoned me.Weapons- Shooting an enemy feels like it doesnt do crap but tickle the enemy with feather sensually afer a successful date that leads to your lovers apartment, until you get overpowered weapons and or character upgrades. I  legit feel like id have more success chasing enemies away by exposing myself and running at them wildly, with my donger swinging like a damn helicopter blade as I do so.Camera angles- Not all of the are bad by any means, but holy hell when they are its like my fartbox is being tongue punched by a woodchipper on steroids. I play this game and will continue to play it for story progression alone because im literally that loyal to the series ( zombies are my weakness), all in all  i give this game a solid 3/hippopotamus.

There are VERY few redeemable qualities about this game, but they are definitely not enough to offset the downsides in any way.Pros  (There's not that many) :-Mercenaries mode is fun-I personally enjoy the combat in this game-The game does not have too many bugs and is playable I guess?Cons:-Have fun with the controls on a keyboard & mouse-The overall story is relatively boring, having no tension whatsoever-None of the campaigns are much fun at all (Leon's is the best, and it's still very mediocre)-This game is filled to the brim with quick time events-There's not much of a reason to play co-op (Unless you're on No Mercy) when your A.I partner cannot die, and there's an ability where your A.I partner has unlimited healing when you're down-There's no ability to change your guns like in previous Resident Evil games (You're stuck with whatever guns you gather in story mode)-They took out the system of having every character have unique melee attacks like in Resident Evil 5-I will always prefer upgrading individual guns like in Resident Evil 5 & Revelations over upgrading your character as a whole like in this game-If you want horror in your Resident Evil game, you will only find a few cheap jumpscares at the most in this game-Almost everything except the main characters and most of the enemies look bad -Did I mention how boring the overall story is?  Because it isTL;DR: If you want to play a Resident Evil co-op game with your friend, go play Resident Evil 5 or something			"

												Leon's Campaign gets a thumbs up. I am writing this because I found Chris' campaign to be an absolute POS. If we remove the resident evil feel of Leon's campaign and replace it with overly predictable and poorly designed action sequences we get the boring, mildy frustrating, and overall lackluster experience that I would call Chris' campaign. It is the single reason I will not be recommending this game at full price; since a fourth of the game is disapointing at best. If you can get it cheap it isn't a bad game. I had fun with Leon's campaign and the mercenaries mode, but I would just as soon skipped the whole thing.			"

												I consider this Resident Evil out of all Resident Evils as the ""Black Sheep Parody"" of the Resident Evil Franchise. It is so bad, that it's good. The gameplay is entertaining and the graphics, SFX and overall content is great. Now as for the story line absolutely bonkers of a plotline, I mean gee whiz is it goofy. You play through several different campaigns of familiar characters as they all interconnect with eachother through the story which gives you wicked cases of Deja Vu. I am not ♥♥♥♥ing kidding its straight vertigo from start to finish. Now for the rest of the game...LoL #OMG where do I begin.The actual control scheme, camera fixtures and control reactions to this game is gawd awful. The charatcers are so rushed and unfleshed out it's like I am in Die Hard with zombies. The times though that we played through in co-op was just hilarious because of the amount of silliness surrounding this entire game. This game is laid with so much QTE (Quick Time Events) you would immediately just rage or laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off to how much you will die or repeat from this throughout the campaigns in such ridiculous ways. I mean its a joke because the enemies will be so overwhelming and at times endless that you will be getting thrown around like a ragdoll and knocked down constantly, not to mention the bullet sponging (I freaking hate the screamers!) constantly throughout the game with the most irky jerky over the shoulder camera work ever. The cover system is so bipolar, and so are the enemies when you fight them on higher difficulties. The game is that hilarious. For the most part the Co-op is where its at for the most parts, lots of cool modes that are fun if are drunk, high or just looking for a good laugh  to play together to have fun because if you are able to not take this game seriously you will find it funny or entertaining. As for the horror factor? Well hate to break it to you all but...IT DOES NOT EXIST HERE.The game has no horror elements, it feels like an action movie with zombies with one of the most outlandish story plots I still can't wrap my head around by the choices, cliche villians and just trying to understand where this is all going after the events of Re 4 & 5 which were excellent games. Its like I just watched a shoot'em up flick make love to a zombie...it is that bad. But past that when it's all said and done it is why I still recommend this game because it is still a good title because it completely parodies it's own mythology that you will have fun playing just from the sheer idiocy of everything you witness and play through on screen. Like a popcorn flick that you control. And when you encounter the fight with the nipple monster for the first time you know you can't take this game seriously anymore. I mean♥♥♥♥♥♥ what were they thinking!? Game is worth a laugh and a playthrough. Just only advice is don't buy it full price, get it on sale.			"

												Extremely fun with a Co-op partner. Lots of replayability, as each character in each campaign has separate quick time events, and objectives during split up areas.The storyline is very cool, you gain a bit more insight into it as you progress through each campaign, all of which occur concurrently. Ada's campaign should be done last, as it pulls everything together and provides backstory.If you're used to RE games, play this on Professional or No Hope. The game is far easier than RE4 and RE5 on similar difficulties (Professional in RE6 is ~ equivalent to Normal in  RE5, and No Hope is equivalent to a fresh Veteran run). Nonetheless, an amazing Coop game, and I hope Capcom keeps making RE games in this vein.			"

												Despite all bad reviews I liked this game very much. It takes a short time to get used to controls, but once you do it's great fun. It gives you the feeling that you are really in control of your character; run, dodge, take cover, slide etc... And first time I opened it on my big screen TV I said 'WOW, fantastic graphics'. I still do so.It's true however that the game is more action than survival horror. And online matching system is really bad. A friend and I tried intersection with each other, we both in the same city. However gave up after a few attempts. This also affects mods, you can't play anyone other than mercenaries and sometimes survivor. Overall,pros: fantastic visuals, very long story playtime, story intersecitons, great player controlcons: bad online matching system, more action than horror. "

												I really wanted to like this game but it's not possible.Note that I have played every single Resident evil game and I liked every single one of them (Except for racoon city).While this game improves a lot of things that the old games ignored it completely destroyed what the series was so proud of.Major Changes:HP has changed into 6 blocks of hp ,one is lost every time you get attacked by normal attacks and you can lose up to 3 from heavy (Normal mode)Herbs have changedThis is a pure action gameLeon's personality has changed from a carefree and funny dude to a stone cold man.Pros:-There is melee combat and it's actually viable in battle.You can beat everything up BUT you need stamina to do it.-QTE are prety fun sometimes-PerksCons:-Sometiems the AI is worse than than Operation racoon city-Minecraft is scarier than this-The difficulity is unbalanced as ♥♥♥♥.If you play in on normal a single zombie will either need 1 or 7 headshots to be killed.What.The.Hell.BUT , if you play it on amateur you won't even need ammo,you can kill everything with melee.A mutated freak that deals ♥♥♥♥♥ons of damage and needs 15 headshots in normal needs 3 melee hits in amateur.-The dialogue can be either good or anime level ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.For example: (Some dude):I need to find my daughter!(Leon):Stop shouting or they will find us.(Same dude):0_0 ghg(Stupid♥♥♥♥♥partner):The place is full of zombies, that means she might be ............... (She might be what?)(Same dude):L-Lisa....I..I hope you are ok.....This is trully writing of the ages.-It's not a story line like RE 1-5, It's about a town were everybody is there and we play 4 or so hours of everybody.There is no purpose other than ""We must save the 3 people that survived because reasons""-No memorable characters.RE2 had the crazy doctor,RE 5,darkside crhonicles  and RE 4 had like 6 memorable and cool villains with ambitions.The only memorable character is that ♥♥♥♥♥ that follows Leon.She is like an upgrade from the stack of hey you had in RE4 because she has a gun and infinite hp.So when she isnt shooting you she might even hit a zombie. -There's a thin line between challenging and complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t unfair.I said I enjoy the QTE BUT that is 70% of the time.Know what happens the other 30%?A zombie will leap 10 meters and will grab you dealing a♥♥♥♥♥♥TON OF DAMAGE even if you break free.Trains will ♥♥♥♥ing randomly ♥♥♥♥ you over and while I enjoy some destruction there is a 100% that the first time that you enter an area with Leon you will die at least 3 times.Why you may ask?(Minos spolier)You need to save some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cops near a gas station.While you fight the zombies a ♥♥♥♥ING TRUCK will ram your♥♥♥♥♥into the next dimnesion.No QTE.No warning.Just death.If you remove the main characters and replace the title you won't even think for a second this is a Resident evil game.Long story shot you run around either one shotting everything or begging for a pack of ammo,without any bosses,no thrill and certainly not enjoyment.If it's less than 10 euros you can give it a try, even though you will get bored from the first hour.

												This walks the line for me, but I'm somewhat reluctantly coming down on the side of not making a recommendation. It's a pretty good action game that looks pretty, the controls are FINALLY excellent, it has a solid length to it, the AI is improved (a bit) from RE5, and most of the game can be played in co-op. But this is not a horror game. There's nothing scary in it. At all. You'd think that would be necessary for a Resident Evil game, but Capcom unwisely disagrees. This doesn't even feel like a Resident Evil game most of the time. The plot is the worst nonsense this side of a Jill sandwich, and while it does have some replayability, I find I don't really want to play it again. There's nothing even resembling a puzzle. The music is probably the best in the series, to be honest, but that's not enough to save it.But the reason I can't recommend this game is that it has Quick-Time Events. Screw QTE's. They ruin games for me, and you can add Resident Evil 6 to that pile.			"

												I won't spoil story here so..The short of it is : Nice setting(RC), good game, nice campaign length, good music and voice acting, nice mechanics/controls. RE:6 is a pretty damn good game despite the hate some people give it. If one has to say it isn't a resident evil game anymore; I would say that the series really hasn't been ""Resident Evil""  since code veronica or the first 3. It kind of got the hitman absolution treatment. Also going back to the city is wonderful since RE has been on this rural muddy/washed out colored binge for a couple games. They finally made a dark game again.. The addition of other game modes and mercenaries is also pretty awesome. It remains linear though like 4-revelations which is my  small nitpick since I love to splore in games. The only thing that bums me out is the (so-far) lack of weapon upgrade parts. The QTE's are actually pretty nice and short compared to other games where you can be asked to spam a key super fast for 30 sec. I would easily give this an 7.5 to 8/10 if asked but to me I am fully satisfied and would really only want more re6. :PMore info:I have been a fan of the RE series since playing/owning the first three at release on the ps1. I stepped away after code veronica and never cared to return since what I saw of four looked way too different from the RE games I knew and loved. Only recently I have gotten into the later games 4,5, revelations and now six. I would argue that they finally got rid of all the clunky mechanics that were only around because of the controllers and limits back then. While I love the old ones the best this one feels top notch gameplay wise out of the recent titles. For instance the pause and shoot was from 1-veronica since you could not free aim and had to tap on the up down to shoot high or low. They kept it in 5 to be a throwback and somehow make it hard or something. In Resident Evil 6 you can finally dodge and melee proper, though it will tire you and have a short cd. (non-spammy).The gun play feels good and the sound effects are really nice. Being able to roll out of the way or land on your back to shoot from the floor is a great touch.  Graphically the game is beautiful and benefits greatly from Sweetfx. In my opinion RE6 feels like what 4-revelations should have been controls wise. Those clung on to old mechanics to make you think they were staying true to the old play style. In 6 they shed all that, made the mechanics/controls more fluid/responsive and finally let it be a decent TPS instead of a slow clunky one. This title takes you back to the city and the shambler type zombies come with that. You will find that sometimes it is better to run than it is to keep fighting. I wish we could have RE 1-veronica playstyle back but since that is gone, six is a good entry to the series.			"

												This game started out as a big disappointment with it's dull and boring ""intro"". I almost quit the game before I was done with the intro, as I thought that was the actual game. Once I started with Leon's campaign, I re-evaluated the game and actually found myself liking it. It captured the horror/survival game we all know and love about the Resident Evil series.Unfortunatly Leon's campaign is just 1 out of 4. If you play the campaigns in order, the game gets worse and worse. Chris's campaign takes us away from the horror/survival genre and put us in a bizarre 3rd person shooter game that takes place in East Europe. Still the campaign was okay.Jake's campaign gets even worse. We're still in East Europe, and we spend most of our time running from stuff. With a car, with a motorcycle, with a snowmobile, on a boat and by foot. A lot of the time we are running with a fixed position camera angle, which annoyed the crap out of me. Dear CapCom running away in an intense situation with a fixed camera position doesn't make the game more intresting, it makes it annoying. No one likes it when you run forward using ""W key"" just to all of a sudden have to use the ""A key"" in order to run straight forward. If you got  great scenery you wanna show off, find some other way to do it.The 4th and final is Ada's campaign. After playing through the first chapter, I really feel I don't want to continue playing this game. Again we find outselves running from everything. We have to stealth and avoid enemies, we have to climb ladders and swim on a timer. Feel free to throw 100's of brain eating zombies at me. Give me puzzles to solve, make me fight unreasonable big and hard bosses. But don't ask me to stealth and run away from everything. Don't give me mini-cutscenes in the middle of a boss fight. And for the love of God, let me decide from what angle I want the camera!I'm really sorry to say, but I don't recommend this game. At least not if you like horror/survivor games. I really wish capaign 2, 3 & 4 were more simmilar to the first one. But it seems that CapCom decided to try and please everyone, by making each campaign aimed at different types of players. I'm sorry Capcom, but instead of pleasing a greater audience, you now have people hating 75% of the game. I don't see how it's possible to enjoy all 4 campaigns.It's as absurd as if you were to make the next Tomb Raider 25% Tomb Raider, 25% Mario-Kart, 25% Silent Hill and 25% Farmville. Chose 1 line and stick to that.			"

												A game I couldn't get myself to play, no matter how many chances I gave it.After hearing all the negative reviews from Resident Evil fans, I understood fully as to what I was getting myself into... or so I thought.I was expecting a silly yet over the top action story line, with fun and gimmicky 3rd person shooting aspects. What I got myself into was possibly the most boring action game of all time, with a story where nothing literally happens. Even upon playing the most difficult settings, you'll find yourself repeating the same routine, as the gameplay has nothing more to offer than what was available the first 5 minutes of the game.If you're looking for a decent action game, look else where.

If you love a mix of Horror and Action, then this is a must have. Mercenaries Mode and the Campaign are very fun! Pros: Very nicely done graphics, Very well done and interesting story, Nice characters, Fun Gameplay. Cons: I just wish there were more scary parts, the cover system isn""t the best, Capcom could have cut down on the QTE events(That one is a minor complaint by me though but a lot of the people complain about that, but it doesnt really ruin the game experience for me.). New players trying to get into the series will really like this one. It may upset older gamers who have played past titles but if you look at this game and just dont think about the flaws so much and just enjoy what Resident Evil 6 has to offer you will have a expierience playing this one :) I think this one is very under rated. It has plenty of the elements that make a game good. I'd give it an 8.5/10.			"

												Impossible to play with keyboard. Not only is this a blind button masher, the controls are bugged. In full screen mode the camera glitches and does not move right. To combat the glitch it can be played in windowed mode, but will almost always get you killed when the mouse accidently selects bottom menu bar items. It's so bad I had to put the game down and walk away.Game content wise it's interesting.			"

												I have no idea what to say about RESIDENT EVIL 6, really. Suppose I'll just ramble a bit.tl;dr at the bottomThe gameplay is fairly solid and the action is exhilarating, for sure. The production values and graphics are impressive, and playing with a buddy in coop is a blast.However, what really brings this game down for me is the ludicrous story, illogical character actions, and punishing length of the game.Those sound like strange criticisms for a Resident Evil game, I know, but they truly transform this game into something that's not Resident Evil. The story is divided into four sections, with 3 of them following different sets of characters, and a final epilogue where everything is wrapped up neatly (that's not including the bonus add-on story mission). Though the action is always rising in pitch, it never truly felt like the story was moving along at the same pace; plot progression would be dragged back by long boss encounters and extensive action scenes where nothing is accomplished, aside from the characters receiving a couple extra scars...which is insane, since many of those sequences should have resulted in grisly death, not near-misses.Again, seems like a strange criticism for a Resident Evil game, a series known for crazy nonsensical plot elements. But much like the film adaptations, RESIDENT EVIL 6 is an adrenaline-pounded sequel to a series that benefitted most on subtlety and horror, with only tiny slivers of its former glory tacked on.The game is also brutally long. You'd think that more game equals better, right?That's not the case here, unfortunately. The game is padded by extensive fight scenes, and progressing through the story feels like a drawn out chore rather than an enjoyable gauntlet. Just when you think you've reached the climax of the game, and must be close to the end, you end up playing for 3 more hours. THEN you're close to the end.In the final chapters I just wanted the game to be over. I was tired of fighting the same boss, who would always ""resurrect"" himself with some new appendage or mutation. Having bosses continually come back certainly sucks the tension out of the game, when you expect that the abomination you just torched will arrive again in 10 minutes. RESIDENT EVIL 6 is also punishing to completionists: if you want to finish the game ""100%"" you'll have to go through the entire game TWICE, once as one character, then again as their partner. The play time I currently have logged is from going through the entire game (and the bonus mission) just once. I don't think I have the patience to go through the game a second time.Also never expected to find continuity errors in a video game. Before the main game starts you have to play through a tutorial prologue that shows certain characters in peril. However, when you catch up to that point in the story in the main game things are completely different. The game lies to you right at the start, and changes certain events throughout the game as you switch between sets of characters. It's crazy.Though it has its moments, RESIDENT EVIL 6 isn't a game I want to revisit any time soon. Unless it goes on sale for like 5 bucks or something, I'd recommend avoiding this title. --------------tl;dr+Impressive graphics and production values+Solid gameplay elements+Action scenes are intense, though over the top+Best played with a friend; coop makes the game fun and enjoyable-Story is a large departure from other Resident Evil titles; nonsensical, illogical, over the top-Main characters are seemingly immortal-Game is frustratingly long and slowed down by too many battles-Bosses are regularly recycled and resurrected, eliminating tension-Story is plagued with continuity errors and plot holes-Lacks old Resident Evil charm			"

												This walks the line for me, but I'm somewhat reluctantly coming down on the side of not making a recommendation. It's a pretty good action game that looks pretty, the controls are FINALLY excellent, it has a solid length to it, the AI is improved (a bit) from RE5, and most of the game can be played in co-op. But this is not a horror game. There's nothing scary in it. At all. You'd think that would be necessary for a Resident Evil game, but Capcom unwisely disagrees. This doesn't even feel like a Resident Evil game most of the time. The plot is the worst nonsense this side of a Jill sandwich, and while it does have some replayability, I find I don't really want to play it again. There's nothing even resembling a puzzle. The music is probably the best in the series, to be honest, but that's not enough to save it.But the reason I can't recommend this game is that it has Quick-Time Events. Screw QTE's. They ruin games for me, and you can add Resident Evil 6 to that pile.			"

												Terrible game - lots of areas that haven't had nearly as much playtesting they required with blatantly obvious flaws, too many enemies with too much HP that barely pose a threat (on medium difficulty) which, in conjunction with ammo shortage, promotes ignoring everything and just running from point A to B.The entire game lacks any kind of scariness or the unnerving moments and general atmosphere that Revelations 1 and 2 had. Too many explosions, well-lit areas and the moments where you are actually forced to fight back are more annoying than anything.PC controls suck. Sprinting, opening doors and picking up items is mapped to one button, sprint direction is dependant on view direction, aka is controlled with the mouse instead of A/D - even in sequences with a fixed camera position.AI comrade is almost completely invulnerable and doesn't deal any kind of significant damage to enemies - they're basically just there to be there and because the B-movie-niveau story requires them at some points.Too. Many. ♥♥♥♥ing. Quicktime-Events.Not too demanding - character models are fine and the environment looks ""good enough"". The game also runs smoothly at 1080p@60FPS even on dated machines. Cutscenes tend to suffer from screentearing.Bought on sale for 7€, spent 21 hours finishing all 4 campaigns on medium difficulty.Lots of content for little money and if you're into resident evil you will find this game to be useful to fill an evening or two - or maybe four. just don't buy into this expecting the next RE4.Motherboard: ASUS M5A78L-MCPU: AMD X4 965 BE (4x 3,4 GHz)GPU: AMD Radeon HD7850 (2GB GDDR5)RAM: Corsair Vengeance Series - 8GB @1600 MHz			"

												Leon's Campaign gets a thumbs up. I am writing this because I found Chris' campaign to be an absolute POS. If we remove the resident evil feel of Leon's campaign and replace it with overly predictable and poorly designed action sequences we get the boring, mildy frustrating, and overall lackluster experience that I would call Chris' campaign. It is the single reason I will not be recommending this game at full price; since a fourth of the game is disapointing at best. If you can get it cheap it isn't a bad game. I had fun with Leon's campaign and the mercenaries mode, but I would just as soon skipped the whole thing.			"

												The best part about 6 is being able to play as the Ultimate Lifeform; Agent. Agent is a co-op partner for Ada Wong. Agent has a rather uplifitng tone in his voice clips, except for ""Excellent"" He says that like a total creep. But Agent has abilities never seen before, Agent can bend reality itself. Ada can grapple up to areas which will activate a short cutscene, and Ada lands by herself. When it ends, Agent is there. Agent can teleport to alot of places during their adventure, even to another part of the sturcture, even if Ada is in trouble. Agent does not appear during cutscenes either, raising more questions. He is also able to consume herbs through his mask that covers his entire face. But his only weakness is surprisingly operational machinery, such as doors, or levers. But all in all, Agent is the most interesting character in the series I've seen in a while.			"

												I bet if this game had a different title it would be geneorusly popular. Sadly thanks to the depressed butt hurt fans who desperately want to return to the past just like any other long running game series (aka final fantasy) the game doesn't do so well in the eyes of the public. To be honest it has the best action, best textures, graphics and the longest bunch of campaigns with so many modes then any of the other resident evil titles before it. The ability to move and shoot was long over do and to be honest people need to just accept that in life things change. So what if it's not scary enough, it sure is hell is fun. Sure some franchises should go back to their roots like Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon. However, Resident Evil has improved both graphically and story wise. Why would we want to return to a game setting that got a place in the guisness world records for worst voice acting in a video game? Like the annoying butt hurt fans of final fantasy who dislike where the series it going, just accept it for what it is now. So please take a chance on this game and final fantasy 15, you won't be disapointed.			"

												I consider this Resident Evil out of all Resident Evils as the ""Black Sheep Parody"" of the Resident Evil Franchise. It is so bad, that it's good. The gameplay is entertaining and the graphics, SFX and overall content is great. Now as for the story line absolutely bonkers of a plotline, I mean gee whiz is it goofy. You play through several different campaigns of familiar characters as they all interconnect with eachother through the story which gives you wicked cases of Deja Vu. I am not ♥♥♥♥ing kidding its straight vertigo from start to finish. Now for the rest of the game...LoL #OMG where do I begin.The actual control scheme, camera fixtures and control reactions to this game is gawd awful. The charatcers are so rushed and unfleshed out it's like I am in Die Hard with zombies. The times though that we played through in co-op was just hilarious because of the amount of silliness surrounding this entire game. This game is laid with so much QTE (Quick Time Events) you would immediately just rage or laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off to how much you will die or repeat from this throughout the campaigns in such ridiculous ways. I mean its a joke because the enemies will be so overwhelming and at times endless that you will be getting thrown around like a ragdoll and knocked down constantly, not to mention the bullet sponging (I freaking hate the screamers!) constantly throughout the game with the most irky jerky over the shoulder camera work ever. The cover system is so bipolar, and so are the enemies when you fight them on higher difficulties. The game is that hilarious. For the most part the Co-op is where its at for the most parts, lots of cool modes that are fun if are drunk, high or just looking for a good laugh  to play together to have fun because if you are able to not take this game seriously you will find it funny or entertaining. As for the horror factor? Well hate to break it to you all but...IT DOES NOT EXIST HERE.The game has no horror elements, it feels like an action movie with zombies with one of the most outlandish story plots I still can't wrap my head around by the choices, cliche villians and just trying to understand where this is all going after the events of Re 4 & 5 which were excellent games. Its like I just watched a shoot'em up flick make love to a zombie...it is that bad. But past that when it's all said and done it is why I still recommend this game because it is still a good title because it completely parodies it's own mythology that you will have fun playing just from the sheer idiocy of everything you witness and play through on screen. Like a popcorn flick that you control. And when you encounter the fight with the nipple monster for the first time you know you can't take this game seriously anymore. I mean♥♥♥♥♥♥ what were they thinking!? Game is worth a laugh and a playthrough. Just only advice is don't buy it full price, get it on sale.			"

												Honestly I enjoy this game for the most part. There are minor issues like controls seeming unresponsive at times  or the HUD changing for different characters that irks me a bit, but for the most part it's all gravy.Until you get to the third campaign. It's awful. Do you ever go seeking to play a horror/3ps and instead get stuck with awful quick time events, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle sections with bad controls, and and awful camera angles for uninteresting chase scenes that just make you frustrated because you can't tell when you need to execute a slide or not to keep moving forward?Honestly it's bad. These situations spring up occasionally throughout all the campaigns, and for the most part it's a little frustrating, but only a slight interrupt of the actual good gameplay and then you're back on track. Once you hit Jake and Shelly's campaign though, you're wading through more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics and bad game design than zombies and being forced to remember all the previous sections of the game that you thought were just a one-off.I like the game, I really do. But honestly at this point I'm just completing it out of stubbornness. If I had accidentally stepped into the dog♥♥♥♥♥♥that is the third campaign earlier on, I would not have continued playing. Hopefully 7 doesn't make these same mistakes, but as it is I've already decided not to buy it until a sale whereas I was hoping to pick it up once I get finished with 6. :/			"

 DISCLAIMER:   Do not let my hours an achievements fool you.  I have played this game A LOT more on my Xbox 360, and even beat all 4 campaigns on professional difficulty, so I have spent more then enough time with this game. Introduction To Review: After playing through this game for WAY longer then I should have on PC and Xbox 360, I find this game to be a long, boring mess that no one should buy.  There are VERY few redeemable qualities about this game, but they are definitely not enough to offset the downsides in any way.Pros  (There's not that many) :-Mercenaries mode is fun-I personally enjoy the combat in this game-The game does not have too many bugs and is playable I guess?Cons:-Have fun with the controls on a keyboard & mouse-The overall story is relatively boring, having no tension whatsoever-None of the campaigns are much fun at all (Leon's is the best, and it's still very mediocre)-This game is filled to the brim with quick time events-There's not much of a reason to play co-op (Unless you're on No Mercy) when your A.I partner cannot die, and there's an ability where your A.I partner has unlimited healing when you're down-There's no ability to change your guns like in previous Resident Evil games (You're stuck with whatever guns you gather in story mode)-They took out the system of having every character have unique melee attacks like in Resident Evil 5-I will always prefer upgrading individual guns like in Resident Evil 5 & Revelations over upgrading your character as a whole like in this game-If you want horror in your Resident Evil game, you will only find a few cheap jumpscares at the most in this game-Almost everything except the main characters and most of the enemies look bad -Did I mention how boring the overall story is?  Because it isTL;DR: If you want to play a Resident Evil co-op game with your friend, go play Resident Evil 5 or something			"

 DISCLAIMER:   Do not let my hours an achievements fool you.  I have played this game A LOT more on my Xbox 360, and even beat all 4 campaigns on professional difficulty, so I have spent more then enough time with this game. Introduction To Review: After playing through this game for WAY longer then I should have on PC and Xbox 360, I find this game to be a long, boring mess that no one should buy.  There are VERY few redeemable qualities about this game, but they are definitely not enough to offset the downsides in any way.Pros  (There's not that many) :-Mercenaries mode is fun-I personally enjoy the combat in this game-The game does not have too many bugs and is playable I guess?Cons:-Have fun with the controls on a keyboard & mouse-The overall story is relatively boring, having no tension whatsoever-None of the campaigns are much fun at all (Leon's is the best, and it's still very mediocre)-This game is filled to the brim with quick time events-There's not much of a reason to play co-op (Unless you're on No Mercy) when your A.I partner cannot die, and there's an ability where your A.I partner has unlimited healing when you're down-There's no ability to change your guns like in previous Resident Evil games (You're stuck with whatever guns you gather in story mode)-They took out the system of having every character have unique melee attacks like in Resident Evil 5-I will always prefer upgrading individual guns like in Resident Evil 5 & Revelations over upgrading your character as a whole like in this game-If you want horror in your Resident Evil game, you will only find a few cheap jumpscares at the most in this game-Almost everything except the main characters and most of the enemies look bad -Did I mention how boring the overall story is?  Because it isTL;DR: If you want to play a Resident Evil co-op game with your friend, go play Resident Evil 5 or something			"

												Honestly I enjoy this game for the most part. There are minor issues like controls seeming unresponsive at times  or the HUD changing for different characters that irks me a bit, but for the most part it's all gravy.Until you get to the third campaign. It's awful. Do you ever go seeking to play a horror/3ps and instead get stuck with awful quick time events, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle sections with bad controls, and and awful camera angles for uninteresting chase scenes that just make you frustrated because you can't tell when you need to execute a slide or not to keep moving forward?Honestly it's bad. These situations spring up occasionally throughout all the campaigns, and for the most part it's a little frustrating, but only a slight interrupt of the actual good gameplay and then you're back on track. Once you hit Jake and Shelly's campaign though, you're wading through more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics and bad game design than zombies and being forced to remember all the previous sections of the game that you thought were just a one-off.I like the game, I really do. But honestly at this point I'm just completing it out of stubbornness. If I had accidentally stepped into the dog♥♥♥♥♥♥that is the third campaign earlier on, I would not have continued playing. Hopefully 7 doesn't make these same mistakes, but as it is I've already decided not to buy it until a sale whereas I was hoping to pick it up once I get finished with 6. :/			"

												I bet if this game had a different title it would be geneorusly popular. Sadly thanks to the depressed butt hurt fans who desperately want to return to the past just like any other long running game series (aka final fantasy) the game doesn't do so well in the eyes of the public. To be honest it has the best action, best textures, graphics and the longest bunch of campaigns with so many modes then any of the other resident evil titles before it. The ability to move and shoot was long over do and to be honest people need to just accept that in life things change. So what if it's not scary enough, it sure is hell is fun. Sure some franchises should go back to their roots like Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon. However, Resident Evil has improved both graphically and story wise. Why would we want to return to a game setting that got a place in the guisness world records for worst voice acting in a video game? Like the annoying butt hurt fans of final fantasy who dislike where the series it going, just accept it for what it is now. So please take a chance on this game and final fantasy 15, you won't be disapointed.			"

												The best part about 6 is being able to play as the Ultimate Lifeform; Agent. Agent is a co-op partner for Ada Wong. Agent has a rather uplifitng tone in his voice clips, except for ""Excellent"" He says that like a total creep. But Agent has abilities never seen before, Agent can bend reality itself. Ada can grapple up to areas which will activate a short cutscene, and Ada lands by herself. When it ends, Agent is there. Agent can teleport to alot of places during their adventure, even to another part of the sturcture, even if Ada is in trouble. Agent does not appear during cutscenes either, raising more questions. He is also able to consume herbs through his mask that covers his entire face. But his only weakness is surprisingly operational machinery, such as doors, or levers. But all in all, Agent is the most interesting character in the series I've seen in a while.			"

												Resident Evil is not a survival horror saga any longer, but this has advanced combat system and an excellent Mercenaries mode. Unfortunately Capcom have once again spent too much time fixing what didn't need to be fixed and not enough time addressing the real issues of this series. The game is long because it's drawn out or challenging because of a flawed control system rather than displaying these positive attributes through balanced game design. Resident Evil 6 is not a bad game, but it's not a great game either and this is a real shame. Despite this however, it still has many amazing elements that should not be overlooked and at its core is a decent horror experience.			"

												I'm absolutely shocked at how bad this game is.  Resident Evil 4 was one of my favorite games of all time, somehow it's evolved to this?  If you're looking for an evolved product of RES4, buy The Evil Within.  It was basically RES4 on steroids and meth.I honestly tried to get into this game, pushed through the crap controls, the crap HUD / weapons setup, the clunky graphics and movement (especially compared to Evil Within).  And wow, I'm playing on the ""veteran"" skill level and you literally have to shoot each zombie 10 times in the head, which isn't much of a problem with the hoards of ammo you find everywhere.  the Resident Evil I fell in love with long ago was barely having enough ammo and getting excited when you found some.  Not every dead zombie providing you with another box of ammo... they turned the series into an arcade shooter.  I couldn't be more upset that I actually wasted money on this and the worst part of all is I was looking forward to the new Resident Evil game coming out, but sadly not anymore.  They killed the franchise in cold blood.			"

												Resident evil 6 is the worst game in the franchise. Not because it’s an action game, but because it’s just a bad game in general. The story itself is very mediocre, the dozens of stupid set pieces that take place during the gameplay and cutscenes make no sense and is worse than a B action movie. The whole experience overall is even more cheesier than Resident evil 5, Chris boulder punching level of cheesiness multiple times. The world doesn’t feel believable, the levels themselves are just stupid with everything requiring more than one person to use. There is no immersion, tension, excitement or suspense during gameplay because it feels like the game is doing everything it can to take you out of the experience. The graphics are pretty poor, there is barely any detail in the environments and the textures are very muddy, probably so the console versions keep a steady framerate during the over the top action. This game is exhausting to play because of how long it is. The game has no right being 20 hours long because of how boring the gameplay is. Coop helps cure the boredom a little but it doesn’t save it. It’s probably as linear as a game can get, the game mostly feels like it’s playing itself, like you have no control over anything that is happening. I feel like this game did have some potential, I don’t mind that the series has gone the action route, I thought resident evil 5 was decent but because of how restrictive, simple, streamlined and scripted the gameplay is in 6, it does ruin its potential. I think the melee they added saves the game from being awful, it’s cool to pull off wwe moves and karate kicks on infected. I also liked the addition of aiming and shooting and being able to dodge around and roll on the floor avoiding attacks it made you feel badass. But none of that ultimately matters because the core of the game is trash.3/10 (Bad)			"

												Прежде всего нужно понимать, что RE6 это не тот старый, каноничный survival horror, который многие фаныты серии привыкли видеть в частях с 1-3 и некоторых ответлениях, да и вообще не horror, а прежде всего неплохой кооперативный шутер от 3-его лица, с весьма хорошими кинематографичными сценами. Поэтому если простить игре ( уже в третий, хотя нет, второй раз) ее новую геимплейную концепцию, то на мой взгляд это весьма хорошая игра, да и к тому же можно пройти вместе с другом, и кстати, может horror составляющая почти на нуле, но survival (в рамках крнцепции данной игры) там вполне присутствует.Рекомендую.)

												This might not be the worst RE game in the series, but it's pretty close.    It's like they took a list of everything that fans hated about Capcom games and used that as a design document.First, the game is like 65% Quicktimed events.   Quicktimed events have to be amongst the most hated console game design tropes ever devised.    The sequences where the player is under direct control are extremely short, linear, and only lead to randomly placed (and longer) periods of scripted sequences, with lots of button mashing.    Only to give the player control again for another random 30 seconds, only to rip that control away again for another scripted, quicktime event.Then, there's the saves.   They're at the end of the chapters and only at the end of the chapters.    Even the original RE game had typewriters all over the place to let you save the game.     RE6?   They have checkpoints, but that's only a temporary save so if you get killed, you don't repeat the whole chapter.   If you quit before the chapter's end, you will have to replay the whole chapter from the beginning.   I can't blame this on a sloppy port, because even a modern console has memory cards and hard drives.   There's no reason not to include the ability to save whenever you want.You know how just about every other game (including previous RE games) would pause the game world when you went to the game menu, or at least include a pause option?    There is no pause.     If something crops up in the real world (phone rings, someone at the door, dog needs walking, human needs a bathroom break), you cant pause the game.   I guess they expect you to just play through or quit and restart the chapter later.Invisible walls.   The game levels are linear, and on the small side, with plenty of invisible walls.    So much for ""going back to the series' roots"" as was claimed.   They had exploration since the first game, but that's gone too.    Bad controls.  A lot of people complained about the unresponsive controls.   The controls aren't really that bad -- when you actually are in control.   The trouble is, the game tears control away from the player every few minutes and seemingly at random.  You'll then find yourself in a scripted sequence leading to a quicktime event or four, or they'll give you the pointless illusion of control.   There's at least two sequences where you're moving along a corridor and feel like you're in control.   The character stops when you stop pressing a button.   The trouble is, the camera's locked (try to look around and you can only look in a narrow cone, and the camera snaps back), and you can only move forward (press anything and you just move forward).    It may as well be a fully scripted sequence.    Then, as if quicktime sequences aren't bad enough, there's at least 3 places in the game where they suddently change the camera angle and reverse the controls, so that instead of running away from a creature or explosion, you suddenly run INTO it with little margin for error and no warning about the change over.Then, the game ends with slightly less than 10 minutes of credits -- which you CAN NOT skip without doing a kill-9 on the game (that's where you use the OS to shutdown a rogue program).   To flip the bird at the player one last time, the credits end with 2 minutes staring at a plain Capcom logo in the center of the screen.They've taken a cue from the Marvel movies and put in a post-credits epilogue sequence, but what they don't get is that what makes those post-credit scenes great is that they're an easter egg for people who CHOOSE to sit through the credits.   You're not given that choice since you can't skip the credits without doing a kill-9 or shutting off the system.I did like that they brought the setting back to the darkness of RE2.   The graphics are a bit more gritty and the game world objects feel like they belong there rather than something that sticks out and looks green screened in.    The trouble is, once you take out the quicktime events, pseudo interactive sequences, and sequences where the player's not in direct control for long, there's just not much game there, and it's certainly not worth the asking price.  It's embarassing when the handheld companion to this game (RE: Revelations) is more interactive and fun than a game that's supposed to be part of the main series. "

Selain zombi merangkak, kadang juga zombi melompat ke arah karakter, awalnya bisa dihindarkan dengan meng-klik kiri dengan cepat namun, semakin ke depan progress perjalannya agak sulit untuk menyerang balik lompatan zombi. Hal yang sulit kurasakan juga saat mengontrol karakter, kamera yang rasanya terlalu bebas dan sulit menentukan titik fokus untuk menembakkan serangan ke zombi sehingga membuatku berpikir berputar-putar sembari menemukan posisi yang pas untuk menembak adalah hal terbaik ketika zombi menyerang ke segala arah.Sekalipun begitu aku masih menikmati gamenya, kualitas grafik yang bagus, soundtrack yang pas, dan efek-efek disajikan dalam gamenya sudah membuatku puas. - Alasan aku tidak merekomendasikan game ini sebenarnya banyak tapi aku hanya akan menulis hal yang kuanggap mengapa game ini tidak bagus di tanganku. - Aku akan merekomendasikan game ini untuk fans Resident Evil, tapi ingat, jangan terlalu mengharapkan gameplay seperti seri ke 4 atau ke 5			"

												Nice Co-op TPS Action game. RE 6 keeps you in a game from start to the end. Good multiplayer modes that keeps you in a game after campaign completion for a lot of time. Good campaign and multiplayer replayability. This game much better than RE 5, but slightly below RE 4(due to lack of puzzles plurality).I am surprised, of what Game Press waited of this game(maybe some innovations, new gameplay features or something else...) This game was not going to follow the canons of the survivor-horror classic from the start of developing. It's just a good continuation of a Resident Evil Franchise, no more, no less...This game is clearly deserving of assessment is not less than 8.But I have two bad parts of this PC port:1)a LOT OF bugs, and consoles controls(you'll see it well in the Creatures' gameplay), low customizable controls... (I think it's more likely to be fixed with a future patches in the next six months(I hope so))2)Bad graphics and graphic customization and very low resolution of Textures.(Comparing with Resident Evil 5...)I think for 6 months, CAPCOM could make a better PC port. But I think that they were mistreat the PC port after hearing low estimates of Game Press...You played a cruel joke to PC players, CAPCOM...Do not repeat this mistake with upcoming PC port of Resident Evil: Revelations...

Hunting zombies with your own friends sometime better than hangout to the mall!The co-op mode on the campaign and the extra modes give you more fun experience.This game have 4 different story missions with a different movie cut-scene based on what character that you play.1. Leon F. Kenedy - Helena HarperOn this campaign, Leon still have his passion in the rainy, castle-ish, and underground stage. If you really curious how the ""Pre-Lude"" Mission starts and ends, you probably must play this story first. Remember, Leon is always come with Ada!2. Chris Redfield - Piers NivansThis story line is about a BSAA missions, but i dont really know what the objectives is. I mean what actually Chris and Piers must do. The 3rd chapter will explain everything. This is a good campaign based on the weapon that they used. Remember, Chris is always against Ada!3. Jake Muller - Sherry BirkinBack to the racoon city accident, Sherry was saved by Leon ( i dont play the racoon city franchise yet). And Jack Muller is Albert Wesker's son (Well, in the movie it's on the 4th sequel). Sherry must save Jake for getting his blood/dna that contain an anti-body that come from his father Albert. This storyline is having more drama than zombie fight.4. Ada Wong - Agent (Agent is only when your friends joining, if not, you're totally alone)This is Ada, this is the puzzle, and that how to story going. I'm not playing this story of her yet but based on another character cut-scene, Ada is there for helping them. 3 Different stories with 3 different saving missions, she is the volunteer of this game.Also you must play the extra modes, unlock some bad♥♥♥♥♥costume and see how good are you for zombies!Remember,  There is no more HOPE!

												I normally only write reviews when a game amazes me, or is better than people give it credit for. I am writing a review for RE6 for the exact opposite reason. I hate this game. It might be the worst game in a major franchise I have ever played. And I played that version of Street Fighter II on Tiger Handheld devices in the 90s.Don't buy it. Controls are bad. Inventory menu is the worst I have ever seen. Lots of disconnects when playing with friends. Gameplay is just moving room to room fighting waves of enemies until the doors unlock. Plot is the only good thing about it cause it is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad its funny.  "

												Resident Evil 6 takes more steps away from it horror survival roots and pushes itself further into the third person action genre. With the removal of many survival aspects and a much greater focus action is a disappointment to many of the original fans of the series however Resident Evil 6 ___. The over the top action makes it difficult to take the game seriously but provides plenty of excitement through all four campaigns.As the new C-virus runs rampant through Estonia, China and America the player battles through four separate campaigns to discover and stop the source between the new attacks. Each campaign provides its own focus, such as the more traditional zombie killing experience to Chris Redfield’s much more combat focused campaign. The four separate campaigns provide plenty of variation throughout the game however when characters between each story meet you will soon find yourself having to repeat the same fights. Though the intention of these events was simply to provide interaction between the main characters having to repeat them between separate campaigns can feel like tedious padding. With plenty of boss fights and approximately five to six hours in each campaign there is plenty of varied gameplay to be had.With the Resident Evil games frequently trying to add greater events then the previous one, the 6th is no exception, as soon events turn from dramatic to just ridiculous to try to top the last death defying stunt. With a serious attitude you can soon lose interest and find it difficult to enjoy as each event because more comical then the last, however if you simply accept the lunacy of the situations and simply enjoy the action then there is plenty of fun to be had. Without spoiling a simple example of this is how persistent some of the bosses continue to be through the entire game. After watching many victory cut scenes where your enemy suffers fatal damage, only to have them appear again one hour later then those taking the game seriously will soon become irritated and lose interest.The basic and minimalistic HUD is unobtrusive yet concise in displaying information which only appears in combat situations, allowing unobstructed views of the environment around you as well as the many cinematic scripted events you will encounter. Fixed camera angles in many areas serve to compliment this design even more, ensuring your gaze is never pulled away from the action. The use of fixed cameras can be a source of much frustration, especially during chase sequences. Many situations will have your character fleeing from one of many monstrosity’s behind you, as the fixed camera ensures you see the path of destruction behind you, you simply can’t see where you are going at all as you just blindly run towards the camera. In some situations the camera will jump to a new perspective or rotate suddenly changing the direction all of the movement keys, often resulting in you walking accidentally towards the enemy as you try to get your bearings again.With a heavy focus on cooperative gameplay I soon expected to be dying each time my partner messed up, yet this was not the case. As the game will harshly punish you for the smallest mistake, you will soon become dependent on your co-op partner to pick up the pieces and get you back on your feet. Finding a balance between individual responsibility and cooperative gameplay can prove difficult for many games, often either being overly dependent on your teammate to a point where you can feel unjustly punished each time your partner makes a mistake. The other side where players simply don’t interact at all, making it feel like you’re simply playing a single player game with another gun at your side. Resident Evil 6 manages to seamlessly find the middle ground between the two, making co-op great fun through 3 of the campaigns, with one of the four being focused for single player gameplay. When playing single player, your AI partner will behave a little odd at times but it always manages to stay close and get the job done, making single player a perfectly viable choice if co-op isn’t your personal choice.The game frequently changes direction from action to short periods of stealth based gameplay, chase sequences and the occasional vehicle sections in an attempt to keep things fresh. Despite the fact that these can be fun, especially as they break from the standard gameplay they also feel unfinished and misplaced. You will find yourself frequently with little direction during these, becoming confused as it can occasionally turn into a scene of trail and error after each death. I found myself trying to escape avalanche on a snow ski, only to frequently die at many corners because I picked the wrong side to approach the corner, to which I would find a bottomless pit right in front of me with no possible time to react.Resident Evil 6 accepts the flaws in its design, while improving the strengths that it has. Yes the storyline is painful, and filled with so many plot holes that finding possible answers would be harmful to ones mental health, but I found it easy to just completely switch off to this as I waited for the next adrenaline fueling moment. Why is the building around me exploding? Why doesn’t the boss simply crush me instead? Why is this base filled with lava? If the answer “because it’s fun” is answer enough for you, you will find plenty of excitement in this game.Pros:Over the top action and strategic elements blend well to create smooth flowing combatMany unique multistage boss designsCo-op finds the middle ground between looking after yourself and your partnerOver 16 hours longMany scripted cinematic scenesEach campaign has slightly different gameplay from the othersCons:A barely functional storyline is just to tie events togetherPracticality sometimes suffers for cinematic scenesSome areas lack direction for players, often leading to trail and errorSome clear signs of a port, such as a the options menu presentation			"

												Resident Evil 6 is laughably bad; It's not a good game by any means. It makes Resident Evil 5 look like a masterpiece in comparison.If I had to describe this game in one word, it would be ""unsatisfactory.""Every action in the game is just that. All the guns feel the same to shoot; it doesn't feel like there's a damage difference between them. Sprinting feels like running on ice. Somehow everything feels floaty and disconnected from you. I'm not sure how CAPCOM managed to accomplish such a feat.The graphics pale in comparison to RE5, and the story is utterly ridiculous; there are multiple plot holes that the game never bothers to explain, even after completing all campaigns. The game is just boring to play. Also, I'm not sure what some people are talking about when they say that this iteration of The Mercenaries is the best. The gameplay is boring; therefore, The Mercenaries is boring. Enemies in that mode are more rare than the horror element.Oh yeah, this was supposed to be a horror game too.It's not scary.			"

												Resident Evil 6 certainly isn't the best game out there, it's annoying, frustrating and at times you will be shouting at the screen at unfair deaths, events and circumstances.However it's still  a whole lot of fun and offers a lot of content and replayability. People complain that this game is too easy and offers too many weapons, however playing at higher difficulties results in a much better experience and Co-op can be the thing that makes this game 10 time more enjoyable for the average player.There are communities for this game which are incredibly polite and strong and will be happy to play with you in the DLC modes released which are a ton of fun with the right people.7/10 - NOT GREAT, BUT CERTAINLY NOT BAD.

												The best resident evil to date the game is massive! I have only played leons campaign and I'm only half way through chris campaign and I'm already 16 hours in. The graphics are fantastic and it's a good port feels very smooth and fluid. The campaign storys draw you in and are well scripted. It's just an action packed thrill rid with a tone of huuuuge bosses, action packed scenes , non stop action and there's always something new around the next corner it never gets boring, it's just awesome it really is. It's well worth the money and your getting a massvie games unlike some other games that charge you full price and only last 5/6 hours cod ghost and bf4 for example. res Revelations is also very good if your interested in getting this then you should check out revelations while your at it.

												With Resident Evil 4, a video game series once known for survival horror and tank controls turned into a third person shooter with tank controls. Resident Evil 6 follows this direction even more consequently than previous installments. There's plenty to shoot, ammo is no longer scarce (true for every campaign save for Chris', for some reason), the characters are more agile than ever before and apart from Ada's campaign, every segment can be played cooperatively. Horror is only present in form of the various body horror moments, the monsters and the gore, of course. Little has changed in terms of mechanics and unless you were expecting survival horror to return, RE6 couldn't be better. In theory.Unfortunately, the game is just littered with bad design decisions. For instance, the dreaded button mashing sequences have returned - with a vengeance. While they have been relatively few in-between before, in RE6 you stumble over them every few steps. Every time you think the game finally lets you play, it snatches control away from you in favor of another chase sequence. And even though the characters are as agile as they can get in a Resident Evil game, the zombies can now leap 4 meters (if you're American, convert it) and every time they get hold of you, you will engage in yet another QTE square dance. In a series that has been known for zombies, you fight relatively few of those. For the most part, enemies consist of gun-toting humanoid mutants, placing RE6 even closer to a run-of-the-mill third person shooter. In addition to that, the railroading is insane, the setpieces are not as varied or interesting as they could be and the story, while absolutely ridiculous, takes itself way too seriously. If I didn't know better, I'd say RE6 is a parody of current-gen game design.There are four campaigns in total, which offer different play styles: Leon's campaign is the closest to the more traditional RE games and the only one featuring zombies, Chris' campaign is a full-on third person shooter, Jake's campaign plays like a hybrid of both and Ada's campaign focuses on what Capcom perceives as stealth. RE6 tries to have its cake and eat it, but ends up doing nothing right. As a result, the game feels weirdly unfocused and makes it evident that Capcom doesn't know where to take the series.Despite its glaring flaws, I can't bring myself to hate the game since the mechanics are rock-solid. The gunplay feels satisfying since zombies react properly to hits: A shot to the chest will throw them back or make them stagger; a shot to the leg will make them fall over, giving you enough time to line up additional shots or go for a melee finisher. Capcom even integrated a gore engine, which is always a nice touch in a game featuring the walking dead. RE6 is at its strongest when it's just pitting you against a horde of zombies and at its weakest when it's going for cinematic action. Unfortunately, moments like the latter are way too present. It almost seems like Capcom doesn't have any confidence in the game holding its own with all those other fancy third person shooters around. There is a good game sleeping in here, mostly in the shape of the Mercenaries mode, which I enjoyed more than all four campaigns combined. Popping heads and body slamming zombies all day - this is what RE6 could have been: pure genocidal fun. It only takes a lot of digging to get there. If you like action games and have a high tolerance for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, check out RE6, but don't blame me if you want to fire it into the sun. In case you were expecting a return to the old days of survival horror: Don't even bother. Personally, I don't really care what you do with an established series as long as you do it right.I for one am looking forward to Resident Evil Kart.			"

												I enjoyed RE5. Even though it wasn't the classic RE everyone knew, it was really a mostly good buddy action game with solid mechanics. The campaign was fun, and Mercenaries was also fun.Although this game was also good buddy fun, there are too many flaws to recommend this game normally. And for the 6th game in such a well established series, it's pretty shocking how flawed it is. You should get this game only if:1. You have a friend to play with whom you can enjoy a good laugh with while playing a really flawed game.2. You're paying less than $10.I played the majority of the game with a friend. Only when I played the last campaign did I come face to face with how bad the game really is.Good stuff:1. Movement Controls/Combat mechanics. They're very action oriented and can be really fluid in given situations. Honestly the best showcase for the controls is mercenary mode.2. Pretty decent looking graphically.3. Co-op fun for the first 3 campaigns and mercenary mode.Bad Stuff:1. One of the first things I noticed was the lighting in the game makes absolutely no sense. This was most noticeable in Leon's campaign. The brightness calibration test at the start is HORRIBLY miscalibrated. Both me and my buddy had to increase brightness drastically once we were in the actual game. On top of that, the game seemed absurdley dark. The light sources in the game seemed to give off no light on the surrounding environment. It looks really bad, but this is most noticeable in Leon's campaign.2. Cover mechanics suck, despite so many other cover based shooters having existed by the time this game came out.3. QTEs. See now, I don't hate all QTEs. I like ""context sensitive"" ones. Pressing RT when an enemy is stunned activates a special move. This kind of QTE is fine to me. I hate the ""fill the meter to not die"" and ""press a random button you have no way of knowing before seeing it"" kind. There are a lot of those.4. The camera can be pretty bad, sometimes it's way too close to your character and they occupy way too much screen space. Similarly, this game has running sections where the camera orients itself classic RE style, from a set angle which you can't anticipate. This will often be the cause of many unjustified deaths.5. The plot is pretty whatever, RE isn't really known for having a brilliant plot, despite taking itself so seriously.6. A lot of things that happen seem to make absolutely NO sense, plot-wise AND gameplay-wise. I noticed this mostly in Ada's campaign (which I'm still playing through). There are puzzles you encounter that only make sense within the context of a video game, they have no logic to them. There was a puzzle where I needed an emblem. I walked into a room and a zombie pulls a lever which drops the big chest with the emblem through a trap door. Was he waiting here the whole time to do this? Why is he sentient enough to do this and how does he know my intentions? I killed him and I clearly needed to hold the lever down somehow so i could go through the trap door. So how did I do this? There are bodies hanging from the ceiling from nooses with locks on them. You're supposed to move the lever (which is on a track) near one of the bodies, shoot the lock which causes the body to drop from the noose (how?), the body gets caught on the lever and holds it down. If you shoot the body without landing on the lever, it dissolves and another one drops from the ceiling. ...WHAT. The whole premise of the puzzle makes no sense at all. There are many more like this. I can't even chalk this up to video game logic because there is no logic to this at all.7. Ada's campaign being single player oriented. I appreciate they tried to do something different by making it a single player campaign, but it's executed in the worst way possible. You play 3 campaigns co-op. The 4th campaign can still be played co-op, but the story and gameplay is built around one player. Only Ada can interact with puzzles and exist in cutscenes. The most the second player can do is fight zombies, but there aren't nearly as many because it's built around one person playing. It really dissuades you from playing with a friend because they end up being useless, thus taking pretty much the only entertaining factor of the game away.So yeah the game is fun with a friend, but not worth it otherwise. RE5 was a better game.			"

												One of my favorite titles in the third-person shooter genre.A good example where the sum of it's parts are greater than the individual pieces.  The controls can be clunky and overcomplicated (use a gamepad), quick-time events are always a point of contention, the graphics (while very good) can be a bit underwhelming in spots, the interface is odd and takes time to familiarize yourself with, the story is completely over the top...But the way it's all wrapped together just works so well.  It's an immense coop experience.  It's a very long experience by third person shooter standards (roughly 20-25 hours for a complete playthrough of all campaigns) and honestly I loved almost every bit of it.  Heh.  Most of these ""flaws"" are really just a matter of getting used to change.  This isn't the Resident Evil of old, and convention is regularly defied.  Which isn't always a bad thing, but you'll have to adjust for it.  The tension of tip-toeing and backtracking through a mansion for hours on 10 bullets is replaced with shootouts, explosions and grandeous boss battles.  The ""zombies"" often have guns.If you can manage to appreciate that this is an action game first, and Resident Evil second... go in with an open mind, and more importantly, go in with a friend... you'll have a great time.  The little flaws will be almost endearing in the bigger picture.If you can't appreciate that... odds are the issues I mentioned above could ruin it for you.			"

												Capcom, they gave a big '♥♥♥♥ you' to all the fans of the series, and turned what made them popular, into a shoot-everything-with-unlimited-ammo action movie. But they also made an uninteresting and ugly game﻿.A mess of QTE's, corridor-levels, (awful) cut-scene-overload and minimized inventory-managment. Got cut away the last, squealing rest of horror that remained in the Resident Evil Series.That happens, when a company tries to satisfy everyone at once: The Call of Duty-Kiddies, Dinosaur-Fans, Gears of War-Players and... ""Zombie""-Fans!Thats sad, because the game could have sold itself just by the franchise.			"

I put in 2 1/2 hours into Chris's campain and felt it was an intro the entire time. The resident evil i fell in love with is gone. I felt like the gameplay was clunky as hell, i would kick a zombie to the ground the somehow in a split second he would get up, tackle me and take down a ton of health. Even the interactive (tap A) or swirl your thumbstick is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥cause sometimes it goes faster than even possible. The tactics originally in this game were around the fact of playing smart, scavenging for ammo and conserving it properly by shooting out their kneecaps and using physical force as everyone knows. Now don't get me wrong the melee combat is much better in this, they give u way to much ammo. it is literally just pull out your pistols, shoot a ton and keep going. I will most likely not be continuing more into this game because of how unoriginal and disgusting the gameplay is imo.			"

I put in 2 1/2 hours into Chris's campain and felt it was an intro the entire time. The resident evil i fell in love with is gone. I felt like the gameplay was clunky as hell, i would kick a zombie to the ground the somehow in a split second he would get up, tackle me and take down a ton of health. Even the interactive (tap A) or swirl your thumbstick is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥cause sometimes it goes faster than even possible. The tactics originally in this game were around the fact of playing smart, scavenging for ammo and conserving it properly by shooting out their kneecaps and using physical force as everyone knows. Now don't get me wrong the melee combat is much better in this, they give u way to much ammo. it is literally just pull out your pistols, shoot a ton and keep going. I will most likely not be continuing more into this game because of how unoriginal and disgusting the gameplay is imo.			"

												Кради убивай. Я не поклонник Резидента в принципе, меня в него поиграть затащили друзья. Так что, моё мнение как обычного игрока: Загадочное прохождение компаний, увлекательные игровые моменты, интересная и весьма драмматическая линия сюжета и связь между каждым персонажем.Обязательно перед началом игры корректируйте свои настройки графики и прочего. В игре, как и в любой другой, есть баги, но встречаются на редкость. Желательно начать прохождение с самой первой части и не пропуская дополнения, если вы действительно хотите полностью погрузиться в эту историю...			"

												Once you get over the fact that Resident Evil is not scary anymore you can really enjoy this game, mercenaries mode is a lot of fun. The story is not a strong point, but the different play styles keep it fresh. If you buy it with a friend I recommend the siege DLC. This can be one of the most fun you'll get from a coop game since RE5 (even better). If you want to play solo I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a diehard fan. (at least the AI is way better in this one.)			"

												I cannot, in good faith, reccomend this game to anyone. If you are interested in the story go look up a playthrough on youtube or read a summary. If you are interested in the gameplay just play Resident Evil 5. This game is absolutely terrible. You would get a more enjoyable experience and a better value for your money by buying a physical copy of Duke Nukem Forever and then burning it.There is not a single redeemable quality to this game.

												I don't know how to start but basically this game ruined my life in a good way. Something interesting concerning Resident Evil is that, there is always something to do even when you finish the story mode. Like, you could play forever man! I think everything was good in this game except the fact that //SPOILER: they've killed a character that could have been so interesting in the future. // But this said I really enjoyed and still enjoy this game!

But if you have never played any of the resident evil games then you might like it. Capcom really messed this one up. But if you have played the games you will not like this game but if you still wanna try it just wait for a sale i would say 19.99 is when you should buy it but not for 30$			"

												If you want to relive the awesome feel of resident evil 4 and 5 then you've come to the wrong place. I bought this for $7 and that's really all this game is worth. I can't really put my finger on what makes this game feel so awfull but I'll just run down the the list of anoyances.So many bugs happen when kicking/stomping on zombies, quite often you'll glitch by a wall and be left with no health.Guns feel really poorly. In previous games you can tell when an enemy is dead but in this game you'll quite often pump an enemy full of bullets only to realize he died 5 shots ago.Autosave sucks, usually you're to busy fighting to notice when you've hit a save zone. Twice I had to redo an entire zone because I exited just before the next autosave.Just when you think the game is done holding your hand through another sequence it happens all again, like i'm in a perpetual tutorial.All in all it feels more like dead rising than resident evil.I'm not even 2 hours into the game and allready it feels like a chore, but I'm going to try and beat it.

												This bad console port is a horror to play. The previous Resident Evil games were somewhat flawed but still quite enjoyable. This one isn't. In short i'd recommend not buying the game. It's not worth a single euro.The gameplay feels very forced and restrictive. You cant jump, at times the camera is being directed or you cant run for no apparent reason. Aiming is a pain. The inventory is to small, using it is counter intuitive. Often resulting in not being able to pick anything up. The many quicktime events are annoying.

												Resident Evil 6 is a confusing mess. It is finally obvious that Capcom has no clue what they want to do with this series so they're just throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥at the wall and seeing what sticks. The plot jumps around in time from chapter to chapter like Memento on crack. The Leon chapter is the only thing even vaguely remenicient of Resident Evil's roots, and even that is basically Kobayashi jumping up and down, waving his arms and screaming ""HEY YOU REMEMBER 2!?

												If you have a friend and you want to have a laugh together with a generic co-op zombie shooter loaded with problems, this game isn't too bad. I got it on sale for $7.50 and it's worth about that much. It's competent enough to function while being bad enough to laugh at. As a Resident Evil game, though, it's TERRIBLE and because it's actually SUPPOSED to be a Resident Evil game, it deserves the negative review. The last great RE game, IMO and not counting remakes, was RE4. This game takes everything good about the older RE games and throws it out the window while taking all the bad stuff and amplifies it 100 fold. It also throws in all the garbage gaming conventions that modern AAA devs think games need that drive me crazy like QTEs, excessive cutscenes, QTEs, taking control away from the player in the middle of gameplay segments, QTEs, gamey button prompts that ruin immersion, have I mentioned QTEs? Let me compare the beginning of this game to a great RE game like RE2. In RE2 you had an FMV cutscene (with zero QTEs) followed by a wonderful gameplay intro that was so memorable I could paint a picture of each scene from memory. Between the end of the FMV cutscene and finding the police station, there was only one short cutscene that used the in-game engine at a gun shop. Aside from that short cutscene it was all normal gameplay allowing the player to get used to the game and immerse themself in the world. In RE6 you're being shot at by a helicopter right off the bat, but wait, you have to open the options menu because you're dropped into the game without a main menu. The heli shoots constantly without hitting anything while you mess with settings, a real immersion killer. Then you have to drag Helena away from the heli but you don't press the movement keys to do so, you mash the spacebar for a garbage QTE. Then you're in an alley for an on-rails segment where any direction you press has Leon lumber forward. Up/down/left/right all progress him down this rail. The player has extremely limited control. In the next part you're finally free to walk around but that's it. You can't check the weapon controls or even run. You can only walk. Then the game expects you to learn the weapon controls in 0.25 seconds as they throw a zombie at your face and flash QTE style prompts on the screen (although this isn't a QTE, it just has the immersion-destroying prompts as a kind of tutorial). Failing to shoot the zombie because you weren't simply allowed to play with your gun to get used to it before the zombie shows up, you die and go back to a checkpoint. As the tutorial segment continues you jump over cars as part of a QTE, you fly a helicopter as part of a QTE, you run from an explosion as part of a QTE, you shoot zombies as part of a QTE, etc... It's all very exciting gameplay... NOT. Devs, how about you let ME play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game? The co-op is generic, as I said. In a Resident Evil game I expect to poke around, click on environmental stuff to read little descriptions of things, pick up files, search for ammo/herbs, solve puzzles, etc. Aside from picking up the odd ammo/herb none of that is present. Also, 90% of your items come from enemy drops so searching for environmental pickups isn't even that important. It's streamlined for co-op, in other words. Devs these days seem to think that a co-op experience has to be FAST to be playable. Can't stop to read descriptions! Can't stop to admire the scenery! Can't stop to solve puzzles! Gotta blaze through the game ASAP! You want a puzzle? How about Player A helps Player B access a co-op accessible area, and then Player B presses a button/unlocks a door/pushes a box/etc to allow Player A to follow? Great puzzle, right? There are also dual pickups meaning both players can pick up each item once meaning there's no real communication aside from ""ammo/herb over here"". You won't have to discuss how much ammo/herbs of each type each player has and who should get what. I could go on. There are many factors that make this a terrible RE game or just a sub-par generic co-op game but we'd be here all day. Overall, the game is playable. If you're playing with a friend, it's actually not bad to play through and laugh at the problems the game has so if that sounds like something you'd enjoy, I can honestly recommend picking it up on sale. For the many reasons stated, however, I feel this game falls way, way, way short of it's potential and isn't a fitting entry in the RE franchise and that's where the negative review comes from.Final Edit: Finished the main campaign and while I have a number of new complaints, the one that really needs to be added here is the dynamic difficulty. In other games that have dynamic difficulty, after you die at the same spot a few times the game might get a little easier to help you get past that part. Here, though, you die once and it  switches to Baby Mode. You'll never die in the same place twice (unless it's due to some janky QTE). Not only is this very insulting to the player but it's also a huge flaw in game design philosphy to think that nothing in the game should take more than 2 attempts.			"

												While the co-op is a blast, this is easily the second worst Resident Evil game ever made. I only say it's the second worst, because nothing to this day has managaed to outdo the horrible asthetic that is RE5.I'm a huge Resident Evil fan. Look at my Steam URL. I've kept this handle since 2005. I'm a fan of the classic RE games, and RE4 is a great game. Please, listen to me on this. They have ruined the story for good with RE6, and have done too many things that will be hard to undo. If undone in any way, they will just make this wound worse than it was than was after the events happened.As for the gameplay, the controls handle outstandingly well. That's the surprising part. For a game that has managed to mangle a fictional universe so thoroughly, just diving around and shooting is really fun to execute. The co-op has great netcode from my own experience, and the idea of hunting agents that are playing portions of the game is fantastic in concept. I give Capcom props to the attempt at the latter mention, but can't recommend this game in the end.I can only suggest maybe buying it at a significantly cheaper price than the usual full price. Say, maybe ten dollars or less? If you have a PS3 or Xbox 360, it's also just cheaper on there in the Capcom Essentials collection which comes with four other games. That costs labout $20 for its current price. Do yourself a favor and pick that up instead, and you'll get Dead Rising too as an added bonus.			"

												Nice game - never played a Resident Evil (RE) game before and this is my first I lied, I just remembered I played a bit of Revelations(just the very beginning of it) on the 3DS XL, but didn't like how it was played with the analogue and keypad to aim and shoot(it felt awkward) and stuff so I sold that game and wait till I get get PC version of it and play that instead. I've watched the RE movies though, all of them. They were cool! I am awaiting for the next sequel movie! Long story short, Biohazard is the Japanese name for it over there and Resident Evil is the name that was chosen for the Americans in case people are wondering why there are two titles. When I first saw this, I though ""Oooh, do I get another free bonus game with RE 6 as well?"" And of course didn't find it (when I launched the game)and did some googling and yeah that's what it was...Ok, I don't know much history about the story of the RE game(So I'll have to play RE 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to get the connections and story going, the game did mention Raccoon City and I think that's a game itself or could be apart of one of those numbers - so I'll need to play that sometime as well), and the movies I watched were from a few years ago too so if anything from the movies did have some sort of connection to the games, then I don't know/remember of. So I guess I'll start where RE 6 starts off at. There's zombie apacalypse going on, thanks to the new weapons man has design to *supposedly* take care of terrism and such. You start off with Leon and Helena (I think I spelt her name correctly). Helena got badly wounded and it's up to Leon to find something to fix that up. After that little scenario, you are brought to the main menu of the game, which is interesting as games usually bring you the main menu first before giving you a taste of the the game itself. When I first started, I thought I had to maybe complete the game before I could go to the menu and save and to not be able to take breaks. Hah. Well anyways, from there you can do some configurations and stuff and then play the campaigns. There are four campaigns, Leon, Chris, Jake and Ada. You will want to play through all of them to see what RE 6 has got to offer as a whole, just by playing one of the campaigns won't be enough as it'll feel too short. Even though there's four campaigns, they are not a sequel to one another but as played in their respective character's eyes of how they saw it. So if you've played it once through with Leon, that's pretty much it, or at least how it went with him. About six hours worth of gameplay. When playing Chris' campaign, you play it at exactly same time period but in Chris' eyes and how it happened for him, same with Jake and Ada's. So the four people will meet at one point or another during each other's campaign. So with that, an average gamer would play a day's worth of RE 6 if he were to play non-stop. In each of the four campaigns, you can play as one of the two characters, amking it a two player only coop or solo with a bot. In Leon, it's Leon and Helena, in Chris' it's Chris and Pierce, in jake's, it's Jake and Sherry(Or it could be spelt with a C) and apparently in Ada, it's Ada and some agent(otherwise you solo the entire game yourself with no help because when I did, there was no agent bot to help out). I found the gameplay enjoyable, save for those fustration puzzle(it's always that moment after you google the solution or a hint/tip and find out ""Wow....I'm so blind and dumb, how could I not see that??!"" - I've only done it once by the way and that was for Ada's campaign...) moments and boss moments where you're like (after using up all your bullets of every weapon you have) ""How the hell do I take this guy down??!"" hahahaThe controls were customizable(well some of them at least) so that's nice to know, though I was fine with the default values anyways. The grahics were nice too, though it appears to be capped at 120fps....despite my 144Hz monitor and display refresh rate was also set to 144 as well ingame. I also notice quite a bit of screen tearing(especially near the end of Jake's campaign) which shouldn't be happening because I am running on a higher refresh rate than the fps it was pumping out, so unless fraps was reporting an incorrect fps value, maybe I was going over 144fps whilst gaming? Though having V-Sync enabled appears to fix that, though I've already solo'd the entire game, all four campaigns with V-sync off(though I wanted it off as it would increas input lag which is a fact and it was already capped to 120 and my refresh rate is set to 144 anyways - so I suppose capping fps isn't really an alternative to fix screen tearing whilst also avoiding increased input lag)....but it still didn't bring to counter to 144 which is what it's supposed to sync to...must be internal engine fps limit or something...Audio appears to be stereo only, though a game like this, I reckon it would have benefit with a surround sound option....you know, zombies/enemies coming from the behind, or your sides....Voice overs were nice too and felt right as well. Yeah...oh yeah, you can also join-mid game too so you don't have to wait till they finish a chapter or a checkpoint. I had a few randoms join mine when I was soloing the game. Some of the addons you can't even solo which is shame because I wanted too to play them, so you'll need to get a group together and do that. Um yeah...I liked it so thumbs up from me! Some of the game parts are really really dark, espcially the Leon campaign so you'll want to play on a monitor that has excellent contrast or else you'll need to either turn down brightness/gamma(ingame or in your graphics control panel - or both) to the point where Black is Black and not Grey, but foregoing brightness when needed for the bright areas which will look darker and dull and not so wow factor or just put up with your crappy monitor and see Grey instead of nice deep Blacks that you're supposed to see. It's these things like this that break immersion....and unfortunately you can't buy CRTs anymore.....and they have superior contrast to the LCDs I'm using...=====================================================Played on ""The Beast""i7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, WinXP x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fans!

												Me and a friend bought this at the same time so that we could play the game through in co-op.  We have played the whole thing and we spent almost the entire time yelling at each other and being upset, both with each other and the game.  He made me play the girl in every campaign.   He is an idiot and I hate him.  The game is okay.I can list 2 things that are my major dislikes about this game:1.  TOO.  MANY.  QUICK TIME EVENTS.  Stop it.  One of the campaigns literally just ends with like ten minutes of quick time events.  No really, stop it.  Press X to stop it.2. Some really stupid monster designs.  Centaur panther thing was the worst.  Also, why does every monster in this game also have to be an animal?  Like... can't you just be a mutant guy?  Why do you also have to be a spider.  Why does getting injected with a mutant virus make you turn into a tyrannosaurus rex?  Can't you just be some sort of horribly mutated tentacle monster with a bunch of eyes?  Why am I fighting a giant fly?  I'm glad that whatever character designer did that was not allowed to work on any other resident evil games.  ( Note: The only things that were not thusly affected were good old fashioned zombies - they were just zombies )Other than those 2 things though this is actually a really fun action/horror game.			"

												Nice game - never played a Resident Evil (RE) game before and this is my first I lied, I just remembered I played a bit of Revelations(just the very beginning of it) on the 3DS XL, but didn't like how it was played with the analogue and keypad to aim and shoot(it felt awkward) and stuff so I sold that game and wait till I get get PC version of it and play that instead. I've watched the RE movies though, all of them. They were cool! I am awaiting for the next sequel movie! Long story short, Biohazard is the Japanese name for it over there and Resident Evil is the name that was chosen for the Americans in case people are wondering why there are two titles. When I first saw this, I though ""Oooh, do I get another free bonus game with RE 6 as well?"" And of course didn't find it (when I launched the game)and did some googling and yeah that's what it was...Ok, I don't know much history about the story of the RE game(So I'll have to play RE 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to get the connections and story going, the game did mention Raccoon City and I think that's a game itself or could be apart of one of those numbers - so I'll need to play that sometime as well), and the movies I watched were from a few years ago too so if anything from the movies did have some sort of connection to the games, then I don't know/remember of. So I guess I'll start where RE 6 starts off at. There's zombie apacalypse going on, thanks to the new weapons man has design to *supposedly* take care of terrism and such. You start off with Leon and Helena (I think I spelt her name correctly). Helena got badly wounded and it's up to Leon to find something to fix that up. After that little scenario, you are brought to the main menu of the game, which is interesting as games usually bring you the main menu first before giving you a taste of the the game itself. When I first started, I thought I had to maybe complete the game before I could go to the menu and save and to not be able to take breaks. Hah. Well anyways, from there you can do some configurations and stuff and then play the campaigns. There are four campaigns, Leon, Chris, Jake and Ada. You will want to play through all of them to see what RE 6 has got to offer as a whole, just by playing one of the campaigns won't be enough as it'll feel too short. Even though there's four campaigns, they are not a sequel to one another but as played in their respective character's eyes of how they saw it. So if you've played it once through with Leon, that's pretty much it, or at least how it went with him. About six hours worth of gameplay. When playing Chris' campaign, you play it at exactly same time period but in Chris' eyes and how it happened for him, same with Jake and Ada's. So the four people will meet at one point or another during each other's campaign. So with that, an average gamer would play a day's worth of RE 6 if he were to play non-stop. In each of the four campaigns, you can play as one of the two characters, amking it a two player only coop or solo with a bot. In Leon, it's Leon and Helena, in Chris' it's Chris and Pierce, in jake's, it's Jake and Sherry(Or it could be spelt with a C) and apparently in Ada, it's Ada and some agent(otherwise you solo the entire game yourself with no help because when I did, there was no agent bot to help out). I found the gameplay enjoyable, save for those fustration puzzle(it's always that moment after you google the solution or a hint/tip and find out ""Wow....I'm so blind and dumb, how could I not see that??!"" - I've only done it once by the way and that was for Ada's campaign...) moments and boss moments where you're like (after using up all your bullets of every weapon you have) ""How the hell do I take this guy down??!"" hahahaThe controls were customizable(well some of them at least) so that's nice to know, though I was fine with the default values anyways. The grahics were nice too, though it appears to be capped at 120fps....despite my 144Hz monitor and display refresh rate was also set to 144 as well ingame. I also notice quite a bit of screen tearing(especially near the end of Jake's campaign) which shouldn't be happening because I am running on a higher refresh rate than the fps it was pumping out, so unless fraps was reporting an incorrect fps value, maybe I was going over 144fps whilst gaming? Though having V-Sync enabled appears to fix that, though I've already solo'd the entire game, all four campaigns with V-sync off(though I wanted it off as it would increas input lag which is a fact and it was already capped to 120 and my refresh rate is set to 144 anyways - so I suppose capping fps isn't really an alternative to fix screen tearing whilst also avoiding increased input lag)....but it still didn't bring to counter to 144 which is what it's supposed to sync to...must be internal engine fps limit or something...Audio appears to be stereo only, though a game like this, I reckon it would have benefit with a surround sound option....you know, zombies/enemies coming from the behind, or your sides....Voice overs were nice too and felt right as well. Yeah...oh yeah, you can also join-mid game too so you don't have to wait till they finish a chapter or a checkpoint. I had a few randoms join mine when I was soloing the game. Some of the addons you can't even solo which is shame because I wanted too to play them, so you'll need to get a group together and do that. Um yeah...I liked it so thumbs up from me! Some of the game parts are really really dark, espcially the Leon campaign so you'll want to play on a monitor that has excellent contrast or else you'll need to either turn down brightness/gamma(ingame or in your graphics control panel - or both) to the point where Black is Black and not Grey, but foregoing brightness when needed for the bright areas which will look darker and dull and not so wow factor or just put up with your crappy monitor and see Grey instead of nice deep Blacks that you're supposed to see. It's these things like this that break immersion....and unfortunately you can't buy CRTs anymore.....and they have superior contrast to the LCDs I'm using...=====================================================Played on ""The Beast""i7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, WinXP x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fans!

												Have you ever had one of those nights where you drank 2 cases of beer and ate... I dunno, 25 pounds of gumbo, then the next morning drank 2 pots of coffee with a handful of painkillers... then about two hours later tried to take a crap a realized that no amount of toilet paper was going to get you clean?  That you might have to hop in the shower or jam your nether region into the sink to get it all spiffy again?This game is exactly like that.It sucks.  It's terrible.  I got it for 75% off or something along those lines during the Steam Sale, and I still feel completely ripped off.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, MY FRIENDS.(If you want to buy this game, I suggest sending me 99% of the price, using the last 1% to acquire a thumbtack, and repeatedly jab said thumbtack into your armpits.  You'll have much, much more fun)Terrible storyline.  Terrible gameplay (push forward to proceed through the entire game, which will briefly be interrupted by quick-reaction moments that are boring as hell).  Terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.DO NOT BUY.

Leon's Story:Leon's story is definitely the Horror aspect of the game, by far. They give you that old Resident Evil feeling mixed in with the new genre Resident Evil 6 has. Through-out the game, you're gradually learning who your partner is, how she is, and what her purpose is. Mainly the objective changes as the story progress, which is an obvious need for Story Telling. However, Leon's story is pretty much the 'Kickstarter' for Resident Evil 6's story, obviously, I'm not saying this for everyone, but I think some people got the wrong idea that the whole game was going to be 'Horror Based' due to the fact that Leon's was horror, and it was the first story there!Chris's Story:Similar to Leon's, Chris's story is definitely the Kickstarter for the 'Real Action' aspect of the game. It starts off giving you the BSAA's perspective on the situation at hand. How once a legend, was so proudful & respectable, became this washed up, depressed person, and that person is Chris Redfield. I like to relate this type of situation to ""Dead Rising 2: Off The Record."", getting back up on your feet & becoming something once more. Anyways, the story is filled with tons of Firefights, action, melee, things of that nature. Intense moments of trying to escape or save your partner, running out of ammo at the completely wrong times, hehe. Chris's story tells how your personal vengance may ruin your work-life and or relationships with others. Aside from Chris, Piers, I felt he was a very under-developed character that was there just to get the story going with Chris. However, he did make a noble sacrifice in the story, how they♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off so many times about Piers, how much regret you felt for taking him along, but Chris noticed his Loyalty & Boldness, and that's what makes a Real Soldier.Jake's Story:I absolutely LOVED Jake's story! It was by far my favorite one. Jake Muller was highly developed & his character progression greatly touches my heart. I, personally am a fan of tough guys becoming more sensitive because they know their worth in the world, but wont admit it. Game-play wise, this story is another Action Aspect, which was fine by me, I focused mainly on the development of Sherry & Jake through-out this journey. But I gotta say, it's kinda your typical ""You've been with me through hard times long enough, and now I think it's time to like each other!"", but I guess it's realistic in a way due to the fact that if someone saves your life numerous times within various months and those two have been through so much, it would make them care that way about each other.Ada's Story:Ada's story pretty much summarizes the entire game from her perspective & clears up anything you may have missed or was confused about, answers questions. It's a tale of watching your enemy slowly kill themselves as in reality, you are ultimately the better person & more responsible person. Even when playing as Ada, you learn new things about her, hear her say things you really wouldn't expect. It seems as if Ada is a quiet person that loves watching other's attempt in things, knowing in her head, she could probably do it better. Also, I never understood what that ""Agent"" guy was for, I know he's for Co-op, but it didn't make a lick of sense. They should have atleast made Ada's story; Single-Player-Only.Soundtrack:The soundtrack was a mix of the original Resident Evils & it had a taste of the animated movie soundtrack as well. I love it, although much of the music wasn't Horror(Not a bad thing!). It was more orchestral/action-based, intense running scenes fit well with this type of Music! My favorite was honestly ""08_Rasklapanje"", it plays when you first meet the Rasklapanje. Let's be honest, you die-hard Resident Evil fans had to like that creature, it freaked me the ♥♥♥♥ out, especially the fact you're in a complex puzzle area when that soundtrack plays..Gameplay:The game-play wasn't your traditional 'Resident Evil' game, but it surely wasn't horrible like half the community said. This game has its own aspect of Resident Evil 4 & a modern shoulder shooter. In realistic terms, they're all trained professionals, they've been in deep♥♥♥♥♥♥for years, they should be able to run & gun in the game! I'm not sure if this was a glitch in the camera system or what, but sometimes in scripted events, it would change my camera angle even though it wasn't really a giant priority to change it. It seems like they didn't bother to change the direction of the character standing from Left to Right. Another thing as well, I know I'm going to get♥♥♥♥♥♥for this, but this would of been so cool to have, actually; different walking/running animations for each indivdual characters! It seems more realistic, but it would take so much more money to make that happen~Conclusion:Not your traditional-everyday-Resident Evil-game, but it's definitely worth a buy! It really introduces a new aspect of Resident Evil itself! I believe that newer generation Resident Evil games should be like Resident Evil 6 - Game-play wise. With very delightful characters you know & love, old friends come back, old references, the same old Virus as well, actually. Along with old stuff, they definitely have new stuff as well!10/10 ♥			"

												Bought this game for its coop, expecting to get at least what RE5 was offering and got disappointed.The game feels like a downgrade of RE5, which already wasn't a masterpiece but was still a fun coop experience.The game is visually unappealing, only offers a lame skill system between missions (which does not encourage any kind of replayability), has problem with servers (hard to finish one of the long♥♥♥♥♥mission in coop without my partner losing connexion... with no reconnect of course), sometimes bug while transitionning to cinematics (which occurs every minute or so) and offers very little coop interaction in general.Those problems could be looked over if the gameplay was good but no, the gameplay of RE6 is 80% QTE and the rest are mediocre, uninteresting and unchallenging shooting phases. Oh and don't expect any kind of survival experience, ammunitions are raining down on you and we don't even bother looting the healing herbs after a couple chapters.			"

												RE4 was the pinnacle of RE games, RE5 was fun but had too many negative elements to make it a classic, Capcom decided to take all the horrible elements of RE5 and make a whole game out of them. Quick time events are the bane of RE games at this point, the story line they try to carry over from various RE games is uninteresting even to die hard RE fans, but the constant cut-scene interruption is the worst. Long cut-scene, walk 2 feet, press spacebar, another long cut scene. The co-op is fun but not enough to justify buying this game, total reboot required on this franchise.Also single player game is even shorter then RE5, think like 8 hours, but there is no re-playability after that unlike RE5 because of the above mentioned issues, so to get any kind of bang for your buck wait for a mega discount.

												I've been playing Resident Evil since inception and I have to say that I've NEVER been this disappointed in a new RE release as I am with this one. Everything about this game is terrible. The action/movement is terrible, the gameplay itself is horrible. It is setup with the cut scenes to the point where it completely takes you out of the action in the game and you're basically left hitting buttons they prompt you with on all the cut scenes.I'm not sure who's idea it was to do this, but it was the wrong decision. RE4 and 5 had great gameplay, so I would have been happy with something similar to that. We love to play video games and be in the action. We don't want to be the composer of a wannabe movie, which is what RE6 is..100% failNow if I can get just this game OUT of my Steam list I'll be happy :)			"

												tl;dr includedFor the record this was gifted to me by a friend and had it not been, I wouldn't have finished more than about an hour of it....I would've been wrong in doing so as playing through all 4 campaigns with said friend was able to shine some light on just how TRULY tedious, exhausting, nonsensical, ugly, monotonous, cheesy and haunting of a game it really is.I don't even know where to start with this abomination of a game. This game seems to be a congregation of promising ideas with the most abysmal implementation known to the video game industry. Apparently no one could decide if they wanted an interactive movie or another true installment into the Resident Evil franchise and just said ""♥♥♥♥ it"" morphing whatever they could think of into a tangled mess of a game. Don't get me wrong Id love to like this game. Its nothing short of a neat concept to have 4 seperate stories take place all at once ultimately ending in one cohesive vision of action and suspense.So I'll start with the positives in this game, it loads. Well...no not really on several occasions there were times when trying to join a co-op session cause the game to lag horribly unless the creator quits and restarts the lobby. And alt tabbing would inexplicably cause the framerate to lag without and indication of going back to normal.Ok so whats wrong with the game? Everything. A barage of bullet sponge enemies acompanied with 30 second moments of action inbetween pointless cutscenes only to immediately lead into another part of the story making me wonder why the game included it as gameplay rather than just an entire cutscene. (seriously the chapters felt about as shattered as Lost Planet 2) The camera and controls were pretty pathetic, taking the gameplay many steps back instead of progressing into something refreshing. Not to mention something simple like rebinding sidemouse buttons won't work as the game doesn't even recognize them. You'll often be thrown to the ground or flung about being disorientated forcing you to trudge through parts of the game. Which would be fun if the gunplay didnt feel like shooting scarecrows. You can't be tactical or skillful in encounters. Headshots are a hit and miss for either killing the enemy or just triggering a transformation. Thus your best bet is to either unload as many clips as possible and hope you can tell when theyre dead (a health bar honestly wouldve done wonders for this game) or try to incapacitate with a single shot and use melee (which you are limited on and eventually get slowed down if you run out of stamina) and just hope the enemy doesnt land a cheap shot before youre able to thus flinging you about some more...becoming incapacitated yet again and....do you see the pattern yet?Lets not forget the muddled story. Breaking it off into 4 segments wouldve been nice if it wasnt filled with the same chore missions/enemies throughout several campaigns instead of being done and over with it and if they had made SOME effort to bring any suspense to the story at all. 0 build up. Get guns, shoot things. Thats it, theres some garbage character development love story in one of the campaigns and nonsense drama (you killed my dad i dunno how to deal with that ok im better now we're friends lets save the world) (uhoh my evil clone is doing♥♥♥♥♥♥better not let anyone in on that so they all want to kill me because im mysterious and cant break character by using my ♥♥♥♥ING brain) Lets not forget that the graphics have gone NOWHERE. Given that capcom games fundamentally focus on gameplay and story I was prepared for that. However this games story and gameplay were drivel so it would've been nice if the engine had actually changed or at least looked better than the previous title. Youre left romping about an ugly world (not for the sake of atmosphere, it looks more like lack of effort) with poor contrast and an overall muddy template. Last but not least Id like to mention that playing number 2 to ada wong in the 4th campaign had me feeling more useless than watching someone else play solo. You magically teleport when she grapples, you cant pick anything up, you can't open doors or interact with anything, and you start with less weapons. Did I mention theres a good 5-10 minutes when youre in a helicopter doing absolutely nothing because the person playing ada is driving and you can only shoot straight ahead, which wouldve been fine if for some arbitrary reason my controls on my half of the weapons systems werent locked only to the right side, thus making it impossible to aim.tl;dr this game is a travesty and massive blemish on the RE franchise. It shows you how to do everything wrong. I dunno how they got it funded but I had more fun writing this hateful review than playing the game. Anyways heres wonderwall			"

												This has to be one of the crappiest games to ever make it on the market.How this managed to bypass quality conrtol is beyond me.The controls and save point system is terrible.Moving your character about in this game is extremely awkward.Remapping the keyboard controls is an exercise in aggravation.The other games in the RE series is not as bad as this as far as thisgoes.This is something that might be better on an xbox than a pc.As a pc game this should be consigned to the toilet.After trying to get thru the beginning part I decided to give upthis game entirely.The beginning list of credits shown should have been left out.It should be an option for the player to see who did what in themaking of this game which is really irrrelevant anyway.If I want to know who the lead programmer was then that should be ina separate section of the game available to those who want toaccess that info.Also the cut scenes at the beginning were way too long to sit thru.If the developers were simply trying to make another animatedfilm in the RE series then I could understand.But damn this is a game not a dramatic film.Cut out the poignant scenes and get to the game.After this I'm going back to the Revelations series and stick withthat.It's too bad that I can't get a refund for this as I had purchased this2 years ago and back then there was absolutely no refund policywhatsoever.

												Played for twenty minutes composed 95% of cutscenes, on-rails walking, and quick-time-events.  The brief shooting portion was interrupted twice by cutscenes.  Decided to take a break.  When I loaded the game again, I found that it had not saved my progress.  Upon researching, it seems I did not hit a ""save point"" and I have no idea when a ""save point"" might occur.  Some people mention that save points occur at 30-90 minute intervals.  It may be a great game, but I can't commit to playing for an indefinite period of time in order to find out, especially if the tutorial gameplay is representative of the rest of the game.On the plus side, this is a superior PC port compared to RE4/5.  Gameplay-wise, they've updated the wheelchair-based control scheme to allow for moving sideways and melee is no longer tied to quick-time-events.I will update this review once I can set aside enough time to maybe hit a save point.

												This game sucks so much. I bought it new for XBOX 360 when it came out and, just like Dead Island, I got rid of it immediately.Unlike Dead Island the PC version in the future is no better. Are you running in a precarious situation? Gasp as the computer takes control of the camera and tries to kill you by making you look at some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t set piece.Do you like to feel uncomfortable and claustrophobic? The FOV is that of a concussed duckling, requiring constant and bizarre corrections to do things like pick up ammo, and accidentally climb a ladder while trying to pick up ammo.If you want to interact with a breakable piece of the environment while trying to kick an enemy, RE6 is the game of your dream. The stupid camera design, and scrunched FOV, really shine when you get autocamera'd into kicking a crate while trying to melee your way out of a desperate struggle and can't cancel the glacial animation.To cap off this hot♥♥♥♥♥♥mess, a patch has made it so some users have audio play independently of video during cutscenes, ruining what could have been a bright spot for this crunchy snoozer. I'm not sure but it looks like some enemies are still immune to damage while in their ""react-to-being-shot"" animation.4/10, will wait for Capcom to Tomb Raider 2013 this soup sandwich of a franchise.

												This review is based on 1 hour of play time on 'Professional' setting so I'm not sure if lower settings fix this problem, but... I can't even take the time to replay it to be honest. I was murdered by my own AI partner three times. I played on Leon's campaign, the AI (Helena) chooses to shoot random zombies at random times, usually only when you're directly in front of her. She has no concept of where you are and probably couldn't care less. I'm not going to finish a game where an hour in, I've already been killed by my own partner three times... too ridiculous to continue.			"

												This game is among my top 3 least favorite games, along with The Hobbit for Gamecube, and The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer for Gameboy color. I bought two of these three games with the intention of having fun and engaging in some of my favorite story worlds. I think my great grandmother bought The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer for me, and I hope anyone who has that game acquired it in the same fashion. I beat these games so that I didn't feel that I was giving up.With that said, I really wanted Resident Evil 6 to be enjoyable. I liked the earlier entries to the series, with 2,3, and 5 being weaker links (5 especially). I kept up the grind, and when the game kept getting slow, I would find myself putting this game down for weeks on end, but resuming at some point because I wanted the game to be good. I would keep giving RE6 another shot because in my mind, it shouldn't be as bad as it is. but it is as bad as it is.The most enjoyable part about RE6 is the idea of RE6. The concept of having several parallel stories that you can choose from, stories that intertwine with eachother is central to RE6. This concept isn't new to the series, they toyed with it in RE2. And while I like seeing the other characters cameo in eachothers storylines, the storylines themselves are so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that the intertwining just smears one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storyline into the next, like a giant poopy mess. Actually, the best part about RE6 is playing as the female lead, Helena Harper. They probably spent more time shaping her booty then they did writing the story. She may be a bland protagonist, but she doo got a booty.CONS: Everything (sans Helena's booty)			"

												Минусы? самая худшая часть RE за всю историю? Я удивляюсь, откуда такие низкие оценки у данной игры? Mногие критикуют игру за то, что в игре 3 кампании, что ""Capcom сделала из серии тупой шутер без сюжета, умудрилась утратить атмосферу и погружение в мир"" - всё это полная чушь.- Если вы любитель Resident Evil 2,3,4 части как например я, то вам следует проходить всего одну кампанию в игре, это за Леона, эта кампания ближе подходит к мрачной атмосфере, хардкору, хоррору, как в первых частях серии, там и зомби нормальные, и патронов мало.- Если вы любитель Resident Evil 5, то вам следует проходить кампанию за Криса, больше экшона и меньше хардкора.- А если вам нравятся все части, то следует проходить все кампании, уж поверьте, вы не будете разочарованы.Capcom просто решила угодить всем фанатам серии RE, и сделала каждую кампанию не похожей друг на друга, каждая кампания проходится около 6 часов, и придётся по вкусу фанатам серии и даже тем, кто не знаком с серией.

												This game got a LOT of hate from the Resident Evil community and I do get why.  If you look at it as a Resident Evil installment, then it is actually pretty bad.  It's about as far as you can get from the horror-survival roots that Resident Evil is known for.  It is by far more of an action oriented game at this point.  However, if you look at it as an action shooter, then it's really not that bad.  The controls can be awkward at times, especially with melee attacks and the camera can cause a lot of problem in certain areas, but beyond that, I have no real complaints.The co-op is what drew me in and kept me in.  Without the co-op, I doubt I would have put as much into the game as what I did.  It's not a great game.  It's not a bad game.  It's a mediocre game that I enjoyed a lot of the time and as got very frustrated at times.  It's a game a lot of RE fans either love or hate.			"

												Not as bad as people make it out to be. No it does not feel like a Resident Evil game because it does not feel like survival horror. However it feels like a Resident Evil movie, it is in that vein of action. High production values, interesting 3rd person controls that I guarantee will be copied soon enough and perfected. Not to mention a nice chunk of content. If you like 3rd person action games or enjoyed Resident Evil 5 this is a nice improvement on that formula. Just dont expect to be scared or feel nostalgic.

												Whereas the shooting and inventory system is an upgrade from Resident Evil 5, the Melee has received a considerable downgrade and the special enemies I have encountered thus far are particularly annoying. The hit box is off or the action simply doesn't connect depending on the animated state of the zombie, if a zombie is coming towards you and albeit your animation connects they still manage to grapple you. The shrieker is plain annoying and having to do ten headshots before a regular zombie is dead is just blatantly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. I understand that Resident Evil games are supposed to be hard but this is a joke.			"

												Been a fan of the RE games since PS1. While not everyone likes the concept of the games becoming more action shooter like; I personally thought it made for a fun co-op and single player expereince. One of my favorite feautures being the co-op  experience. Ive played this game on xbox360, ps3, and now PC. Obviously PC looks the best. (If I had to take away points, it would be for split screen). The setup for playing on the same system look off to me and you really cannot see enough of the map with shared screen. I can look pass that due to the game being one of the most enjoyable games I've played still to this day; which is only further enchanced by the fact that the stories cross over and you can have other players support you. I don't have much information personally on all the side features of the game however. eg: DLC. Im willing to believe they're fun too. Want a fun game to pick up and play with your friends...this would be it.			"

												This game was actually fun to play, I don't know why there are so many people hating of it.  Try not to relate this game to previous RE games (in term of style), you will have much easier time to enjoy a good game.  Few things to complain though, there are too many chasing events, QTE, the control is somewhat awkward, and enermies (especially bosses) have no obvious weak spots or they are moving too fast to be shoot on... most of the time you just unload your bullets as fast as you can on the targets, and it gets boring very fast.  If this still happens in the next game, then the producers really have problems making great games.			"

												This game doesnt deserve half of the flack that it gets. Its one of the best third person action games out there, with mechanical depth, fun and diverse enemy types, a good atmosphere and nice set pieces. Is it a horror game?  No its not, but this is the natural direction the games and their story have been going since the second game. Just think about it on a game to game basis. It started in a mansion.... then went to a whole city... then overseas.... did you really think you can keep contained isolated terror from something that started in a house and evolved to a wordlwide pandemic? The first one was the only authentic survival horror game, after that they started adding more explosions,more ammo, a bigger arsenal, more randomly unnecessary plot twists,a burning city you must escape, giant monsters chasing you for the entirety of the game, and just all around action. They just threw in moody music and a difficult control scheme and people accepted it as survival horror.  I challenge someone to name one thing that 2 and 3 had that 6 doesnt. Exploding barrels? check, a counter move? check. A big creepy dude stalking you for the whole game? check. An over the top B grade sci fi story? check. Hell, back then it was even a big deal to beat the game fast so that you could run and gun your way through the game! Not to mention people looooved mercenaries back in the day. People essentially WANTED it to be an action game! The entirety of this experience is essentially a resident evil: greatest hits, just with better (albiet more complicated) mechanics, graphics, and co op. Leon is RE2, Jake is RE3. Chris is the mode in those games when you unlocked the unlimited ammo on your weapons and were allowed to go to town. And dont let my time in game fool you. I also had this for xbox360, and ps3. Twice. Most of the game is missing that isolated and alone feel the first 2 (and 4) resi's had, but just that fact alone should NOT be a determining factor to the games quality. I'm gonna start reviewing call of duty games and say ""4/10 not scary enough"". The game is great. 5 is great. If you really MUST have your mood however, i suggest the revelations series. Not as mechanically good, but definitely has the ambiance thats apparently necessary for a good RE score. All that said, chill the ♥♥♥♥ out with the QTE's capcom			"

												Resident Evil 6 made me cream. Sorry, but I had to say it. Resident Evil 6 is everything I wanted before, and crammed into one huge game. You take on the roles of multiple characters, playing different stories. Your goals are different, but you all share one...survive. Get through a bioterrorism outbreak in China, and fight every B.O.W that comes your way. Solve puzzles, riddles, and mysteries about the incident at hand, and find the ultimate answer. The controls and feel of Resident Evil are reworked, for you now can run while shooting, jump backwards and land on your back, and take full control of your environment. Resident Evil 6 is definitely a ground shaker in the series, and I can't wait to see more. I give Resident Evil 6 a 10/10.			"

												This game has coop written all over it. In Singleplayer you get a pretty good scripted AI at your side. Which is too good. It solves all the (ok, maybe not so hard) puzzles for you, has instant reflexes and can kill almost all enemies by itself. In Multiplayer this changes. You should get a friend to play the coop with, since communication helps you not having to do everything over an over again.There are 4 campaigns each with about 5-6 hours of content (maybe except the Ada one). All pretty unique in their own way an all somehow connected to each others. That feels great.The Ada campaign should be a singleplayer one, since the coop character is a noname with no real purpose, he can't even open doors or pick up plot items. Aside from that I had a great time playing through this game (which took over 20h!).Will play it again for sure.			"

												Минусы? самая худшая часть RE за всю историю? Я удивляюсь, откуда такие низкие оценки у данной игры? Mногие критикуют игру за то, что в игре 3 кампании, что ""Capcom сделала из серии тупой шутер без сюжета, умудрилась утратить атмосферу и погружение в мир"" - всё это полная чушь.- Если вы любитель Resident Evil 2,3,4 части как например я, то вам следует проходить всего одну кампанию в игре, это за Леона, эта кампания ближе подходит к мрачной атмосфере, хардкору, хоррору, как в первых частях серии, там и зомби нормальные, и патронов мало.- Если вы любитель Resident Evil 5, то вам следует проходить кампанию за Криса, больше экшона и меньше хардкора.- А если вам нравятся все части, то следует проходить все кампании, уж поверьте, вы не будете разочарованы.Capcom просто решила угодить всем фанатам серии RE, и сделала каждую кампанию не похожей друг на друга, каждая кампания проходится около 6 часов, и придётся по вкусу фанатам серии и даже тем, кто не знаком с серией.

												This game got a LOT of hate from the Resident Evil community and I do get why.  If you look at it as a Resident Evil installment, then it is actually pretty bad.  It's about as far as you can get from the horror-survival roots that Resident Evil is known for.  It is by far more of an action oriented game at this point.  However, if you look at it as an action shooter, then it's really not that bad.  The controls can be awkward at times, especially with melee attacks and the camera can cause a lot of problem in certain areas, but beyond that, I have no real complaints.The co-op is what drew me in and kept me in.  Without the co-op, I doubt I would have put as much into the game as what I did.  It's not a great game.  It's not a bad game.  It's a mediocre game that I enjoyed a lot of the time and as got very frustrated at times.  It's a game a lot of RE fans either love or hate.			"

												Not as bad as people make it out to be. No it does not feel like a Resident Evil game because it does not feel like survival horror. However it feels like a Resident Evil movie, it is in that vein of action. High production values, interesting 3rd person controls that I guarantee will be copied soon enough and perfected. Not to mention a nice chunk of content. If you like 3rd person action games or enjoyed Resident Evil 5 this is a nice improvement on that formula. Just dont expect to be scared or feel nostalgic.

That being said of the 686.8 hrs I have logged in this game I've thus far noticed some similarites to a gamecube game I once had called ""Resident Evil 4"".  I don't know if there are any connections to these two games but its really shocking to see that the main characters of both have the same name (Lions Obseniddey) and that they both feature a certain protagonist (Raincoat Inc.).  If you're looking to get hot and bothered and really like to beat off while being yelled at by a lolli man with a terrible haircut, this game was made for you.  Repetitive gameplay and no real innovation make this game a 5 out of 5 for me.  Take this with a grain of salt though, because I could just be lying to trick you...Or not. "

												First off this game is really good for me, I love the gameplay and the online features. Some campaigns stick to the movie vibe, some stick to the video game vibe. The multiplayer is great makes the game even more fun than what it already is. The monsters and zombies in this game are always exciting, with new tricks everytime. And the guns are awesome. This game is great but there are a couple of flaws.One flaw is my game takes awhile to launch up the menu screen about 5 minutes, but then the game runs normaly. Second You cant buy guns in this like Resident Evil 5, you have to find the guns. But that is all the flaws I can think of.                                                                      9/10			"

												I have to say, I only got into RE because of the Yogscast series of RE5. I loved RE5 and the controls in that game were pretty nice aswell. I put off playing RE6 until about a month ago because of all the bad stuff I heard about it. I decided to pick it up, and I must say, while getting through the prelude and beggining of Leon's campaign is the WORST design flaw, the gameplay itself is one of the most fun things I have ever experienced. Once I got dodging and countering down, the game itself didn't feel like the whole ""shoot bodypart then melee"", but instead a more fluent and linked combat system with a great story, and I haven't even played Mercs or Agent Hunt yet! Overall this game is amazing and severely beat on, but shouldn't be. I do have to warn you though, if you're not a master at your console controls (PC, Xbox, PS_, etc.), then your combat skills will reflect on that. Also, after playing RE6 for a while, I found it impossible to go back to RE5 because the controls were SO different. You have no idea how many times I tried to walk up to a guy in RE5 and click for a melee attack XD.			"

Don't get this one if you want horror game or old school Bio Hazard. Take a quick look for some game play video will give you idea.Pros (whole game)+ 3 main story to play with co-op. Pretty long if not speed run at all.+ and extra Ada story, also co-op... somehow.+ Load of action. Bore of shooting enemy? Kick them, punch them, ignore them, sandwich them.+ Old heroine meeting ground.+ Not too confuse or too easy puzzle/gimmick to beat through area/fight.+ Minor skill system to add extra customize to your playstyle.+ Down you teammate with your weapon & spam Good job at your friend♥♥♥♥♥Cons (game play/function)- No, if you love old school Bio hazard 1-3 game play.- Expect lot of death from QTE/escape event.- Forget the horror, we have lot of prank instead.- Not much worth replay, but still okay from time to time.- Not that much story intercourse, really.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it! auto mic. detection and no push to talk mapping key.- Ton of co-op action require (solo with AI still do the trick) which somehow can be annoying.- Never know that running can be this hard to control.- Item carry through your other checkpoint when replay with other player/chapter in the same story.

												I think I started playing Resident Evil 1 on my Sega 16, 32 bit system.  I'm talking about more than 20 years ago.. It was a very atmospheric game with high difficulty level.  I never forgot about Resident Evil because of in my view the special and nice graphics.  Now, many games and years later I picked up Resident Evil 4.  I finished the game in a heartbeat, played it for a second, third time, loved the typical inventory for guns and items. Japanese horror rules.Now.  Raccoon City and Biohazard 6 are my last buys.  I think they are both in their way special and very good games.One game developper has too evolve, a game (even called resident evil) has too Grow, change.I never made an issue about one game being different from the other. Because; the graphics were pretty darn good!Resident Evil, as the game is called is.. a studio, full of competent people, a piece of art. They have a website like no other game has.  U can unlock sketches drawn for the game characters etc.  Not too mention the Animated Movies they made about resident Evil.  This is HIGH resolution cartoons like never before.I don't know what hobby's you have sir.  But next to gaming, sports, music.. art is alsoo a hobby of mine.Why I tell all this. Well if have to say I'm dissapointed.  I finished the campaign in single player.  Then I started playing the campain in CO-OP.  I'm sorry too say, but you call this Playing a game together people?I'ts been two years now, and the only serious co-op players I met were asian players.  Japanese, chinese I dont know but not american or European.  Maybe because they have more respect for the game? They have knowledge of the roots.Or they simply know what the word 'Respect means.I've seen like everything in CO-OP; intollerance, team-killing, not helping each other one out...Worst thing is; abusing the game and its possebilities too kill your teammate.So you think you're a fierce person or a good player? by using this game not for what its made?Resident Evil is not EVIL, maybe you missed someting but this game is not a horror movie and you are Not one if its characters!!  It's just a title; Resident Evil has spooky and challenging opponents but they are not Evil !! At least; you don't have a clue what evil is.  If you are bored go download the last horror movie like ""I know what you did last summer"" and watch it 10 times, then go tell your friends how COOL you are.As a tip for the tolerant and honest and good players; teamkillers and Quitters stare and do absolutely nothing, taking no first actions, sneak up behind your back.. or they run all over the place so you cant keep up.I can't remember where the hype ""I need too have a cool and scary nickname"" came from.. or "" I need too quit the game within 15 minutes because you shot the zombie that I wanted 2 shoot........I'ts not cool people and because of this and maybe because of some negative reviews written about this game, players and developpers may become unmotivated.I tend too host a game myself now, play the game for what its made for.  And finish it with 85% accuracy and lots of S-grades.  Please; have respect for this game, the developpers and the gamers.I'd like too even finish with saying; from now on ; every teamkiller that screws me over in co-up, mutiplayer etc ;  I have your nickname and info written down.  I'm gonna file a complaint.  And if you think the company has no power in doing so, I'll make it happen watch me. "

												This game is not at all like the first one, but I gotta say that they have been able to evolve the series to this great action/adventure which I promise that you will find amusing and entertaining even if you prefer the older games. I found it fun and the graphics are great. A lot of good old characters from the older games return and you get to see what they are up too theese days. As a Resident Evil-fan I can really recommend this, especially if you play coop with a friend.			"

												According to many people, Resident Evil 6 was the worst in the series.  I can't say I agree with that, but this game does have positives to it.  No longer a survival horror genre at this point, the game is still good for what it is.  Action shooter-ish game.  Controls are nice and smooth, easy to get use to compared to 5.  The two best things for this game are the modding community and the Mercenaries No Mercy.  Mercenaries is just overall fun to play with friends.  Good game.  7.5/10			"

												I forgot how boring and stupid this game is. Resident Evil 6 is a survival horror game where you aren't really surviving and there is no horror. ""Survival"" mainly consists of simply running up and kicking zombies in the face to death. Unlike the good RE games you don't even have to be wary of the zombies anymore. They are no longer a threat that you have to work your way either around or through strategically. They are just something in your way from point A to point B that you simply shoot or kick your way through. What's the point?Through the entire start of Leon's campaign I didn't even have to use my gun once. The melee attacks basically give you the ""Press left mouse button to win"" option. After that, everything was easy. And boring. By the time I was done, I actually forgot why I was playing in the first place. I wasn't having fun or being challenged. The game just led me from one area to the next asking me to occasionally press a button or two along the way.Resident Evil 4 is my favorite game of all time, and everything it did right, this did so - so wrong! I wasn't crazy about Resident Evil 5, but it was at the very least enjoyable at times. Resident Evil 6 is just garbage.			"

												Why does everyone like this game?First off, the gameplay, its bad. Quick time events with intermittent bursts of unsatisfying shooting, and tutorial that seems to go on forever. The QTEs in particular feel like they were designed by someone who's never even seen a keyboard.Second off, this game was just ported over from consoles, and it definitely shows. The menus are minimal and clunky and were clearly designed to be navigated with a controller, the graphics are subpar by console standards even on max settings.On the plus side the game runs very smoothly.And even though this was clearly designed to be played with a controller, the controller support is abysmal. The game recognizes my controller, and then supplies me with an unplayable control scheme, which it won't let me change, sure there's a part of the menu that supposedly lets you change the controller layout, but it does nothing, selecting anything to change just locks up the menus and I have to unplug my controller to get them working again.Also, there is no 21:9 support without modding. Is this really such a difficult thing to offer?			"

												Quick ReviewLet's face it, Resident Evil has lost its step. It isn't the horror juggernaut it used to be. 4 and 5 made it clear that it was transitioning into a more action-esque genre which upset a lot of fans. So where does this put 6?RE6 is by no means an amazing game, nor is it the best Resident Evil game. However, for what it provides, it's a good game. The action combat feels refined with the ability to move while you aim and shoot. Gone are the days where you had to stand still to fire a gun. This certainly makes for better action gameplay. While the quick time events are more consistent in what they ask the player to press and when, the game unfortunately throws several more at you than 5. What about the narrative?Resident Evil 6's plot is still that silly B movie narrative that it's always had. It tries so hard to be serious and emotional, but follows so many expected tropes that it never hits the nail hard enough. However, it isn't a complete travesty and shouldn't be shunned completely. Overall Resident Evil 6 is a decent entry into the Resident Evil franchise. If you at least enjoyed 5, I'd reccommend picking 6 up, but only if it is on sale. This game is worth about $15 USD at most, and that's stretching it. If you didn't enjoy 5, you probably won't enjoy 6.7.5/10			"

												Brilliant story line, it is definitely a thriller with dabs of horror. No Deus ex machina (a good thing), surprising for a video game. Only down side is for some strange reason the story isn't in chronological order. The chapter order I used is at the bottom of this review**Game play is typical run and gun. melee, grenades, and explosives with some puzzles. I mixed it up and never got bored. Checkpoints are generous. Only negative: around 3 puzzles use unique mechanics, throwing the players intuitive nature out the window. I quickly googled the crazy puzzles to avoid frustration. Graphics are great for a 2013 game. Smoke from gun barrels, cloth physics on some characters. water, dust, and ice fog all look great. The extra shader effects in cutscenes is nice too.Over all, I enjoyed nearly every minute of it. Unless you are made of money, wait for the specials. Capcom always put up their old RE titles on sale.

Graphics are nice, I enjoyed how the storylines all aligned together just nicely. But, I had a horrible time with the camera angles. When i 1st play'd this game I got the regular XBox release, but i decided to buy the biohazard edition on steam, and you get an additional story, playing Ada Wong herself!1st level they combined stealth within a horror game.... if you cant tell I didnt enjoy it, and you can easily get caught! I ended up switching to easy mode, and it was still hard.In the end, I dont think this is worth it, maybe it they lowered price down to 20, it would be okay, but my final score is.....4 Ada Wong nudes out of 10.

												This game is basically B-Movie bad, in that if you play it alone it's terrible but if you play it co-op with a friend & laugh at how dumb & bad it is it's pretty good.Still, not good enough to recommend it.PROS-It's funny-Co-OpCONS-Story is Stupid, Bad & uninspired-Level Design is Linear, uninspired & makes no sense-Enemies are dumb & repetitive-Micro-Managing Inventory-Terrible & Generic Upgrade System-Bad but servicable Controls-It's basically a derpfestSTORYI don't even know where to begin explaining this, but I'll give it my best shot. The story starts off with Leon in China doing a tutorial intro mission with some lady who's just there... I forget her name, she's unmemorable as all hell. Anyways, she's injured, Leon heals her. Then they fly a Helicopter into a building, fail several QTE's & die to only try them again & then Leon says something & then the RE6 logo appears. You are then in a screen to choose between Leon's, Chris's, & Wesker Jr's Story. Each one of them is dumber than the last. So, as Leon, you go through some nonsense center of the earth place, fight some naked zombie chick grabbing her ♥♥♥♥♥ (Not a Trump Joke, she's literally just doing that) & when you kill her the lady partner cries & then you fight a giant fish later who's on an endless roller coaster ride to the center of the earth, then you come out of some lake somewhere & then you do something in China & really... I have no clue what else was happening because it's just a giant fuster-cluck. Leon eventually gets some SD card from Wesker Jr's girlfriend, & then he flies a plane somewhere, crashes & then idk... Kills some big dude with a claw hand? Then he goes back to Murica & talks with Hunnigan about something...Really, I have no idea wtf is going on in any story mode. It's just a derpfest designed for you to kill zombies over & over again.Chris' story is basically the exact same thing, exept he's all emo about something that happened 6 months ago where some guy died & now he's grieving about it by eating steak & drinking beer. That steak, tho. Best rendered steak in all of video games. It was rendered so nice they used it twice. Eventually, you get to this one area with a playground & you slide down the slide 100 times cause there's nothing better to do. Then, you go to China & drive a monster truck that dies constantly when it bumps into the slightest wall but can take 100 missles to the face. Later, you're in some lab & you fight the tentacle doom monster that supposedly is gonna take over the earth, you win & you go back to the bar & eat another steak.Finally, Wesker Jr's story is basically him being a bad ♥♥♥ Ninja orphan who's angry at Chris for killing his dad, even though he never knew his dad ever. He then learns his blood can cure this outbreak cause he's immune & charges $50 million dollars for it, but then settles for enough money for a tank of gas & a night with Super Girl.  Oh, and you fight Claw-man like 10 times.  Oh, and apparantly Ada Wong is here but nothing is ever explained about anything regarding her story. Stuff happens, you see her hatching from an egg, then you never hear about it again.  You could probably play her missions to find out wtf is happening, but if it's anything like the other story missions it's just there so you can kill zombies.GAMEPLAY & FEATURESThe games controls are just servicable at best.  It's like it's trying to do a mixture of RE4/5 shooting with modern day mechanics but it doesn't do it very well.  Aiming with a scope is terrible because everyone has parkinsons, throwing multiple grenades is impossible because you switch back to your gun every throw, almost every puzzle is just a QTE segment where you hit X, single player mode is terrible because companions are idiots, boss fights are pointless because you waste all your ammo only to kill it in some dramatic cutscene, upgrades are dubbed down to the point where you think the game thinks you're a special needs child, inventory size is extremely limited & you constantly need to throw stuff away in order to maintain what you need, & you can't trade items with your partner, zombies have bullet proof armor now, but you as an elite field agent for the US government do not, QTE's are so frequent but so unexpected that you will die to them a lot, Bosses are basically ammo sponges, one character has healing powers that don't work when you play her, the main villain wants to destroy the world because ""reasons"", the world ends & then is magically fixed because it just is?  The game is just badly designed in almost every single way, but it's so bad it's hilarious seeing it fall on it's face at every given turn.  I honestly can't tell if the people who were behind this game were being serious or just really overdoing some kind of parody satire thing.OVERALLThis game is terrible but it's so bad it's funny as hell to just point & laugh at how bad it is. The story makes no god dam sense, the combat is dull & level design is terrible & linear as all hell. It's like this game was made by 12 year olds for 12 year olds. If you get it, get it on sale & get it with a friend so you can just ♥♥♥♥ around on Chris' slide for an hour, cause that's the best part in the whole game.			"

												Oh Baby, it's a MASSIVE YES! lol I don't understand the disappointments of the fans, personally, it's the coolest RE ever released on earth at the moment. EXPLOSIONS THERE! EXPLOSIONS HERE! It rocks! It's a game that you will enjoy especially if you are playing with a friend. I do not care what the fans says and I believe the ratings are so under rated. I played actually almost all of the RE's out there... RE1 2 3 4 5 etc... for me this is one of the best. It's all about action, partnership with a survival horror elements and it has tons of playable characters :) It's a very fun game. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Awesome graphics too. The cutscenes are very intense too. It's a day 1 buy game for me. It's silly to consider as 68/100, It's a 94/100 score for me!			"

												I have been long time resident evil fan since the start of the series although I've never been really good at them. I don't like RE 4 and 5 because I think they are uninteresting and when I bought RE 6 I was gambling my money because I have been disappointed with RE 4 and 5. Turned out my gamble paid very well. I found RE 6 as one of the best game I ever played and probably the best resident evil game to date. The game itself improved the system from 4 and 5. However, the best part of this game is the storytelling and how it is presented. When I played this game I felt like immersing into a non-stop action movie and felt myself as the protagonist. Strong characters are the main selling point of RE 6. I am captivated with the relationship among the characters. I found RE 4 had less likable cast such as Ashley, and in RE 5, Sheva was a nice character but she had less dynamics compared to Piers. I put this game on the top of my list and as good as Mass Effect 3 and Deus EX Human Reolution. This game makes everyone a hero.  Ignore all the harsh critics, and give this game a chance. I honestly cannot believe all the critics that said this game is worst game ever. Seriously guys, you need your brain checked. I agree with famitsu that this game is near-perfect.I'm glad I played this game during holiday because I lost my social life in the past several days. :)			"

												Now Im not gonna do the same mistake everyone else does. When you review a game you DO NOT compare it to other games or older games.On the title of the game it says ""Survival Horror"", which I disagree with, this game is an adventure blown action game. Capcom has made the gameplay nice, but still a bit hard to control. I finished the game like 5 times because the Co-op is a boss, I loved playing this with my friends I enjoyed it a lot. Still, the zombie killing was amazing! the new creatures Jo'avos kinda suck. the story sucks, the monsters are repetitve but still super nice to kill. the graphics dont make the game but matter, and they suck. I give the game a 6/10 mostly for the co-op and zombie killing. recomended for people who want to play co-op adventure action ONLY!			"

												In my opinion, I think this is one of the best RE I have ever played so far, obvious a few fans of the saga didn't like too much the game since it didn't have that ""Survival Horror"" feeling who Capcom had promised, from all the campaigns that might give you that feeling that would be Leon's Campaign, the rest are pure action which I don't complain, I have already accepted that Resident Evil is no longer a Survival Horror, I know it hurts, but it's the truth. I like the Co-op mode it has, you can join other players campaign while they are in-game without starting from a checkpoint, not like RE5 (I loved that RE though don't get me wrong), and also it shows you the time the player have been playing it, which difficulty was set it on, if Infinite Ammo was set it on (which I don't see the point of playing it with that option activated), if friendly fire was activated or not, etc.If you expect to find a Survival Horror atmosphere, well I'm sorry to tell you that you won't find it, RE stopped being Survival Horror since RE4 (where a lot of ""fans"" started from there it seems). There is an excelent mode called ""Agent Hunt"" where you can join other players campaign as a zombie, it's a very fun mode in my opinion, and it's even more awesome when you have the right abilities.Let's not forget the free DLC it has, where you can play The Mercenaries mode with L4D2 characters!

												Quick ReviewLet's face it, Resident Evil has lost its step. It isn't the horror juggernaut it used to be. 4 and 5 made it clear that it was transitioning into a more action-esque genre which upset a lot of fans. So where does this put 6?RE6 is by no means an amazing game, nor is it the best Resident Evil game. However, for what it provides, it's a good game. The action combat feels refined with the ability to move while you aim and shoot. Gone are the days where you had to stand still to fire a gun. This certainly makes for better action gameplay. While the quick time events are more consistent in what they ask the player to press and when, the game unfortunately throws several more at you than 5. What about the narrative?Resident Evil 6's plot is still that silly B movie narrative that it's always had. It tries so hard to be serious and emotional, but follows so many expected tropes that it never hits the nail hard enough. However, it isn't a complete travesty and shouldn't be shunned completely. Overall Resident Evil 6 is a decent entry into the Resident Evil franchise. If you at least enjoyed 5, I'd reccommend picking 6 up, but only if it is on sale. This game is worth about $15 USD at most, and that's stretching it. If you didn't enjoy 5, you probably won't enjoy 6.7.5/10			"

												This game is garbage. Story and graphics? Fine. Great. Whatever. Controls and, most importantly, gameplay? Utter garbage. First off; QTE's. I don't like them, but I'm not one to jump on the bandwagon and instantly give a game a 0/10 if it has a couple of well designed QTE's. Unfortunately, RE6 is made up of almost entirely QTE's and cutscenes. No seriously, I have never played a game with more QTE's than this game right here. Also, let's talk about headshots. RE6 get's rid of them in favor of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t skillpoint system that essentially forces you to play each campaign multiple times in order to make your character not suck. I've heard the argument that if headshots did what they used to, the game would be too easy. That tells you a lot about the quality of the gameplay right there.I don't know what has caused Capcom to become so utterly disconnected from its fanbase, but this is a huge step in the wrong direction.

												I've been playing through this with a friend. I haven't played any other Resident Evil games, but I thought it was a decent standalone game. Until suddenly, chapter 3 of Chris' campaign. Not gonna lie, dying 10 times in a row by literally clipping through a boat where a jump command refuses to appear, at the VERY end of a chase sequence that's incredibly frustrating on its own without having a gamebreaking glitch at the end of it? Kinda sours a game experience.So, yeah, it's good to know that the money Capcom is saving by not using Megaman for anything ever is going toward some quality products. Seriously, I can understand side rooms being kinda buggy, or the J'avo bugging out in general from mutating in areas that don't work well with it (indoor moth guys, seriously). But how, honestly, can playtesting miss something that makes simply completing one of the campaigns nigh-impossible? Until if and when I come across a damn good explanation for why Chris Redfield phases through boats and dies for no reason that isn't ""you didn't go fast enough, try it 30 or 40 more times,"" I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anybody.

												A serious contender for ""The Worst Thing I Have Ever Bought (and I even bought a kick in the balls once)"" competition.  Previous winners being ""Takedown: Brown Sabres"" (later disqualified for being ok after all) and ""Deus Ex: The Fail"" The 'game' which i bought for it's coop, won't let you start a coop game until you have worked your way through a no skill required, long winded, slow and boring ""press space to start the next cut scene"" type thing. There are checkpoints you can restart at if you die, but no way to save your progress if you have to stop before the end of this prologue.I have made 6 attempts to get to the end of this easy no skill needed prologue, but I can't do it. Not because I lack the ability, but because the game crashes my pc in the most horrible way I have seen. First it turns the monitor off, then about 20 seconds later it causes a really horrible sound to continuously play until you realise the only way it can be stopped is by powering the pc down and restarting. Back to the beginning in another futile attempt.Avoid this like the plague.			"

You can't even climb a ladder yourself, you press one button, the character climbs all the way up there himself.-Just Ada campaign is good, the others are worth jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ the thing is Ada campaign is great because it doesn't have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sequences like the three others campaign, but it's still not that good either.-Long as hell when like me you think it's bad.-Jake and Chris campaign feels like a generic third military person shooter, where you spend all your time shooting infected with guns.-Most important of all, the campaign aren't fun.Seriously, if you want good action/horror Resident Evil, you're better with Resident 4 on Gamecube/PS2 or the HD one  on Steam or with Resident Evil Revelations on 3DS/PC/PS360 WII U			"

I enjoyed RE4 so much but this game tries too hard at the cinematic aspects of the game and left the actual gameplay to rot.  The camera angle makes judging distances hard and you cannot adjust the sensitivity of the camera when not aiming down with your shakey laser sight. You are going to die a lot before you figure out the best way to play the game if you play on any of the harder dificulties. I like how it doesnt just spoonfeed you how to play but it does not introduce the player to any of the mechanics till after you've already had to use them a bunch. 1/5			"

												Been a RE fan since it was released on Sega saturn back in the mid 90's ive played every RE game up until 4 beat every one of them 2 or 3 times and am very versed in the lore and cannon of the series. I recently picked up Revelations and actually enjoyed it so i though i would pick RE-6 up and give it a shot..Despite the negative reviews.What a mistake...it was'nt the story or lack there of that got me,or even the cheesy one liners or ridiculous action scenes. But the persistant and unrelenting button smashing sequences that plainly inviscerated my experience. 15min into the game i was mildly annoyed 2 hours into the game and i physically could'nt stand it anymore. There are sections in the game where you have to complete 4+ sequences in a row without making a single mistake or your character dies and you have to start the whole sequence over again!?!I'm uninstalling and waiting for the remake of RE1 to be released early in 2015.

												This is one of the worst games I've ever played. Cutscenes and quick time events are rife in this game. There are seriously quicktime events everywhere. It is nothing like the spooky atmospheric masterpiece that was resident evil 2. I am incredibly ashamed to have bought this and wish I could have gotten a refund, which I learned wasn't available via steam. Whoops!			"

												This game, just it pushes my nerves.  Like, really graphics that are just terrible.  The only effort went into the character model and they are good, at best.  the controls harshly hurt the game, and hey don't worry just bring some popcorn and soda because the game will play it self.  you walk into a room cutscene that doesn't pause them. it makes you look at EVERYTHING!  a hole in the floor, a door that is obviously the way to go because its 3 feet infront of you, and after you get to the door another Cutscene of the door....   what they wanted in this game was many hours of cutscenes and that really hurt it,  read that its 4 hours to play through the whole game of just cutscenes..... well i have also noticed that Multiple cutscenes are reused and are unskippable,   Tho im really glad they put minigames in this movie!

												This game is so bad, that it is in a class of its own. The gameplay is just horrofyingly bad. You ain't fighting zombies in this game. You are fighting the game itself.If you wanna know how bad this is then think of a dumpster truck on ice with no tires. The movement is so clunky so ridiculously bad that it makes a dumpster truck on ice with no tires look like a ballerina. RE4 was a rough diamond, this one is a giftwrapped turd. Avoid at all cost or if you want to bleed from your nose then buy it megacheap, it's not worth more than 3dollars.Go play something that is actually fun or scary or pretty much anything else for that matter. Not worth your time because it fails in every aspect of the game.			"

												Very linear even though it is mission based there is little exploration, forced camera angles (sometimes doing it mid-combat), bad character control, no upgrading in any way, very limited inventory (no upgrades), repetitive enemies and campaign.

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 52% YES / 48% NOGOODGraphics are top notch.User Interface (UI) looks good.AI companions are vastly improved over RE5 and are no longer a hinderance.Voice acting is on point. You can feel the enthusiasm.Everyone's outfits are superb. Their personalities feel like they're being expressed through their clothing. Only dumb thing are the heels Ada wears everywhere, but that's just a trope lots of media just can't escape from.I still hate the QTEs are in the game, but they're way more lenient than 4 and 5. Really wish they'd just take these out already.Absolutely fantastic monster design. The cocoon idea for a lot of transformations keeps me wondering what I'm about to fight. Bosses are also super grotesque and interesting.NEUTRALReally wish the UI didn't constantly change aesthetics.Story is incredibly standard. New bad guy with ties to research for monsters trying to do something kinda evil and is evil, then more evil people pop up around him behind the scenes.Not incredibly great additons to the combat. Of course you can move and shoot now, but you also have odd dodging and crawling.Ustanak is an ok Nemesis type, but doesn't really work in this type of game. It worked in RE3 because moving between zones meant you were safe, but this was a BOSS MOB that could follow you through sections of the map. It was terrifying.Leon's campaign is fine, Ada's is ok, Jake's is ok, and Chris' is annoying. None of them feel spectacular and make me want to replay them, despite having two characters for most of the campaigns.BADGame focuses on spectacle rather than fun action horror that RE4 introduced.UI feels bad to use. Some of it is rather unintuitive and inventory management isn't as clean as it should be.There is a bevy of terrible sequences that just made me sigh and dip my head. Here are a few: obnoxious shark bio weapon (B.O.W.) section with exploding barrels that don't always land in time, you have to redo the intro section with Leon that you played at the beginning with barely any changes, rescuing hostages from spider J'avo, highway chase scene with Chris and friend, unfortunately paced and disappointing snake fight, Ustanak hide & seek, annoying bus sequence with Ada against a chainsaw boss, and a crude sequence against some goo on a ship. Mostly all the run sequences suck.There's a lot of game here, which explains why it's just so stretched and feels so thin. A lot of the game sections feel one note across the entire character campaigns.Leon still can't recognize someone turning into a zombie and sometimes just hesitates too much when there is one RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE.SUMMARYThis game's a mess. It feels like a AAA game that was stretched way too thin. Cut out 60% of the content and polish it up, it'd be fantastic. It's still a solid game that was built well, but the story and campaign ideas were pushed too far and it shows. As a Resident Evil fan, I hope they learn from their mistakes.			"

												This game is a polished turd. No matter how shiny it seems, underneath ... it's still a turd, and this one has chunks of corn left in it.It is closer to the quality of the Resident evil live-action films than it is to RE4 or RE5.At best, this is a mediocre  shooter with a zombie skin. It attempts to cater to everyone but it fails to do anything well. Without the zombie skin, it is still not that great.It has its moments here and there, but generally this game has no atmosphere. It cares more about showing you the action that is going on, than it cares about the experience you'll have playing it. Tension never builds, but your frustration sure will.5.5/10.You'd be much better off putting your money towards Resident Evil Revelations.			"

												This is far better than Resident Evil 5 (and even 4 to an extent). It actually feels and plays more like a Resident Evil game. I honestly don't know why people mindlessly praise 5 but reject this one. At least be consistent. This game is nowhere as good as the classic Resident Evils but I think for the ""modern"" nonsense we had to suffer through this game does a lot of things decently. I think people were just fed up with Capcom in general and Resident Evil continuing to reject its roots so they rebelled against this title instead of 5.4 was a breath of fresh air (controls mainly), 5 was 4's decayed and infected breath, 6 is the rebirth of 4's formula while cleansing 5's problems. Confused? Yeah, just play the Resident Evil remake instead, can't go wrong there.			"

												I like the melee combat and more mobile charactersBUT I HATE the dumbing down of the rpg elements that I really enjoyed in RE4/RE5.

Bottom line is I lose all motivation and that's really sad because I loved RE4/RE5.would reccommend if the game had more depth of gun customization and upgrades.Also way to many QTE cutscenes.NOTE FOR RE7: LESS QTE's / OVER THE TOP CINEMATICS and bring back an in game shop and gun upgrade system with multiple guns that I can chose for myself pretty much I want back RE4's Inventory/customizeation/shop system with the movement mechanics of RE6 then you could actually be in for a good game. I also like the idea that ammo actually counts for something and you should conserve it try to add that back into RE7.			"

												One of the best Resident Evil games in my opinion!And you can quote that I said you can quote that if you like, sillyness aside. This game turned out to be so much more than what I thought. I know RE5 was a massive let down / failure, but this is nothing like 5. Its simply a great game fun game play, great story, nice unlockables, and lots of replay value. Its a huge must buy for RE fans! or any one who loves zombie games. Best of all is its awsome co-op play, you just have to love games that do a good job on co-op.The down side to this game is... its a bad port, some parts require you to have a xbox or game control. I found one scene imossible to do on the pc, as well as some vechiles impossible to accurately control with out a xbox/ game controller. Aside from that its a awsome awsome game but at those points if I had not had a xbox remote I don't think I could have completed that part of the game, but hey at this point if you don't have a xbox remote for pc gaming you should really go out and get one....

												From a control and ""playing a game"" perspective, this isnt really bad. Its probably the best third person shooter I've played, even if only because you dont spend 90% of your time hiding behind some waist-high wall. We aren't in survival or horror territory any more, but RE6 does know how to do flashy and actiony and everything it shouldnt really do or know about and from that standpoint it is a bad game. Mercenaries is more fun than ever, though, and the No Mercy version is pretty cool too.

												I have seen the changes of Resident Evil series as Capcom is trying to preserve the franchise. RE6 applied most contents from RE4 and 5 with separated campaigns. The scale of story is bigger which is not just about viruses as the game will bring a player to taste the diversity of gameplay and atmosphere. The cut scenes and voice acting are done very well beside from heroic dialogues. The gameplay is improved version of RE5. I’m glad that character can shoot in motion, player control is more fluid and more additional movement; sliding, crawling, rolling. Plus with improved melee combat to fill the taste of hitting them up, but limit the over usage by using combat gauge which is a good solution.However, RE6 hardly preserves its horror and intense as original RE, but it fails in implementation. Most of horror moments are based on quick-time events rather than survive from zombie hordes. It has, but the game throws player just into small area with enough ammo pile. Yes, it gives intense gameplay but it can frustrate a player at the same time with annoying enemy’s attack patterns or 1-hit kill enemy. Force player to perform non-sense action or dying from delay incapacitated animation (I prefer old button mashing to recover). Beside from bad design of game world, my biggest disappointment is too much QTE and the way they ported the input into PC. The fast switching of QTE pattern can kill player at every moments. Moreover, the camera issues during escape scenes always confuse player and force player to move in opposed direction and get killed. I understand the game want to show terror moment, but this is bad implementation. For the interfaces, I like its design, but the usage is less fluid and I miss original inventory.Overall, I won’t say RE6 is terrible game; the story and variety of gameplay are interesting including improved Co-op mode like campaign, mercenaries mode are really fun. Agent hunt is also fun and feel like old L4D versus mode (beside from terrible spawn points and zombie delay animation). I feel like RE6 is bit dull product. The campaign setup and based combat are solid, but it still can’t fill the gap between action and horror as the original RE. I have to agree that this is RE we love and hate and I have high hope they will have the right direction in RE7.			"

												Should you buy this? Maybe. Just, if you're gonna try your luck on this, do so when the price for the base game and DLC has dropped- as with a lot of titles, the content that gives this game replayability is stuck behind a paywall. Yay.And don't go into this expecting a dark, cerebral, psychological thriller/survival horror game. This is not Hellraiser, this is freakin' Planet Terror- with the mindset that you're enjoying a budget horror themed action movie the game makes more sense. Play it with a friend, have some drinks or maybe a smoke if that's your scene, have a good time.			"

												As someone who has played RE4, RE5, and RE: Revelations. I recommend RE6 too, though it is true that the game became less scary and more action-based after RE4. However, having 4 different campaigns and occasionally bumping into different protagonists of the game adds a nice taste to the game. I liked it. Their stories; at least some of them are a little bit intertwined to each other. You get the full picture when you finished all four campaign. If you have played RE4 on normal diffculty, be assured RE6 is much more easier on Normal difficulty than RE4 and also less scary. At least you\'re not alone like you were in RE4. The only disappointment for me is not to see Claire. Almost everyone is on this game except her.			"

No ressource management, no dannger of getting killed anywhere at anytime, no serious and dark story, no authentic characters and story developement. It is just realy stupid in many, many cases.

RE6 can be fun to play, but even or especially Resident Evil 1 is just the better game, and that should capcom make to think why they are making worse RE games.			"

												Though unlike older RE games, this game is a lot of fun and doesn't deserve the hate it gets. It's not survival horror anymore really, but the gameplay action rocks! It's loaded with content and is a lot of fun. This game is also great with co-op. Kind of gave me RE5 vibes in the co-op regard. It does a great job as a Third Person Shooter. Gameplay is smooth, graphics are pretty good, and the mechanics work well. Bugs are also extremely minimal if there are any. The only downside to the game is that it isn't classic survival horror RE.

Thou smashing their heads is always great ;)The bad things at times was that the AI on your team could be in the way so more of a hinder then helpful.Camera angels could be annoying when it is those very few times you have to run and avoid things.You will thou have your challenges in the game.I can for sure recommend the game.

												In terms of gameplay its better than Resident Evil 5. In terms of story eh.... its sorta lacking. If I was playing this game alone I would never have finished it. So I suggest you find yourself a partner to enjoy fast and insanely dumb quick time events paired with just banterous character animations.The Co-Op is definately a highlight to this game.If I am honest Leon's hair physics are more than enough reason to play this game.Story: 7Gameplay: 8Co-Op: 9Hair Physics: 10/10			"

												This game has been out for a while now yet graphically and gameplay wise it\'s far better than alot of mainstream games coming out at the moment (looking at you COD). There are four campaigns which take about 5 or 6 hours each to complete if you speed run it on the easiest difficulty however it gets quickly very challenging if you up the difficulty level. It has one of the best soundtracks in video games with characters that you get attachted to very quickly. Once you play through two or three campaigns you see where each campaigns\' falls onto the RE 6 timeline and how each one intertwines with the others as you meet the main characters for the other campaigns in the one you are playing. This game is one of the best optimised games for pc and is not really demanding CPU and graphic card wise to run however i\'d stronglt recommend to have a pc to run this on the highest quality the characters and the levels are brilliantly detailed and is easy to make the mistake that the game was made this year and not 2012/13 (when it came out).  Definitely worth getting regardless if it\'s on sale or not.			"

												Honestly I dont say this much, but this game is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. It looks great. Its resident evil. It doesnt stray too much outside what you expect from resident evil, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it they do it very well. Characters are very believable and able to draw true emotions for their plights in relatively short periods of character development. Its quite impressive.As for gameplay, Id say like all Resident Evil game its got that somewhat clunky feel, which I believe is intentional, in design to create almost a more tactical gameplay, in that you have to really calculate your movements. For instance how many milliseconds it takes to ready your knife, and how many it takes to swing before youre in a dodgable state again. It does feel more fluid than previous games. But as is often the case, This game shines with its intense story telling. Although I am a bit interested as to who designed the inventory system.... If Im holding almost any ammo at all, I cant spare any inventory slots for herbs or grenades... Seems odd that I should be forced to choose between carrying ammo, grenades, or healing ingredients. Kind of like being punished for being resourceful.Graphics 10/10Fear factor 5/10 (I may just be very jaded, but still had its moments of heavy tension)Story 10/10Gameplay 7/10 "

												If Resident Evil 5 was any indication of where the series was heading, Resident Evil 6 ran miles in the opposite direction of it's survival horror roots... but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's still a solid action game with impressive visuals and a very noticeable triple A budget. The game is by no means a cakewalk. It's challenging and you can still run into ammo problems like classic Resident Evil and unlike modern shooters where you'll practically trip and fall over ammunition at every corner. The game challanges you to fight smart.The game has a solid amount of content featuring 4 interwoven campaigns featuring familiar faces and an all new set of characters. Each campaign will last you several hours and each has a somewhat different flavour. One campaign has a more classic survival horror approach with minimal ammo and tight and dark corridors while other campaigns have you out in sprawling war torn cities being constantly chased by a seemingly immortal enemy.Story wise, Resident Evil does live up to it's roots. It's got all the charm and cheese of absolute B grade horror movies complete with cheesy lines and ham fisted acting and delivery. It doesn't go too far to absolutely ruin the ""dark and brooding"" nature of the game but it does constantly remind you that perhaps they're trying a little bit too hard to include dark humour but the implementation is quite horrid and the timing tends to be way off.In addition to a meaty single player, you can play the campaign co-op online or even split screen. There are even modes where you can join someone's campaign as the enemy. The Mercenaries also makes a return and you can tackle it solo or co-op online.In short, it may not be the ""best"" Resident Evil in terms of it's adhering to it's classic roots, but it certainly is the ""best"" Resident Evil for hours of exciting action filled gunplay.

												Solid action horror game!  For hardcore fans of the old school Resident Evil formula, this game may be off-putting.  Faster paced than RE4 and 5, but less emphasis on the survival part.  Hence, action horror as opposed to survical horror.  I chalk this up to ""Call-of-Duty-itis""-- many developers are borrowing elements of this formula though.  The unlockables are fun to wittle down though, giving the game replay value.  The first campaign is over all the best, with the second campaign suffering the most as far as been there, done that design -= looks at call of Duty =- Top notch art-design.  Third person perspective is a little awkward but you get the hang of it after a while.  The PC Left 4 Dead 2 characters are a nice exclusive.  Cooperative multiplayer is a welcome site, and there is also a mode to play as the bad guys in campaign mode against other real players (much like L4d).			"

												Personally i've been a fan of most resident evil games so it might be one sided ,I liked how they added move and shoot kinda weird how the camera moves with it in a sense... but good enoughControls are kind of lacking in the sense of to many buttons on 1 thing ( For keyboard mouse , has so much they could impliment for it )Its story/plot line is really unique and different , i enjoyed it because to practically complete the game you must spend at least 8+ hr for maybe 1 or 2 story lines . Some functions are great like melee anytime , but the other one for stamina might wanna be taken out if they work a little bit more on it and implimate newer things like the japanese voice For example , why only japan edition.I honestly had lots of fun in this so in my opinion it is worth the money			"

That guy who tries to ram a zombie with the bus and managed to lose control of the bus, that guy who release a zombie that can infect civilians at a fast rate, that guy who comes out and points players to the chopper but doesn't get into the chopper and dies, etc. They are all over the place.The drama is so weird, I get 2nd Party Embarrassment whenever I play as any of the characters in the game or witnessing the npc act because they tend to make  a choice which is incredibly stupid, except for a select few like Ada Wong because she is a one woman army but i question her methods sometimes.Storyline is actually not bad, aside from the weird and random lines the characters say.Gameplay is ok, I really like the sprinting feature, a lot of times when i'm outnumbered, i'll just start sprinting towards the objective ignoring all the enemies unless I have to kill them to make way. Boss battle can be challenging if you don't know what you're supposed to shoot at or do whatever. Mini bosses are pain in the neck, lil♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥trying to ruin your walk in the park.

												RE 6 is definitely a fantastic game! I have played the original RE, RE code Veronica, RE 0, RE 4, 5 and now 6 and I have to say, this is for sure one of my favorites. I know that a lot of people are saying that the franchise has changed from the original and it sure has, but that does not mean that it's not a dark and RE game. The graphics are beautiful, the atmosphere is great, and the shooting keeps getting better! and yes, there is less ammo in this game. This is very similar to RE 4 but with a little more action but still great story. For those who say this is not a RE game, please understand that the creators have clearly changed their perspective, and that although the crazy camera angles were fun for their time, a third person scary shooter is also fantastic. All I'm saying is, be open to change :)**UPDATE** yes this game is too much fun!! It took me 57 hours to finally beat all 4 campaigns!!! Very good game!! You will like it!! Now quit reading reviews and go out and buy it!Now, to be fair,  RE 5 is the only one that I truly did not like. I tried it but still sucked :(			"

												I was actually struggling whether to give thumbs up or down as the game has its good parts and I enjoyed it, from time to time, but overall it is not worth playing unless you're a RE completionist.The simple good and bad...The good:* This is Resident Evil, in all its cheesy glory with nasty creatures, nastier bosses, and even some of your basic zombies.* The game is quite long and it's actually a 4-in-1 as you get 4 different campaigns with Leon's one being the closest to classic RE (and the rest being closer to GoW or generic tpp shooters).* When everything is working correctly it can be a fun experience with running, shooting, dodging and blowing heads clean off (does not sound like your normal RE game, does it).* You can walk and shoot, it is still a big deal :)* The gfx, when it's bright enough for you to actually see something.The bad:* Respawning enemies. I hate respawning enemies.* Difficulty. I started on Normal and after finishing the first chapter wanted to throw my PC out of the window. That's how frustrating it was. Constantly respawning enemies, dodging bullets like Neo in The Matrix when I had at most 20 ammo. Not to mention healing herbs are scarce. I switched to Amateur to avoid frustration and everything was dropping left and right after I sneezed in the general direction... Sigh... And don't even let me start on the QTEs. Some of them require not reflex but precognition.* The gfx, it's dark and dark and dark and you can't see sh*t because it's that dark. Other than that it's quite nice.* Unskippable animations.* Bad menus with no in-game pause.If you like the RE universe and/or shooting mutated zombie monsters in the head then you might want to grab this when it's 75% off, otherwise I would not bother.

												So Resident Evil is one of those series that has undergone a slew of sequels. I am a big fan of the series and i try to play most of the games aside from the handheld ones but that is mostly a control issue than anything. This resident evil got a lot of flack, and supprisingly more than resident evil 5. re6 still isnt the survival horror game that resident evil fans want, however the game is in a slight step in the right direction. Well if your playing either the ada or leon campain. The Chris and Jake campains are more like action games. I did enjoy most of all the campains. there were some sections in the game however that felt like they were near impossible. One section in Chris's campain has you running away from a attack helicopter while jumping from platform to platform and dodging enemies. If you are just one second too slow you will either get shot by a missile or dodge the missile and fall through the map and die. I can not express my frustration with the 25 tries that it took me to get past that part thanks to dodgey game mechanics and controlls. And if you run out of ammo durring the final boss of Chris's campain be prepared for a 45 minute fight as it spawns things that have a chance to drop ammo or skill points. And if you have my luck have fun stabbing the boss to death. I did have a lot of skill points by the end of that playthrough. Even with these flaws the game still had me playing it for quite a while actualy. to finish all the playthroughs it took me around 20 hours. I did explore quite a bit however so some might be able to finish it quicker. If you can catch it durring a sale it is worth a try.			"

												I can't recommend this game as a Resident Evil game, but I can recommend it as an action game. Some camera issues, bugs, bad story telling and boss design... but overall the game was fun and shooting things is always fun.I'd say it's worth picking up and playing when it's on sale. It's a long long game though and some parts with the quick time events are frustrating. Too bad not many people play it now and agent hunt as well as finding partners to play with is somewhat difficult.			"

												Ok from the beginning this game feels and plays more like call of duty that should be call ""Resident Evil 6 Modern warfare"" or ""Resident evil Rambo Edition"" i mean where is the tension? the horror? there is non of it in this game. If the game name RE wouldnt be there it should be ok but..♥♥♥♥♥♥is there. Most of the stuff from RE 4 and 5 five is here with some elements from Dead Space but its not enought. Dont take me wrong its a fun game but theres better options out there.6/10.			"

												One of the best games out there at the moment,perfect co-op gameplay,nice graphics,perfect AI and the gameplay it self is breath taking,every horror / action freak needs to won this game and beat all the stages with all the characters.The upgrade system is nice,point collecting witch in a way makes you play the game over and over again and makes it even more fun each time you beat it.

												I did not have high hopes for this game when I first heard about it and how there were going to be multiple story lines; I was expecting something a long the lines of ""Halo 2"". However, the game did not jump between story lines just to focus on a timeline. Rather, it focused on the development of the characters you were playing and to top it off the story for each character was done really well. The characters do have overlapping segments but don't really hang out together too much, as expected. But all in all, this game was amazing and surprised me with its quality of gaming and story/character development; felt like a real 'RE' game.			"

												Love the franchise. Though no doubt people hate it because the game is not on the path they want it to be. I like how the characters interact with each other. Hope they would put more works on story ( give us some easter eggs and in depth suspicions). Might also want to improve more on gameplay as well (maybe a co-op combo combat moves). Too much quick time event on this one. Fix the camera too!			"

												I bought this game when it came out on PS3 for 60 bucks day one. To be honest it may have been the worst game I bought full price. I got it on steam for much cheaper, but there are only two reasons that I did, Leon and the new mercenaries mode. I played through all four campaigns on the PS3 and the only one I got marginal enjoyment out of was Leon's campaign. Sure Chris's campaign has much better boss fights but the rest of it just isn't worth trudging through. I wouldn't reccomend this game if you are looking for great story, cause it is non-existent, but if you have a friend to play with you it can be lots of fun especially in mercenaries.			"

I have to admit that I hated it at first but once I really got the odd controls down it was addictive.  If you're in the mood for some good Resident Evil action this one is worth picking up.			"

												Resident Evil 6 is a tired franchise that attempts to please all, gain all, but achieves neither.  Sure it sold over 5 million, but it was 2 million short of its expected sales, and over half the players were far from pleased.  So what game is this?  Is this a survivor horror?  A third person shooter?  A Call of Duty or Gears of War (the irony!) wannabe?  It's clear that Capcom couldn't decide between wanting to please long time Resident Evil fans, such as myself, or if they wanted the big figures that all the other ""AAA"" titles have been shooting for, and failing for the most part.As for how I feel, it's a conflicted relationship.  On one hand, I knew what I was getting myself into and I welcomed it, only out of interest that Capcom would try to stretch the boundaries of what Resident Evil was comfortable at, but then again, I found myself disappointed by the storyline and how they had basically shoe-horned some elements in, like the ""family"", Helena (though I really dig her suit~), and how Chris' campaign is more or less a generic military shooter for the first half (it DOES get better though, but it's easily the worse of the four).  Leon's campaign brings the zombies back, but you are so impowered, there is hardly any tension during gameplay.  Not bad though.  Jake's campaign was a lot of fun, and it's nice to see the siblings of two antagonists work together, to sort of fix the sins of their fathers, so to speak.  The best campaign is Ada's, because it's single player.  No co-op partner.  Just breath in the atmosphere, actually do some puzzles (brain dead simple, but hey, there are puzzles), and not have to have someone talking all the time with you.  Sure, her campaign does have a co-op option, but thankfully it is completely optional.  I wouldn't mind if the whole game just focused on Ada where it's single player, with co-op strictly as an option, not a full integration of the main game.Anyway, game play wise, it is definitely the most controllable and technical Resident Evil to date, but it seems to be meant for a third person shooter, and NOT a survivor horror game.  Graphics looks great, music's fine, yadayada, oh and the PC version is the best version, bar none.  While Resident Evil 4 and 5's PC ports weren't very good, 6 is that definitive PC Resident Evil experience... just minus the Resident Evil we grew up with.  Times had changed, but not for the better... Oh well, at least we got a badass PC version that controls amazingly well.I can only recommend this for hardcore Resident Evil fans.  New comers may want to trend onto Resident Evil Revelations or 4 or any of the earlier games instead, but then again, that is if you can adapt to the tank controls.  So old-school tank controls with awkward camera angles, or great controls at the expense of the Resident Evil name and experience.  Pick your poison.  :P  Either way, if you must play Resident Evil 6, the PC version is the way to go, so THAT I recommend.			"

												I will be the first to admit that the game is an unpolished one, but underneath its problems is one of the most kinetic, frantic games I've played. This is a game in which you slide into enemies, only to get to your feet and deliver a powerbomb. The look of stunned surprise as you suplex a zombie never gets old to me. To me, the gameplay feels like a very logical extension of that seen in RE4 and 5, and in many ways the plot does as well. Given that folks have been messing around with the T (G, C, whatever) virus since the 1990s, it stands to reason that they would eventually make a bioweapon that could actually be sold, and used in a war.

												If you are a fan of horror and shooting this game is for you! As for the Resident Evil fans, i don't know if you would like this game.The game has several seperate story lines comming together. You can choose from different characters and they all have something to add to the overal storyline.The graphics are good but the camera is something to get used to, atleast from my experiance sometimes in combat.Playing this game in co-op mode makes it more fun and challenging. Now i can also understand at some point that RE fans do not like the game, it is more shooting based then anything else. I kinda miss the puzzles a bit.But all in all, you get enough enjoyable zombie killing hours from it. Alone or online with friends or other players.			"

												Resident Evil 6 brings up another round of Action/Horror, this time with old faces as Leon Scott Kennedy, Sherry Birkin, Ada Wong, Chris Redfield and Ingrid Hunnigan (Resident Evil 4) but also new ones like Helena Harper, Piers Nivans and, the son of Albert Wesker, Jake Muller. Seeing the story from 4 different campaigns lets you stick at the monitor/tv for quite some time, also because of the community events. Great story, finally old school characters again, i love it. Maybe not the best choice for those who wanted the old RE style (RE2, 3 etc).			"

												Actually a fun game.I haven't played a resident evil game since re4 and i bought this game simply because of the l4d feature. But after playing a few hours with a buddy of mine in co-op, i think im gonna play the entire game. Heres whyMost re games feature a UI that i have never been a fan off. I dont like the menus, i dont like the layouts, and its always felt like a jrpg was trying to infect the game(pun intended). This has always turned me off of re games but usually i fought through it because of the story and how intense the gameplay felt. This is no different. Many people complain about how fast ou need to react to certain QTE's, but i feel ike that makes it more realistic. In real life, you would NOT have 10 seconds to react to something. You have a split second. And even though they change up the means of breaking the attacks saving yourself, they stick to very few options, and usually you have enough time to react. The times you do not do not take more than one try to figure out what it is you need to do and when, so i dont think this takes away fromt he gameplay at all. If anything, it adds to the immersion. Speaking of immersion, the cut scenes are incredible. The scene in the beginning of leons campaign with the helicopter? Not going to give anything away, but MAN! As for the ambulance that many people have brought up, well, its sucks, but its a mninor moment and dying only sets you back about 30 seconds, and if you cant figure out where to be after one or two times you should probably start plaing Animal Crossing and leave these kinds of games for the grown ups.The other thing im looking forward to, even though i havent gotten there yet, is the replay factor. Every RE game i have played i have replayed several times over. I cant wait to start this again with all my OP weapons and just breeze through it. RE games, like the movies, are just about entertainment and NOTHING else. They will not win best game just like the movies wil not win best film. But they are very entertaining and well worth the money, especially if you pck this up on sale.And on another note, although i havent had the pleasure of playing the L$D crossover yet, this has to be one of the things ive been most excited about in video games. I loved old RE, and i loved both L4D's, and mixing the two seems like a match made in heaven. I would reccomend this game to anyone but i would also STRONGLY reccomend playing this with a friend. The amount of time you have to react is VERY realistic and a lot of times you wil find yourself needing your partners help.			"

There are 4 stories, each story has 2 characters to choose from, so there's a total of 7 character to play as, except Ada Wong's story. And also the online is pretty much dead already.

												I have seen the changes of Resident Evil series as Capcom is trying to preserve the franchise. RE6 applied most contents from RE4 and 5 with separated campaigns. The scale of story is bigger which is not just about viruses as the game will bring a player to taste the diversity of gameplay and atmosphere. The cut scenes and voice acting are done very well beside from heroic dialogues. The gameplay is improved version of RE5. I’m glad that character can shoot in motion, player control is more fluid and more additional movement; sliding, crawling, rolling. Plus with improved melee combat to fill the taste of hitting them up, but limit the over usage by using combat gauge which is a good solution.However, RE6 hardly preserves its horror and intense as original RE, but it fails in implementation. Most of horror moments are based on quick-time events rather than survive from zombie hordes. It has, but the game throws player just into small area with enough ammo pile. Yes, it gives intense gameplay but it can frustrate a player at the same time with annoying enemy’s attack patterns or 1-hit kill enemy. Force player to perform non-sense action or dying from delay incapacitated animation (I prefer old button mashing to recover). Beside from bad design of game world, my biggest disappointment is too much QTE and the way they ported the input into PC. The fast switching of QTE pattern can kill player at every moments. Moreover, the camera issues during escape scenes always confuse player and force player to move in opposed direction and get killed. I understand the game want to show terror moment, but this is bad implementation. For the interfaces, I like its design, but the usage is less fluid and I miss original inventory.Overall, I won’t say RE6 is terrible game; the story and variety of gameplay are interesting including improved Co-op mode like campaign, mercenaries mode are really fun. Agent hunt is also fun and feel like old L4D versus mode (beside from terrible spawn points and zombie delay animation). I feel like RE6 is bit dull product. The campaign setup and based combat are solid, but it still can’t fill the gap between action and horror as the original RE. I have to agree that this is RE we love and hate and I have high hope they will have the right direction in RE7.			"

Super entertaining Story with multiple paths and endings, you can coop online or split screen, be a zombie and kill other players and theres also Mercenary mode for you to break records! This version also features exclusive L4D 2 characters to play as on Mercenary mode (very cool!) On the graphics side this has lots of options and also FOV (very welcome feature) still looks old but definetely better than RE revelations.			"

YouTube™ Video: Resident Evil 6 PC review 

			Views: 2,166		

			http://cramgaming.com - Worth the six month wait, or the definitive version? Now with added Left 4 Dead.		

To conclude, Resident Evil 6 is a must have play game due its vast content and mixed campaigns. If you've already sampled the console version, then it's perhaps hard to recommend this version, if not, then it will be money well spent. A point has been deducted from the original console review simply because Capcom could have offered a bit more polish for PC gamers in terms of some details, and included the DLC by default considering the six month wait.Score 8/10 - Review by Robert Cram			"

												Zombies, abominations, and rampant viruses. Many games have touched on those keywords, but CAPCOM's Resident Evil series has set the table for the zombie-killing survival horror genre. Since the first game, the series has strived to capture the struggle of surviving in zombie-infested mansions, cities, and laboratories with nothing but your wits and whatever weapon you manage to get your hands on. With an evil pharmaceutical company's creations running amok, it falls upon you to uncover their secrets and get out alive. Over time, the borders of the series have shifted and parted to suit the changing times, but as I've noted with Resident Evil 6, the newest addition to the series, the core has remained the same.Resident Evil 6 is the creation of fusing the fourth and fifth game together while keeping aesthetics of the first three games scattered about in select scenarios like trudging through a dying, infested city or escaping from a seemingly invincible foe. Taking place a few years after the events of the previous game, the world is on the brink of another bioterrorism catastrophe, and it's up to a handful of distinguished individuals to put a stop to it, all the while bringing the masterminds to justice. Returning to the fight are four original fan favorites: Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Sherry Birkin, who is a grown woman at this time and Jake Muller's partner, and Ada Wong, who stars in her own campaign as she did in RE4's Separate Ways campaign. All characters are joined by new partners to assist them in their campaigns, of which are four divided into five chapters each.A few words of warning: the main game's campaign is much longer than 4 and 5's story. Each chapter can take up to an average of an hour and a half of your time, and a campaign can take up about half of your day, even if you're the speedrunner type. It's a good thing that the campaigns are varied, else those hours spent would be unbearable. Leon's campaign is a callback to the days of Resident Evil 2. Although Leon is joined by Helena Harper, a regretful woman armed two powerful weapons, there is no safety in this. The campaign guides the player through many dark and eerie locations that keep them tense and alert, and the zombies faced by Leon and Helena are soupped up to match the times and advanced controls. It can be easy to be caught off guard and overwhelmed by the varieties of zombies, but they can be quickly dispatched with a calm mind and a quick trigger finger. For those wanting survival horror, Leon's chapter delivers.That said, the opening sequence can leave the player baffled at the abruptness of the situation. The President is a zombie, the surrounding city is infected, and a cathedral owned by the big bad villain is supposed to hold all the answers. On top of that, the guilty Helena Harper is tight-lipped and doesn't explain herself to Leon until the end of the second chapter. On multiple occasions the agent asks for exposition or reasons to which Helena waves her hand, choosing to jeopardize what little trust there is between each other for the sake of theatrical deliverance at the right moment.And let's not forget to mention Simmons, the villain whom the players must fight four times before he finally dies. Granted, the boss fights take place in spectacular arenas and there's enough ammunition to force the next sequence, but the sheer tenacity of the villain weighing against the exasperation of both the players and the characters themselves leaves a bad taste. If Leon's campaign was a filling dinner, the ending with Simmons was a sour tart that took too long to finish.Chris's campaign is more of what RE5 offered, that being survival action rather than survival horror. With the army of BSAA troops at Chris's back and Piers Nivans, a talented sniper, at his side, the campaign transitions into a third-person shooter play style where cover is much more important, especially against enemies who use firearms. There are no zombies for the Arklay Mansion survivor to fight. Instead there are the J'avo, which are humanoid enemies like the Ganado and Majini from the previous games. The difference with the J'avo is that they are able to mutate body parts in response to getting shot, which can result in a variety of enemy types that force the player to change tactics.CAPCOM had tried to appeal to the Call of Duty fans with the Chris campaign, but in doing so they lost some appeal to the fans of the RE series. The campaign focuses too much on action and throws enemy after enemy at you without giving the ammunition or health needed to tackle them at times. Another gripe with the campaign is the final level and its overuse of the camera. Typically the camera would be over the shoulder of the player, but in the final sequence the camera is unreliable as it focuses on a large BOW that players have no hope of destroying at the moment. To make matters worse, the controls follow the camera just as well as they did when the cameras changed in the first few games. This makes running from a foe or looking where you're going an unsavory challenge.Jake's campaign is hands-down the most varied of them all. Players are taken for a rollercoaster ride through urban warzones, avalanche-prone mountains, a deadly manor, burning streets and even an undersea research facility. The enemies are the J'avo and BOWs again, but while the player can dispatch them with ease, a new foe inspired by RE3's Nemesis chases the characters through all missions. Layered between the various fight and flight elements is the personality of the campaign's two characters, Jake and Sherry. They're personable enough for players to relate to and they're interesting and determined enough that one can't help but root for them. Not to mention the awkward yet adorable scenes between them... Other than a few unforgiving parts in the levels (snipers on an icy slope, for instance), Jake's campaign is exciting, rousing, and a hell of a lot of fun.And as per usual, Ada's campaign sets out to provide exposition and tie up loose ends left dangling during the three main campaigns. Her gameplay has many stealth elements, staying true to her character playing games behind the scenes. As she encounters all of the main characters in their campaigns, she also fights the various enemies in each campaign: zombies, J'avo, and BOWs. Beaten only by Jake's campaign, Ada's run is filled with variety and backstory, although trying to decipher a story by CAPCOM is a Herculean effort in itself.Yes, like most CAPCOM games the story is lacking. Here's a brief summary: It's a one-sided love story that results in a mad clone of Ada, the death of the President, and a Chinese Raccoon City. Given that the series loves to make its characters remark that every city with zombies reminds them of Raccoon, maybe CAPCOM just has a bad case of nostalgia that most fans have gotten over by now.RE6's controls are a far cry from the tank mechanics of the first few games. The heroes can perform mad dashes, move while aiming, physically attack on whim, and dodge attacks by rolling, ducking, and sliding with minimal effort. Adding to the formula is a new mechanic that allows you to counter an enemy's attack with one of your own, provided you have the reflexes to execute the counter. Cover, which was used in some places in RE4 and 5, can be taken anywhere. By pressing the aim button near a wall or object, a character can snap to the cover and peek out to shoot at hostiles. It's a gimmicky mechanic that needs more refinement, but other than that, the new controls are easy to get a hold of.If you're not griping about the story, then you must be having difficulty with the camera. In short, not bad, but not the best that CAPCOM has created. If you're going to try RE6 out, I'd recommend renting it before making the decision to buy it.			"

												I will be the first to admit that the game is an unpolished one, but underneath its problems is one of the most kinetic, frantic games I've played. This is a game in which you slide into enemies, only to get to your feet and deliver a powerbomb. The look of stunned surprise as you suplex a zombie never gets old to me. To me, the gameplay feels like a very logical extension of that seen in RE4 and 5, and in many ways the plot does as well. Given that folks have been messing around with the T (G, C, whatever) virus since the 1990s, it stands to reason that they would eventually make a bioweapon that could actually be sold, and used in a war.

												If you are a fan of horror and shooting this game is for you! As for the Resident Evil fans, i don't know if you would like this game.The game has several seperate story lines comming together. You can choose from different characters and they all have something to add to the overal storyline.The graphics are good but the camera is something to get used to, atleast from my experiance sometimes in combat.Playing this game in co-op mode makes it more fun and challenging. Now i can also understand at some point that RE fans do not like the game, it is more shooting based then anything else. I kinda miss the puzzles a bit.But all in all, you get enough enjoyable zombie killing hours from it. Alone or online with friends or other players.			"

												Resident Evil 6 brings up another round of Action/Horror, this time with old faces as Leon Scott Kennedy, Sherry Birkin, Ada Wong, Chris Redfield and Ingrid Hunnigan (Resident Evil 4) but also new ones like Helena Harper, Piers Nivans and, the son of Albert Wesker, Jake Muller. Seeing the story from 4 different campaigns lets you stick at the monitor/tv for quite some time, also because of the community events. Great story, finally old school characters again, i love it. Maybe not the best choice for those who wanted the old RE style (RE2, 3 etc).			"

												Actually a fun game.I haven't played a resident evil game since re4 and i bought this game simply because of the l4d feature. But after playing a few hours with a buddy of mine in co-op, i think im gonna play the entire game. Heres whyMost re games feature a UI that i have never been a fan off. I dont like the menus, i dont like the layouts, and its always felt like a jrpg was trying to infect the game(pun intended). This has always turned me off of re games but usually i fought through it because of the story and how intense the gameplay felt. This is no different. Many people complain about how fast ou need to react to certain QTE's, but i feel ike that makes it more realistic. In real life, you would NOT have 10 seconds to react to something. You have a split second. And even though they change up the means of breaking the attacks saving yourself, they stick to very few options, and usually you have enough time to react. The times you do not do not take more than one try to figure out what it is you need to do and when, so i dont think this takes away fromt he gameplay at all. If anything, it adds to the immersion. Speaking of immersion, the cut scenes are incredible. The scene in the beginning of leons campaign with the helicopter? Not going to give anything away, but MAN! As for the ambulance that many people have brought up, well, its sucks, but its a mninor moment and dying only sets you back about 30 seconds, and if you cant figure out where to be after one or two times you should probably start plaing Animal Crossing and leave these kinds of games for the grown ups.The other thing im looking forward to, even though i havent gotten there yet, is the replay factor. Every RE game i have played i have replayed several times over. I cant wait to start this again with all my OP weapons and just breeze through it. RE games, like the movies, are just about entertainment and NOTHING else. They will not win best game just like the movies wil not win best film. But they are very entertaining and well worth the money, especially if you pck this up on sale.And on another note, although i havent had the pleasure of playing the L$D crossover yet, this has to be one of the things ive been most excited about in video games. I loved old RE, and i loved both L4D's, and mixing the two seems like a match made in heaven. I would reccomend this game to anyone but i would also STRONGLY reccomend playing this with a friend. The amount of time you have to react is VERY realistic and a lot of times you wil find yourself needing your partners help.			"

												Let's get this straight: Never judge a game by it's ancestors, or you'll just end up having a bad time. Unless the game is an exact clone of the last game, then you can safely judge it like that. Enjoy every game like it is a standalone game. Take out the 6, and pretend like it's the first game you've ever played. Then, hopefully, you can realize that a true gamer feels.Onto the pros and cons.Pros:+Free-Flow controls+Dodging+Moving while Shooting+Leon's campaign is themed around Resident Evil 2.+4 Campaigns in One game! (That's a lot of content)+Local Co-Op for PC (Rare indeed)Cons:-QTEs are around a lot. (I'd rather only have them for escaping an enemy's attack, like old times)-A lot of people hate this gameHopefully you give the game a chance, and you don't base it off past games in the series. At least you're getting 4 times the gameplay you'd get from any other game (Other than open world games like GTA and Elder Scrolls).			"

												I have been a die-hard fan of Resident Evil since I first played RE2 on the N64. I loved the remake of RE1 on CG. When the game genre shifted from Survival Horror to Action Horror in RE4 I was very reluctant, but pleasently surprised. And I would be lying if I said I didn't love playing RE5 co-op with my friends. To me, the RE story ended with RE5. All lose ends tied up, all stories ran their course, and the heros saved the day. However, being a huge fan of RE, I was very excited when this game launched and bought it without a second thought. That was a huge mistake.RE6 is a stain on the RE series. The story line is non-sense, the controls are awful and cumbersome, whether on a game pad or keyboard, and the characters are just Capcom's way of vomiting out familar faces to try and grab the fan base of RE. The zombies in this game are pratically just carbon-copies of the creatures you would see in the Left for Dead series. Although, they do try to bring back the classic zombies from the original RE series, they do so in a way that is completely NOT cannon to the story. Speaking of story, continuity in this game is a huge problem. In Leon's story, you somehow end in a valley between mountains at the edge of a lake, even though the progression of the story takes you further and further down into some kind of catacombs. All I can figure is that your battle with the huge shark with legs (WTF?) actually occurs while you are falling UP a waterfall. I guess gravity doesn't exist in the RE universe anymore. I didn't even bother to try and beat Chris's story line. The entire thing was just ending up to be Michael Bay's take on Die Hard the game. After trying to escape a zombie guided helicopter by jumping across make shift rafts on a river in Hong Kong I decided it was time to put the controller down, delete the game from my hard drive, and try to forget that this game ever existed.

												This game is bloody hilarious.So many ""that guy"" moments in this game. That guy who tries to ram a zombie with the bus and managed to lose control of the bus, that guy who release a zombie that can infect civilians at a fast rate, that guy who comes out and points players to the chopper but doesn't get into the chopper and dies, etc. They are all over the place.The drama is so weird, I get 2nd Party Embarrassment whenever I play as any of the characters in the game or witnessing the npc act because they tend to make  a choice which is incredibly stupid, except for a select few like Ada Wong because she is a one woman army but i question her methods sometimes.Storyline is actually not bad, aside from the weird and random lines the characters say.Gameplay is ok, I really like the sprinting feature, a lot of times when i'm outnumbered, i'll just start sprinting towards the objective ignoring all the enemies unless I have to kill them to make way. Boss battle can be challenging if you don't know what you're supposed to shoot at or do whatever. Mini bosses are pain in the neck, lil♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥trying to ruin your walk in the park.

												I bought this game when it first came out back when it was released on PS3, and I have had it for some time now on PC.I love Resident Evil. I have been a fan for this series since I was like 4 years old watching my uncle play it behind my bed sheets. Despite what everyone has said about this game I do believe it was worth every penny, it is a good game with a good story behind it. Is it scary? No, however it does have a few jump scares here and there. This game is more of an action movie if anything with your typical Michael Bay explosions and what not but don't let that stop you from buying this game and having fun. There's been many times where I do feel like they're turning Leon into a God where he survives places where no human can survive - now I realize this is a game. I realize he is the cash cow of Resident Evil, however if they added some form of realism to this game I feel like it would of been golden. I'm not asking for certain characters to be completely killed off. I am just saying it'll be nice to have some ""realism"" into the game.			"

Just, if you're gonna try your luck on this, do so when the price for the base game and DLC has dropped- as with a lot of titles, the content that gives this game replayability is stuck behind a paywall. Yay.And don't go into this expecting a dark, cerebral, psychological thriller/survival horror game. This is not Hellraiser, this is freakin' Planet Terror- with the mindset that you're enjoying a budget horror themed action movie the game makes more sense. Play it with a friend, have some drinks or maybe a smoke if that's your scene, have a good time.			"

												This game gets a lot of heat for not being more like it's predecessors. While I can agree that I enjoy the previous installments (namely RE3 and RE4) more, I also think this is a good game. It handles way better than 5 did. The story, while lacking the great pacing the first few games had, fits well enough. The more action oriented sequences with Chris do throw the game of tone, but to me it's a minor problem. Looking at it objectively as a game instead of a sequel I'm sure would bring about more positive reviews. I know when investing in a franchise game you expect a certain consistency, however calling it a bad game doesn't seem fair to me. If you're willing to play it as just a game, and not simply compare it to other RE titlles, you'll most likley enjoy it.			"

I found 6 rather interesting in it's controls. It could be way better I will admit, but I am not completely disappointed either. If you are a RE fan.. just give it a go. Judge it for yourself.

												I can't recommend this game as a Resident Evil game, but I can recommend it as an action game. Some camera issues, bugs, bad story telling and boss design... but overall the game was fun and shooting things is always fun.I'd say it's worth picking up and playing when it's on sale. It's a long long game though and some parts with the quick time events are frustrating. Too bad not many people play it now and agent hunt as well as finding partners to play with is somewhat difficult.			"

												I did not have high hopes for this game when I first heard about it and how there were going to be multiple story lines; I was expecting something a long the lines of ""Halo 2"". However, the game did not jump between story lines just to focus on a timeline. Rather, it focused on the development of the characters you were playing and to top it off the story for each character was done really well. The characters do have overlapping segments but don't really hang out together too much, as expected. But all in all, this game was amazing and surprised me with its quality of gaming and story/character development; felt like a real 'RE' game.			"

												Resident Evil 6 is like Star Wars Episode 1-3.For a special target audience (and with special i mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) it is a fantastic and entertaining game. It is just nothing like the Resident Evil series stood for. No Survival Horror. No ressource management, no dannger of getting killed anywhere at anytime, no serious and dark story, no authentic characters and story developement. It is just realy stupid in many, many cases. Even -the not so good but fun- RE5 did it better. RE6 can be fun to play, but even or especially Resident Evil 1 is just the better game, and that should capcom make to think why they are making worse RE games.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. Being a huge resident evil fan and owning a ton of the resident evil games, this game was different than most. Lets go to resident evil 4.   That game is what changed the resident evil series. The game went from birds-eye view type camera angles to a true 3rd person game. It changed the inventory, graphics, and most things with resident evil, and in my perspective, re4 is one of the best games i have ever played.    Resident Evil 6 changed how resident evil is going to be i think as well from this point on. The game has more of a cinematic storyline, with more cutscenes, and a bigger plot. You really gotta listen in with this game, because there are 4 different campaigns, and they all relate to each other in some kind of way, so its very important to know whats going on in the game at all times, or else you can get stranded and confused with the story.   Over all the game is awesome and i really enjoy playing mercenaries with my buds.			"

												I will be the first to admit that the game is an unpolished one, but underneath its problems is one of the most kinetic, frantic games I've played. This is a game in which you slide into enemies, only to get to your feet and deliver a powerbomb. The look of stunned surprise as you suplex a zombie never gets old to me. To me, the gameplay feels like a very logical extension of that seen in RE4 and 5, and in many ways the plot does as well. Given that folks have been messing around with the T (G, C, whatever) virus since the 1990s, it stands to reason that they would eventually make a bioweapon that could actually be sold, and used in a war.

As for the Resident Evil fans, i don't know if you would like this game.The game has several seperate story lines comming together. You can choose from different characters and they all have something to add to the overal storyline.The graphics are good but the camera is something to get used to, atleast from my experiance sometimes in combat.Playing this game in co-op mode makes it more fun and challenging. Now i can also understand at some point that RE fans do not like the game, it is more shooting based then anything else. I kinda miss the puzzles a bit.But all in all, you get enough enjoyable zombie killing hours from it. Alone or online with friends or other players.			"

												Resident Evil 6 brings up another round of Action/Horror, this time with old faces as Leon Scott Kennedy, Sherry Birkin, Ada Wong, Chris Redfield and Ingrid Hunnigan (Resident Evil 4) but also new ones like Helena Harper, Piers Nivans and, the son of Albert Wesker, Jake Muller. Seeing the story from 4 different campaigns lets you stick at the monitor/tv for quite some time, also because of the community events. Great story, finally old school characters again, i love it. Maybe not the best choice for those who wanted the old RE style (RE2, 3 etc).			"

												Actually a fun game.I haven't played a resident evil game since re4 and i bought this game simply because of the l4d feature. But after playing a few hours with a buddy of mine in co-op, i think im gonna play the entire game. Heres whyMost re games feature a UI that i have never been a fan off. I dont like the menus, i dont like the layouts, and its always felt like a jrpg was trying to infect the game(pun intended). This has always turned me off of re games but usually i fought through it because of the story and how intense the gameplay felt. This is no different. Many people complain about how fast ou need to react to certain QTE's, but i feel ike that makes it more realistic. In real life, you would NOT have 10 seconds to react to something. You have a split second. And even though they change up the means of breaking the attacks saving yourself, they stick to very few options, and usually you have enough time to react. The times you do not do not take more than one try to figure out what it is you need to do and when, so i dont think this takes away fromt he gameplay at all. If anything, it adds to the immersion. Speaking of immersion, the cut scenes are incredible. The scene in the beginning of leons campaign with the helicopter? Not going to give anything away, but MAN! As for the ambulance that many people have brought up, well, its sucks, but its a mninor moment and dying only sets you back about 30 seconds, and if you cant figure out where to be after one or two times you should probably start plaing Animal Crossing and leave these kinds of games for the grown ups.The other thing im looking forward to, even though i havent gotten there yet, is the replay factor. Every RE game i have played i have replayed several times over. I cant wait to start this again with all my OP weapons and just breeze through it. RE games, like the movies, are just about entertainment and NOTHING else. They will not win best game just like the movies wil not win best film. But they are very entertaining and well worth the money, especially if you pck this up on sale.And on another note, although i havent had the pleasure of playing the L$D crossover yet, this has to be one of the things ive been most excited about in video games. I loved old RE, and i loved both L4D's, and mixing the two seems like a match made in heaven. I would reccomend this game to anyone but i would also STRONGLY reccomend playing this with a friend. The amount of time you have to react is VERY realistic and a lot of times you wil find yourself needing your partners help.			"

												I bought this game when it first came out back when it was released on PS3, and I have had it for some time now on PC.I love Resident Evil. I have been a fan for this series since I was like 4 years old watching my uncle play it behind my bed sheets. Despite what everyone has said about this game I do believe it was worth every penny, it is a good game with a good story behind it. Is it scary? No, however it does have a few jump scares here and there. This game is more of an action movie if anything with your typical Michael Bay explosions and what not but don't let that stop you from buying this game and having fun. There's been many times where I do feel like they're turning Leon into a God where he survives places where no human can survive - now I realize this is a game. I realize he is the cash cow of Resident Evil, however if they added some form of realism to this game I feel like it would of been golden. I'm not asking for certain characters to be completely killed off. I am just saying it'll be nice to have some ""realism"" into the game.			"

I've played it before the steamversion, solo, and it's very doable with the AI bot.It's nowhere near as horror-ish as the first 3 RE games, and it's alot more action packed than 4 and 5, but atleast the stories are solid so this ""flaw"" (in diehard RE1-3 fans' eyes) can be overlooked.Would definitely recommend this game as a COOP game, but also if you just want to take it easy and play alone.

												Let's get this straight: Never judge a game by it's ancestors, or you'll just end up having a bad time. Unless the game is an exact clone of the last game, then you can safely judge it like that. Enjoy every game like it is a standalone game. Take out the 6, and pretend like it's the first game you've ever played. Then, hopefully, you can realize that a true gamer feels.Onto the pros and cons.Pros:+Free-Flow controls+Dodging+Moving while Shooting+Leon's campaign is themed around Resident Evil 2.+4 Campaigns in One game! (That's a lot of content)+Local Co-Op for PC (Rare indeed)Cons:-QTEs are around a lot. (I'd rather only have them for escaping an enemy's attack, like old times)-A lot of people hate this gameHopefully you give the game a chance, and you don't base it off past games in the series. At least you're getting 4 times the gameplay you'd get from any other game (Other than open world games like GTA and Elder Scrolls).			"

												Я не могу понять, почему этой части серии поставили в среднем оценку 7.5 - это абсурд.ВСЕ компании продуманы до костей, неожиданно поставлен сюжет (смотря за кого начать компанию).Гемплей быстро привыкаемый, порт наилучший, атмосфера нервности присутствует. По сравнению с 5 частью лучше в 2 раза.Фантастический кооператив ещё продуманнее и сложнее. Вместо покупки пушек мы их находим по мере выполнения задания, а также нельзя прокачивать оружие, что печально, вместо этого прокачиваем умения и, как всегда, хочется проходить снова ииииииииииииии снова.

												I just spent the last hour of my life trying and retrying a sequence in which all I should need to do is hold the forward arrow and steer. Instead I have died 30 times. Once, quite refreshingly, was due to a bug wherein I hovered in the air for a few minutes, merrily parkouring over invisible boxes, until Resi abruptly realized it had made a mistake and sent me plummeting to my death.I don't think a game has ever made me so spiteful with its design decisions.All menus (including saves) work in real time. There is no pause. There is no remit from this unending nightmare. The inventory is clunky garbage. Progress is only truly saved at the end of chapters (about four to a campaign, and about two hours long each.)Furthermore, the game is in over-the-shoulder cover-shooter controls most of the time. And then unexpectedly it's in tank controls. And then sometimes the camera decides to decouple from your shoulder, orbits around you, and reverses all your movement inputs while it's doing this. Not as a bug, mind you. As a feature.I don't think I can adequately describe how awful this is, so instead just imagine Capcom's boot stomping on a human face forever.EDIT: Died a few more times. Figured out a workaround for the problem. The game gets very confused (bless its little heart) when you try to maneuver while running with the arrow keys. You need to frantically wrench the mouse around the screen to try and head in the right direction. The arrow keys are also necessary, but they fulfill a supplementary role: namely, navigating you into walls.			"

												This game can best be described in two words; frustrating and tedious. I really wanted to at least finish the 4 campaigns but had to stop for fear of breaking my keyboard. There are so, so many things wrong with this game and so very few things right. I am a long time fan of the series. I played the very first RE on PS1. To date I have played and finished RE1,2,3 CV:X, 4,5 and Revelations so I know the series well.  All of them have been frustrating at times. It is part of what makes difficult games rewarding. A sense of achievement for having solved a challenging puzzle or defeated a tough boss. Unfortunately that sense of satisfaction is utterly absent in RE6. ""Yes! I finally did it!"" has been replaced with ""Thank f that's out of the way."" There is so much I feel I want to say about this game that this review will consist of a brief pros and cons followed by more detailed reasoning should anyone wish to understand my views. Additionally I will provide clear spoilers further down so if you do not wish to see them please stop after the warning.Pros:The characters look good.The voice acting will be familiar.There are a few atmospheric areas.Sherry Birkin! (RE2 is still the best of the series imho so nice to see her return)The general presentation is solid.Some of the set piece sequences were fun and well scripted.Cons:The controls feel sluggish and awkward. Also a 1:1 transposition of controller to mouse and keyboard rarely ends well.The cinematic camera often leads to incredibly jarring perspective shifts.The story is incredibly boring. The game contains characters I love and yet in this game I do not care about any of them in the slightest. The characters are never adequately fleshed out. There are a number of new characters introduced with the bare-minimum of back story and we are just expected to care what happens to them. I didn't.The interconnecting storylines should be interesting and add a new dimension to the game and yet everything feels shoehorned together just for the sake of a game mechanic.""Why are we doing this?"" ""Because COD"" So much of the game feels like it is copying elements from the Call of Duty franchise which is so unimaginably stupid for an RE title. ""MORE SPLOSHUNS!!!!!111one1!"" ""WHY?"" ""BECAUSE COD!!!!!!"" It is frankly mornonic in the extreme.The locations quickly become boring. The lighting is atrocious. Dark and atmospheric are not synonymous. There are exceptions in this game but precious few.The enemy design has become ludicrous to the point that they are not frightening or horifying they are now simply irritating.The bosses. Not because of the mechanics themselves, but how the game uses them. Get used to saying ""Again, really? I so don't care anymore.""The music is intrusive to the point I turned it off.No interesting villains.The pacing is non existent. It starts off being incredibly promising. The opening to the first scenario is very well done but before long it ramps everything up to 11 and just leaves it there. FOREVER.In summary, I spent a great deal of my time in this game persisting with tedious sequence after tedious sequence in the hopes that at some point the game would improve, and it just never did. I struggled, literally, through three campaigns before finally having to stop early in the fourth after yet another pointless ""chase"" sequence killed me without me being able to comprehend what I had done wrong. And this is my biggest complaint. These sequences are so frequent that they quickly become just another annoyance to be overcome in order to progress the story. The first sequence was mildly irritating due to the shoddy controls but after a half dozen or so I was ready to throw something. They are that aggravating. I have not been so angry at a game mechanic in a long while. And I have 100 hours or so played in Dark Souls. For fans of the series, I was not truly dissapointed by this game because I simply hate it too much to feel anything else.From this point onwards expect spoilers. You have been warned.Leon's campaign starts well, walking around in a creepy darkened mansion-like building. I was very encouraged early on. The pace slowly ramps up as you progress towards a finale of sorts but once the action reaches a peak it more or less stays there for the rest of the campaign. There is seemingly nothing to the game except for a seris of action sequences loosely connected byt cutscenes that tell you nothing of interest. The same tired plot points are recycled over and over. The same sequences are recycled over and over. You may as well play the first campaign and then watch the rest of the cutscenes somewhere. Even most of them are recycled from campaign to campaign. There is maybe 3-4 hours of total storytelling in this game. The rest is shooting stuff, running away from stuff or getting blown off something by an explosion and being separated from your partner for 5 minutes. There is NOTHING in this game that another game in the series has not done better. And by better I mean if you have played all the games I listed at the beginning you will get nothing new out of this game at all. The story is truly that weak. You just won't care, I promise.Examples;Once Leon and Helena escape the campus they go through various areas killing zombies, and wind up at a cathedral. Up to this point I was enjoying the game. The pacing seemed reasonable and I was expecting at this point to have arrived at the first major location in the game involving exploration, puzzles, secrets and whatnot. Instead what I got was about 10 minutes of trivial puzzles. And so the game progresses in that fashion til the end. And this is where it really begins to suck HARD. You fight a boss and kill it. You then kill stuff for ten minutes and the boss is back. Then you kill things and it comes back. Again and again you fight the same boss with slightly different patterns with seemingly nothing of consequence happening in between. It is just. Plain. BORING. It really just becomes a game of Call of Duty with ""zombies"". You get to a room with cover and stuff tries to kill you for 5 minutes or so. You clear that room, go through a corridor and there is another room with stuff to kill. The decor changes but the enemies are the same and the gameplay never elevates beyond this point. In fact it gets worse. The chase sequences.I had similar doubts about RE5 in truth. But comparing the two there are some critical differences; in RE5 the sequences tend to be mercifully short and they don't rely on a horribly broken control system. The running ahead of a falling floor is achieved in RE5 in a simple and elegent fashion. In RE6 it is painful. You have to manually control you character as you escape a falling floor (notably Chris and Piers on the river in China) but the controls simply do not work properly. I died multiple times due to my character randomly turning 180 and jumping back the way he came. And this happened every time. Irritating, tedious, repetetive. I enjoy challenging. I hate broken.RE4, RE5 and Revelations all have similar gameplay but with more interesting villains and far more engaging stories as well as infinitely superior progression systems.There are AI problems with enemies and partners, level glitches with animations and trigger points and so much more but I have no more space. This game feels unfinished. It is a shameless cash-in with no heart in it. Glad I only payed £5 for it and not £40.			"

												Resident Evil 6 is like Star Wars Episode 1-3.For a special target audience (and with special i mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) it is a fantastic and entertaining game. It is just nothing like the Resident Evil series stood for. No Survival Horror. No ressource management, no dannger of getting killed anywhere at anytime, no serious and dark story, no authentic characters and story developement. It is just realy stupid in many, many cases. Even -the not so good but fun- RE5 did it better. RE6 can be fun to play, but even or especially Resident Evil 1 is just the better game, and that should capcom make to think why they are making worse RE games.			"

												I bought this game when it first came out back when it was released on PS3, and I have had it for some time now on PC.I love Resident Evil. I have been a fan for this series since I was like 4 years old watching my uncle play it behind my bed sheets. Despite what everyone has said about this game I do believe it was worth every penny, it is a good game with a good story behind it. Is it scary? No, however it does have a few jump scares here and there. This game is more of an action movie if anything with your typical Michael Bay explosions and what not but don't let that stop you from buying this game and having fun. There's been many times where I do feel like they're turning Leon into a God where he survives places where no human can survive - now I realize this is a game. I realize he is the cash cow of Resident Evil, however if they added some form of realism to this game I feel like it would of been golden. I'm not asking for certain characters to be completely killed off. I am just saying it'll be nice to have some ""realism"" into the game.			"

												A few things about this game.  I like the general stories and how they all intertwine with each other, but a big problem some people may have is that it has a lot of story references to older games, mostly RE2 (which now a days is hard to get).  Though Resident Evil / Biohazard has completely changed after the third one from horror and ominous to action-packed and gun hoeing.  Don't expect the same scares in this one that you would in RE2/BH2P.S. I originally thought it was an ok game until I tried the mercenaries no mercy with l4d2 characters (Nick and Ellis), and that... well, that was one of the biggest rushes I got from a game in a while.  I'll just leave it at that...			"

												Underrated addition to the famed Resident Evil franchise. Suffers from some jinkiness at parts, but overall delivers a satisfying and action-packed shooter experience. Fantastic graphics, lots of gameplay. Hard to go wrong here.If you're looking for the old, slow tank-shooter style of the original Resident Evils, this is not your best bet.			"

												more of a shooter than a traditional RE game - but i loved it - great fun! i've played all the RE games and truly have enjoyed all of them (except the rails shooter one, in which i couldn't get past the first boss; and the one set on the train with 2 characters; i ended up stuck and not being able to continue) - anyway this was a hoot as long as you take it for what it is and don't expect RE1 glory days - :)			"

												if you searching a survival horor game, then this isnt for you. RE has been veer away from that genre after RE3. But i tell you this, RE6 is one of the best RE series of all times. reasons ?[+] PROS :- COOP    this is the main reason i bought this game. Sure it isnt a survival horror. but it is a fun coop action 3ps shooter game that excels both online or local coop is a delightfull experience - Great controller support   it isnt perfect. but its way better than RE 5. i use my Dualshock 2 controller- nice graphic    mind you, this is a 3 year old game but still looks damn good- Ada Wong tight pants[-] CONS :- bad camera implementation sometimes irritating, i think its better if we can setup view distance from the character - no weapon upgrade or customization- cliche plot- exagerated action scene almost feel like a ripoff from a bollywood movieSCORE  8/10GET IT NOW			"

I was constantly testing my patience as I forced myself through each level just so I could say that I've beaten every main Resident Evil game. But after a while, the game suddenly got a million times better!! I found was actually enjoying the story and the characters a lot more then I was when I first started!

												Generally a good game. Great stories and the way it's been told is kinda awesome(So do the hollywood-grade cutscenes). Gameplay is fun and graphics was alright , recommend to play with real people because AI partner is dumb( but at least they don't waste your items like in RE5). No horror like old RE games though so if you are a fan of horror stuff , this is not what you are looking for but if you are action-lovers then hell yeah ! This is what you gonna love.			"

												Is it the Best game in the series? nope. Does it have a lot going for it? Yep.Pros- 1. Got a buddy to play with? good becuase it's always better to play the game with someone.2. When the story does hit it, it hits it out of the park. There are moments of true terror in this game (most in Leon's Campaign)3. The Melee and shooting system are a fine polish. They really are fun and if you like mercenaries modes you like this.4. Some replayability really goes a long way with this game. Cons- 1. Does someone who is suffering and dying from a C virus infection really have to be sexualized in such a huge way. Deborah in Leon's Campaign goes way overboard and it's really distracting and in poor taste.2. Story is all over the place due to the nature of 4 split campaigns. You might like one campaign ang hate the next one due to the changed nature. 3. When it falls flat... it truly does. some things you have to slog through and boy does it suck if you have to do it multiple times.4. QTE's... So many QTE's... god help you if you suck at them. "

												I launched it once, and then I died. I found out it doesn't have colorblind support, or any kind of blindness support, so I was pretty disapoint.The game is the best thing I have ever played, with its action packed rolling mechanics and non-functioning story elements, it's a real treat.That being said, it's the worst game I've ever played.Seriously though, it isn't a very good game. Don't get it unless it's on sale or you have someone to play it with while making fun of it the whole time.			"

												Dear reader,If you are looking for an incredibly fun Resident Evil game, look no further than Resident Evil 5! Seriously, if you try to go for Resident Evil 6, you will be just as disappointed as I am. The camera angles will make you jump off ledges while running from explosions and helicoperts (honestly, who made this game and why did they think they should get Michael Bay involved?) Resident Evil 5 may not have introduced the badass that is Albert Wesker but they nailed the badassary which the previous games couldn't quite get down. Spoiler Altert! They killed him off.With possibly the greatest villain in the Resident Evil series killed off, what do they do? Come up with some strange reason for Wesker to have a son who is far weaker than his father but still acts like a character from Devil May Cry. Although you can go fisticuffs on these ""zombies,"" when you really need the ammo, it's not there (you can't even pick up their guns!) and when you're trying to melee these ""zombies"" they shoot the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and drop your health, which then makes you oh so much weaker. Yes, when you really need your inherited badassary, you become a little ♥♥♥♥♥ who can only sweep the leg as a melee attack. I don't even know how such a slow kick can hurt them but they stumble. And then recover from getting hit faster than you can recover from attacking which then leads to you getting shot more.I will not be purchasing another Resident Evil game after this atrocity because I bought this on sale for $8 and I still feel ripped off. P.S. Leon needs to leave the series. What is with you people liking these worthless emo kids in shows and video games (I'm talking about you, Daryl from The Walking Dead). Kill him off, leave the story Chris Redfield and bring the games back to their former glory of Resident Evil 1 - 5 (yes I know Leon was in quite a few of the other games in the series).All in all, I'd give this game 1 out of 10 RPGs to the face because ♥♥♥♥ allies who shoot you repeatedly with RPG-7s from the comfort of their helicopters!

												9/10!The story is TRUE resident evil, Cutscenes are incredible, story and characters as good as ever! Plus it has an option for Co-op and various other modes!Yes, the game has many weaknesses, but since RE4 the series has been so greatly changed, why complain now then? Admitedly the gameplay, is just a Gears of War style of shooter, since RE4.This is better than Resident Evil 5! Reason: Better story, Cutscenes and also set mostly during the night! 100% Better game, but overall in the series, probably just ahead of #5, and certainly average, by the perfections of early RE games/{ I would Like to mention, That I finally had the nerve to Play RE6 in 2017! I have played EVERY other RE title ever (Upto this)!Dont be put off by the BS demo of the game, it is much better than that, if your unsure like I was, buy it on sale. It is definately worth it then!PS Ada Wong, is the best Femme Fatale out there!RESIDENT Eeeeeeee-vil!			"

I do belive its a step up from RE5 simply because at the very least they tried to include oldschool zombie campaign but then you have to deal with mutated grasshoper-men ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.People get a lot of flame for critizicing it for being a bad RE game because they had EXPECTATIONS as FANS. I did too and i dont think anybody should be blamed for that : the sole reasons that drove me to buy those games came from my expiiences in previous games. Nobody would ever ♥♥♥♥♥ if RE5 and RE6 were released under another title (which would never happen because they needed the publicity that this franchise had generated to make sales)I damn the developers for the whole ""appeal to the wider audience"" thing.That goes to show how little they care about making a good game and remain true to their style in favor of making a game that sells better (disregarding what their main consumer base might think).A solid Biohazard expirience would sell too.

												Насколько мне известно серия Resident Evil славится атмосферой и хардкорностью, когда считаешь каждый патрон и стараешься пройти игру без потерь. Шестая часть не стала исключением. Но всего лишь по атмосфере. Сейчас это Call of Duty  с зомби и гигантскими боссами. На этот раз нам дают поиграть за 4 персонажей. Самое крутое это то, что в какой-то момент герои пересекаются, и тут ты можешь посмотреть на данную ситуацию с разных сторон. Это очень круто. Остальное, что есть в RE6 это хорошая история, интересный геймплей ( особенно когда начинаешь играть за Криса, давно я не встречал таких врагов которые мутируют ту часть тела, которую снесет игрок ).К сожалению интерес может немного упасть когда вы пройдете 2 первые кампании, так как ничего непонятно. Но когда начинаешь проходить кампанию Ады Вонг, то получаешь ответы на все вопросы. В итоге Capcom попробовала угодить всем, и у них получилась неплохая игра! Проходите ее в коопе! Оценка 8/10			"

												  Многие в свое время сильно распинались, рассказывая, как игра ужасна, со временем негатив улегся и игра явила множество своих плюсов. Расскажу только о тех минусах, которые не получается простить или не заметить.  1. Постоянная попытка постанавливать сцену. То камера сама начнет лететь на ""нужный"" объект/взрыв, то персонажам запрещается использовать бег или стрелять.  Поверьте, если сцена хороша, я так на нее посмотрю, зачем конкретно поворачивать мне голову и связывать руки/ноги?  2. Скриптованность появления врагов. В RE4, RE5, Dead Space и других играх я могу увидеть притворяющегося мертвым врага и заранее его продырявить. Но здесь это не только нельзя сделать, все хуже - зомби неуязвим пока встает, и только когда он ""красиво поднимется в него будет входить урон. Это ОЧЕНЬ раздражает.   Пофикси разработчики всего эти две вещи и я бы рукоплескал игре.  Мелочи, которые простить можно, но все-таки они как лишнее пятно:  3. Почему убрали возможность командного взаимодействия? Больше нельзя подлечить конкретно союзника (таблетками, только когда он в агонии), больше нельзя передать патроны (а в RE5 это неплохо развивало взаимодействие), все предметы просто продублированы. Но это же кооперативная игра, а дублирование предметов наоборот делает игроков более самостоятельными, даже эмблемы каждый теперь сам сбивает для себя. Определиться бы - кооператив это или попутная прогулка?  4. Где задачи на подумать? Даже в РЕ5 хотя бы были зеркала с лучами.  5. Старая прокачка и выбор оружия были приятнее и вариативнее. Мне нравится настраивать под себя арсенал, а тут 3 скилла и будь доволен.  Итого: Хороший и добротный продолжатель 4 и 5 частей. Кооператив добавляет игер лишний бал и можно честно поставить около 7 из 10. А так просто было вытянуть выше, всего лишь исправив перечисленные ошибки.			"

												Glad I got this on a big sale.  So far, this game has little to do with any sort of gaming skills you may or may not have.  Its all about hitting the keys that the game tells you to hit at exactly the moment it tells you to hit them.  In other words, you dont die because you got overwhelmed by mobs or made a bad tactical decision, you died because it was your first play through of a certain scene and you didnt know which keys the game was going to ask you to hit. Once you do know which key needs to be hit and when, your next play through is a breeze.  In still other words, the game relies on your lack of knowledge about what to do next to make itself difficult.  That kind of ""difficulty"" doesnt count as being difficult to me.  I mean, seriously!  If a game is only difficult during your first play through and a breeze every other time that you play it, what does that say?  RE 6 is also very linear and feels cramped and the charectors move like they are slogging through peanut butter.  Other than that, RE 6 is beautiful graphically and the story is fun to follow.  Ill probably keep playing it to follow the story but the game play is just plain silly.  For example, I play a scene and die because I didnt know the game was going to demand that I hit V or R or space or whatever at exactly a certain point.  So, I restart the scene and now I know when Im going to have to hit the V or R or Space or whatever so this time I do and I dont die.  If you like that kind of game play then more power to you.  I prefer something a little more challenging and something that I actually have a little more control over.   Is this game worth the price that I paid for it($7.50)?  Sure but I wouldnt advise that anyone pay any more than that-unless you like the kind of game play that I described.  Ill probably get a bunch of angry kids hating on this review but that will be fun too lol!			"

												Wow this game is terrible when compared to the previous entries in the series. More quick time events have been placed. The camera angle is forced sometimes which in and of its self isn't the end of the world except for when the game completly stops you from seeing forward to force you to look at something like oh I don't know a random door. No more gun upgrade system it's instead replaced with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ buying skill system. (once you buy the few you want there isn't anything else you need to spend on). Very linear gameplay. No reason to really explore. No more interesting puzzles. Rocket launcher shots some times do loads of damage to you but other times only does one bar (when hit dead on or not). Enemies who shoot you will make you fall back for no reason. And god forbid you get me started on the stupid slide mechanic. Some times you will play the same part twice for example their is a part where you play Leon's campaign that you then replay the same exact part with Chris. Or even gamepley wise there is a collect the keys part that has the same exact enemy and idea in both. Final Verdict: Resident Evil 6: Micheal Bay edition.			"

												This game is not scary, and thats what everyone cries over.... The orginal Resident Evil ... I was more scared of the controls then the zombies in it... Resident Evil 6 Controls take some getting used to, but once you embeed them in your memory, buddy you're in for a good time. My hours are low on steam, but on my PS3 I completed no hope on all missions, not even trying normal, hard. Going stright to No Hope was a great experience, and the other modes that come with the game are loads of fun as well! Not many people play it anymore, but when it first came out I had a super great time, people invading my game as a zombie, playing the multiplayer arena type games. This game is a game, not a horror simulator. *Pats Resident Evil 6 on the head*People need hope /10			"

												As someone who has played RE4, RE5, and RE: Revelations. I recommend RE6 too, though it is true that the game became less scary and more action-based after RE4. However, having 4 different campaigns and occasionally bumping into different protagonists of the game adds a nice taste to the game. I liked it. Their stories; at least some of them are a little bit intertwined to each other. You get the full picture when you finished all four campaign. If you have played RE4 on normal diffculty, be assured RE6 is much more easier on Normal difficulty than RE4 and also less scary. At least you\'re not alone like you were in RE4. The only disappointment for me is not to see Claire. Almost everyone is on this game except her.			"

												I bought this game when it first came out back when it was released on PS3, and I have had it for some time now on PC.I love Resident Evil. I have been a fan for this series since I was like 4 years old watching my uncle play it behind my bed sheets. Despite what everyone has said about this game I do believe it was worth every penny, it is a good game with a good story behind it. Is it scary? No, however it does have a few jump scares here and there. This game is more of an action movie if anything with your typical Michael Bay explosions and what not but don't let that stop you from buying this game and having fun. There's been many times where I do feel like they're turning Leon into a God where he survives places where no human can survive - now I realize this is a game. I realize he is the cash cow of Resident Evil, however if they added some form of realism to this game I feel like it would of been golden. I'm not asking for certain characters to be completely killed off. I am just saying it'll be nice to have some ""realism"" into the game.			"

												I borght this on the basis that other people said the previous resident evil games are good and that this one would be too.Well, may be it is good is like having next to no control over your character, a charcter that has a aiming set up that is desined to make you fail, a character that is so close to the players view point at times that you cant see, not to mention the nasty view angle and then if you couple that with a the game resrticting you in so many ways from the option to view your environment to having to let zombies that start upto 15ft away walk upto you before you can shoot or react to them.I dont know about other players but I feel I have just wasted money on this and if this is normal then I not be buying the next Resident Evil or any other, for me this game is fail. Maybe if i was willing to spend more time suffering and putting up with the way this game works I would maybe get used to it but im not going to if I have to suffer to play it then the developer have missed the point of playing as I feel i should be able to enjoy the game from the start not from half way through.I give this game the following points -8/10 for Graphics, the world looks awesome7/10 for Sound Track (what I did hear of it seamed good)3/10 for control of character, it so badly set up?/10 for story, not a clue because I could not play it long enough to enjoy or toget to know the story with out wanting to smashing up my PC.7/10 Rage FactorHope you enjoy this crap way more than I do!!!

												Avoid this game please. Resident Evil has detracted from the genre of survival horror, we all know that the moment we saw RE5. But this? My goodness, this is the biggest disappointment for me in 2013. I'll do my best to... uh, ""summarise"".Resident Evil 6 focuses too much on action. Capcom have also concentrated on ramming as many explosions, excessive Quick-Time-Events and railroad gameplay into your face that it's horrible. The storyline: Capcom's ""interweaving character plotline mechanics"" falls flat on it's face. New and old faces return but nothing is developed, heck all of RE6 happens because some Scientist couldn't bang Ada Wong so he makes a clone of her. Oh I'm sorry, did I spoil it? Why do you care? I've played RE since the first cheesy one on PS1 but I have to admit that this game is an absolute shame.Do not buy. Dead Space 3 is better. Resident Evil 5, for it being another action game, is better!Shinji Mikami, the creator of Resident Evil, is making a game called Evil Within. Give him your money. He is the father of RE and the master of survival horror. He deserves your cash. Not Crapcom.			"

There is no telling how much damage this game may cause to you or your loved ones when you are forced to play certain unpassible sequences in the game over and over with no hope of sucess and are rapidly filled with the uncontrollable urge to punch a baby seal.If you are not a hard core fan of the Resident Evil series, avoid this game like the plauge.

												Persistance frustrante.Le numéro 6 de la célèbre série suit très bien les traces de ses prédécesseurs tant pour l'histoire que pour ses vidéos léchés. Les graphiques en jeu sont aussi dans les standards auxquels Capcom nous a habitués au fil des ans.Le bas est au niveau de la jouabilité. Depuis le 4e jeu, les aspects horreur et survie ont été relayés à l'arrière plan au profit de l'action.  Si cette action était bien gérée dans le 4e et 5e, elle est tout simplement ridicule dans le 6e.

												Quite possible the single worst game I have ever played.  Quick Time Events in tandem with pass/fail checks result in 30, 40 and 50+ deaths that require replaying through the entire event over and over.  CAPCOM showcases complete ineptitude with this game and deserve to have their developers flogged publicly for ever releasing this piece of garbage.  Loose, floaty camereas that change your perspective and make you run into tons of invisible walls.  Mind numbingly boring.  0/100.			"

												This game is complete trash, the mercenaries is about the only thing that is good about it. Agent Hunt is just an excuse to ruin someone else's singleplayer game. Multiplayer is dead, and the story is not even close to mediocre at best. This is a game that wasn't even built for the diehard fans, it slaps the entire franchise in the face, with its design choices, single player story, campaigns, and somehow worse AI than RE5. I stomached my way through three campaigns, but could not get through Ada's, simply because the game throws quick time events, constant crap, and frankenstein controls at you, at a rate that a computer would have a hard time accomplishing. Out of all the campaigns, most of the setpieces fall apart, sequences where you get chased auto fail, bugs stop a one hour mission, AI incompetence kills a few more, and all that aside, you end up having to play a few missions in their entirety more than once because the game was designed for two people, but you like your friends too much to force this one on them. ORC had a lot of things wrong, but it wasn't so bad it couldn't be playable with a friend, this one is so bad you feel ashamed to ask a mate to join you. Absolutely one of the worst purchases I've ever made since switching to PC, and I bought Arkham Knight at launch, this game is marred not by technical issues, but by every designer that added something to this game and wasn't gunned down at Capcom for even suggesting it. This is not a game for anyone that enjoys well-built or even enjoyable games, and even a masochist would have a hard time getting a stiffy through a single playthrough. It wouldn't be beyond belief to imagine Capcom execs sitting around a room discussing everything they've gotten right so far and deciding to 86 all those ideas. Remember somewhat competent AI in RE0? ♥♥♥♥ that. How about a cheesy story with some kind of conspiracy that doesn't take itself too seriously? nope. People really seemed to like RE4, since it blended survival horror and action almost perfectly... but Michael Bay wants to give us a discount. If we had a small scale nuke to destroy anything on the planet, I would wait until time travel was invented and launch it directly into the RE6 development studio mid-development. This game is so bad it singlehandedly destroyed any credibility that the RE franchise had left when it released, and every move they've made since has been a desparate attempt to win back the hearts of fans. It is so bad it makes me question my loyalty to the franchise, and that is the absolutely worst thing you could do, when Silent Hill died in the hands of Konami, this was basically a stillbirth.			"

												This is not a recommendation, exactly. No, sirree. It's a bit of a warning. I've played almost all the other iterations of the Resident Evil series (and enjoyed them), but this one is simply punishing. And that makes it largely un-fun at times. I'm not implying that the controls, or the game itself, are broken - in fact, the dialogue, the characters, the cutscenes, and production/creature design, are quite good. Those aspects I enjoy. It's more like the game simply isn't sure what it wants to be (action, thriller, horror, shooter, co-op, stealth, etc.), and in so doing, tries to shoehorn a little bit of everything. And doesn't do any of that particularly well. It's the age-old issue of quantity over quality. Personally, I find that all that variation really disrupts the tone of the game, which is supposedly survival horror with action elements.There are many lethal cutscene QTEs, and a plethora of ""races"" away from insta-kill threats. In some cases, you get both - over and over again in a single event. And more often than not, the events themselves are too long - making it difficult to complete without making some critical mistake. After which, you have the option of continuing from checkpoints - which penalizes you in the in-game report-card-style ranking system at the end of each level.It's also not helped by an AI ally system that is, at best, occasionally helpful/useful.It's a 50/50 shot, that in the midst of a minor scuffle, he/she will be able to save/help you. And it's much more likely the AI will be haplessly fighting something else (or off-screen, making a sandwich) while you're getting curb-stomped by enemies. I'd liken the gaming experience to feeling more like studying for an important exam, frustratingly trying to memorize where to be and where to go, just to pass. It's less suspense from horror and environment, and more suspense from not wanting to die and do the level over.As a fan of the franchise, I'll continue to try and power through this game, but for the most part I'm somewhat disappointed in the turn the franchise has taken.

												if you like tag teaming of RE5 (off and online), you will love this. I have only played 2 chapters of leon kennedy and I am knee deep into the game. This game really gives you a sense of accomplishment when you get to save points in the game. BTW, if you buy the game and wonder what's going on, it's a game prelude. Something not many games do in terms of story.edit: when you go into late portions of the chris redfield campaign, there is a part where the camera goes into classic alone in the dark mode where you are fleeing from a 100 foot tall BOW up ramps and over obstacles. The part I have is when your character goes off camera and since it's a scripted and timing event, one slip up and your toast. Well, I couldn't complete the campaign because of the poor camera angle at one point during the run.Also, the same thing happens when you are on a ski doo trying to outrun a avalanche in the jake muller campaign. There is a part where your you have to angle jump from one area to another and the camera angle doesn't work in the sense you don't have the proper perspective to make the jump without gettting caught in the avalanche.

If you got a friend to play the mercenary mode and also Leons Story is not terrible and probably the strongest of the 3 you can play.

												Persistance frustrante.Le numéro 6 de la célèbre série suit très bien les traces de ses prédécesseurs tant pour l'histoire que pour ses vidéos léchés. Les graphiques en jeu sont aussi dans les standards auxquels Capcom nous a habitués au fil des ans.Le bas est au niveau de la jouabilité. Depuis le 4e jeu, les aspects horreur et survie ont été relayés à l'arrière plan au profit de l'action.  Si cette action était bien gérée dans le 4e et 5e, elle est tout simplement ridicule dans le 6e. Les actions sont imprécises, le nouveau ""recoil"" des armes rend leur utilisation pénible, les boutons d'actions apparaissent souvent lorsque le temps alloué pour les utiliser est déjà en parti écoulé et les angles de caméra, surtout lors des scènes animées, rend certaines parties du jeu frustrantes, voir enrageantes.

												I enjoy this Resident Evil very much. Instead of bulky movement and being still during combat, it's a lot more free and you have the option to move while you aim. The story is very compelling and the characters grow on you if you don't have a favorite already. If you're looking for horror, then you'll like Leon's Story (for horror try: The Evil Within). But for everything else. It's mostly a thrill which I enjoy both. You can't spell excitement without running and smashing the correct sequence buttons to save your life.			"

												I was actually struggling whether to give thumbs up or down as the game has its good parts and I enjoyed it, from time to time, but overall it is not worth playing unless you're a RE completionist.The simple good and bad...The good:* This is Resident Evil, in all its cheesy glory with nasty creatures, nastier bosses, and even some of your basic zombies.* The game is quite long and it's actually a 4-in-1 as you get 4 different campaigns with Leon's one being the closest to classic RE (and the rest being closer to GoW or generic tpp shooters).* When everything is working correctly it can be a fun experience with running, shooting, dodging and blowing heads clean off (does not sound like your normal RE game, does it).* You can walk and shoot, it is still a big deal :)* The gfx, when it's bright enough for you to actually see something.The bad:* Respawning enemies. I hate respawning enemies.* Difficulty. I started on Normal and after finishing the first chapter wanted to throw my PC out of the window. That's how frustrating it was. Constantly respawning enemies, dodging bullets like Neo in The Matrix when I had at most 20 ammo. Not to mention healing herbs are scarce. I switched to Amateur to avoid frustration and everything was dropping left and right after I sneezed in the general direction... Sigh... And don't even let me start on the QTEs. Some of them require not reflex but precognition.* The gfx, it's dark and dark and dark and you can't see sh*t because it's that dark. Other than that it's quite nice.* Unskippable animations.* Bad menus with no in-game pause.If you like the RE universe and/or shooting mutated zombie monsters in the head then you might want to grab this when it's 75% off, otherwise I would not bother.

												RE 6 is definitely a fantastic game! I have played the original RE, RE code Veronica, RE 0, RE 4, 5 and now 6 and I have to say, this is for sure one of my favorites. I know that a lot of people are saying that the franchise has changed from the original and it sure has, but that does not mean that it's not a dark and RE game. The graphics are beautiful, the atmosphere is great, and the shooting keeps getting better! and yes, there is less ammo in this game. This is very similar to RE 4 but with a little more action but still great story. For those who say this is not a RE game, please understand that the creators have clearly changed their perspective, and that although the crazy camera angles were fun for their time, a third person scary shooter is also fantastic. All I'm saying is, be open to change :)**UPDATE** yes this game is too much fun!! It took me 57 hours to finally beat all 4 campaigns!!! Very good game!! You will like it!! Now quit reading reviews and go out and buy it!Now, to be fair,  RE 5 is the only one that I truly did not like. I tried it but still sucked :(			"

												I ragequit this game pretty hard and here are some reasons why. The ""blocky"" and very scripted gameplay leave a lot to be desired. Combat is not very intuitive and the controls are an absolute travesty. Definitely one meant to be played on console. Why Capcom, why?			"

												This game can best be described in two words; frustrating and tedious. I really wanted to at least finish the 4 campaigns but had to stop for fear of breaking my keyboard. There are so, so many things wrong with this game and so very few things right. I am a long time fan of the series. I played the very first RE on PS1. To date I have played and finished RE1,2,3 CV:X, 4,5 and Revelations so I know the series well.  All of them have been frustrating at times. It is part of what makes difficult games rewarding. A sense of achievement for having solved a challenging puzzle or defeated a tough boss. Unfortunately that sense of satisfaction is utterly absent in RE6. ""Yes! I finally did it!"" has been replaced with ""Thank f that's out of the way."" There is so much I feel I want to say about this game that this review will consist of a brief pros and cons followed by more detailed reasoning should anyone wish to understand my views. Additionally I will provide clear spoilers further down so if you do not wish to see them please stop after the warning.Pros:The characters look good.The voice acting will be familiar.There are a few atmospheric areas.Sherry Birkin! (RE2 is still the best of the series imho so nice to see her return)The general presentation is solid.Some of the set piece sequences were fun and well scripted.Cons:The controls feel sluggish and awkward. Also a 1:1 transposition of controller to mouse and keyboard rarely ends well.The cinematic camera often leads to incredibly jarring perspective shifts.The story is incredibly boring. The game contains characters I love and yet in this game I do not care about any of them in the slightest. The characters are never adequately fleshed out. There are a number of new characters introduced with the bare-minimum of back story and we are just expected to care what happens to them. I didn't.The interconnecting storylines should be interesting and add a new dimension to the game and yet everything feels shoehorned together just for the sake of a game mechanic.""Why are we doing this?"" ""Because COD"" So much of the game feels like it is copying elements from the Call of Duty franchise which is so unimaginably stupid for an RE title. ""MORE SPLOSHUNS!!!!!111one1!"" ""WHY?"" ""BECAUSE COD!!!!!!"" It is frankly mornonic in the extreme.The locations quickly become boring. The lighting is atrocious. Dark and atmospheric are not synonymous. There are exceptions in this game but precious few.The enemy design has become ludicrous to the point that they are not frightening or horifying they are now simply irritating.The bosses. Not because of the mechanics themselves, but how the game uses them. Get used to saying ""Again, really? I so don't care anymore.""The music is intrusive to the point I turned it off.No interesting villains.The pacing is non existent. It starts off being incredibly promising. The opening to the first scenario is very well done but before long it ramps everything up to 11 and just leaves it there. FOREVER.In summary, I spent a great deal of my time in this game persisting with tedious sequence after tedious sequence in the hopes that at some point the game would improve, and it just never did. I struggled, literally, through three campaigns before finally having to stop early in the fourth after yet another pointless ""chase"" sequence killed me without me being able to comprehend what I had done wrong. And this is my biggest complaint. These sequences are so frequent that they quickly become just another annoyance to be overcome in order to progress the story. The first sequence was mildly irritating due to the shoddy controls but after a half dozen or so I was ready to throw something. They are that aggravating. I have not been so angry at a game mechanic in a long while. And I have 100 hours or so played in Dark Souls. For fans of the series, I was not truly dissapointed by this game because I simply hate it too much to feel anything else.From this point onwards expect spoilers. You have been warned.Leon's campaign starts well, walking around in a creepy darkened mansion-like building. I was very encouraged early on. The pace slowly ramps up as you progress towards a finale of sorts but once the action reaches a peak it more or less stays there for the rest of the campaign. There is seemingly nothing to the game except for a seris of action sequences loosely connected byt cutscenes that tell you nothing of interest. The same tired plot points are recycled over and over. The same sequences are recycled over and over. You may as well play the first campaign and then watch the rest of the cutscenes somewhere. Even most of them are recycled from campaign to campaign. There is maybe 3-4 hours of total storytelling in this game. The rest is shooting stuff, running away from stuff or getting blown off something by an explosion and being separated from your partner for 5 minutes. There is NOTHING in this game that another game in the series has not done better. And by better I mean if you have played all the games I listed at the beginning you will get nothing new out of this game at all. The story is truly that weak. You just won't care, I promise.Examples;Once Leon and Helena escape the campus they go through various areas killing zombies, and wind up at a cathedral. Up to this point I was enjoying the game. The pacing seemed reasonable and I was expecting at this point to have arrived at the first major location in the game involving exploration, puzzles, secrets and whatnot. Instead what I got was about 10 minutes of trivial puzzles. And so the game progresses in that fashion til the end. And this is where it really begins to suck HARD. You fight a boss and kill it. You then kill stuff for ten minutes and the boss is back. Then you kill things and it comes back. Again and again you fight the same boss with slightly different patterns with seemingly nothing of consequence happening in between. It is just. Plain. BORING. It really just becomes a game of Call of Duty with ""zombies"". You get to a room with cover and stuff tries to kill you for 5 minutes or so. You clear that room, go through a corridor and there is another room with stuff to kill. The decor changes but the enemies are the same and the gameplay never elevates beyond this point. In fact it gets worse. The chase sequences.I had similar doubts about RE5 in truth. But comparing the two there are some critical differences; in RE5 the sequences tend to be mercifully short and they don't rely on a horribly broken control system. The running ahead of a falling floor is achieved in RE5 in a simple and elegent fashion. In RE6 it is painful. You have to manually control you character as you escape a falling floor (notably Chris and Piers on the river in China) but the controls simply do not work properly. I died multiple times due to my character randomly turning 180 and jumping back the way he came. And this happened every time. Irritating, tedious, repetetive. I enjoy challenging. I hate broken.RE4, RE5 and Revelations all have similar gameplay but with more interesting villains and far more engaging stories as well as infinitely superior progression systems.There are AI problems with enemies and partners, level glitches with animations and trigger points and so much more but I have no more space. This game feels unfinished. It is a shameless cash-in with no heart in it. Glad I only payed £5 for it and not £40.			"

												I strted playing this thing and thinking, ""This isn't great but it isn't terrible. I don't know why people hate on this game so much."" I played for about three hours and when I went back the save point was about two hours prior to where I stopped. I guess I'll never be playing this again. Don't waste ten bucks. And it really is on rails more than any other resident evil game.			"

												First of all, this is not a resident evil game, its an all-out action game that dares to use the RE logo. Even as an action 3rd person shooter it fail to deliver any substance with its shallow story and bad ""acting"". If you want to play the real resident evil 6 buy the awesome resident evil revelations and a permanent marker and just add the number 6 on the box.			"

												If you are like me who started resident evil along time ago when shinji mikami was working with capcom, you will understand that this game completely derails off the series. This game is nothing but a hollywood blockbuster knock off, capcom is like an old dog that needs to be put out of their misery. Instead of just milking the series scoffing and ignoring the core fans, they should either reboot the game or atleast make another resident evil that follows their main foundation of the series and I believe it is ""Resident evil 1 remake"". Oh did I mention that they should just rename this game to ""Resident Evil: Identity Crisis""? Now that is horrific!!!			"

												PLEASE READ THE WHOLE REVIEW TO UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE RATING PLEASE.Once again, as referenced in other reviews, I am a huge RE fan.Resident Evil 6 was a major change in pace compared to other installments. The gameplay is more fast paced than in other games. The story to this one is also rather different than others as well. When getting down and dirty, this Resident Evil feels more like a shooter than a horror survival. You're running and gunning for the most part. Sure there are a few jump scares here and there however, you just don't get that same feel from this one.  I understand it was done in Resident Evil 4 and 5 however in this one, the zombies shooting at you becomes a little out of place and abnoxious. The AI in that is better than that of what should be in an actual shooter. If you're coming to RE6 to fill the missing void skip this one and go to Revalations.As for the controls and other mechanics of this game, everything is mapped terribly. You'll need to hold Shift and P at one point to avoid a train. The new inventory is fairly difficult to use in a rush and nothing is really explained to you, you're thrown right into the story. Hopefully you won't have to leave to take a dump as you can't pause at all either. Mercenaries makes a return and this is where the fast paced mechanics of this installment shine. With the ""No Mercy"" edition added to this installment, there are hordes and hordes of zombies making the fast paced gameplay exteremely enjoyable. Also just the fact that there's a crossover between this world and Left 4 Dead is outstanding. Being that I did not feel the same vibe I have from other installments, this RE will be getting a negative review from me. However that just me, I like the emersed stories they usually have and enjoy the twists and turns. If you like games like Assassin's Creed, Mirror's Edge, and Splinter Cell Conviction, the gameplay feels a little similar.			"

												!!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!This game is nothing like any of the RE games. I'm going to say this as nice as possbile.The controls are crap. The automatic cover system is clunky and it gets constantly in the way, The dialogues and story telling is totally♥♥♥♥♥♥not coherent at all. One minute you are in China and the next you are  halfway around the world. You jump from area to area like mario warps with the pipes. The infected are more skilled then any pilot because the fly tiger choppers between buildings as if was a fly.There are plenty of reviews that get more in depth but a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game like this is just not worth it. not even 1 dollar or a euro. Buy some bubblegum instead, a bubblegum will give at least some pleasure.			"

												I guess I didn't dislike this game too much, but please refrain from paying too much for it.  Others have said it, and so will I;  A ""neutral"" recommendation is needed for reviews.There have been many complaints, and many are justified.  I did expect some horror, but it was mostly just guys with guns wearing kibuki make-up and monsters that kept coming back--that got rather tiresome.  Although, I think, the best monster was the last mutation of Heer Simmons.  That fight was pretty good (once I fgured out how to kill it after two deaths :-).  I just didn't see that damn lightning rod on the ground after the monster's first use of it  heheh.Anyway, I got sick of the cutscenes mostly.  Everytime I got a bead on some schmuck--there was a cutscene!  Also, did anyone else notice that the mosters recover from attacks during cutscenes?  Maybe I was seeing things, but I swear this happened three times.Next was the amount of QTE's.  Some were good, but others seemed like they were put in there because the designers couldn't think of something else.  And after a while my sighs became more and more audible each time a QTE popped up (SIGH).The inventory system was truly horrid.  And a battlefield unit like Chris's should have a supply system to bring them ammo, I mean, if common sense prevailed, but it doesn't in RE6.  That's ok.  No one expects to have ammo handed to them; however, it would make me feel special to FIND some now and again.  It was nice to see my favorite old zombie slayers, but I cannot remember once feeling that sense of fright as in the old games.  Maybe I'm just jaded or perhaps my expectations were too high, and the game didn't deliver (like Return of the Jedi back in '85).I did like the Ada adventure mostly because it filled in some story gaps (but my daughter and I did a pretty good job at surmising what happened).  Ada's cockiness does get a little annoying; it was good to see Leon save her highness' hash.  But upright Leon's fascination for her seems to get more confusing the more he and we learn about her.I'm getting off track.  This isn't a bad game, but it isn't a good one either.  I gave it a down simply to give fellow gamers fair warning.Good gaming, everyone!			"

I'm not a huge fan of linear games anymore, but this game is particularly terrible at being linear and not giving any breathing room for improvision. Terrible controls, pretty bad weapon system, just an overall poorly written game and I will not go back to it, I am done with it, what a waste of $15.			"

												Resident Evil one of my most favorite series.RE6 is the worst RE game i have ever played. I´m playing campaign as a single player.And so far I have managed to force my self to play through Leon´s story and few chapters of Chris´s story.+Well it is a Resident Evil game!  If you are fan of the series like me naturally you would  not like to miss anything from the story. +Keep telling that to yourself.-Controls are idiotic and aiming with weapons is sometimes really frustrating. This goes to both xbox controller and keyboard +mouse combo.-Annoyingly timed cutscenes that stop you  from doing what ever you were trying to do,  but ofcourse monsters can keep moving and  punching you in the face while you can only watch.-Puzzles are pretty much gone. There are some, but nothing that would require you to actually use your brains.---AI of your partner: If your partner is not stuck in somewhere when you are waiting it to help you open a door it is either shooting you in the back your running between you and the zombies like a completely r3t4rd. I do not know if this is any different when playing multi-player.-Nothing in this game is no longer scary.6/10 Feels like a cheap copy of a Resident Evil game.			"

												The Bad:Like being fustrated to the point of rage? Buy this game. It's controls are some of the worst I've ever seen. Enemies designed to drive you to the point of actual violence with QTE attacks that can interupt anything you do. Awful partner AI that hinders progress to the point it will actually kill you (Cathedral cluster♥♥♥♥ with the Church doors and the endlessly respawning enemies comes to mind) A pointless inventory system that can also kill you as you struggle to put healing items into a ""Case"" as if inventory management meant anything anymore, hell you can't even pause the game during a session, this is not Dark Souls, because if it was it would actually be rewarding. Backgrounds are dull and cliched with no dept to them whatsoever, your dragged from one set piece to another and expected to be wowed by the Hollywood action vibe of it as your bombarded with yet more QTE's. It runs well enough but my god are some of the textures awful low res, they would look lacklustre in RE4, this creates a weird contrast between the generally good character models and the background, a side effect of a badly designed port.It's as if they got all the worst traits of the last 2 ""over the shoulder"" action Resident Evil games and jacked them up to 11, no lessons learned at all, but hey ♥♥♥♥ it right? It makes the money. And I spent as little as I could to buy this, so I had an idea of what I was getting into. If I could compare it to anything, I'd say this is Resident Evil's FEAR 3. Total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The Good:It's Resident Evil (Just about). You can suplex and bodyslam Zombies, which is as ridiculous as it is fun. Chris is essentially John Cena at this point anyway. If it's on sale for less then a tenner you could do worse.			"

												I really played this game A LOT but that's surely isn't because the game is amazing.It is definitely NOT amazing, this one too (just like Resident Evil 5) is going to a be a lot of fun IF you want to play online with friends (just as I did, multiple friends multiple times) BUT 2/3 of this game COMPLETELY take away the survival part going for an Hollywood (crappy and full of cliché) action movie feel.Leon's campaign has its good (very few) moments when you actually feel you could probably be playing a weird Resident Evil game (but a Resident Evil nonetheless) but other then those few moments it really feels like an awful game. It gets boring very soon and I can't even think of playing it alone (The Kingdom of Boredom).Characters once again feels like are action movie heroes capable of superhuman things and you can almost predict everything that's going to happen (gives you no surprise nor excitement to keep playing).Altough I actually prefer this over Resident Evil 5 (but realize that is like preferring handling manure over pee) I still can't recommend this...Capcom has to realize they have to take a step back and track its roots to make a good Resident Evil game as they once did.You want to play this game in coop with a friend regardless of what it is supposed to be? You'll share some laughs and you're probably going to have fun.You want to play this game because you love the survival horror genre? Buy the Resident Evil Remaster HD instead and save your money on this one, you won't regret it.(and Capcom may even understand what games we actually want from them)			"

												Do not buy this game for anything other than co-op. Do not buy it as a horror game because it really has none apart from the game design. Do not buy it as a 3rd person shooter because it has some of the most counter-intuitive 3rd person combat systems I have come across. Do not buy it for its story as it is just overblown tripe full of unlikeable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.If you do buy it bring a co-op partner to help you put up with/ endure:- non-stop unskippable cutscenes that a) serve no purpose or b) you have watched a dozen times already due to stupid checkpointing.- a camera and control scheme that actively fight the player in way too many situations. Context sensitive everything, confusing button combinations leading to gymnastics when you mean to fire etc.- linear levels that still manage to be confusing and disorientating. Entire sections can be hold sprint and run in a direction but you die because you fail to run at a wooden box at just the right angle and have to start the whole section again.- arbitrary game rules. Weapons do no damage to bosses because you haven't killed the bosses current swarm of minions or some other bs reason but one section later you can then damage them.The game does have sections where it clicks and things work well but I cannot recommend this game as it such a struggle to reach these parts.

												Updating review as I go.EDIT: And today on Leon Logic!WHY IS THERE A STUMBLE MECHANIC. I AM NOT PLAYING SMASH BROS WII. HE JUST SHOT AT YOU WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE, WHY NOT PICK IT UP. CORPSE LYING THERE? BETTER JUST WALK PAST AND HOPE IT'S NOT ALIVE.I mean seriously you've seen all the zombie tricks twice already Leon.UI is a complete mess. There is a semblance of effort in a PC port, as some menus, such as the inventory, allow you to click to select. However, these menus are obviously built for key inputs, so why can't I do that as well? And for menu prompts, why do I have to press enter instead of clicking yes? The lack of consistency is minor but incredibly frustrating after it continues to happen.Writing is bad, much worse than I expected. ""We should get moving."" ""What, not a fan of sewers?"" No, I'm not a fan of doddling around and waiting for zombies to eat me MISTER KENNEDY. And if the president has black skin, drooling lips, and a blank stare, slowly shuffling towards you while ignoring your pleas, why would you even hesitate to shoot him? Seems pretty stupid to wait until he's about to nibble your partners giblets.It's a shame that the pacing and writing are so bad, because there were little snippets of great emotion, like when Helena's eyes widen in fear, or the man chokes up when his daughter dies. YOu pause and say, ""Wow, that was a great spot of emotion,"" then you're right back to trading paint with a train in a helicopter and all your empathy instantly disappears as the game fades back into unrealistic absurdity.Mechanics have somehow gone completely backwards, as you can't even reliably stun rushing zombies with a pistol headshot. Remember how they stumbled back in RE4, or fell when you shot the kneecap? These zombies DGAF and can tank more than five pistol rounds each without flinching, so good luck when the game places 5 zombies in front of you after a cutscene.Did you want to heal? Great! We've got herbs again, but you have to move them to your herb-only inventory before you can use them. Oh, then you have to press another button to use them. Oh, and if you wanted to heal fully, don't worry, you just have to press the heal button, wait for the animation, and do that again 5-6 times.I'm not finished yet, but so far, you should probably just buy RE4 again.EDIT: So I've been testing the stun hits. Both headshots and limb shots do not reliably stun. If zombies are in an animation, they ignore any chance to stun. This includes: already stumbling from stun, transitioning from idle to aggro, transitioning from aggro to attacking you, standing up, sidestepping, and more. They have to finish the animation before you can stun them. Sloppy, un-fun mechanics.EDIT: CQC is still strong. You can kick combo enemies and kill isolated zoms in a couple hits. But don't worry, they ruined this too! Now you have stamina so you get tired and slow after dealing with a couple zombies. Artificially induced difficulty that's especially annoying when you're low on ammo.EDIT: Enemies with unique items are fun. If they have an ax or bottle you get a unique CQC finisher. If they're carrying a fire extinguisher, shoot it for a bang.EDIT: They tried way too hard to push this as a co-op experience. If I'm playing offline, why do I need to have my partner with me to advance? Why doesn't the pause menu actually pause? If you want to fiddle with graphics or controls, find a quiet spot because zombies don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about your PDA menu. Oh hey Helena, I need some help with these zombi-oh you just ran past them to the end of the level? You're just gonna wait for me there? Thanks a bunch.EDIT: Who in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ world pushed this horrible roll/dodge system. Just give me a directional dodge key like spacebar instead of taking up 6 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keybinds. This forces default crouch to 2, heal to 1, mix herbs to H and shoulder switch to caps lock. Ridiculously inconvenient.EDIT: So today I shot a zombie in midair, blowing its head off. But guess what? Headless zombies can still bite your neck and kill you.			"

												Dear God, I hated this game.  Resident Evil officially sucks now.  Zero puzzle solving elements, boring charcters, and the plot is so over the top now that it's beyond comprehension.  The only (mildly) good part was the early stages of Leon going through the city in sort of a 3rd person version of RE2, but that was it.  The QT parts of Chris Redfield's section made me want to punch my monitor.  Capcom, you need to quit making these games.			"

												First off I would like to say that I very much enjoyed this game on my PS4. I bought this as part of a ""every resident evil"" bundle, because why not right?This is probably one of the worst ports of a game I have ever seen in my life. The controls are absolutely abysmal in every imaginable way. They somehow managed to take something that needed MAYBE four buttons, excluding the directional keys, and make it an exercise in keyboard gymnastics.So many keys that could have just been combined into a single damn key that were, for reasons only the most demented, drug addled soul could decypher, were split onto two or three keys in the case of ""Pick up / open door / action"". You know, they key that the FPS genre figured out 20 years ago could just be bound to E.If you get this game free as part of a cheap bundle, then fine, but don't waste your money buying this game on it's own. Do yourself a favor and just go by the console version.			"

												I beat this on console few years ago. I've basically converted to PC gaming and I -love- Resident Evil and I have RE5 on steam. Love the game, the controls are easy. This game however, makes no sense. The action combos make no sense and there's no direction as to what buttons you're supposed to hit in combination with the space bar. I attemped it 5x in a row. Can't figure it out. You can't even change the controls in the settings so it's just a simple hit ""E"" or ""Space"" in a quick action scene. Not to mention, I hit several check points and had to start the game completely over despite the auto save. This game is best kept for console/controller gaming. I'm very disapointed.			"

												RE1 had hilarious voice acting, and clunky controls.  A strange first attempt on PS1.RE2 had mildly funny voice acting, and introduced auto-aim, which made the controls fine.  (But sure, why not whine about controls that you can't learn for some reason?)RE3 introduced dodging, which made it even better.RE4 was weird and just as frustrating to play as the old games. However, it let you aim accurately at someone's head... and still have to take 8 shots to make their head explode. (Until you get to upgrade weapons, SORT OF.)  It also took out basically everything that made the games ""survival horror"".RE5 just got even more clunky and frustrating, introduced CO-OP and more annoying quicktime events mid-battle.  And included some of the dumbest boss battles and shootout scenes so far.  Oh, and give the zombies miniguns, why not?RE6 basically took the frustrating parts of RE5, and made a whole game out of it, instead of just occasional annoying scenes.I keep trying to play this game and then just give up.  It's so ridiculously chaotic, making it impossible or too easy.			"

												Big fan of the series since the beginning, and never have I liked a Resident Evil game so little. The combat is inconsistent, and firearms feel ineffectual and useless against enemies. The majority of the damage you take is from unavoidable ""surprise"" events, reducing any feeling of accomplishment or control. The game is packed with quick-time events as well, and they are poorly integrated into the flow of the action. I did not have the feeling that my actions or skill level, good or bad, actually had anything to do with the progression of the game. Death is hardly a failure, as dying actually gets you some life back and and a refill of ammo. When it takes between 3 and 10 shots to the head at close range to kill a standard zombie on standard difficulty, you are going to run out of ammo. I defaulted to running around zombies and using melee attacks against them, which feels clunky and unsatisfying. Buy this if you are a hardcore fan looking to continue the series. The story is not bad, the gameplay is poor and unsatisfying. Many other modern games have taken the old RE formula and done it better (Evil Within, Dead Space and Alan Wake come to mind).			"

												What a load of unmitigated garbage.  The storyline is good, but the gameplay is utterly atrocious - from the major irritations like camera angles being swapped causing control problems, to the tedious and over abundant quick time events (fail to press the button in time?  Oops, dead, reload, redo from start), to not being able to skip or exit scripted sequences (or credits for that matter) or even pause the game.  No logic in the controls, lots of pointless button mashing, no brain required.Console tripe.  Might have made an OK animated film, but frankly with some of the level of interaction required that's about all it is.			"

												Glad I got this on a big sale.  So far, this game has little to do with any sort of gaming skills you may or may not have.  Its all about hitting the keys that the game tells you to hit at exactly the moment it tells you to hit them.  In other words, you dont die because you got overwhelmed by mobs or made a bad tactical decision, you died because it was your first play through of a certain scene and you didnt know which keys the game was going to ask you to hit. Once you do know which key needs to be hit and when, your next play through is a breeze.  In still other words, the game relies on your lack of knowledge about what to do next to make itself difficult.  That kind of ""difficulty"" doesnt count as being difficult to me.  I mean, seriously!  If a game is only difficult during your first play through and a breeze every other time that you play it, what does that say?  RE 6 is also very linear and feels cramped and the charectors move like they are slogging through peanut butter.  Other than that, RE 6 is beautiful graphically and the story is fun to follow.  Ill probably keep playing it to follow the story but the game play is just plain silly.  For example, I play a scene and die because I didnt know the game was going to demand that I hit V or R or space or whatever at exactly a certain point.  So, I restart the scene and now I know when Im going to have to hit the V or R or Space or whatever so this time I do and I dont die.  If you like that kind of game play then more power to you.  I prefer something a little more challenging and something that I actually have a little more control over.   Is this game worth the price that I paid for it($7.50)?  Sure but I wouldnt advise that anyone pay any more than that-unless you like the kind of game play that I described.  Ill probably get a bunch of angry kids hating on this review but that will be fun too lol!			"

												После противоречивой, на мой взгляд, 5-ой части, Capcom попытались угодить всем игрокам и охватить побольше аудитории совместив хоррор с экшеном, добавив кооп. Понятное дело экшн выиграл с огромным противовесом. Хотя бы по одной из причин что игрока будет сопровождать напарник, и слава богу не такой тупой бот, как это было в предидущем выпуске. Однако игра заточена под совместное прохождение, что крайне рекомендутся. И как бы сильно 6-ой выпуск не утратил свой жанр, дух Раккун-Сити будет о себе напоминать. Все же смело можно заявить что большая доля запланированного исполнилась. 6-ой Обитель зла, с оглядкой назад, оказался просто бешеным (в хорошем смысле). Пускай это не совсем то, что мы ждали. Однако игра подкупает всем остальным, что у нее есть, что и в праду удалось.Тут 3 компании, плюс одна бонусная, которые позволят полностью раскрыть сюжетную линию и взглянуть на нее с разных сторон. Соответственно 7 играбельных персонажей. Каждая компания по своему уникальна. Первая ориентирована на неспешный хоррор, вторая является чистокровным боевиком, ну а последние даже не поддаются чему то определенному - так много в них напихано. Разность так же в миссиях, в местах действия, в стилях рукопашного боя, оружия, да и вообще с каждой новой компанией меняется характер игры. Все это на фоне кинематографичного экшена, который так и хлещет со всех щелей. В Resident Evil 6 весьма интересные и увлекательные миссии с задачами, решения которых во многом будет зависить от взаимодействия с напарником. И подобраны такие моменты и впрямь не дурно.Еще шестая часть примечательна наличием дополнительного контента в который входят несколько режимов. Небезисвестная режим на очки ""Наемники"" в котором теперь еще можно играть персонажами из знаменитой Left 4 Dead 2! Дебютировал еще один интересный режим - ""Охота на агентов"", в ней можно подключиться к игре других геймеров в качестве монстра. В ообщем после прохождения есть стимул задержаться в Resident Evil.Новая часть оказалась все таки крутой, получилась очень хорошая игра привлекательной разнообразием во всем, с очень приятной графикой, и сюжетом.На этом пожалуй все... Играйте в хорошие игры.			"

												Wow this game is terrible when compared to the previous entries in the series. More quick time events have been placed. The camera angle is forced sometimes which in and of its self isn't the end of the world except for when the game completly stops you from seeing forward to force you to look at something like oh I don't know a random door. No more gun upgrade system it's instead replaced with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ buying skill system. (once you buy the few you want there isn't anything else you need to spend on). Very linear gameplay. No reason to really explore. No more interesting puzzles. Rocket launcher shots some times do loads of damage to you but other times only does one bar (when hit dead on or not). Enemies who shoot you will make you fall back for no reason. And god forbid you get me started on the stupid slide mechanic. Some times you will play the same part twice for example their is a part where you play Leon's campaign that you then replay the same exact part with Chris. Or even gamepley wise there is a collect the keys part that has the same exact enemy and idea in both. Final Verdict: Resident Evil 6: Micheal Bay edition.			"

My hours are low on steam, but on my PS3 I completed no hope on all missions, not even trying normal, hard. Going stright to No Hope was a great experience, and the other modes that come with the game are loads of fun as well! Not many people play it anymore, but when it first came out I had a super great time, people invading my game as a zombie, playing the multiplayer arena type games.

												It's an amazing co-op game, a good action game, but a rather mediocre Resident Evil game. It has all the elements, but the inventory management, the lack of actual puzzles and the incredibly linear level design make the game feel like it's following a trend, which is odd considering for a long time it was this very game franchise that was considered the trendsetter. RE1/2 gave us the horror survival genre, RE4 gave us the modern action game genre and RE5 has provided a golden example on how to do a story driven co-op game properly. Despite this though, 6 has quite a lot of things going for it, lots of variety and content, excellent TPS mechanics (melee + movement) and flashy capcom over-the-top style that can't ever get old really.

												Had a super long review.  Condensed it to this:Dead Space and Dead Space 2 are still better 3d person horror games than Resident Evil 6(and 5 for that matter).Capcom has had since 2008 to figure out what makes Dead Space just an overall fantastic experience - they still haven't figured it out.That said, RE6 should have been called ""Walk Alot with Quick Time Events Evil 6"".Oh, and even though it wasn't a great game - Operation Raccoon City still felt much more like a Resident Evil game that RE6.In the end, I'll still probably fork over $15 for RE7 when it releases and goes on sale just like I did for RE6. What can I say?  I am a masochist that eats up Capcom titles.			"

												TL;DR: This is a fun, cheesy co-op shooter, not a horror game. Make sure to play on No Hope with a co-op partner.Mandatory disclaimer: This is not Resident Evil 1, 2 nor 3. I'm OK with that, since I dont like broken controls, broken camera & broken puzzles. The love the original 3 get is 90% because of nostalgia, the remaining 10% is the love for the cheese those games had.I've played through this entire game on No Hope difficulty with a co-op partner, that is the only correct way to play this game, as it's far too easy otherwise & the AI partner is brain-dead. Just remember to spam dodge buttons after cutscenes, lest you get insta-gibbed.RE6/BH6 is fun, over the top action with a fair bit of cheese & interesting scenarios, but it's far from a horror game. This game is about the story, the characters & the action, which I feel it mostly delivers on, although you need to finish all 4 campaigns to get the full picture.Pros: (assumes you're playing on No Hope, the only difficulty option)+ Ammo presevation is important, if you miss more than 1 shot per 5 enemies you'll run out of ammo, as you should.+ A single regular enemy is a genuine threat if not taken seriously.+ You die in 1-3 hits.+ You want to stealth & avoid battles whenever available. (not because combat is bad, but because it's costly)+ It contains cheese & interesting scenarios.+ Decent weapon variety.+ Good enemy variety.+ Severely punishes incompitent behaviour.+ Approximately 30 hours of content split in 4 campaigns.Cons: (also assumes you're playing on No Hope, the only difficulty option)- You must hold the dodge keys to dodge, they're not instant, causing a delay & lowering the skill-cieling.- Enemies can shoot through eachother in order to hit you, so sometimes enemies you can't even see shoot you.- It contains quick time events.- Sometimes difficult to get co-op to run properly.- No item trading with co-op partner.- Getting insta-gibbed/grappled to death right after cutscenes.- You stagger like crazy every single time you're hit or you triggered a trigger.- Contains bad driving segments.- The worst aiming-style is on by default, you must change to laser-only yourself.- Some shared events from different campaigns (due to characters bumping into eachother).Others:+/- Easy but fun bosses.+/- Graphics & audio are acceptable.+/- There are 2 states between healthy & dead, one making you slower & melee useless & another one where you crawl.+/- Pointless passive skills system. (It's not in effect in No Hope, the only difficulty option.)+/- There are invisible (for you) duplicates of all items in the game, so both co-op partners get everything.+/- When in-game most menus are in the style of a phone, a poorly designed phone. It's immersive, but bad.			"

												Score: 5/10Be sure to stock up on canned food, weapons, medical supplies and gasoline as Resident Evil 6 satisfies the un-dead gamer horde but leaves more to be desired by the living.It’s 15 Years after the Arklay Mansion incident and the biggest project in Capcom’s history, Resident Evil 6, looks to carry on the elements of what began as a horror series. But instead it just proves that bigger isn’t always better. Despite delivering a game with four campaigns and loads of online features,Resident Evil 6 lacks the means to either scare you or impress you.At times it embraces its old school heritage, pitting its heroes against the un-dead horde, horrific creatures and rather farfetched –who-put-this-here-puzzles. The game is incredibly dark, tension is rife and yet it simultaneously tries to be the largest, most action packed entry in the history of the franchise. Every facet of Resident Evil 6 leans towards a western-style cinematic. Lengthy fire fights, driving sequences, falling sequences, crash sequences – I refer here to a particular incident involving a helicopter, bullet train and skyscraper – all of which result in something that is erratic and never sure of itself, delivering brilliance one moment and something far less spectacular the next. In short,Resident Evil 6 is begging to be a movie.Capcom promised bigger and we got bigger, although it may have exaggerated to the degree in which the four individual campaigns differed. Each campaign is seven to eight hours long and on top of that there is the familiar Mercenaries and new Agent Hunt Mode. In Agent Hunt, players are able to drop-in and out of online games, as either a zombie or other C-virus abomination – similar to that of Left 4 Dead-, in an attempt to hinder the progress of other players and ultimately force them to give it up, turn it off and go to bed, which is great fun until somebody does it to you.Rather than infuse characters and storylines along a singular campaign, the game separates them across four individual threads. This layered narrative, whilst new to the franchise, sometimes works against the game play. As the campaigns cross paths, the game forces players to replay sequences – some of which really ought to be played once- nothing is gained from this repetition, as plot revelations only come from cut scenes/ dialogue and not in-game action.Quick-time events are prominent to the point of distraction. The new cover-system is disappointing and really isn’t necessary at all –the only time I ever found myself using it was during the inane and equally pointless tutorial- and the skills mechanic is mundane. Not only are you limited to the most basic of upgrades but the game only allows you to equip up to three at once and rightly so because you won’t want to spend your points on more than three anyway.Resident Evil 6 offers vast improvements in terms of the cooperative game-play experience both on and offline. Resident Evil 5 was notorious for its empty-headed AI partner system but this time around, should you wish to play on your own, seek comfort in that the AI does a great job of knowing what to do and where to go, assisting you when necessary and not taking your resources. When playing with a friend, the game capitalises on some great ideas but struggles with the execution. Often you find yourself standing around with nothing to do, whilst your buddy works his way through a handful of enemies until they’re able to open a door or lower a ladder.Visually,Resident Evil 6 focuses on shadows and much darker, murky environments as opposed to Resident Evil 5’s sun-soaked African locales. The result is a Resident Evil experience players will be familiar with but the overall aesthetics leave you wondering why Capcom didn’t realise it sooner. The Unreal Engine 3 does little justice to Capcom’s flagship title and to be honest, there are a lot better looking games out there. Not to take anything away from Resident Evil 6, it’s just too similar to its predecessor to take any real preference.For most fans, the love of the franchise began with the first time you found a zombie crouched over Kenneth’s corpse in the Arklay mansion. Or the moment the Cerberus –zombie dogs- crashed through the windows. These are the signature moments that we remember. The love of the old Resident Evil came from these moments, these self-contained incidents of horror. But Resident Evil 6 does everything it can to abolish this trend. In a reversal of roles,Resident Evil 6 looks like it draws from its western blockbuster counterparts, Paul Anderson’s over-the-top action thrillers, rather than focusing on the fundamentals that made it great and led to the movies to begin with.Under any other name, Resident Evil 6 could be great. Breathe fresh air into a stifling and dull genre. Sadly, it just isn’t Resident Evil.			"

												As an avid fan of the series, at least of the main entries (1-6), this has to be the weakest one. It seems as Capcom tried to jump on the CoD bandwagon with this one. Also, it has been super casual-zied to the point where even a non-gamer could play. 2/10.			"

												i can't tell if this is a game or a movie.  No options at main menu to load a save game.  Was forced to watch the same into 3 times till i can adjust my video setting and can not bypass it.  Nothing worse then button press commands on a screen that take you out of the game. Nothing worse then these same commands that do nothing, its an illusion that the gamer has any control in some cutscene shots. ( (L) ) to move around - go any direction and you walk forward, don't touch it you walk forward, its more like they just advance the cutscene rather then actually teach you the commands.This game feels like your forced to watch a movie instead of playing a game. I can't even get into the game cause after exiting at a save point to readjust my screen brightness since it gives you zero options in game to doit.  I am either forced to replay the crappy tutorial cutscene intro or just move on to another game so i can't really get a good Gameing experience. cutscenes are ok, but forceing people to watch them over and over with no way to bypass is a massive fail. The Graphics look great, and i really wish i could get deeper into the game, but i can't waste time doing the same tutorial 4 times  in a row because the developers never thought to include a load option at the main menu. Press anykey, video setting, brightness, loading content skipping any savepoints or checkpoints reach - load new game - That was my experience..   Last time i checked in games like this a checkpoint or means you could quit and come back later and pick up were you left off: NOPE i was wrong and won't waste 30 min going back through all those stupid Cutscene intro again and again.

												What went wrong here? Well, everything.The gameplay, arguably the most important part of most if not any game, is broken. The camera, which was allegedly fixed shortly after the console release, is still broken. Basically, it jerks you around every time you are trying to do anything. When you are running, the camera pulls back and views everything from the low vantage point. Basically, it makes you NOT see your surroundings pretty well. When you try to melee someone, it pulls your forward and then in all different directions.Another thing, Dead Space 3 introduced the roll option. I barely used it and didn't like it much. DS2 worked perfectly fine without it. However, all you needed to do was use your WSAD keys along with the SPACE key to pick which way you wanted to roll. Pretty easy. Not in this game. If you want to roll left, click Z. If you want to roll right, click C. If you want to roll back, click X. If you want to roll/slide forward, click 2. Convenient, huh? Don't bother using it, because when you divert one of your fingers to try to roll left or right you will expose yourself to harm by not being able to use WSAD effectively because you only have 5 fingers.I also had to turn brightness all the way up. Why? Well, evidently folks at CAPCOM were creating this game for consoles without PC in mind. So when you are walking in a dark environment and looking straight you see that 'dark fog' slowly lifting up revealing everything (like in the good old days on PS1). THEN, all of a sudden you see a zombie 3 feet away that jumps you. WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?Should I mention there are re-spawning enemies in most areas? Should I mention how frustrating it is when you try to make a pathway for your partner but the enemies keep respawning behind you while your partner is running out of bullets since it takes good 10-15 to turn that wheel and lower the bridge? Hell, they also have respawning enemies on a falling airplane!Also, two people pushing a 20 ton rock boulder?Yeah, Count me out.One of the most annoying things in this game is the jumping zombies. Yeah, one second they are slowly walking towards you and another moment they are flying towards you with their arms open. Then they knock you down which is when you have to press WSAD keys all over the place to get them off. However, while doing so your health will STILL DRAIN. Oh, and another thing about health. This is how you heal. You first combine green and red herbs by pressing R in the small menu, when you figure out how to do that you have to look at the bottom right to see how many pills you have. The amount of pills = the amount of health bars. If you want to use it then click 1 three times. Yeah, I know, it's totally idiotic. Try to figure that out during battle. Better yet, try to figure out how to use the spray quickly. 4 hours into the game and I still had trouble healing myself quickly because the menus ARE CLUNKY AND BROKEN.There are so many other negatives in this games. The more I played it, the worse it got. I thought about RE5 and just how much more superior it was to this game. RE5 graphics were better for one thing and that was 5 years ago. RE5 had directx10, a semi-bearable story, better refined gameplay, cool environments, decent textures, worked out physics (shooting with a shotgun actually meant 3-4 zombies flying back), plenty of hidden treasures, etc. Each enemy required some kind of accuracy and finesse. In RE6 however you just punch zombies to death, and even THAT doesn't always work. If you have one health left your punches don't mean a thing and your screen flashes constantly with the white and red vomit inducing in-nauseating glow. And when you or your partner gets knocked down your screen flashes for 2 seconds with white and red so that you can't see anything. THEN, right after that you try to figure out who exactly got knocked down, your partner or you? I KID YOU NOT.Btw. why does Ada Wong look Caucasian? She definitely did a nose job. Perhaps Capcom was hoping to attract more Western players or something?Oh, did I also mention that cutscenes during boss battles don't leave you immune from small enemies? Yeah. Let's say you are fighting a boss and then they show a mid-battle cutscene, you WILL get hurt by a nearby zombie during that time.One of the mistakes they made is give you the ability to punch, kick and kick in mid air after running (Like in Double Dragon). Which is a yet another insult to the series. Another mistake is giving you the ability to punch ANYTIME you want, and not just when there is a dazzled foe in front of you. So you may just end up spamming the punch button all over the place until you basically clubber the zombie into the oblivion. If you do a finishing move and there is a zombie that's swinging a shovel at you then you WILL get hit right after your finishing move.There's no more $ that you collect and use towards purchasing weapons and upgrades anymore. Noooo, they scrapped all that. Now you pick up ""skill points"" after slain enemies and then and then and then....Oh that's right, when do I use those skill points towards upgrading my character? Umm, NEVER in the game. (I was playing on the highest difficulty so maybe that's why, but regardless). You have to quit the game and go into main menu, click campaign and then click SKILL POINTS. And then you have about 30 skills or perks to buy and upgrade and only 3 SLOTS to put them in. This is useless. You can't buy any weapons, you will find a few extra though but you will still be using your main beginning pistols for most of the campaign.Anyways, I am sure more things will come up. I just can't think of every single idiotic point about this game so I will keep updating this review.I don't know what else to say. I felt a lot of hate from Capcom. I felt that I was being punished for something. It seems like they made this installment simply because it was that time to make another RE game.SAVE YOUR MONEY.			"

												This game is a piece of crap. The graphics go from acceptable to suddenly looking like a PS2 port, at times it actually looks like an old Resident Evil game with how muddy the textures can look. The user interface is ugly, dated looking and even looks low resolution at times (noticeably on the type) and has terrible key mapping.The gameplay is actually boring because it's not very difficult, in fact at times it just gets you plain angry when the QTE moments ♥♥♥♥ you over and other similar♥♥♥♥♥♥moves. This isn't the Resident Evil I remember playing years ago, it's just a generic and sloppy action game. If you want a good third person action game play Max Payne instead.This game does have one positive thing: Ada Wong's nice♥♥♥♥♥			"

												While not a great Resident Evil game it is a good TPS, albeit a flawed one. I will start with the positives, first and foremost it's just a lot of fun to play as the combat is truly fantastic, apart from the cover system which is quite terrible so I never used it. There's endless ways to kill the enemy, including the always fun to execute melee finishers. The monsters take visible damage as you shoot them which I loved, bits of their body will fly off as you focus them and it just adds something to the combat which I appreciated. The game doesn't have an Oscar winning story but it keeps you interested, if you've ever played a Resident Evil game you know what's going to happen, as it always happens. The voice work is done well, although hurt by the script which isn't great at best, it's very cheesy and almost cringe-worthy at times but that's a staple of Resident Evil games at this point. Also I'll say that I had no technical issues, the game ran at a solid 60fps throughout on max settings, I know performance was an issue in the past but it's certainly not now on appropriate hardware.As for negatives, the biggest for me was the length of the game, it truly overstayed its welcome, at 22 hours it feels very long and fatigue kicked in around the 15 hours mark. I would have enjoyed the game a lot more had they trimmed the fat and sliced off at least 5 hours, it would have been a more enjoyable game for it, I can think of a few sections that could be shortened or just removed entirely. By the end I was struggling to find motivation to finish it, and I dropped my overall rating from a 7 to a 6 as it just dragged on too much, the reduction in score was also due to the fact that Ada's campaign was poor almost throughout and as I played it last it left a sour taste in my mouth after I finished the game. Another gripe were the unskippable cutscenes, no one likes them, so please stop using them devs! Another dev favourite that we all hate are QTEs and the game is littered with them, so be prepared to die if you don't press A + X within a split second of it popping up on the screen.Overall I did enjoy it for the most part but it definitely wore me down by the end, would I recommend it? Yes, but only when on sale and only if you feel you can endure the boring chapters as to enjoy the good ones. I should also mention the game is heavily co-op focused, you can play solo with an AI companion but the game is far more fun with a friend, or even a random online player although those are rare these days.

												Horrible Piece of CrapFirst of all, while this game has excellent graphic, the rest of the system is just abysmally horrible. The controls are severely over-complicated for PC, with multiple actions that require pressing at least three keys at once. Players are limited to using only a few and can barely touch its potential. The game has a truckload of keys to press in game, but the list is outside, in the first welcome screen instead of being accessible in the game. If you forget anything on that list while playing, then screw you. You have to quit the game to access that list in the key config. The tutorial, if you can call that pathetic excuse of a prelude one, are AWFUL and barely teach anything of the mechanics. I was hoping that the game would teach you more when you pick up things, but no. The game doesn't teach you ANY-FREAKING-THING. If you need any in-depth key combinations, you find it online. It's not even in the damn manual. This is how responsible CAPCOM has become.The pathfinder system of your partner's AI is also god-awful. Your partner often finds yourself stuck near the edge of a door without being smart enough to walk an inch sideways and clear the obstacle. It is one of the case when artificial intelligence completely beats genuine stupidity. To make matters worse, sometimes you cannot cancel a command issued to your partner, and if the AI can't clear a door, it ends up getting stuck there forever, requiring you to restart from the check point. If your partner has no way of reaching you when you call, you end up watching him trying to get to you forevermore without being able to cancel it. Makes you wonder if the AI of your partner is controlling a BSAA Agent or a monkey. In fact, a monkey might be smarter than this game's AI.The menu interface is also terrible. It is not intuitive and instead making things accessible in one place for easy access, it splits every bit of everyhing everywhere. There's a weapon in one menu, grenades and health items in another. Oh, and herbs have specific method of using them too. You have to mix them in the menu, put it in capsules, and use it outside the menu using a specific key. When you throw a grenade, if you have 10, you can't just throw 10. You have to throw one, and the game ""intelligently"" switch to your guns, and you have to swith the menu to grenade menu, find the grenade, select the grenades, and use another. If you want to use 10 grenades, you do that 10 times. If this is not called horrible, I don't know what is. You also have to do all this IN REAL TIME, WHILE FIGHTING.There are over-abundance of quick-time event. One mistake, and you're dead. You also cannot skip cutscenes. NONE of them. Many of them are minutes long. If the quick-time events are specially difficult, the torture of watching the cutscenes over and over might be more of a challenge than the actual gameplay.I certainly hope that despite all the heavy sales, this piece of crap doesn't get your money. If you want to know the story, just watch people play this game on YouTube and save yourself the frustration.			"

												You hear people complaining about it all the time. The fact this game just isn't survival horror anymore, all the characters have superhuman speed and strength and it is now just an action game with ridiculous moments that is just a lost cause. Well let me tell you something, This franchise has built something that most have tried but failed. It gives you a real bond to the characters, Weither that be Leon, Chris or whoever. And the moment I picked up this game I wanted to see how chris's story had continued. And I was not disapointed. I've loved this the style of gameplay since resident evil 4 and 5. Nobody expects survival horror. But what you do get is an awesome action game about bioterrorism and how it impacts the world. Where else are you gonna find that?!			"

												Gears of Resident Duty 6 (reviewed after 50 hours)Opening title music says it's not horror, it's action.Feels like a mix of arcade titles Time Crisis and House of the Dead.Honestly, I hated RE5 the first time I played it, but came back to it later and really grew fond of the coop experience.As much as I want to like RE6, I'm not sure I'll be putting as many hours into it.I waited for a big Steam sale discount before buying up the complete game(all DLC), coming to around $12.  Probably should have forgone the DLC.  I can't recommend this game, unless it's on sale.+ Good character modeling and animation (except for the odd team gestures)+ Opportunity for up to 4 player coop at certain stages+ Sherry Birkin+ Pretty Chinese mansion+ 4 overlapping campaigns- Horrible controls- Labyrinthian menus- 4 overlapping campaigns- Hardly anyone plays this so 4 player coop will be extremely rare- AI partner takes no damage- Horribly imbalanced/broken Agent Hunt Mode- Weapon upgrades replaed by Skill perks- Too many QTE- Too many QTE- Too many QTE- Mundane vehicle stages- Inventory system sucks- Occasionally horrific camera angles- Jake isn't as cool as his dad- No Jill- No Sheva- Roid rage emo Chris "

												La verdad si van a jugar este juego por que son fans de los originales, tomen mi recomendación y olviden totalmente su existencia. La verdad no tiene nada que ver con los originales, esto no es survival horror, es un juego de acción de espectaculo en tercera personas; tipo NADA que ver. Aparte la historia y exposición apesta pero mal, el guión es malisimoooooo y la acción es toda lineal; no hay nada de exploración siquiera. Es como que el juego te arrastra a través de una mala película de acción, que ademas tiene zombies y para el colmo te frustra mal con los peores controles ever ... En fin mejor evitar este y esperar el eventual e inevitable remake.			"

												Dear CAPCOM if you expect me after finishing Leon campaign to play for Cris ""Testosterones"" Redfield or Jake you are gravely mistaken!Why i despise this game:1. QTE - it's horrible.2. CO-OP - my partners AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell. In a boss fight she keeps firing a with a pistol.3. Plot - i personally love the old RE plot. yeah it's a little bit of b rated plot but i still loved it on play-station. but in RE6 it's a disaster! in my entire life the was only 2 games that i say so many times ""WHY?"". First it was Medal Of Honor Warfighter, and second was RE6. I pretty imagine the stupidity of the plot when Leon starts talking with zombie president. Does he have amnesia or something? and where is all the files that i can read?4. Boss fights - first of all A ****ING FLY for a final boss fight? are you kidding me? that is not creative CAPCOM that is just lazy! and instead of creating multiply enemy bosses you just keep bringing the same guy over and over and over again!5. ""Survival Horror"" - amnesia is a survival horror!  penumbra is a survival horror! outlast is a survival horror! cry of fear is a survival horror! RE6 is a mash up everything and in the end it's a whole lot of nothing!			"

												I am a Resident Evil fan... but this game.. wow man. SUCK badControls are horribleI cant play a game like this.No main menu until you end an endless intro without knowledge of the game, in absolute darkness. Everytime you die you must return to the ""check point"" and see cutscenes all over again... while the game is forcing your to finish the introduction to display the main menu.Common sense tells you the intro should be short and simple, nope. Cutscenes all the time, total darkness, the Screen Settings menu which is the only accessible when the game starts have errors. For example asking you for a number six to be ""barely visible"". If you do that, would be like directly turning off the screen.Then.. why you are tired and with headache playing the intro you cant quit the game, the only way is Alt F4 or Windows key and Task Manager ...WTF??This HUGE ERROR they made with the intro makes you hate the game each instant.

Nah! let's give some some skills points so he can skill his stupid points up, he'll like that. Also let's fill the crates inside the boss room with skill points so he has to kill the boss with his knife, but that doesn't matter, because now he has all these skill points so maybe he can get a new skill before the campagain ends!""To whoever came up with this: F*CK YOU!Also... the partners get stuck all the time... and i fall through the ground at times.2/10 "

												Many people will say that resident evil 6/ biohazard 6 is a bad game for not following the example left by RE4 and will state that it is a bad game. This is not true at all the game is fun the coop works good. (2 player co-op in normal gameplay and up to 4 player co-op for some boss fights in a way that makes sense.) This game has a intresting story that expands the more you play, Leon's story has some good scares in it and Jake's story will be right at home to people who have played resident evil 3. Chris's story on the otherhand is more in line with resident evil 5 and for some people this can be a good thing or a bad thing and i have yet to play it so i wont talk about it that much. There are several multiplayer and single player modes one such mode lets other people join you're single player/co-op as a zombie which makes the game harder. People complain that there is not enough ammo in the game and that this is a bad thing but in reality they are complaing about something that has been in the RE series from the start the lack of ammo makes the game feel more like a horror game then a action game and there is the melee combat which is done well mixing up gunplay and melee is you're best bet to survive even in co-op. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who like's action games or is a fan of the re series i started with this game and it made me want to try the others 9,1/10			"

												By far the best RE game I've ever played. Apart from the stunning graphics, one thing I like in particular is the smooth and blending combat in this game. The controls have been Taylored ( ;) ) to perfection. Length of the story modes also sort of satisfied me. Unfortunately it did feel like the same story was being played over and over again. But then again, that was the whole idea. This point may or may not be liked by a few people so, look out if you're not into such stuff.A previous knowledge into the RE series is, thankfully, NOT required to understand this game much. I, for one, am a huge RE fan but to be honest my memory resembles that of an elephant (or an ant, whichever has a weaker one) and I forget things. I don't really recall what happened in the last games even though I've played them a lot of times. Even watched all of the movies (both real and animated ones). However, if one truly wants to indulge complete with the story and the background, try quickly using wikipedia and speed reading some of it. Helps if you want to dive in deep.I played this game alone but it does have the option to play it with one more player/friend. Personally this was one of those I do better on my own but in any case, more people to play with is always better!In short:Story: 10/10Graphics: 8/10 (probably debatable considering how graphics keep getting better and better day by day)Controls: 9/10 (a few times in the game I was let down by how the camera view changed, but that might just be me)This gets my ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) seal of approval.

												I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil series and have prided myself in giving each game in the series a shot...so I decided to give this one a bash even after not enjoying RE5 and the absolutely abortionate Operation Raccoon City.I regret that decision. I absolutely dispise this game.First, the game dumps me right into the thick of it without so much as being able to map the controls, change the sensitivities and turn subtitles on, but then I actually get to shoot something- with the exact same horrible hit detection and lack of feedback that plagued ORC (And I might add that both RE4 and 5 got exactly right.) along with a lack of explaination on how melee works, a much more difficult and far less satisfying gameplay mechanic for knives and herbs, a far, far more buggy and uncertain Melee command with very little (And inaccurately late) prompting and a severe lack of ammo. All of this is evident in the first ten minutes.Add to that the action movie scene of the entire street becoming engulfed in an explosion that you just barely escape into the helecopter, only to find the pilot inexplicably not only wounded but somehow INFECTED without any explaiantion or plausability whatsoever, who then proceeds to turn instantly and attack your partner, showing once again Capcom's lack of writing skill and thematic consistency with their own lore. Of course, there are QTEs and they're just as unsatisfying as RE4 and RE5, only there are EVEN MORE of them. In the 76 minutes that I managed of this game, I'd performed over 20 QTEs and was auto-attacked by so many scripted, railroaded 'enemies' that my head was spinning.So, after the high octane Michael Bay stylings of the intro, I'm then railroaded into a slow and very predictable 'horror' gameplay sequence as Leon where I'm force-walking down a corridor for 20 minutes unable to take the prudent measure of pre-killing zombies (Something we were able to do in Dead Space, several years prior) that we can see have already turned but aren't 'activated' yet. We happen upon an infected survivor and his infected survivor daughter that Leon doesn't realise is infected despite being the literal biggest expert in Bioterrorism that the Secret Service have...and then we're force-script attacked in an elevator with four 'enemies' piling into us without ANY EXPLAINATION OF HOW MELEE WORKS IN THIS GAME!! I'm trying to shoot them in the head instead of booting them out the door like a numpty and find that ultra-close range shooting is about as accurate as Starfox Zero and about half as satisfying.Add to that how unbearably dark the game is even with the gamma turned down and you have an absolutely miserable experience both in terms of looks and in terms of gameplay.The voice acting seems to be of a much higher quality, but the dialogue is stiff, formal and extremely cliché at pretty much all times undermining any attempt at serious storytelling that this game pretends to- exactly like RE5 only much more braindead. Think 'Chris Redfield punching a boulder' stupid...it's that bad.The final straw that broke my back was the scene where Leon and Helena get in a police car...I have to QTE to find the keys, then QTE accelerate and then QTE reverse to avoid some 'enemies.'Next thing I know 'ARGH, OH NOES, DERRS STILL BAD GUYS ON MY CAARRR!!' and instead of shooting them in the head as I had done in every weapon QTE and Leon had done in most cutscenes, instead he decided to steer-flip the car, roll it over, totally trash it and then think nothing of doing so. DONE!! I'M SO DONE!! I'M SO COMPLETELY TOTALLY UTTERLY DONE WITH THIS ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MY TIME AND ENERGY!So the gameplay is a 3 / 10.The graphics are a 6 / 10.The story and dialogue that I played through is a 2 / 10.The UI and menu system is a 2 / 10.The weapons, Inventory management (A Resident Evil staple that was completely ripped out of the heart of this game) and control feedback are a 2 / 10.This game is at most a 3 / 10. It's exceptionally bad in terms of gameplay, hideously braindead in its storytelling, has a UI that in 2016 is a clunky mess of a thing that does not befit the series and is really only marginally better than the absolutely shambolic Operation Raccoon City- a game which I suspect this shares an engine and shares its weapon registration and hit detection with. (And I might add, beat this game as my 'Worst game of 2012' by quite a large margin- ORC is THAT bad.)I'd love nothing more than to be able to say that I enjoyed this, but then I'd be lying.It's a disaster. An utter disaster. Do not buy this game unless you want a very poor action game that happens to have a co-op story mode (Which might make it better) and you're not a Resident Evil fan. (Or a fan of the movies.)If you want a decent action Resident Evil, get the Revelations games, they're written, feel, play, and look far better and are a fraction of the cost. Absolutely pitiful display from Capcom here.Pitiful. :(			"

												I bought this for my son and I to each play on separate PCs together. It worked fine. But this is less of a shooter than just punching zombies. The zombies stagger so much, it is hard to get the 2-5 head shots required for a single kill. But shooting is fine compared to the gameplay issues.What I hate about this game!-25pts: The lack of ability to move. Feels like you might as well be on rails. The game forces you into an extremely confined space to walk through. Even in an empty hallway you are forced to walk around small desks. I would have rather they just put me on rails than whatever movement impairing thing they did here.-25pts: Teaching you how to use Dash, as the space bar, then taking the ability of using it away in the next section. The game kept allowing me to use it for 10 foot sections then taking it away. This whole first section of the board was 30 minutes long of slowly walking around bullcrap items just for the sake of walking around bs items.-1pts: The game is kind of silly making you walk through a room around tons of desks in a classroom, as if it is fun or challenging to move around objects constantly during the time of a zombie apocalypse when none of this crap matters and should be fully destructable.-50pts: The camera is wobbly on purpose. I told my son I had to squint so I could only see a portion of the crazy cam, as my screen is right in front of my face, like every pc player. He made the joke that when he gets in the car to drive and put his keys in the ignition that he too wobbles his head everywhere. This wobble cam was so bad in the first car scene that I said I have to quit and he agreed with me. This game was the first game to ever make me car sick, and that is a bad thing.What I love about this game?+1pts: It has the Resident Evil tag on the name.+10pts: It is a zombie game with guns.0/10 Would throw up again! (I didn't actually barf, but it took me about an hour to fully recover from the head sickness this game gave me... everytime I played it!)			"

												Not a good Resident Evil game.  Not the best horror game.  But the gameplay is solid, versatile and extremely polished.  Controls are a bit complex but...you can roll in 4 directions, take cover, slide, perform melee attacks, takedowns, Fire from your backside, slide over low cover fluidily, climb up and down context sensitive areas(ladders, ledges, etc.), perform counter attacks, and maybe a few other things I'm forgetting.  So it's absurdly robust!  And you can do it with a friend!!			"

												This game... Is such a mixed bag it's silly.The first thing I should ask is... Why do you think all of the resident evil games cost the same amount right now?In my opinion, to have a surefire way to grab users who want the current game if it's the same price, because why not? I have heard many good things about both, but My knowledge of both fall short and I can only assume.So, what's good about this game?The models, the immersion, the vocals, the co op,  graphics, even the interface is passible provided you aren't in a major shuffle. The game is pretty much a movie where you have to keep the controller handy iat moments akin to the final destination 3 bonus feature where you can control people's destinies. There actually aren't that many quick time events outside of leon's story so far for me. SO FAR! I played through leon's story and am halfway into sherry's story. Resident evil 6 does exceedingly well at making most of the characters likable and actually makes you feel like you are playing in a party during the game. The cutscenes to the context shared pool of ""we have to survive"" There are a lot of things to find and serpent files to fish for. Again, the models in the game are really good, If you are the kind of gamer who doesn't care as long as it looks good, just buy it, because it does pull off all of its good ends without a hitch, and so well it's as tolerable as repititiveness in a sandbox game with good graphics and open spaces.But in my opinion, that's where it ends, If you were screening this game off to a friend or group of followers they'd almost be permitted to bring glasses and popcorn, because from the screen to the viewer, it is magnificent.As a player, however, the gameplay makes me upset out of the health system and the general mechanics of the game itself. Bosses will stab and pretty much kill animate you for the same damage that a legless zombie can get out of your ankles. One unit. The units do not always empty completely so there's no real excuse. I don't understand how getting stabbed 6 times or taking about 6 shots of damage allows for the unit of damage to still recover but god forbid my ankles get slapped... Please, jump in the river Styx completely before you come back. Also... staggers... Where are they when you need them? I can stagger in monster hunter with No effort mid attack, whatever, But here, shooting a shotgun shell at a zombie in mid leap does nothing unless they will die from it. I don't get how that works, and in that sense, George Bush would have gotten hit by both of those shoes. Now, I know not all games work as well with mechanics but capcom has already had working systems in games like lost planet and the earlier mentioned monster hunter. Also, the game rarely mentions how they want you to do things, Zombie epedemic survivors like leon should want to shoot dead bodies on the floor or sever anything even remotely close to intact or infected, but they do not, and act surprised when they finally come to life after they tripped over them just to get to the key. again... movie experience. Meanwhile they let loose on zombies they can almost be sure still have some sort of consciousness. I don't get it. Other times they tell you you need to do something and have a feild set to almost show you you're going to be doing area defense. hey, sever that! okay! Let me waste all of my ammo when you really want me to jump on his back. How was I supposed to know that when you're respawning 9mm ammo from cases I destroyed 10 minutes ago? It just makes zero sense. And I feel like someone screaming at the movies because they just make really poor decisions overall. You see a zombie with a machine gun? a sniper? You cannot have their gun. And if you see a sniper sight you? You better hope there's a wall nearby because he's not going to miss. Hey look, lockers, let me hide in one hopefully they will have to actually look before finding me or giving up, found instantly. If you're playing next to someone who played and mastered resident evil 5, They're probably going to give you the look of grief until it finally happens to them. Quickshot... how about an aim mode that doesn't obligate me to use it if they're too close. The aim and controls are akin to being in sniper mode. Someone leaps behind you, you either sprint away, hope you can turn and aim fast enough to make the shot, and if it does not kill or stun fast enough you will get hit, or quickshot. In my opinion, It's just bad news, even online players aren't as blatant about noscope as this game is. Capcom can do better. Because quickshot should not cost stamina when you're trying to simulate relatively close shots. The cover system Is very workable, but sprinting around in circles is more effective currently for me, as sniper enemies seem to never exist when you can actually dodge the shot. That being said, quickshot has a multitude of uses that can be good or bad, they ultimately open some characters up to empty their clips on enemies with guns, or they just miss and give a better more closer opportunity to aim properly. Quickshot is necessary, but not a need, in my opinion the quickshot system is a clear call that they expect you to never have an opportunity to sit still. It's probably the biggest mixed bag in the game, because It takes a lot of load off of the developers for making a shooting system that pretty much lacks in terms of the situation at hand. But hey, resident evil does feature an intricate targeting system where certain areas do more damage, they've been doing it forever, so maybe I'm just doing it wrong, I am okay with that.The inventory system is another thing that makes me cringe. you cant hold two herbs but you can hold 200 9mm bullets. I have no first aid spray but it's forever bonded to an icon in my selection. You can carry every gun in the game but you can't carry the ammo stack. I know this is supposed to be survival horror, But failing to organize their inventory or not even saying, wow player, this is not going to work, at all. Your partner is telling you good job when you just mutated 3 enemies and they're going rogue while your partner is firing a pistol. A PISTOL. Even dynasty warriors will slap you with variants of you're too far out when you are clearly making the game harder than it has to be, Not this game. Hey, push a huge dumpster to move along the game. Oh an umbrella token is under the table? BLOW UP THE WHOLE TABLE THERES NO OTHER WAY! Why capcom?I enjoy the game when I can ignore these things, and don't mind getting killed from an ankle slap occasionally. But even at the end of a story, It just feels like you're a witness and not really playing the game. Alright I shook off that zombie, who cares, just got smacked by a train. I have to open that hatch before we all die, My partner is being ignored because he's using one pistol... LEON YOU HAVE TWO PISTOLS WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING. Like I said, as a movie this thing gets a million out of 10. But as a game, by developers who clearly know how to do things they've pretty much missed, no. I think everyone I personally would try to recommend this game to will think I am either a monster at games for not seeing how easy it is to die constantly, or rude enough to make people pay for a badly executed gaming experience. Listen to what everyone is saying, It is very arcade oriented, Being scared because you didn't reload or out of not having a clear idea of how the game wants you to defeat the enemy is not survival horror, It's having opinionated multiple choice answers and you slightly disagree with all of them. I enjoy it because I have it, But unless you're up for some really bad turns. Or think the online experience may be different. (I do admit my online intersection was laughably easy save for the fact we were stuck mashing x for 5 minutes because of reasons I am not aware of) I am not mean enough to tell you to buy the game.

												I bought this game on sale, figuring $10 was not bad...  and how bad could this game really be?I tried to like this game.  I played it, even after I was bored silly during the first sequence.  The problem here is quick time events.  It is not the type of events where you push a sequence of buttons to complete an action (refernce God of War - which did it well)  as much as it is just spam the hell out of one button in hopes you take less damage from an unavoidable zombie attack (which it does not do well).  Lets face it, when you are walking to a building and you are passing a dozen dead bodies, you know what is coming...  but you can not stab them, shoot them, or dodge them.  Instead you have to come back out of the building with all the corpes coming back to life in your face and grabbing you, sending you into a quick time event.  This gets dull...  fast.  Maybe if it was not every stinking dead body you pass, but it is predictable to no end.  I have enjoyed most the RE titles, being I was playing them back in the PS1 era and I loved RE4 on the GameCube.  I just have no love for this game, it did nothing for me.  I felt like I was being pushined while playing it and THAT is an achivement.  Save your money.			"

												Just♥♥♥♥♥♥Resident Evil has always been a bit corny and ridiculous, but this time the story is just an abomination.  Absolutely ludicrous, cheesy, and makes no sense; and it's not like this is a B-movie, the story takes itself seriously.  The characters are entirely cliche and one-dimensional.  Not enjoyable in the least.Extremely linear not only in its level design, but also in its pacing.  Literally every 30 seconds, a cutscene takes over.  It could be a bit of story, or it could be interrupting you to point out a door, or to show you an enemy appearing, just constant interruptions of control and gameplay.The core gameplay is actually pretty fun, but the game will just not let you ♥♥♥♥ing play.

												This game has bad presentation, bad atmosphere (no atmosphere actually), bad music, bad mechanics, bad gameplay. It's basically just an arcade style shooting game with the RE name. After playing The Evil Wtihin, a real survival horror game, this game feels like absolute garbage. Nothing feels like RE, including running, shooting. Even the inventory and option menus suck badly. YES, the options menu. =\The only thing the game seems useful for is the split screen and online multiplayer options, but I haven't tried these yet.

												Not a good Resident Evil game.  Not the best horror game.  But the gameplay is solid, versatile and extremely polished.  Controls are a bit complex but...you can roll in 4 directions, take cover, slide, perform melee attacks, takedowns, Fire from your backside, slide over low cover fluidily, climb up and down context sensitive areas(ladders, ledges, etc.), perform counter attacks, and maybe a few other things I'm forgetting.  So it's absurdly robust!  And you can do it with a friend!!			"

												I bought this for my son and I to each play on separate PCs together. It worked fine. But this is less of a shooter than just punching zombies. The zombies stagger so much, it is hard to get the 2-5 head shots required for a single kill. But shooting is fine compared to the gameplay issues.What I hate about this game!-25pts: The lack of ability to move. Feels like you might as well be on rails. The game forces you into an extremely confined space to walk through. Even in an empty hallway you are forced to walk around small desks. I would have rather they just put me on rails than whatever movement impairing thing they did here.-25pts: Teaching you how to use Dash, as the space bar, then taking the ability of using it away in the next section. The game kept allowing me to use it for 10 foot sections then taking it away. This whole first section of the board was 30 minutes long of slowly walking around bullcrap items just for the sake of walking around bs items.-1pts: The game is kind of silly making you walk through a room around tons of desks in a classroom, as if it is fun or challenging to move around objects constantly during the time of a zombie apocalypse when none of this crap matters and should be fully destructable.-50pts: The camera is wobbly on purpose. I told my son I had to squint so I could only see a portion of the crazy cam, as my screen is right in front of my face, like every pc player. He made the joke that when he gets in the car to drive and put his keys in the ignition that he too wobbles his head everywhere. This wobble cam was so bad in the first car scene that I said I have to quit and he agreed with me. This game was the first game to ever make me car sick, and that is a bad thing.What I love about this game?+1pts: It has the Resident Evil tag on the name.+10pts: It is a zombie game with guns.0/10 Would throw up again! (I didn't actually barf, but it took me about an hour to fully recover from the head sickness this game gave me... everytime I played it!)			"

Love the fancy moves, like sliding, dodging and melee attacks (specifically counter-attacks).  The graphics is amazing too!

												Not only is this the worst Resident Evil game ever created, I'd go so far as saying this is the worst action game ever created, with or without zombies. The QTE's brutally difficult, checkpoints are few and far between, and every section where the game forces you apart from your co op partner is both the epitome of frustration, and unforgiving beyond any semblance of reason. And don't even think of rage quitting this maniacal zombie ♥♥♥♥fest, because the game's sporadic save spots will have you repeating entire expanses of certain chapters, which, by the way, can encompass well up to four hours of irritating gameplay. If you like this game, you're the reason Gabe will never release Half LIfe 2: Episode 3.			"

												Resident Evil 6 takes one step forward, and two steps back, in pretty much every aspect of its design, except perhaps graphics, as It's a nice enough looking game in that department. I can see how the series got to where it is at 6, after seeing the direction the series took going from 4 to 5, but I still can't believe it really happened. It really feels like the makers of the game ignored what fans of only 4, fans of only 5, and fans of both had to say. Instead, the game's creators seemed to  just says ""Well, 5 was more action-packed than 4, so let's make 6 be even more action-packed than 6."" They certainly made it more like an action film, but in my opinion, as a fan of both 4 and 5, this game took it too far.Here's the thing. I feel that RE5 was a terrible Resident Evil game...but a fantastic game! By that, I mean that while 4 made some big gameplay changes, I welcomed them with open arms and was still thoroughly creeped out and unnerved by 4's gloomy, creepy locations, music, and tone, with just the right amount of B-movie ""camp"" to give the game a nice bit of levity, and some really fun gameplay. 5 basically copy/pasted 4's gameplay with a few minor changes, but with one major gameplay change: co-op. Having someone to watch your back diminished 5's creepiness for me, and the tone just wasn't unsettling for me like it was with 4. The gameplay, however, was wonderful, and I spent hundreds of hours with 5 on PS3, both doing single player and co-op, both online and on the couch. So I find 5 to be wonderful as a game...but not as a Resident Evil game, because it departs too far for me from the tone and creepiness of the original games and 4. I love 5, though!Now 6...if you've played 5, it's like that, with the improvement that you can move while you aim your gun...except everything else in the game is one big, jumbled mess. You start by picking one of four campaigns. All the campaigns criss-cross over one another, which sounds cool, when in practice, I just ended up sighing as I realized a cutscene I'd already watched was about to come up again, and this happened frequently enough. You can skip them, but that just means a chunk of the plot of each campaign is all retreads of what you've already sat through before. You even have to fight almost every boss at least twice if you play through all the campaigns. RE4 and RE5 had a nice, linear story. Although the Ada stuff in 4 did a bit of what RE6 does, but 4 did it infinitely better, and it strengthened the plot for me. In 6, though, I just dreaded every chapter of the game.Dreading each chapter, not out of a sense of ""oh noes! This is spooky!"" but out of an ""Ugh, I want this game to just end so I can finally put it behind me for good"" is not what I want out of a game. I originally tried playing with someone on couch co-op in RE6 on PS3 but stopped when I got bored with it. I tried again with a different friend, online on PS3, and couldn't even get as far as I did on the prior attempt at the game. Finally, I managed to charge through the PC version, constantly wishing I was playing a different game; never considered which other game to play, but just knew I didn't want it to be RE6. See, that's the thing...during RE5, I was glad to see each next chapter, and I played through the game repeatedly because I enjoyed it. I've played through RE4 several times as well, and I've finished every attempt at a full playthrough that I've ever tried. I love those games!But RE6? Nope, I just wish it didn't even exist. Are there good moments? Storywise, I would say it was fairly creatively bankrupt and did not entertain me. Gameplay-wise, the J'avo, which are basically Las Plagas enemies, made for good fun, but that's just because it worked in 4 and 5. RE6 didn't have to do anything to make that good. They added zombies to Leon's campaign, and I thought they were dull and far less fun than other enemies in 4, 5, and 6. In the first chapter of Leon's campaign, I killed over 300 zombies, according to the end-of-mission report. This isn't Left 4 Dead, guys n' gals. Imagine getting 300 kills in one chapter of RE4 or RE5...that would be huge. Now imagine that it was the first chapter, instead of a late-game one. Rather than being spooky - and Leon's campaign is portrayed as the one that is supposed to be spooky - Leon's campaign is a slot through hordes of easily killable zombies that are less fun to fight than RE4's enemies, and your companion character, Helena, is dull and uninteresting.As for things I liked, I liked Sherry Birkin and Jake Muller's interactions, and Chris' missions had some pretty good gameplay. Oh, and Ada's crossbow is fantastic. Anything that feels like RE4 and RE5 is good, but then those games already mastered that. Also, you don't have to save your AI combat partners in single player, which is wonderful. Back to negatives...Chris' partner, Piers, was about as dull as Helena was for me, at least until Chris' final chapter. The overall narrative and the way each campaign criss-crossed into one another was just perplexing, boring, and made the plot harder to follow or care about, and the virus in this game is the biggest McGuffin BS thing I've seen in a good, long while. From what I can tell, it makes zombies, white goo people, smoke-shooter people, chrysalis people that each can turn into various things, Las Plagas people, and a FREAKING TRANSFORMER. I'm not kidding. If you play this game, just you wait. It's biological, but it's a friggin' Transformer. There's nothing this virus can't do, and it's absurd. Suspension of disbelief can only take one so far, and this virus goes over the line for me, then flies around the world two more times, passing the line again and again.Also, the co-op is ""lop-sided in one campaign."" In RE5, even though Sheva wasn't a big deal in the RE universe like Chris, players controlling her get plenty of kickass moments throughout the game. In RE6, on the other hand, one character pretty much sits out the final boss fight and is often needing to be rescued or helped in scripted events, while that character's partner gets special melee attacks that make the character the obvious choice to choose as your character.Do you like quick-time-events? Y'know, push a button or you die immediately? Those come up at unexpected moments, and if you're using a keyboard and mouse with the default controls, which are pretty much what most PC gamer using a keyboard and mouse would set the keys to, the key combinations can be pretty weird. You don't know a QTE is coming, then ""Space + R"" pops up on the screen. That's weird positioning, and you have one second or less to hit it, most of the time. I was not a fan of these and would have preferred something more natural for PC. On PS3, you have stuff like L1 + R1, and Square + X, which feel very natural and can be hit rapidly, even by me, and I'm a PC guy. =/I can't let this go: a major boss is a biological Transformer, which makes him go from human-sized to big as a house and back again to human-sized multiple times, and he transforms into different stuff each time. I still cringe when I see it...and since you repeat bosses, you'll see it again! Anyway, long story short, this game is not the sequel that RE5 should have had, and it's certainly not a step in the right direction to pleasing many RE4 fans, as it moves even further away from the formula that made RE4 so great.

												I have not finished every campaign yet. i currently only finished Leons. but i greatly enjoyed this game. The only thing i was particularly annoyed with in this game is that take time to kill every enemy in some parts you will inevetably waste ammo. for example after the part with the church in leons campaign you are brought to an underground research lab where you have to activate several switches in order to get to a door on the other side of the room which in turn required you to sometimes end your partner out on there own to activate things for you to cross. which in all honesty wasnt bad at all and was really fun. but what bothered me about it is the endless spawning C virus zombies. nothing special about them just your ordinary garden variety zombie that cant do anything unless you of course decide to walk to close or take in the scenery for too long. but still i didnt know that they would endlessly spawn so i sorta started popping heads hoping to clear the room. it didnt work so i had to restart the checkpoint to get my ammo back. some parts of the game you have to just quick shot a few times and then move or else you will get overwhelmed. which makes sense in any case. but to somone who does not know survival horror games it would be a big trap. even so it wasnt that bad at all and i managed to farm quite the ammount of skill points from it. other than that the game is excellent.

												Resident Evil 6 takes one step forward, and two steps back, in pretty much every aspect of its design, except perhaps graphics, as It's a nice enough looking game in that department. I can see how the series got to where it is at 6, after seeing the direction the series took going from 4 to 5, but I still can't believe it really happened. It really feels like the makers of the game ignored what fans of only 4, fans of only 5, and fans of both had to say. Instead, the game's creators seemed to  just says ""Well, 5 was more action-packed than 4, so let's make 6 be even more action-packed than 6."" They certainly made it more like an action film, but in my opinion, as a fan of both 4 and 5, this game took it too far.Here's the thing. I feel that RE5 was a terrible Resident Evil game...but a fantastic game! By that, I mean that while 4 made some big gameplay changes, I welcomed them with open arms and was still thoroughly creeped out and unnerved by 4's gloomy, creepy locations, music, and tone, with just the right amount of B-movie ""camp"" to give the game a nice bit of levity, and some really fun gameplay. 5 basically copy/pasted 4's gameplay with a few minor changes, but with one major gameplay change: co-op. Having someone to watch your back diminished 5's creepiness for me, and the tone just wasn't unsettling for me like it was with 4. The gameplay, however, was wonderful, and I spent hundreds of hours with 5 on PS3, both doing single player and co-op, both online and on the couch. So I find 5 to be wonderful as a game...but not as a Resident Evil game, because it departs too far for me from the tone and creepiness of the original games and 4. I love 5, though!Now 6...if you've played 5, it's like that, with the improvement that you can move while you aim your gun...except everything else in the game is one big, jumbled mess. You start by picking one of four campaigns. All the campaigns criss-cross over one another, which sounds cool, when in practice, I just ended up sighing as I realized a cutscene I'd already watched was about to come up again, and this happened frequently enough. You can skip them, but that just means a chunk of the plot of each campaign is all retreads of what you've already sat through before. You even have to fight almost every boss at least twice if you play through all the campaigns. RE4 and RE5 had a nice, linear story. Although the Ada stuff in 4 did a bit of what RE6 does, but 4 did it infinitely better, and it strengthened the plot for me. In 6, though, I just dreaded every chapter of the game.Dreading each chapter, not out of a sense of ""oh noes! This is spooky!"" but out of an ""Ugh, I want this game to just end so I can finally put it behind me for good"" is not what I want out of a game. I originally tried playing with someone on couch co-op in RE6 on PS3 but stopped when I got bored with it. I tried again with a different friend, online on PS3, and couldn't even get as far as I did on the prior attempt at the game. Finally, I managed to charge through the PC version, constantly wishing I was playing a different game; never considered which other game to play, but just knew I didn't want it to be RE6. See, that's the thing...during RE5, I was glad to see each next chapter, and I played through the game repeatedly because I enjoyed it. I've played through RE4 several times as well, and I've finished every attempt at a full playthrough that I've ever tried. I love those games!But RE6? Nope, I just wish it didn't even exist. Are there good moments? Storywise, I would say it was fairly creatively bankrupt and did not entertain me. Gameplay-wise, the J'avo, which are basically Las Plagas enemies, made for good fun, but that's just because it worked in 4 and 5. RE6 didn't have to do anything to make that good. They added zombies to Leon's campaign, and I thought they were dull and far less fun than other enemies in 4, 5, and 6. In the first chapter of Leon's campaign, I killed over 300 zombies, according to the end-of-mission report. This isn't Left 4 Dead, guys n' gals. Imagine getting 300 kills in one chapter of RE4 or RE5...that would be huge. Now imagine that it was the first chapter, instead of a late-game one. Rather than being spooky - and Leon's campaign is portrayed as the one that is supposed to be spooky - Leon's campaign is a slot through hordes of easily killable zombies that are less fun to fight than RE4's enemies, and your companion character, Helena, is dull and uninteresting.As for things I liked, I liked Sherry Birkin and Jake Muller's interactions, and Chris' missions had some pretty good gameplay. Oh, and Ada's crossbow is fantastic. Anything that feels like RE4 and RE5 is good, but then those games already mastered that. Also, you don't have to save your AI combat partners in single player, which is wonderful. Back to negatives...Chris' partner, Piers, was about as dull as Helena was for me, at least until Chris' final chapter. The overall narrative and the way each campaign criss-crossed into one another was just perplexing, boring, and made the plot harder to follow or care about, and the virus in this game is the biggest McGuffin BS thing I've seen in a good, long while. From what I can tell, it makes zombies, white goo people, smoke-shooter people, chrysalis people that each can turn into various things, Las Plagas people, and a FREAKING TRANSFORMER. I'm not kidding. If you play this game, just you wait. It's biological, but it's a friggin' Transformer. There's nothing this virus can't do, and it's absurd. Suspension of disbelief can only take one so far, and this virus goes over the line for me, then flies around the world two more times, passing the line again and again.Also, the co-op is ""lop-sided in one campaign."" In RE5, even though Sheva wasn't a big deal in the RE universe like Chris, players controlling her get plenty of kickass moments throughout the game. In RE6, on the other hand, one character pretty much sits out the final boss fight and is often needing to be rescued or helped in scripted events, while that character's partner gets special melee attacks that make the character the obvious choice to choose as your character.Do you like quick-time-events? Y'know, push a button or you die immediately? Those come up at unexpected moments, and if you're using a keyboard and mouse with the default controls, which are pretty much what most PC gamer using a keyboard and mouse would set the keys to, the key combinations can be pretty weird. You don't know a QTE is coming, then ""Space + R"" pops up on the screen. That's weird positioning, and you have one second or less to hit it, most of the time. I was not a fan of these and would have preferred something more natural for PC. On PS3, you have stuff like L1 + R1, and Square + X, which feel very natural and can be hit rapidly, even by me, and I'm a PC guy. =/I can't let this go: a major boss is a biological Transformer, which makes him go from human-sized to big as a house and back again to human-sized multiple times, and he transforms into different stuff each time. I still cringe when I see it...and since you repeat bosses, you'll see it again! Anyway, long story short, this game is not the sequel that RE5 should have had, and it's certainly not a step in the right direction to pleasing many RE4 fans, as it moves even further away from the formula that made RE4 so great.

												As a long time fan of resident evil games, I can't understand why this game has such a positive rating here. This game features some of the most irritating forced encounters I've ever seen. Still corpes on the ground that you know will be zombies are immune to any interaction and the game forces you to get hit, take damage, etc. Not at all a fun mechanic. Very disappointing title and by far the worst entry in the series I've played recently. It is a shame too because the game looks great and has some really interesting upgrade mechanics, but the constant feeling of ""cheap monsters"" and ""cheap traps"" and ""cheap tricks"" absolutely ruins any fun.

												Look simply put if you like RE4 and RE5 this is no different. The fact that it has multiple campaigns is a little worry-some. 4-5 hours for each campaign why not just have one long, expansive, and emersive campaign instead of trying to include multiple campaigns that seem to go know where. No saying i didnt have fun but i couldnt do it. Give me true survial horror.			"

												On paper, this game sounds interesting.  Splitting the story into separate campaigns allows for each one to have a unique perspective and also create a natural boundary for your characters to develop.  There are also some added elements to the gameplay, like being able to melee freely with an added stamina system, the ability to move while you have your weapon drawn and move, aim and shoot while laying on your back.  I like the idea of being able to place your herbs into a quick-use container.  These additions give the game a lot of potential for taking the solid mechanics that were present in RE5 and building on them for a more varied experience.In practice, however, they completely botched this game.  The added mobility in combat is all but ruined by a terrible camera system, an awful inventory system, and sloppy animations.  There are moments in the game that are enjoyable and work well, but it never lasts long.  For every stretch of decent gameplay, you have a counterpart that is filled with frustration as the game teases you with control and then constantly takes it away from you.  There are numerous moments where your character will only move a few paces in between cutscenes, and far too often you are given very limited control where you can only walk slowly.  In these moments, you cannot open your inventory, you cannot run, you can not reload your weapon, you cannot change your weapon.  Even if you don't find the game awful, replaying the game or doing a speedrun would be very frustrating because of this.There are also incredibly lazy moments in the game where it feels like the developers were just adding filler to get each campaign to a certain length.  I really can't fathom that the game was tested for pacing or for player feedback, because it's littered with terrible decisions.It's a real head-scratcher, because there are decent moments in the game and the awful bits are randomly littered throughout.  It is another solid PC release for Capcom and i'm glad that Mercenaries has gotten better with each new release, but you wouldn't buy this just for the mercenaries mode.I bought this at a good sale price and still regret the decision.  If you've heard any criticism about the game before, it was most likely about the quick time events.  I absolutely hate QTEs and have to say that they were one of the smallest issues i had with the gameplay.  The rest of it really is that bad.If you enjoyed RE5 and are looking for improvements and more fun, stay away from this mess.If you love the classic RE titles and want strategy, stay away from this mess.If you want a dumb action-packed joy ride, stay away from this mess.If you want a competant shooter with decent level design and adequate story, stay away from this mess.

												Clunky controls, moronic AI and horrible quick time events should be more than enough to put off any casual Resident Evil fan from enjoying this sixth in the main series. It likewise suffers from the same problems as Reisdent Evil 5 in that, thanks to it's implementation of a forced co-op partner and action-orientated pacing, the solitary feeling of horror and dread that ecapsulated the series is lost entirely. No amount of PC exclusive content can fix Resident Evil 6's problems. While this is undoubtedly the best looking version, besides being relaitvely easy to run, it isn't worth the trouble when so many better zombie focused games are out there.			"

												I’d heard this game was bad, and having played the demo I decided to skip this. But then the years went on, and both critics and game developers popped their head out to say “Resident Evil 6 wasn’t that bad!”. Could there be something interesting here after all? No. No there isn’t.Maybe it’s a matter of preference? The way games like Resident Evil Revelations 2 or The Evil Within are paced is like a rollercoaster. You have long stretches of buildup and tension before all hell breaks loose. They both do a great job at it. Neither are particularly effective as horror games, but as action games I love them. Resident Evil 6 on the other hand is more like being strapped to a rocket. There’s some anticipation at the start, but then it’s non-stop action with set pieces upon set pieces with maybe 5 seconds of breathing room between them. I only played the first chapter of Leon’s story, and I apparently killed 228 enemies during that time. That’s the kinds of numbers you’d expect out of late game Doom 2 or Serious Sam.So all pretense of it being horror is out the window, and there’s minimal exploration and the pacing is nonexistent. This puts more strain on the combat mechanics. They better be good if it’s the only thing you’ll be doing. Unfortunately they tossed out the mechanics used in Resident Evil 4 and 5 and tried to come up with new ones. I can appreciate the thought. But what they have here is simply worse. Your guns and enemies somehow both feel weak and flimsy, yet they take more hits to kill than I’d like. When you shoot enemies with a shotgun, there’s no difference in reaction from when you shoot them with a gun. It feels like an underdeveloped system that was rushed out the door. This is especially true of tougher enemies. In the parts of the game I played there were higher evolved zombies that took loads of bullets to take down, and there were big fat ones that took the rest of my inventory to kill. None of them were intimidating or exciting to fight. All they did was add tedium because their health meant the action set piece would go on for longer than it already was. I didn’t enjoy playing Resident Evil 6 at all. The story starts in a laughable manner, and it doesn’t get much better after that. In fact, almost nothing happened in the 2 hours I played, as characters insisted the story would start once I reached a cathedral. But on the way there I had to go through 9 action set pieces, one more tedious than the other. On every level from characterization, pacing, tension, the feel of the weapons, the enemy designs, and the way environments were designed and lit was worse than it has ever been in the series. I’m actually glad I decided to play it properly, because now I can finally write it off completely as garbage. If you like this for some reason, fine, I have nothing against that. But I can’t understand at all what the appeal is. This isn’t mediocre, it’s absolutely horrible.			"

												Look simply put if you like RE4 and RE5 this is no different. The fact that it has multiple campaigns is a little worry-some. 4-5 hours for each campaign why not just have one long, expansive, and emersive campaign instead of trying to include multiple campaigns that seem to go know where. No saying i didnt have fun but i couldnt do it. Give me true survial horror.			"

												On paper, this game sounds interesting.  Splitting the story into separate campaigns allows for each one to have a unique perspective and also create a natural boundary for your characters to develop.  There are also some added elements to the gameplay, like being able to melee freely with an added stamina system, the ability to move while you have your weapon drawn and move, aim and shoot while laying on your back.  I like the idea of being able to place your herbs into a quick-use container.  These additions give the game a lot of potential for taking the solid mechanics that were present in RE5 and building on them for a more varied experience.In practice, however, they completely botched this game.  The added mobility in combat is all but ruined by a terrible camera system, an awful inventory system, and sloppy animations.  There are moments in the game that are enjoyable and work well, but it never lasts long.  For every stretch of decent gameplay, you have a counterpart that is filled with frustration as the game teases you with control and then constantly takes it away from you.  There are numerous moments where your character will only move a few paces in between cutscenes, and far too often you are given very limited control where you can only walk slowly.  In these moments, you cannot open your inventory, you cannot run, you can not reload your weapon, you cannot change your weapon.  Even if you don't find the game awful, replaying the game or doing a speedrun would be very frustrating because of this.There are also incredibly lazy moments in the game where it feels like the developers were just adding filler to get each campaign to a certain length.  I really can't fathom that the game was tested for pacing or for player feedback, because it's littered with terrible decisions.It's a real head-scratcher, because there are decent moments in the game and the awful bits are randomly littered throughout.  It is another solid PC release for Capcom and i'm glad that Mercenaries has gotten better with each new release, but you wouldn't buy this just for the mercenaries mode.I bought this at a good sale price and still regret the decision.  If you've heard any criticism about the game before, it was most likely about the quick time events.  I absolutely hate QTEs and have to say that they were one of the smallest issues i had with the gameplay.  The rest of it really is that bad.If you enjoyed RE5 and are looking for improvements and more fun, stay away from this mess.If you love the classic RE titles and want strategy, stay away from this mess.If you want a dumb action-packed joy ride, stay away from this mess.If you want a competant shooter with decent level design and adequate story, stay away from this mess.

												There are already plenty of brilliant reviews for this game. I just want to add a very simple ""thumbs DOWN"" and recommendation to AVOID here as well. Even as a huge fan of modern RESIDENT EVIL (4 and 5 especially), I could not make it through this pathetic effort. Everything has regressed, from the clunky controls and mechanics, to the story (""Uh... kill this new wave of things!?""). Bored to tears. Even the graphics are somehow lackluster (textures, environment, lighting). CAPCOM deserves shame and embarassment for this abomination. We know they can produce quality games. There is no excuse for this. My rating for RESIDENT EVIL 6: 4 out of 10.			"

												Awkward control mechanics and terrible camera. Extremely unintuitive UI and inventory system, probably the worst of any game I've seen.  Unable to hotkey weapon select, you have to manually scroll trhough 10 weapons just to select a specific weapon.  Annoying QTE's everywhere.  Unnecessary screen shaking and events that make you lose control, designed to create tension and a sense of panic but actually just annoy the player.  Terrible game design decisions EVERYWHERE (e.g. you have to hold 'DOWN' to run away from something, then suddenly the camera flips for the sake of looking cool and hollywood, so now you have to press 'UP' but since you were already holding 'DOWN', you run right back into the thing you were running away from).  Artificially extending game length by creating 4 campaigns which are more or less the same thing.  The list goes on and on.As for the story and overall atmosphere, they tried to go ""hollywood action flick"" with this one--there is absolutely ZERO sense of horror.  The worst game of the series and perhaps one of the worst games of all time.  Googled the lead designer of this game and it looks like he never worked on another game after this one, thank god for that.  Matter of fact, every game designer that worked on this game should do the world a favor and quit the video game industry.The only decent thing about this game is the co-op, and maybe Ada Wong's azz when you crawl through vents.  Everything else is trash.  I'm struggling to force myself to complete this game for the sake of completing every RE game and obtaining and reading the intel files.			"

												It's a game I can certainly get into once you get past the motion sickness and shakiness of the controls.. If you can. I actually just played it again and couldn't stomach it. That's why I'm rewriting this. I enjoyed the first couple campaigns but now that I'm on Jake and Sherries there's way too many boss battles and way too many enemies in a row. It's non-sense to call it Resident Evil anymore at that point. And the gameplay for that campaign and Chris' campaign are just not fun for the most part. I find myself getting way too mad at the controls, or lack there of, when you get bombarded with enemies/bosses. I still really enjoy Leons/Helena and Ada's campaign though. They're both compelling stories and the hoards only get uncontrollable in a few spots while still being able to stomach those moments to get to the next juicy part of it's story. They should've saved the devolopement money for RE 7 though from Sherries/Jakes, and Chris'/Piers campaigns. They aren't well thought out from an RE standpoint and I think they did more harm than good for the game/franchise itself.			"

												This game is beautiful, suspenseful and amazing. I have watched my mom play resident evil on nintendo as a child and cannot believe how far capcom has come (I was  born in 1994). The fact that i have grown up to be 20 years old and playing the same franchise as my mother still dazzles me. The feelings I have felt as a child still persist in this game. I hate/love/fear/cannot wait for the next second while playing Resident evil 6.  This game is a favor to us gamers and horror lovers. They have came so far and have not missed a beat and i cannot get over how well they have kept composure. Some may hate this game but i have only played 1 hr and wish i could donate extra to the devs. No other games can instil feelings into you like this games. This isnt a game but more of a experience you can participate in or not. A good one at that.			"

While not all of the missions were steller, there is alot of fun to be had here.  2 main issues i have with it. The camera and controls are terrible. The direction of camera and movement controls can change on the fly in certain missions and really mess up the flow of the game. Quick time events along with the timed running sequences were really annoying due to clunky controls. Play at your own risk!			"

Cover system that is a joke compared to other games that have cover systems. Chris fans get slapped in the face as capcom bends him over a barrel and destroys any likeability of the character by trying to turn him into a max payne ripoff minus the bullet time mechanic. wait till it goes on sale or buy it from a site like Gamersgate (7.99 currently along with several other capcom classics)			"

If u expect the old survival horror like in RE1 or 2 or 3 u will not get that . It is a great Third Person Action Shooter just like SPec Ops ot Ghost REcon but falls real short on the horror part .

												Got the game as a gift to play with my friend and from the special sell. The game is special in it's own way. This game is a mix, it good yet not good yet good again.Also don't questions the logic in this game.I enjoy the game even though it has flaws. Since I never play the other game I felt really confused at first as to who was who and what role they had in the universe. If you want to have a compleate collection go for it...and try and get it on special sell. I do enjoy the 2 player.This game is long to me and that cool but I had to take breaks. I thought only play as Leon and hi partner. After you beat his level you can play the other characters and see there side of the story.I have only play a bit of the orignal first Resident Evil game and a bit of Resident Evil Revelations. There a lot of nice maps and detail to things. Cutceans camera could be a bit more fluid and less choppy on transitions movment fad in or out to black. A cutscines will happen all a sudden where you walk a few distence then it cuts to a cutcanes I guess it to load the scenes instead of right after another scnese had already load but I notice this in other game I have played. The game is just weirdness in it own I guess. Menu option screen to just edit setting is  bit of a chore since your figuring out what the icon are even with a small discription. Control feel clunky sometime even though I adjusted the mouse sensitivity but don't feel improvment, this can be ignored because after a while you get used to it. Though would like to try with a game controler one day. The gun system feels similuer to Metal Gear 2 shooting style (and maybe there other games but Metal Gear is one I like and notice) but I felt they done it better or calibrated it better in Metal Gear. Some of the action seem redundent like ""open the door fence that has a bar, I can simply reach my arm over the metal bars and lift the metal wedge. nothing stoping me from doing that.""  ""Oh no, I can't climb over this desk it block by a small box and junk, yet in real life I can climb over a desk to not set off the sercurity gate alarm detector."" I could go on but yeah.I feel it like a crazy action movie I'm watching. The cars or truck that just come out of knowhere and I'm like ""HOW THE HECK DO YOU SURVIVE THAT?"" Even in video game logic. Maybe if the cheography sett up was done better it could be more belivabile like in some movies. Though animation is still great just feel like some of the film editing fad in to out could be a bit better.It's a decent game even though it might have flaws. From somebody like me who has not really play the other Resident Evil game and can say from a neutral point is that the game is decent for what it is atleast for me.			"

												I really enjoy this game. Honestly for RE going action, it really doesn't bother me that much. Even though I too like the classics and would love another classic style RE, I have come to terms with accepting this one. Especially since this game does kinda take it back to the roots a bit at least with the story (by that I mean using multiple characters to complete the story mode to it's fullest understanding) and overall it's still a fun game, even if it's not the RE that you want it to be.Graphics are really nice looking (while having some muddy textures here and there not enough to ruin the experience), co-op is fun, though on PC there is a bit of a trick to getting it to work correctly, and overall just a really enjoyable game, at least to me. I platinumed this game on the PS3 and loved every minute playing the game I decided to get it on PC.One problem I will note about this version of the game other than the co-op trick is tha this port for some reason this game uses quite a bit of CPU power. It will run fine on a quad-core setup but recording might be a different matter depending how taxing your recording software is. I would recommend a higher core CPU (AMD) or a high cache CPU (Intel) to run and record this game at 60fps, since this is a VERY CPU heavy game.			"

												The first thing you should do when considering this game as a purchase, is ignore a lot of publisher reviews, such as Metacritic, IGN, Gamespot etc. After logging 4 hours into the game, I have to ask, why all the hate on this game? Granted that RE6 took a huge turn in comparison of each Resident evil game prior to this one, I still marvel at the gameplay of this installment. In RE6 you get 4 different campaigns, all supporting both local co-op and online co-op, so instantly there's a plus if you have any friends or family who want to play with you. Also, the game isn't the most graphically demanding game on the market, it's actually optimized surprisingly well. Probably my biggest problem though is that it takes away a lot of exploration from the game. On the majority of all chapters, you're limited to a rather linear path with next to no diversions or detour routes. While this wasn't exactly game breaking, it did take away a little bit of the experience. This being said, the atmosphere is built beautifully. With the soundtrack and sfx to set the mood, it's hard not to get immersed in the experience. In addition, RE6 takes a lot of elements from the installment that came before, there's a lot more action in RE6 than you would expect. Although the horror isn't quite there anymore, for anyone who loves zombies, anyone who loved RE5, I could not recommend this game any more.			"

												Got the game as a gift to play with my friend and from the special sell. The game is special in it's own way. This game is a mix, it good yet not good yet good again.Also don't questions the logic in this game.I enjoy the game even though it has flaws. Since I never play the other game I felt really confused at first as to who was who and what role they had in the universe. If you want to have a compleate collection go for it...and try and get it on special sell. I do enjoy the 2 player.This game is long to me and that cool but I had to take breaks. I thought only play as Leon and hi partner. After you beat his level you can play the other characters and see there side of the story.I have only play a bit of the orignal first Resident Evil game and a bit of Resident Evil Revelations. There a lot of nice maps and detail to things. Cutceans camera could be a bit more fluid and less choppy on transitions movment fad in or out to black. A cutscines will happen all a sudden where you walk a few distence then it cuts to a cutcanes I guess it to load the scenes instead of right after another scnese had already load but I notice this in other game I have played. The game is just weirdness in it own I guess. Menu option screen to just edit setting is  bit of a chore since your figuring out what the icon are even with a small discription. Control feel clunky sometime even though I adjusted the mouse sensitivity but don't feel improvment, this can be ignored because after a while you get used to it. Though would like to try with a game controler one day. The gun system feels similuer to Metal Gear 2 shooting style (and maybe there other games but Metal Gear is one I like and notice) but I felt they done it better or calibrated it better in Metal Gear. Some of the action seem redundent like ""open the door fence that has a bar, I can simply reach my arm over the metal bars and lift the metal wedge. nothing stoping me from doing that.""  ""Oh no, I can't climb over this desk it block by a small box and junk, yet in real life I can climb over a desk to not set off the sercurity gate alarm detector."" I could go on but yeah.I feel it like a crazy action movie I'm watching. The cars or truck that just come out of knowhere and I'm like ""HOW THE HECK DO YOU SURVIVE THAT?"" Even in video game logic. Maybe if the cheography sett up was done better it could be more belivabile like in some movies. Though animation is still great just feel like some of the film editing fad in to out could be a bit better.It's a decent game even though it might have flaws. From somebody like me who has not really play the other Resident Evil game and can say from a neutral point is that the game is decent for what it is atleast for me.			"

												I really enjoy this game. Honestly for RE going action, it really doesn't bother me that much. Even though I too like the classics and would love another classic style RE, I have come to terms with accepting this one. Especially since this game does kinda take it back to the roots a bit at least with the story (by that I mean using multiple characters to complete the story mode to it's fullest understanding) and overall it's still a fun game, even if it's not the RE that you want it to be.Graphics are really nice looking (while having some muddy textures here and there not enough to ruin the experience), co-op is fun, though on PC there is a bit of a trick to getting it to work correctly, and overall just a really enjoyable game, at least to me. I platinumed this game on the PS3 and loved every minute playing the game I decided to get it on PC.One problem I will note about this version of the game other than the co-op trick is tha this port for some reason this game uses quite a bit of CPU power. It will run fine on a quad-core setup but recording might be a different matter depending how taxing your recording software is. I would recommend a higher core CPU (AMD) or a high cache CPU (Intel) to run and record this game at 60fps, since this is a VERY CPU heavy game.			"

After the dreadful RE5 we kind of expected CAPCOM to take a step in this way so they gave us this ..... and i will not lie except Leon & Ada's Campaign & Mercennaries the whole game is underwhleming . If u expect the old survival horror like in RE1 or 2 or 3 u will not get that . It is a great Third Person Action Shooter just like SPec Ops ot Ghost REcon but falls real short on the horror part . I Like this game and has a huge campaign but its Michael Bay style gameplay will not satisfy the fans of the Orignal RE's			"

Every single decision made during the development of this game was the wrong one.However, it is also the funniest thing I have ever played. Welcome to the gaming version of The Room. Get a friend, set the language to French, and prepare to ATANCION your way through the most melodramatic pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥on Steam. Bonus if you have a ping of greater than 400 - you can play the rarely seen Glitch Edition, in which your characters scream constantly behind blank screens and occasionally bury their heads in the ground, along with a whole host of extra glitches.

												Very hard to find something positive to say about this one. Even for a console game it lacks gameplay and immersion.It does bring back a certain sense of nostalgia for when games were far more limited back in the old days of games arcades but this just lacks basic game play.  Half the game is simply, press V or press R or mash a couple of buttons really fast.  The controls are often a matter of trial an error breaking from the game and story while you work out what buttons it wants you to press.  Very little challenge and worse yet a console field of view with your character often taking up so much of the screen real eastate that its hard to see the action going on literally in front of you.  It was cheap on sale so I thought what happened to this series.  Now I see it died and should be left to rest in peace.			"

												While I've never heard of Resident Evil, I'm really smitten with the entire biohazard series, particularly this latest installment that balances romantic mood lighting, coy glances, full on tentacle♥♥♥♥♥♥ and tantalizing homoeroticism between Piers and Chris Redfield. If you liked the end of Titanic you'll greatly enjoy the tragic homage death scene of Piers while Chris Redfield holds him in his arms and slowly must learn to let go. The audience is given a real sense of tension when playing other character's campaigns. Slowly, but surely, the audience discovers that this game is an allegory for two young (albeit suspiciously attractive) homosexual lovers (Piers and Chris) and the other campaigns are merely metaphorical representations of the tremendously frustrating challenge of coming to terms with ones sexuality while in a world where it would seem utterly impossible to cling to waist-level or below cover. However, they realize that much like standing on top of aforementioned cover, they simply can't avoid who they are, and I tell you the ending is sadder than a  John Greene novel.			"

												I wanted to jump into Resident Evil 6 and castrate it for what it's become, but after a short time playing it I realized that if you accept that this is what Resident Evil is now; a third person shoot em up, then it's astonishingly good. The game mechanics are absolutely solid and the action is some of the most insane that I've experienced outside of spectacle fighters like God of War and Devil May Cry. The storyline has recovered surprisingly well after the death of Wesker in 5 and the games are starting to show signs of a future world-wide apocalypse. I would definitely recommend this to new players of the series and ask that older fans such as myself attempt to accept it for what it is. Would I prefer Capcom to go back to their roots? Absolutely. However in their minds that isn't financially viable and even after Revelations it's a safe bet to assume 7 will be as crazy, if not more so than 6. The metacritic is quite fair on this one, as I rate it...7/10			"

												Unfournatelly the horror of the Resident evil series is dead and gone. After Re3 the series turn to a more action based gameplay with keep the player interacted with QTE's and other prompts like that. Resident Evil 6 does just that, and does it well. The game have a kinda buggy cam the can ♥♥♥♥ you up when sprinting but when you get into some of the game modes such as Mercinaries and it's no mercy counter part you get a massvie joy-gasm of fun and death. The campaign still tries to keep the horror idea with Leon's and Ada's but after years of the same zombie jump-scare it's almost impossble to be afriad of something like that again. Chris's campaign turns in to a hardcore shooter more in the vains of a CoD or GoW game and delivers the action instantally. Jake's will not be mention due to personal disgust for it but it's supossed to be based more about RE3 with Ustanak as Nemesis. In a short summary I give this game a 7/10. It has it's flaws like a lot of other games but it's still enjoyable with friends.			"

												I love Resident Evil. Pure honesty even taking the name away this is a clunky mess. Graphically it looks decent.  I do not recommend this game as even a fan unless you catch it for 6 bucks. I will explain why I feel this way.The game is unbalanced far as enemies go....headshots ummm like 3 to 7 so being rewarded for conserving ammo by stockpiling it by being accurate does nothing for you. It doesnt matter anyways because theres tons of ammo. You will die due to cheap deaths. I can literally knock an enemy down with melee and stomp its head for a much easier time. Why have guns in the game just use you're foot.The action mechanics are cool and very John Woo movie like...But they in my opinion are for show more than they are helpful.I will say they add very light and I mean light puzzle mechanics to the game. The levels are actually pretty cool and especially in Leons chapter...but the problem is with limited interaction with the background theres no real reason to even explore. Not saying there isnt typical notes and journals to read they are just there for filler only. Having played Resident Evil Revelations 2 which thumps this game even in its episodic nature its far superior.There is no survival horror here. Theres no conserving ammo health or anything else.You do get skill point drops in the shape of pawns and statues that drop to use for new skills like better accuracy and so on.If Leon Ada and Chris were'nt in the game it could be a very generic action game.Not to say that the action is dull its very action oriented...to the QTE events in the opening of Leons chapter to the scripted areas of the story.This felt like an off the rails house of the dead game.You will either like it or you won't theres really no middle ground but do not expect anything even close to Resident Evil.

There was almost no bullets, so you had to smash the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everybody (which looked pretty awesome, but it was very inafective againt 10+ enemies).And the controls... They really really sucks. You Sprint on ""SPACE"", like WTF??!?! And you also do actions with that buttom, so if you change it to, for an example ""Left shift"" You would also open doors on ""left shift""...So i wouldn't recommend anyone this game.			"

												""QTE is my favorite part of the game"", said no one ever!  Spoiler alert, this game features excessive amounts of QTE. Interspersed lightly among the button mashing is the potential for a good game.  But that potential is sadly never realized in this pseudo Left for dead resident evil hybrid.  Most of the sub bosses share a striking resemblance to Left 4 dead special creatures. There are also constant interruptions to game play and repetitive boss fights which further add to an already frustrating and disappointing experience! There was potential for something great here and it was squandered! Hopefully the devs pull their heads out of their asses and get it right next time...			"

												See this review will see this game as a part of the RE series as in general . After the dreadful RE5 we kind of expected CAPCOM to take a step in this way so they gave us this ..... and i will not lie except Leon & Ada's Campaign & Mercennaries the whole game is underwhleming . If u expect the old survival horror like in RE1 or 2 or 3 u will not get that . It is a great Third Person Action Shooter just like SPec Ops ot Ghost REcon but falls real short on the horror part . I Like this game and has a huge campaign but its Michael Bay style gameplay will not satisfy the fans of the Orignal RE's			"

												Game is decent, although it seems there are less games open for RE6 than there are for RE5, so I have to play solo most of the time (although I was playing in the morning, not evening yet) Campaign can be freely accessed so it can be confusing, recommended to play it with a ""guide"" of chapters that player should do before the others (not just from top to left, but certain chapters with certain characters to keep chronology, and game doesn't indicate that) Extra modes like merceneries are fun, game feels different than RE5 and as always requires some learning of controlls. Playing as monster in random players compaign is good idea, but hardly any chance for the monsters to do anything in my opinion. All in all 8 of 10 and a recommendation to all RE fans. The franchise is still interesting for me :)			"

												""QTE is my favorite part of the game"", said no one ever!  Spoiler alert, this game features excessive amounts of QTE. Interspersed lightly among the button mashing is the potential for a good game.  But that potential is sadly never realized in this pseudo Left for dead resident evil hybrid.  Most of the sub bosses share a striking resemblance to Left 4 dead special creatures. There are also constant interruptions to game play and repetitive boss fights which further add to an already frustrating and disappointing experience! There was potential for something great here and it was squandered! Hopefully the devs pull their heads out of their asses and get it right next time...			"

												First time I've done a review and after having fun with the two Revelations games and RE5, I've found RE6 to be extremely unintiutive and frustrating. Despite the fact the game allows for movement whilst shooting (which RE5 didn't) the controls and entry into the game are just plain unclear. Several of the quick time events are downright horrible and require instant reaction, which you won't have the first time.The inventory system is also a mess in that you have to go through a whole bunch of keys and combinations to do the most basic things. Even just using a First Aid spray I just found out is stupidly implemented in that it counts as a grenade and has to be used as one without zero information or useability from the inventory screen. It's just a clunky mess. It might get better but if you're coming from RE5 or a Revelations game, prepare to be very frustrated.			"

This feels like a very bad port, I played on normal mode and was given very little instruction to what I was doing half of the time and a time limit until I died which annoyed.What annoyed me most about this game was the fact I was pressing random buttons to avoid stuff more than any actual action or shooting -.-			"

												They tried to copy the films and it didn't workCapcom Certainly Dropped and Egg with this, and I don't mean as a RE Title, forget about that and it is still a bad game, the films and the games should have been left as completely seperate entities.Despite the controversy and slating this got upon release when I saw it in the Summer sale for Six Bucks it was out of sheer morbid curiosity that I bought it.  The Portmanteau twist was something that I found interesting and if it had been done properly then it would have been amazing, but from what I understand Capcom blew the budget for this on Corperate Suits, Advisors and other assorted Professional Butt-Kissers who know nothing about actual Games or the fans that buy them.   Also while playing this the inconsistency of the graphics and a few other things gave me the sneeking impresion that corners had been cut and this had been rushed through so I did a little Due Dilligence which I found interesting. By far the largest RE game to date is the complete Revelations 2 with a Whopping Big 18 GB.  Coming second (surprisingly) is the HD Remaster of the Gamecube Remake at 17 GB.  However RE 6 comes Third at 16 GB, and that's after CAPCOM added more content because of the complaints,  so it would indeed seem that something had definately gone wrong in the production of this.  Let's face it these days most Independent Small Producers make product that hits around the 16 GB mark, but a Mega Companly such as CAPCOM can't produce better than this?!?!  Ultimately Capcom's clear distain of the fans is what wrecked a game that COULD have been a convincing Comeback for Resident Evil.First of all if you made it past the epic Train Wreck of an Intro Level without uninstalling it, either out of sheer frustration or because you genuinely thought it was broken, then well done because many have fallen here!   Ok that over and done with perhaps we can enjoy the actual game?  Nope, the PC version is still a complete stinker.....and I get the creepy, unshakable feeling that the Suits at Capcom were trying to punish us for not liking the change of direction they started in RE4 as I have not come across a game that does so much to deliberately sabotage itself  since  The Fabulous Wanda.  These awful game Mechanics don't happen by accident, someone has to plan and and code them, then they have to make it through testing and managment approval.  I really feel this may well be an act of spite from Capcom because we wouldn't jump through their Hoops and Like what they told us to Like.  Just a feeling...Visually it tries to be Epic, Glorious and Cinematic - it's such a shame that Two thirds of the time will be spent looking at the Keyboard!  If you thought RE5 has mega amounts of Quick Time then you ain't seen nothing yet.  The ""JAKE"" Level is almost exclusivly QT, and Visually Incomprehensable QT at that!  Instant Kill After Instant Kill after Instant Kill after Instant Kill makes the Two Hours completing this level this seem MUCH longer.  Hey Capcom...I didn't spend huge amounts of money on Top Quality components, sound systems and a HUGE TV so I can get neck Strain looking at my bloody Keyboard!!   I bought this equipment because I wanted an immersive experience and to get ""Lost"" in fantasy for a few hours.  Personally I HATE Quick Time because it destroys the experience just as certainly as that annoying idiot who Talks over the Film in the Cinema does.  This isn't Dragons Lair in 1985 for crying out loud, but that's what ""Playing"" RE6 feels like for the most part.  Give me Tank Controls any day over this.Ranting aside, and allowing for the Awful ""Wesker JR"" Level  what you have here are essentially Three versions of Mercinaries that try to share a common story but it's been done so badly that I just didn't care. The Chris level is a Buggy, Frustrating Clunk-Fest that REALLY showcases how bad the AI Partner system is (who just blocks your way from progressing and gets you killed)  and the Genius idea of having the game root you to the spot in crucial arears of battle while choosing the most unhelpful camera angle possible for you.  It also  unfathomably switches back to Tank Controls for the last boss fight which again are mostly uresponsive so good luck with that.  There is a resonably good Leon stage with a passable Ada stage so to make things slightly better save these for last.  Revelations 2 should have been the Real RE6, it is a much better game in all respects and I really do feel for all you whom bought RE6 at full price.Anyone else notice that they stole the music from the Ravenhearst Games?

												""QTE is my favorite part of the game"", said no one ever!  Spoiler alert, this game features excessive amounts of QTE. Interspersed lightly among the button mashing is the potential for a good game.  But that potential is sadly never realized in this pseudo Left for dead resident evil hybrid.  Most of the sub bosses share a striking resemblance to Left 4 dead special creatures. There are also constant interruptions to game play and repetitive boss fights which further add to an already frustrating and disappointing experience! There was potential for something great here and it was squandered! Hopefully the devs pull their heads out of their asses and get it right next time...			"

												This is an incredible game and I really do enjoy it but I just feel that it has a predictable atmosphere, the scares are too gimmicky (almost non-existant) and that the save points are WAY too far apart. The last one is the main reason I would not recommend this game to friends (IF I HAD ANY). I get to play games in short burst so having to play close to 2 hours until it saves is stupid. I unlocked a new gun and then I had to come off the computer as there was a power cut, BOOM! 2-3 hours work and a new gun right down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Well played CapCom. I used to love the Res Evil Series. 4 Was my favourite but they have got more and more action based and have no more scare factor. The last good Res Evil was Revelations imo. If you want an amazing game with a griiping storyline and proper (sort of) scares, get that :)			"

												While not a bad game, it is a big departure from the kind of game (such as RE:4) I was hoping for. A bit too much fast paced action, not enough survival horror. If you like that kind of game RE:6 DOES have a lot to offer, however it isn't for me.			"

												Unplayable PC port. My hours played is valid, finished Leon's campaign and was stuck at Chris chapter five (last campiagn) due to repetitive failed chase scene becuase of poor keyboard controls. Died over +15 times in most chase scences and finally gave up in Chri's campiagn. The first half of Leon campaign was great then it became a grind.  Didn't bother with Jakes story and uninstalled this action game. Not a true survival horror.			"

												Overall, I think this game is just objectively poorly made and lazy. Though it's by no means good, it can be fun if you have someone to play it with and don't take it too seriously. I'll try to compile pros and cons as best I can: Cons: The controls are generally terrible. I've only played the PC version, but I've heard console controls are better, so you might wanna try that if you're looking to buy this. For example, the buttons to slide over cover are almost the exact same as the buttons to take cover. Unlike most games, where you can take cover and remain there until you choose to move, you have to hold a button the entire time you're in cover in addition to the buttons to fire. They also have a ""quick shot"" button combination that is the same as the button combination to fire normally, which is annoying.This game doesn't have the pause menu of RE 4 or the ability to assign items to the keyboard like RE 5. Instead, you have to manually scroll through every weapon in your inventory while everything in the known universe is attacking you. Good luck, son.This game does away with tank controls, which were a common complaint about older RE titles. This would be fine, expect for some completely baffling reason they didn't fix the problem that made them use tank controls in the first place. There are many scenes where the camera suddenly shifts angles from the usual third person to in front of you. If you weren't expecting this (and you won't be), you'll find yourself suddenly running the wrong away and immediately dying.The game will randomly switch into cutscene mode to show you your next objective, without actually pausing gameplay. The camera will return to your control just in time to see yourself get surround by the enemies that were closing in the whole time.Sometimes the game will enter a sort of cutscene mode when fighting bosses, during which they are invulnerable. The game will still allow you to fire on them during this, though, and it's hard to tell when you can actually hurt them and when you can't, since they hardly respond either way.Quick time events....quick time events everywhere! Dear lord.There are many moments where things can instantly kill you, and the only way to avoid them is to know they're coming in advance. This ain't a platformer, son.The above point wouldn't be so bad if the checkpoints for this game weren't completely terrible. Also, every chapter is very long, especially the first time you play through them. There is no manual saving and what few checkpoints they have are very unreliable.LOADING! Now, I'll try to be fair and say maybe the length of the loading screens is the fault of my computer/connection. However; the frequency of them is still ridiculous. Loading screen, play for 2 minutes, loading screen, watch cutscene, loading screen. JUST LET ME PLAYThe game can't figure out what genre it is. It's clear they tried to appease more old school RE fans with slower horror/puzzle based sections while still attracting newer players with action packed shooter segments. The end result is that both styles are very poorly done due to a lack of focus and polishing on either.Jake Muller Pros: The graphics are a thing of beauty. It's probably the only thing they worked hard on.They actually went the extra mile and gave every character their own individual melee moves.The plot is just as goofy and terrible as past RE games, just in a more action movie sense than b movie. Enjoy ripping the stupidity to shreds.GOOD STUFF! THANKS! NO WAY, NOT NOW! BEAUTIFUL! GOOD STUFF! GRATZIE! Annoy your friends by spamming commands!Stare at Leon and Helena's booties. MmhmmHas one of the best RE villians ever.All in all, don't by this game if you are expecting something fantastic. Don't buy it if you don't have someone fun to play it with. DEFINITELY don't buy it full price. However, if it's on sale and you just want something dumb to kill some time with, it's not that bad.			"

												JUST AWFUL.prosNOTHINGcons- settings UI. there is no texts but icons. so u must put on cursol to see what these icons are for.- camera. no slider to adjust FOV though its narrow. so u will get motion sickness in 1st ten minutes.- head bobbing. of course u can NEVER turn it off. surely u will puke after some hours like zombies.- NOT free mouse look. u will be limited sometimes even to watch ur back. - quick time events. even when u must just run, it demands QTE with stupid unreasonable keys. - unskippable cut scenes. if u died in QTE, u MUST see the same movie repeatedly until succeed.these are my 1st 10minutes playing review.but only within 10minutes, this game showed these fatal cons.and i must say about the 1st zombies battle was awful too.u will be surrounded by about 10 zombies in the night street filled with abandoned cars.but there is no enough lights. only u can do is to increase brightness with settings.so u must struggle in the darkness against zombies with annyoing backlights from carsthese shi-t backlighs never light up ur battlefield enough though idk why, they just blind ur eyes.maybe it means by the game director, ""have fun my battle design in the ♥♥♥♥ing dark place, nerds"".so i STOPPED playing this game after 10 minutes from start.and 1 more fun thing to tell u, this game does NOT have the button to quit.only the text appears in the title screen, ""press any key to start, blah""so u MUST press alt + F4 to escape from this♥♥♥♥♥♥game's hell,but even these keys are recognized as ""hitting keys"" to start by this stupid client.of course ESC key NEVER works too in the title screen.i wanna give 100 thumbdowns for this game.i noticed now why this game was bundled in my Nvidia video card.if u expect the fun like Left 4 Dead for this game,u will be betrayed and depressed like a zombie soon.

												This game is decent but not for a resident evil title, re6 is nothing like the classic resident evil titles which where what made the franchise what it is, all campaigns where made by a seperate team, which makes each campaign seem like a different game almost.  Leons campaign wasnt scary to me nothing about the game really is unless u get scared easily, also his campaign is littered with cinematics and quick time events, i noticed chris's campaign didnt have hardly any quick time events or cinematics just nonstop action in that one.i own re1 remake re2 re3 code veronica x now those are the best resident evil games ever, the music in those games was so awesome and atmopheric re6 music sucks, also the survival horror in the originals made it hella scary the fact u had very limited ammunition and had to run from the zombies and there where moments of tension everywhere where u where walking through areas where theres no enemies yet u still feel like they could pop out anywhere and kill u, the game put butterflys in my stomach i got so scared many times in those classics and i have many memories about those games.re6 is a decent action game, and i think the co-op is fun along with getting skill points for new skills, also the graphics are pretty nice and the cutscenes are well done, but the storyline isnt that great, although the resident evil series doesnt have the strongest storyline  the classics where alot more memorable and i prefer them, the puzzles in the classics where tough and when u did one on your own without looking it up on the computer it makes u feel like u accomplished something in which makes u not forget that moment and what it took to beat the game.If i was to make a resident evil game, i would keep the tank controls, it makes the game harder and your character feels less like a badass doing rolls and owning the zombies instead of being overwelmed and running, i would change to 3d backgrounds like u did in this game but with the classic camera angles. i saw a few of classic camera angles in re6 on leons campaign in a few areas and liked them.ADD BACK THE SURVIVAL HORROR!I dont want a shooting gallery where i never run outta ammo and the zombies just keep coming to where i expect this and am never scared, supplies should be limited and shouldnt fall from zombies when they die but should be scattered across the map, i want to feel the terror of walking not expecting zombies to pop out.Also the item box returns and the ink ribbon...CAPCOM: sry didnt quite impress me with this game.but i loved re1 remake on gamecube that is how its done and that game was hella scary and was a remake done right, if u would just go back to this style i would be jumping to buy the next resident evil instead of sluggishly thinking about getting it.

												It has rough controls, sudden death QTEs that appear out of nowhere, a camera that forces the player to look at a direction for cinematic purposes, atrocious inventory system, no weapon upgrade system, alternate costumes are unusable in the campaign, and the inability to pause even in offline mode♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the hell out of me. The story is typical anime-style with Michael Bay explosions every few minutes (I felt sorry for these characters because they can't rest and encounters one bad scenario after the another). This is not survival horror.  On the plus side, this game is very well produced, well-acted, attractive-looking, and engine performance is well optimized for the PC.After all those negatives, I still like RE6. I like the game. Yes, as a fan and followed the numbered REs, I'm biased. If you're a fan and wants to see more of the characters you loved and hated since RE1, this game is not to be missed.7/10			"

												Resident evil... it has changed quite a lot since that first time we stepped inside that mansion. There are a lot of mixed reviews regarding RE6 - what did I think? I actually liked it, and this comes from an all-time fan of the franchise. I guess you have to look at this game not as a survival horror but as an action game with old characters. The campaign is really fun and very hard due to the new controls but at the end satisfying and isn't that what we look for in a video game? Having fun but getting challenged? Now I'm not saying that this is the best RE game (I think that title belongs to RE4), but it is a good direction to take, maybe in the future we might get to see these action-based controls in a more suvival horrorish kind of game, who knows, that's all up to capcom. But you know what I would criticize? I think it's time for a change of characters - I liked Sherry and Jake as new protagonists, but seriously it's time for Chris to hang the towel, he's been on RE1, RE: Code Veronica, RE5, RE6 and Revelations (the ones that I know), so there's not much character development left.
