												TL;DR: massively overhyped, it falls short of my expectations.I pre-ordered this game because of the pre release information.It is (afaik) the first Unreal Engine 4 game that's actually released and - if trailers are to be trusted - it seemed to use that engine quite well to create a believable nightmare.This version however, seems to suffer from weak textures and visuals that would have been possible on the Unreal engine 3 as well.Besides that, there are quite a lot of users right now suffering from crashes and instabilites in the Steam forums.(and there is no way to change the game language completely - I am forced to use German text with spoken English, because the game simply won't become 100% English when set to that in Steam settings)The game plays in a hospital / asylum / prison, which are all stuffed into the same building.Your character starts off with a smartphone (doubling as a map and a torchlight) and has to gather so called relics.Each relic is commented by some person with the comments being somewhere between annoying and a minor inconvenience - they just don't actually add to the gameplay or the atmosphere.Then there is the actual game which has you run through corridors of ever-repeating models (the doors, the actual items placed around the rooms, ...) and visuals.This game seems like a cheap modification for UT3, but neither the visuals nor any other aspect live up to my expectations of what the Unreal engine 4 would be capable of.In that maze of repeating corridors there are random ghosts (which - you guessed it - seem like clones) spawning in on you.While this might at first seem like a nice change of pace, simply because flickering lights and closing doors have been done before, it soon becomes exhausting.You have got one and a half way of getting rid of ghosts.The most effective one is to actually get rid of them by using a signalling torch similar to those used in road accidents (which you find on a regular basis in this madhouse...) - however, the next ghost might spawn in only a few seconds later.Then there is the possibility of running away.When actually choosing flight instead of fight, you will run in a ghost around the next corner, so it is not really an alternative in the long run.(Besides, it's a maze that you are running through, with your path clearly laid out - so running away from the ghost actually forces you to retreat into the maze and hinders your progress, rendering it - all things considered - unfeasible)The story seems somewhat normal.There is this hospital in which patients die of ""mysterious"" causes, start seeing things, ... - the usual stuff.Although I have not yet played through the whole game, I already regret pre ordering the game.The gameplay has already overstayed its welcome, the visuals seem dated and the overall atmosphere just isn't as good as it seemed to be in the trailers.While I got it for almost 10$ it simply is not as satisfying as I am used to when comparing it to other games I got for this amount (and less).

												I started this game without knowing anything about it.You randomly start in some abandoned building as a girl / woman with a smartphone through which some person talks to you.You look around, find some notes, nothing too special.There are blue notes and red notes. Once you pick up your first red note, a counter appears in the bottom right. 1 / 6 for instance. Seems a bit familiar.There are two types of items you get walking around the halls: Glowsticks and Flares.Glowsticks give a little bit more light and hint you at things you can actually interact with. Also they show your footsteps, helping you with orientation. This is quite important as the map on your smartphone is so tiny that you can hardly see stuff, even when zooming in (putting it closer to your face).Flares have a defensive purpose. I'll explain later what that means.So basically there is one simple and quite obvious pattern:1. Get red notes2. Find key to exit3. Enter next area.Now where is the scary part?Besides some objects randomly moving when you pass them (of course only the first time to come along) and the actually quite good ambience, there is one threat so far: A ghost girl.Is she scary? no... during the first chapter you see her already when she is like 100 meters away from you and you can casually walk away. When you look at her she attacks by standing still and screaming at you, which doesn't even have an effect, if you are far away. If this actually hits you, the screen starts turning black from outside to inside, making it extremely hard to see. Your visions gets better over time though. To avoid this, hold a flare in the ghost's face.Once you reach the next chapter and it all starts again the ghost will actually appear directly behind you and there you have your slenderman clone.Honestly, for anyone who has experience with horror, this game has nothing to offer except for startling you every now and then.If you never touched a horror game before and want to start with something that isn't too horrible or if you plain and simple love to do the same thing over and over again, feel free to take a look at this.Anybody who wants horror beyond cheap jumpscares and some actual gameplay should ignore this game.

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Daylight 

			Views: 1,304		

			Is this Unreal 4 powered procedurally generated horror title one worth coming back to, or should it have been locked away? Trent finds out when he dives into Daylight.		

With the rising popularity of YouTube let's plays and Twitch streaming, horror games have enjoyed a bit of a resurgence. This resurgence is, oddly enough, not due to people's desires to play these games themselves, but rather to watch others play them on the internet. I digress, whatever the reason, developers are back to delivering scars and suspense to those who have the steely nerves required to complete these games. Daylight attempts to elbow it's way to the front of the crowd, nudging past fan favorites like Slender: The Eight Pages, Outlast and Amnesia: The Dark Decent. With it's procedurally generated mazes and visuals bolstered by Epic's Unreal 4 engine, Daylight has the goods to garner the interest of fans but does it deliver the tension and scares of it's contemporaries? Daylight wastes no time with any kind of lead-in or build up. Immediately, you take control of Sarah, a girl stranded in a dilapidated hospital who... Well, you aren't really told anything about Sarah...You don't see her face, aren't clued into her age or her background and why she's in the middle of this hospital is a mystery. The most intriguing aspect of Sarah is the bizzare maze-like network of lines that appear on her arm. With only her cell phone and a mysterious male voice to guide her, Sarah must wander around in search of documents called remnants and collecting all of the documents in an area allows her to obtain a sigil which unlocks a magically sealed door to the next area. If this sounds vaguely familiar, that's because it's pretty much the same set up as the Slender games. Along the way, pictures will fall off of walls unexpectedly, drawers from filing cabinets with shoot across the room and wheelchairs and IV drip racks will squeak across the floor in this veritable digital funhouse. Nestled between each area that hosts a remnant hunt are areas that require some light puzzle solving and collecting more documents that attempt to build a narrative. The puzzles are inconsequential, requiring some switch flipping and crate pushing. Sarah can also use glowsticks to illuminate objects of interest since apparently the magical elements she encounters respond to chemiluminescence... Lockers, supply boxes and crates can all be opened for flares, glowsticks and documents. The problem is that all of this can be made frustrating as a result of clunky controls. Opening a locker can involve and awkward tango while trying to prompt the contextual command to pop up and grant Sarah access to it's contents. Pushable crates can only be moved from one side so players must circle them like a shark in order to find the side they can interact with. Sarah also moves at a ponderous pace by default meaning the patience of a zen master is required to navigate the environment. While she can sprint, the exaggerated head bob can make some players sick and is at the very least disorienting, making exploration difficult. The witches that want to tear Sarah limb from limb appear at random, often behind players and can be warded off with flares. Flares and glowsticks are not exactly in short supply but the real challenge is making it to the magically sealed doors with the sigil in hand since your trusty flares cannot be used. It can get frustrating when you find yourself cornered by a spawning witch with no recourse. While players can get the same type of gameplay from several other games on the market, one would at least expect the narrative to differentiate Daylight from other titles. This would be a mistake however, since Daylight is on a strict diet of cliches and hackery. By dropping it's protagonist into a scenario without any introduction it drives a large wedge between players and the characters involved. Where the protagonists of other horror games reflect on their growing unease or decaying sanity, Sarah does nothing to reflect on her predicament aside from calling out into the dark, announcing that she is aware of some unseen presence. All of this culminates in an inane plot twist that has little consequence given the abysmal character development. There is nothing for players to be invested in and the mysteries surrounding the hospital, it's patients and Sarah merely come off as set dressing.    Given that Daylight is running on the shiny new Unreal 4 engine, one would at least expect it to look great but the procedural level generation betrays this expectation by requiring environments to be modular making it reminiscent of being trapped in one of Skyrim's dungeons. One room offers few details to distinguish itself from another and, were it not for the fact that there is an ever present map on Sarah's phone, getting lost would be a frequent occurrence. Props are generic and as a result many areas don't feel like they have a purpose and the decaying buildings that players have to navigate look sparse, with even simple details like windows being few and far between. Lighting is also rather generic as a result of this design so don't expect to see any of the extraordinary expressionist surroundings offered by a game like Outlast. Continuing the trend of treading well worn ground, Daylight also suffers from it's choice of environments by featuring horror game staples like a hospital, prison, sewers and a forest. Ultimately, Daylight lacks the all important atmosphere that allows a horror game to truly get under your skin in a way that jump scares cannot. Despite looking like a student project, the frame rate has a tendency to chug in some areas and I did experience a crash during my two hour playthrough. Sound design keeps the tension up but does little to stand out from similar games. Daylight is truly embarrassing as it gormandizes on cliches and tropes, digests and squeezes them out of it's sphincter for Twitch streamers and let's play hosts to gobble up. There is absolutely no reason to endure Daylight, even with it's short play time. The decision to make Daylight a procedurally generated experience cuts it's nose off to spite it's face. Randomizing the design of levels does so much to negatively impact an already lackluster experience by stripping the atmosphere from the experience. The hubris required to commit such an atrocious design blunder in order to add replayability to a title that isn't even worth seeing through once is staggering. Everything you can find in Daylight is available in other, more enjoyable games. The uninspired gameplay and fan fiction grade narrative have no place in a world where titles like Amnesia and Outlast exist. If only this game never saw the light of day...			"

												Understanding Daylight isn’t difficult. If you’re familiar with games like Slender or Amnesia you’ll have a fair idea of what needs to be done.  Now not to take away anything from Daylight as it is in it’s own right a game separate from many others like it, I feel maybe I’ve become a bit tired of the same “spooky” tricks laid out in front of me.Wheel chairs magically move. Drawers of desks slam open. Doors slowly creek open while the lights flicker from above. Wandering through what seems to be endless corridors, searching for remnants to proceed becomes tiresome even after thirty minutes.The story plays out through text for a majority of the time. Giving you some insight to the horrific deeds that as plagued the hospital. Every once in awhile a man’s voice would chirp through your cell phone saying awkward things while Sarah annoying asks “is someone there,” repeatedly.Daylight was a short 1-2 hour trek through familiar territory.  The story, the setting, the environment, it feels like Deja Vu and it’s hard to wash those feelings away.Get more http://www.1up-island.com/10727/daylight-pc-review "

												While I generally like Daylight, right now it is hard to give a recommendation. The gameplay, and interesting story bits are there, but, the game is so poorly optimized that it runs about as well as a fat kid in gym class.Edit: I decided to give this game another go after all the patches the developer has put out to make it run better. The utter fact that the diagnostic tool forbids the game from launching with FRAPS running is completely shady. I was going to give a score of 5 out of 10 because yes, there have been improvements, but, the fact they are trying to prevent me from recording their game has now infact lowered the score from a 5 to a 2. (I did eventually work my way around their stupid little diagnostic tool)Final review score for Daylight, due to shady practices in trying to stifle recorded video of this game, a 2 out of 10.			"

												As a long term survival horror fan, I feel like the community is being way too harsh on this game, mostly due to completely wrong expectations.If you are truly interested in Daylight, but the negative reviews keep you off, please read this to understand what exactly this game has to offer before expecting anything else from it.Most survival horror games can be divided into two categories: puzzle-based action-adventures (early Resident Evil, Silent Hill, ObsCure) and the recent story-driven run and hide investigations (Penumbra, Amnesia, Outlast).Which one is Daylight? Neither.Remember Slenderman? The one that was in early beta but still got popular due to its basic yet effective gameplay formula? Since it became so popular, we had a huge number of clones, remakes and spiritual successors with different interpretations of the story and the monster himself. I don't know about you, but none of them were truly my cup of tea - not even the full Slender: The Arrival game itself.Daylight is, though. It follows Slenderman's legacy every step of the way, while trading the open forest for procedurally generated corridors, which works for this type of gameplay. If you don't know what Slenderman is, here's a simple explanation of its mechanics: collect documents, avoid the enemy and never look at him. Looking at him triggers his aggro and scariness ensues. Very simple yet very effective.Daylight uses the same mechanics with a few extra touches here and there which is enough to make the game stand out without overcomplicating it.Its main issue is relying almost purely on cheap jumpscares, although even without them the atmosphere is quite unnerving. And as far as jumpscares go, Daylight can at the very least show some good ones. The ghost is well detailed, and the sound design is genuinely creepy. Bricks are expected to be♥♥♥♥♥♥I understand why people dislike it. It's not as story-heavy as one would want, although IMO the ending was worth reading through the notes you find. Its scares are cheap and don't change throughout the game, the ghosts can be outsmarted and the overall experience leaves you wanting just a tad bit more... but if it's scares you want, then scares you shall get.It's one of those games that you should force your friends to play and just enjoy them jumping out of their seats. Definitely far from a top-tier survival horror, but nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. Know what the game offers and you shall be not disappointed with what it doesn't offer.			"

												I really, really dug this game, despite its arguable flaws.  What flaws are these?  Well, it could be construed as a tad repetitious, especially in some of its scenery (though having worked in a number of hospitals, I can tell you that's exactly how they are!), and also in some of its gameplay (find some notes, open a portal, start lookin' for notes again).  It's also a little unclear early on as to what exactly you're supposed to be doing, though once you get the hang of it, you generally know what to do.      This game seems to have taken a lot of other flack, which I don't necessarily agree with, and which I'll address now.  Firstly, ""It's too easy once you work out to just look away from the witches"".  Okay, I guess I must be a particularly skittish individual, 'cause I still managed to die a good few times after reading these words of wisdom.  Sure, after a while I got the gist and improved a bit, but the whole idea is you're supposed to PANIC, and not just ""calmly"" look away, because IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SCARY GAME.  Something which a lot of these cocky young ♥♥♥♥♥ don't seem to understand:  It requires a bit of suspension of disbelief, a genuine DESIRE to scare yourself, in order to have that effect.  If you give in to that desire, then I believe this game does a VERY good job of scaring you shiteless.  Saying, ""Ooh, all you have to do is not look at the witch"", is a bit like saying, ""All you have to do to stop a great white shark devouring you is punch it on the nose as it's swimming towards you.""  Yeah, right.  Like to see you arrogant little turds try THAT one on, sometime...    Secondly, the inevitable ""Slender"" comparisons.  Okay, YES.  It IS a ""Slender"" clone.  But for my money, it's probably the BEST ""Slender"" clone I've played yet...and I've damn well nearly played all of 'em, including ""Slender: The Arrival"", which certainly ISN'T quite as good as this in my humble opinion.  When I wrote a review for that game, I accused it of ""cheating"" ('cause sometimes it's just plain dumb luck which leads to ol' Slendy teleporting RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU).  This game plays MUCH fairer, providing a decent enough challenge, but as I alluded to above, if you manage to keep your wits and your nerves under control, you should MOSTLY be okay.  MOSTLY!  And okay, so it ends in a spooky forest, after covering many of the other cliché horror environments such as hospitals, prisons and sewers, but if you're willing to accept that it's a somewhat DERIVATIVE game, you may just have yourself a pretty good time.  It was compelling enough for me that I finished it in one night, something which I almost never do (not even for a game only a few hours long).  And finally, the asking price of ten dollars is more than reasonable for what you get (the procedurally-generated elements and multiple difficulty levels no doubt granting it some replayability).      Man, if people are seriously inclined to complain about a game of this quality, for this price, we really must be a spoiled ♥♥♥♥ing bunch...maybe we'd be more grateful if we'd been BURNED AT THE STAKE like them witches, eh?  Then we might actually have something to COMPLAIN about! Verdict: 9/10. (Oh, and PS: Fantastic ending!  Though the end credits music which comes on immediately after is a tad abrupt and inappropriate, haha...)			"

												From the get-go we are tossed onto our asses into an asylum with only a cell phone and a cheap Malcolm McDowell imitator barking nonsense over the speaker. He just spouts out grade-school philosophy such as “Life is but a butterfly’s dream,” and “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned… and you’ve scorned them all.” With @John_Henry_Eden_ebooks as our good company, we stumble around in the dark hallways (using useless glowsticks and flares) of which you will see the same of many times. One of Daylight’s big selling points is that it is randomly generated as you play so you can never have the same play experience twice. Well that doesn’t help when every single room is the same non-memorable one over and over again, does it?The goal of every area you visit is to collect 6 “remnants”, which is an absurdly vague way of saying “Find 6 pieces of paper with a red rune on them, some of which will be hidden in boxes on the walls and in desks”. Once you’ve stuffed enough Macguffins into your jacket, Ol’ Phoney pipes up mentioning that the “Sigil” has been revealed. While that sounds like something deep and meaningful, all it really turns out to be is a pair of surgical scissors or a porcelain doll floating in a room covered in glowing writing that you most likely already found before you had all six remnants. In taking the Sigil, you become defenseless as you are no longer able to whip out any flares or glowsticks to protect yourself.…oh, right. I forgot something. The ghost. From the outset you’re being pursued by an apparition that appears out of the blue with little rhyme or reason. My first encounter with it was as follows: I heard a banshee cry out from behind me as I was in mid-turn. My cell phone minimap was beginning to distort with random artifacts and glyphs. I stopped moving and waited for a moment, noticing that I could see what appeared to be the leg of the creature standing there just to my right. I contemplated for a moment what may happen should I continue to turn. All the while it persisted on making weird hissy noises. And then, almost as quickly as it came, the creature disappeared. It felt like one of those hilariously bad special effects sequences in old low budget films where they paused recording while the person or object was moved off camera while everyone else held still before continuing to record to give the illusion that they had vanished in an instant.You see, Daylight has a lot of problems. It fails to be truly engaging to the player at any point. All plot exposition is taken care of via the notes and remnants (there are two colors of seal on the paper to designate the difference!) which you can skip most of and most likely will because it is all drivel. Any tension is completely ruined by the fact that none of the game’s systems work to support each other. Sarah can sprint indefinitely, which makes the ghost a trivial occurrence in the event that it manages to even spawn. Resource management is merely an afterthought thanks to being given free flares and glowsticks in almost every other room. And if you manage to fill up too much on either, finding one in a container causes you to just completely discard it. I’m pretty sure no human alive is going to just throw out a precious glowstick before finding at least one extra pocket to cram it into.The game does not look nearly as demanding as it claims to be and none of the setpieces are visually interesting or even memorable. Between the campy dialog, shoddy notes and head-shake inducing comments in the UI message area claiming “They will come to haunt you”, every bit of the writing is downright amateurish and is something to be ashamed of. The in-game Twitch streaming support tells me more about what was on the developers’ minds than anything else in the game. They were banking on the braindead simple stream avenue to perpetuate the game with its enticing look and promise of replayability via randomization.What they forgot to do was make a game worth playing, watching or thinking about.

												Daylight is a First person horror game -or at least wannabe horror game-  with many flaws.From the first 5 minutes you play you will have an idea of what will follow, cheap jumpscares -like things falling off from desks and drawers opening- to a typical ghostlike lady spawning every now and then.I am not the guy who will play a decent horror game without blinking an eye but heck this game is the first where i started chasing the ""antagonist"".Some -pros- now, the sound effects and music playing in the background were OK.The random generated halls/corridors ehm i mean map is descent but overhyped as hell they even used it as a selling point for this game...If you want a decent horror game don't buy this.

												Do. Not. Buy. This. Game. Unless you like throwing money at weak scares, a 1-2 hour game and some crappy technical performance. (long loading times, awkward angle to interact with some objects, choppiness at times) Go play SCP- Containment Breach instead, it's free and has the same 'randomly generated area' concept, PLUS it's actually scary at times.Very disappointing Zombie Studios, and disappointing on me for spending nearly £9 on this garbage. Last time I buy an indie horror game WITHOUT reading reviews and watching gameplay footage extensively. Lesson learnt.			"

												It is Slender.  You trudge through some corridors, find sheets of paper and walk away from a ghost lady.  Sometimes you get to watch canned animations when climbing over objects, and very rarely you pull a switch or two to open up a new part of the level.The default field of view is atrocious, and there is no menu to change the control scheme, although the FOV can be changed in configuration files, and likely so can the controls.  The lack of accessible menus for these things, however, shows such immense negligence on the part of the developers.There's some controversy over getting that Jessica Chobot fellow to write the story for the game.  Except she didn't really write it.  There are a bunch of tiny blurbs scattered everywhere on small sheets of paper that are undoubtedly as original as tiny blurbs can get, but the dialogue can't possibly be attributed to an actual author.  Every single line of dialogue is a platitude that the writer got from somewhere else and thought sounded cool.Being a graphical apologist on many levels, I understand that the visuals are fine to look at, but it's rather humorous that this is the first Unreal Engine 4 game to be released.  It looks overall like something you'd find released early in the last console generation, with lots of shortcuts taken, like stacks of books being little more than blurrily textured rectangular prisms, or wood grain textures with the sharpness of cheap plastic.  Little bits like the cloth physics and lighting are much more contemporary, but they don't warrant such steep system requirements, especially since most of the game is set in very tiny corridors.  It's all the baggage of a cutting edge game engine without any of the cutting edge.What a wonderful time to be alive.			"

   My Playthrough   Youtube Video    The Review Please stay away from this game. This game is one of the most horribly optimized games that I have ever played. It's like Zombie Studios didn't put even the smallest amount of effort into this game. Looking at the games that they made they probably didn't but they are gone now so it is neither here nor there. This game is not scary. Jump scares is not scary. In fact this game is very boring and easy. All you do is run around randomly generated small areas looking for notes that try to explain the story and then find the key and then the door. You do this four times and then the game ends. The only monster in this game is very predictable and all you have to do is not look at her and she can't hurt you. Walking backwards makes you invincible. And if all this was not bad enough the story is just terrible. The story is so badly written that it makes the lazy ending not be the worst part. Daylight was written by Jessica Chobot so that can explain why it is so bad. Normally I hate it when a game is as short as this one but it being so short is the only good thing about this abomination.  "

												Procedurally generated hallways, slender style note gathering objectives.

Thought there would have been a bit more of a dynamic layout, rather than just hallways, but that was my impression, not really what the devs promised.Was mostly hoping there would have been a little more development post-release.Competent gameplay nonetheless			"

												You start in some type of ward, with someone directing you via your phone to pick up some glowsticks and start exploring. You pickup on the events of this place through notes scattered throughout the map. This causes constant pauses to read notes, which I stopped doing halfway through, merely picking them up to access the key to progress through the next door. I found they ruined the flow of the game, and didn't offer much info except paranormal activity and the actions of crazed inmates. Nothing you can't imagine on your own.The glowstick/flare mechanics are interesting though, yet somewhat broken. It seemed like some cabinets/desks were only discoverable while lighting a glowstick, but on the neat side, they showed your footsteps. That helped you run through the game faster without having to bother with the phone map, as you could tell where you had been. The flare wards off the nurse ghost, who will get close to you in most areas because of the tight mapping. She becomes more determined as you advance through each section. You can't use a flare while holding the key object though, so you're forced to make a vulnerable dash to the door. Take that as you will. At one point I was on a dock but I couldn't pick up flares from a box on a wooden post because I apparently couldn't see them, until I lit one. *SPOILER* I then blew a large gas tank to advance, meanwhile I could have just jumped over the damn boxes.The areas of this game are formulaic, with repeating assets in each. I had one or two jump scares when the nurse pops up infront of me. I had my settings on medium and it ran mediocre. The key bindings are not changeable, and the FOV is narrow. I tried editing the ini files but it didn't end up working, and carried on with the game.Ending was terrible.I'm a fan of survival/horror/adventure but I'd suggest skipping this one. Wait for Routine or something.4/10			"

												A good example of how proceduralism in games is not always a good idea. I didn't expect much of Daylight but the presentation and ATLUS supporting it as publisher (on console versions) tempted me. Aside the lack of level design the not mindblowing graphics some assets, shaders and post processes looks nice on UE4 (DX11 Only).The worst part about the experience is not that is based on cheap screamers from start to the end, is the poor story, the backtracking and the repetitive mechanics.Oh! or forgot! the voice acting is not that good, the interface is horrible and the key binding for controllers is a pain in the *ss. Here's a guide:

												Daylight is a first-person randomly generated survival-horror game. Or how I like to call it, 'Pseudo Pac-Man'.Basically, this is the game; You got a story area where you're safe, and story things happen, then you get thrown into a randomly generated maze, where you have to find a key, and find the exit. And then rinse and repeat, over and over, until the game is done. They try and throw a few things in to make it more 'interesting', with random scares in mazes and 'puzzles' in the safe areas. But the scares are super weak for the most part, and the 'puzzles' are such riveting things such as, ""Push this glowing crate in front of this higher stack of glowing crates,"" or, ""Find the switch to open up this secret door."" Riveting.Now, I may have drawn attention to my Pac-Man example, let me explain... Since most of the horror is a maze, you sort of just waka-waka your way through these mazes, which get larger as the game goes on. You have a map that forms on the phone you always carry in-front of your face as you explore, and as you go there are 'consumable' story pages that you can pick-up (no worries, they freeze gameplay, yo~). And as you explore, there is a ghost that goes after you. And you look for flares, which act like Power Pellets. The ghost AI I noticed while playing will not kill you if you're not looking at it, though. Essentially the ghost approaches you, and when it gets too close and you look at it, you lose. Ghost can teleport around like Slender, and sometimes you'll turn around and it'll be right there and you die. Also, Glowsticks, which you use to make objects you can interact with highlightable.It's all fun enough, but hardly scary to me. I was not scared once when playing the game, though was tensed-up during a few closer encounters. It doesn't help that the two main characters (the one who you play as and some guy talking to you on the phone) are very unlikable. You see a chair slightly move. ""Ohhhhhhhhh,"" your character says all scared-like. A tile falls from the ceiling. ""Ohhhhhhhh."" You start to realize that the character's reacting to try and be 'in-touch' with the player, but it isn't working. She cries to herself that she's scared. She says lines like, ""What was that? Was there something behind me?,"" when clearing there isn't. And says she hears noises when there's no audio at all and stupidly calls out at random if anyone's there, and just... Ugh... I haven't felt this dissonant from a horror protagonist in a long time. And then there's Mr. Guy on the Radio, who was never explained who exactly he was, but you can take some guesses. He's a guy on a radio, who's official occupation seems to be saying cryptic♥♥♥♥♥♥that means absolutely nothing. He'll ring off every once in a while, mostly when you pick up stuff, and rant on like some living Fortune Cookie.And the story is incredibly disappointing, the files are lackluster to decent, and the ending is all kinds of disappointing. I'd tell you the story, but honestly there's hardly any story to tell. I guessed the stories big plot twist literally in the first five minutes of the game. And the story hardly has any presence in the game anyways.The randomly generated aspect doesn't feel too needed, as most of the rooms look similar for the most part, and can either make what you're objective is stupidly easy, or a lot harder than it needs to be. I think randomly generated mazes wasn't the best idea on the devs, the game is pretty linear so the random level layout often can make the levels themselves feel rather poor more often than not. Scares and all that I can understand being randomized, but in a game that's at heart a linear corridor horror game, the random feature literally in this case just shifts halls and rooms around.But it's decent fun, and it looks fairly pretty. The music is nice. I'd say it's decent if it's cheap, but it's honestly a very mediocre game. It's not terrible or even bad I'd say, I'd just say it falls short.of its promise, and it almost all comes from poor choices. The mechanics are good, and there's groundwork here for a good horror game, but the execution just falls flat a lot of the time.Buy if cheap and like horror games as it's not terrible, but not worth it full price either, and honestly rather average as a whole.And it feels like a lot of other games that have come out in the last few years.

												Just don't buy it There are plenty of survival horror games that are much better. This game is broken in so many ways, just look at the forums tons of users who can't even play. I am able to run it for what that's worth, but the controller support is still lacking. Also the devs really (from what I have seen others might have a different response) don't seem to think they need to fix anything. I have seen post by devs where they basically blamed the users (not flat out implied) for buying a game their system can't run. But that's the thing a lot of these systems should be able to run it and it just doesn't work. If you have a really good DX11 computer and feel like rolling the dice be my guest, but I say wait and see if the devs actually release any updates. Hasn't been one for at least a few months and the game only came out in April I think there was one in May.Update:It really falls short on gameplay there are many other survival horror games that do a much better job at suspense.It has an orginal idea, but it's not enough to break off from games like Slender, Amnesia, and Outlast. A lot of the scary stuff has literally been used in these other games and the effect is just getting tiresome. There are lots of complaints from users about lag. Threads with hundreds of posts, and then you have to listen to people tell you that your computer is not really DX11 and you don't really know what you are doing. Even if you getting running without lag chances are you are not going to play it that much, after all it is just walking down halls the whole time. Just take a look at the other reviews and some posts on the forums chances are you will turn away and run screaming from this game.			"

												This game excelled in only two areas, audio and creature design.The story felt rushed and didn't make sense half the time. Me being #13 makes very little sense in the grand scheme except that I'm apparently super natural and somehow related to the other 12. I felt like the end of the game was a frantic attempt to somehow tie everything together by labeling me as Patient 13, an ""eerie"" coincidence. There was very little ""Twist"" in finding that out.The way the story was told was, frankly, awful. I'm put through 4 runs of Slenderman page collection mechanics, being forced to read notes to understand half the story while the other half is told by a man over the phone I'm holding whom I assume is Dr. Mercer.Next is the dialogue. Between the girl constantly asking if anyone is there when she has clearly seen the other ""12"" over and over and Dr. Mercer's terrible attempts at being wise with quotes like ""No matter where you go, there you are"" I was ready to mute voice all together.Finally is the graphics. While they weren't bad, I expected much better considering this was a new engine and that what was advertised made the game look much better than it actually was. I consider the graphics in Outlast to be 5x better than what I saw here and it uses an older Unreal Engine.Overall, I was very unimpressed. It was an extremely short game and not worth $15 at all. Score maybe a 4/10.If you wish to see a full playthrough of it, go here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9Y1sm5zjdOE-PtontPFTfpJ-z6RS31ar "

												I was really excited to play this when I first saw trailers for the game. However, the consistent crashing when launching the game, the clipped audio, the terrible dialogue (hearing the protagonist continuously say ""Oh my god"" or ""Is someone there?"" when nothing was around really killed the game for me), and the countless other problems made playing Daylight a chore. I'd avoid this game until it has been fully optimized and even then I'd wait for it to have a large discount because of the short and repetitive nature of the gameplay.			"

												For whatever reason this game scares me right out of my pants. I've had friends play for me when I've wussed out, only to see them scream their heads off. It's all jump scares, but something about the atmosphere tends to freak me out. Too bad the game is optimized like crap, half the time I can't get it to boot up, or it freezes at the loading screen. It's seriously unstable. I've had it installed on multiple systems now, most current being my i5 4690k with a MSI GTX 1070. Still very unreliable. I want to recommend it, because if you can get to the gameplay I find it to be a lot of fun. However, it's going to take a lot of patience to get through all the poor launches, frozen loading screens, etc. I guess it's possible it's my system and setup, but many others have reported the same kind of issues. I have a very stable system otherwise, so it's hard to not point my finger at the games optimisation.			"

												Daylight is a first-person survival horror game. The player awakens as a young woman trapped inside an abandoned hospital with a smartphone conveniently at her side. A creepy man barks instructions and vague allusions to her past through the phone, which also acts as a map and a light. Glow sticks can be collected and used for light and double as a basic hint system, casting a soft green glow to highlight item containers or puzzle mechanisms. Flares are the only other usable items and are used to fend off the creepy witch ghost thing that haunts you throughout the game.You know how most horror games like to embellish their worlds with various collectable files or documents that help to fill in the backstory of what is really going on. In Daylight, collecting these documents is the primary mechanic of gameplay. The basic structure of each level goes as follows: find at least five or six of these documents called “remnants” (they are usually briefs notes or the occasional photo), bring the remnants to a designated symbol to acquire a special artifact called a Sigil and then use the Sigil to open a magic barrier and continue on your way. Repeat, again and again and this is the whole game.If this sounds boring, it’s because it is. Think the main hook from Slender, but stretched out over 60 to 90 minutes. The replay value of Daylight is almost nonexistent, even when taking into account its procedurally generated nature. The thing is, the game itself is so lifeless and devoid of any actual gameplay, that it’s incredibly hard to justify experiencing the adventure for a second time at all.Daylight is the retail debut of Unreal Engine 4 but the graphics look shockingly outdated.The sound effects do not help matters all that much, either. You will have the expected banging on doors and low howls in the distance, but it is Sarah’s own commentary that ends up being the biggest thing at fault here. Sarah has about three or four different dialogue options that she cycles through densely and incessantly, with weird choices of pausing by the actor like “Is anyone………there?” and “I can’t see anything!” and “I know someone’s there!”In terms of both a game’s atmospheric scare factor and enjoyable gameplay, Daylight is essentially a poor man’s Amnesia, and does not even come close to the current king of the genre, Outlast.Sounds 4/10Graphics 4/10Gameplay 3/10Atmosphere 3/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Hard to recommend this game that tries to be scary and tries to boasts the good visuals of Unreal Engine 4 (by the way, it doesn't show at all!), lots of bad textures that strains your eyes badly.So what is Daylight?You basically ""wake up"" in another yet overused abandonned asylum, pick up your smartphone that you use as the light source and as the map too. That mechanic is very well thought! I gotta give props where I see them!Then you have two kind of flares. The green ones to highlight notes scattered around the numerous corridors and you get the red flares who are used to ""make the creeping shadows disappears"". Again, you have some defense mechanism and is well thought. But if you're out of the red flares, you're done... well not all the time but if you're in a dead end (MANY dead ends in Daylight) and out of these red flares, you're totally screwed! You ""die"" and somehow respawn somewhere else, with lots of progress lost.The procedurally generated levels are mostly all the same thing over and over. Corridors, doors, walls... run and run and run, activate the two kind of flares, gather notes... find a ""sigil"", basically a KEY to open a blocked path covered with a door marked with a ward.If you LOVED Slender, this game is somehow similar, a close clone to it. But, I had enough of wandering around these corridors... maybe someday, I'll give it another chance but as of now, nope! The game feels like a poor tech demo and the bonus is a big migraine for all the eye strains you got!PROS:+Smartphone act as light source and a map device. Well thought!+Flare system is decent and working. I'd love if they could last longer though!+Game can be tense at times... especially when you're out of red flares!CONS:-Poor procedurally generated levels... many dead ends!-Running back and forth in corridors, stairs... finding notes and the sigil to progress further.-Overused asylum in a ""scary game"" setting.-Bad textures of the Unreal Engine 4. Developers boasted using that marvelous engine yet it doesn't show much!RECOMMENDATION:I can't recommend this game in its state as it is, even years after release. I was wary of all the bad reviews once the game released back in April 2014 but now, game hasn't much improved if at all and both gamers and reviewers were right in all the bad reputation this game has got.There is a few great ideas here but the procedurally generated levels is a bad idea. Hopefully on your next game, you can fix the issues mentionned and I'll be willing to give another shot at your next project!RATING:4.0 / 10 "

If you're looking for a showcase for UE4 or your hardware this is not the game, I have 3-4 year old games in my library which visually are more impressive, I have played PS3 games which are visually more impressive.On a positive note the use of dynamic soundtrack is one thing which adds to the games atmosphere.

												Another generic horror game.  Just like all the others, it relies on generic jump scares and single digit IQ's of players in order to produce ""scary"" moments so people can scream like a ♥♥♥♥♥ at an unusual shadow or a flickering light. (See: PewDiePie)  I tried playing it and got bored almost immediately because ""horror"" and ""scary"" stuff was just so bland and overused.  Level design is boring at best and is incredibly redundant and unimaginitive, and the save system is horrible.  No manual saves, and checkpoints are about 30 minutes apart from each other.

												I did a playthrough on this game and I have to say; I'm not that pleased with the game. The horror/scares are there (and I'm a bit of a wimp with horror games), but this game felt more like a text simulator mixed with the Slender games. Each level/section/whatever was simply the exact same thing and literally had nothing unique. The game is seriously short also (can probably rush the game in like 30 mins; but reading everything, you'd probably spend 1 1/2 hours or so).I was hoping that this would be better than Outlast, but I was left disappointed overall. I would say play it if you do get jumps/scares in general (just for hilarious reasons), but.... honestly, don't expect anything amazing from it.			"

There are four levels, and you play them the exactly same way: hence repetitive. Yes, each level is a maze, so you must like mazes.Honestly, there are things about this game that could have and should have been done better, but as far as in game experience and story go, I give the game an A.

												This is a very fun game! 5 stars, 10/10 whatever! It had a lot of jumpscares that on a first-time run through are quite surprising! Of course when you die and run through it again you are a ""little"" more prepared for them. Though, if I have any complaints it is that it kinda goes the Slender route and you do a lot of running away as you collect items, but this game gives you a map! Not bad but it gets annoying when you don't have any flares to make the ghosts go away. Also, this game has a very interesting plot and it ends very well. The ending makes you think and you aren't left with any loose ends. If you like horror and ""oh god I gotta get away from this thing!"" kind of games I definitely recommend that you play this!			"

												If this game didn’t come free with my GTX 770, I never would have bought it.  It was not very fun and gets old quick walking around looking for things.  For one of the first titles to showcase what the new Unreal Engine 4 is all about, this is a pretty weak showing.  Textures were not sharp, the hospital environment all looked the same but there was some decent lighting.  Speaking of which, you need to use a green glow stick to find clues, so your screen is green half the time you play the game.  That takes away from some of the visuals.			"

												Nothing new in terms of hide-and-seek modern horror games. Nevertheless level design is quite nice. And story do have a couple of nice twists. Especially the ending is fullfilling. As for being frightening Daylight is not very frightening, because at most it relies on jumpscares. As a result you're getting used to them rather quickly. All in all Daylight is recommended only to genre fans.			"

												While I don't say ""get this game"" at ALL, I will say it is worth they buy when under $7 USD. Personaly, I got it free with my GTX 770. Anyway, this game is basicly Slenderman, but in a different set, the ghost can move while you see it, and you have something to fend it off. Although, on all my tests, just looking away stop any pain from the ghost. It's just a balanced Slenderman. He gets movement while you get defence.			"

												I <3 this game! Started playing it tonight and the ambience helps create a terrifying game. The dark halls, the bangs, the  FREAKING SCARY SHADOW PEOPLE EEEEEEEEEK scared the pants off me. I shrieked with every sound. The graphics are pretty darn good, the soundtrack by Alex Guilbert and Ivory Gray-Smith is fantastic - only 3 songs but 3 brilliant atmospheric creepy songs. Only issue I had was I was playing it with a replica xbox controller and it made turning a little hard and very slow so I died twice while trying to run away as I had no flares to scare off those SCARY shadow people :'( so I will try it next time with just keyboard & mouse.I definitely recommend it if you want to get your heart racing and a sore voice from screaming. Or maybe that just happens to me hehehehe :)			"

												Nothing but endless doors and corridors, with you trying to find randomly scattered notes so you can collect the piece of cursed garbage and escape to the next area to do it again. Game only manages to  provide decent chills through the environment, but they quickly lose their charm after seeing room 5 and corridor 2 for the fifth time. The main antagonist is more of a haunted house spook than an actual threat, and the minor scripted events are laughable(floating spooky skull is my favorite). Also since everything looks the same, it makes finding the notes you're missing tedious and boring, and the useless map doesn't help, since it doesn't differentiate between dead ends and unopened doors. The box shoving reminds of a PS1 game, and serves only to break up the 100 meter dash that is the main portion of the content. Save your money and your time, don't even get on a steam sale.			"

												After trying to let's play the game, I was invited to loading screens that last 10 minutes, dated textures and FPS flickers. I keep saying that this game could have been the next ""Outlast"", but falls short of expectations. The hype for this game was the main selling point. This game was created on the new Unreal Engine 4 and should have given us more realistic and terrifying scares. The game is hardely scary and I actually stopped my let's play after one episode. There are points where the game runs at a smooth 30 FPS, but if I so much as try to turn my character, the game freezes or drops the FPS. The game is nearly unplayable as I have found many bugs in the game. My favorite bug is the movable crates. I try to move them to progress through the game and they completely clip through the floor! Thus, making me restart from the last save point. The saving mechanic in the game is very bad. You have no choice but to save when the game wants to. You cannot save wherever you'd like, causing let's players like me to make very long videos. Overall, I didn't finish the game and I probably never will. 3/10 Rating on this game.			"

												I REALLY wanted to like Daylight. I really did. It had alot of cool things going for it, like randomly generated levels, showing off the 4th version of the Unreal Engine, and Actually being a horror game with ghosts in it (count the amount of horror games with ghosts in them. I can only count them on one hand.) but it turned out to be another disappointment. Why??? Well, ill attempt to explain why.THE GOOD One of the good things going for Daylight is the lighting. Daylight has some great lighting, and it shows it off with the use of the different items in the game like the flares.  Another cool thing is most of the environments. From a sewer, to the outside, alot of the areas look pretty good and creepy. The only areas that aren't very good are the first two but besides that, they are very well made environments. One last thing is the sound. Not all of the sound is good and the way most of the sound is used is rather crappy, but many other SFXs are great, and are fitting with the setting. The sound that tells you a ghost is nearby and most of the old, worn out doors are very creepy, and set the mood perfectly.Also, the way Twitch (Livestreaming) is integrated is neat as well.THE BADHere's where it all goes downhill. one thing to make your game scary is be crafty and paced well. Daylight fails at this. Here are daylights ""regular"" scares.- cheap jumps scares-doors opening by themselves (SPOOOOOKY)-Objects getting flung around-and loud screams that get old about the third time they are usedSure, most people will find this scary, but I don't. Jump scares can be scary if done right, but ones that are thrown out of nowhere with no buildup are not scary. Daylight does that so many times its not even funny. As for doors and objects magicly opening or get thrown, its such a done to death cliche I roll my eyes instead of being scared. And the loud screams are pretty self explanatory. The worst part is the gameplay. Here is the entirety of daylights gameplay. 1. Enter level. 2.collect 6 pages. 3.go to the key. 4. Go to exit. 5.rinse and repeat. Sound familiar, doesn't it? Yes, this is pretty much a rip-off of the smash hit horror game, Slender: The Eight Pages (which I don't like either). Not only that, but it gets extremely repetitive later in the game. Another thing that is bad is the lack of enemy variety. The entire game, you're being chased by ONE ghost the whole game, and its design is very bland. Because of this, it adds on to the repetition and bore-factor of the game. One last thing is the story and characters. The story is told through notes and slight (and I mean slight) exposition between levels. I would have been fine with this if not for the fact that it is very bland and uninteresting from start to finish. Most of the notes are either ZOMG I SAW SOMEONE RUN AROUND WHERE I WAS AND IVE NEVER SEEN HIM IN MY LIFE! To ZOMG SOMEONE DIED! It got to the point where reading them felt like a chore. Another thing is that the protagonist is SOOO annoying. I give props for not using the ""silent character"" approach, but id rather prefer that then this. The entire game Sarah will say ""Is anyone there"" to ""What was that?"" And it gets annoying real fast because of how many voice clips are used over and over again.THE VERDICTWhat a disappointment. It had alot of potential, but wound up being boring and uninspired. 3/10.For more reviews, check out our True Reviewers Group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereviewI cant believe i bought this instead of The Amazing Spider-man 2.

												7.5/10   (8.5/10 if they patch the technical problems)+ use of unreal  engine 4 for the first time, not that impressive (in this game), but it shows that it can produce some very nice special effects and great lighting.+ creepy atmosphere, good horror story told by reading scattered notes and seeing some cursed pictures and by listening to the ... narrator, very nice sound (maybe the best part of the game) and atmospheric soundrack+ gameplay wise it's divided into maze like areas where you have to find clues (those are the notes you read and pictures) using green sticks that help you identify them ,while at the same time trying to avoid the ghost girl (you will find out what that really is in the end) by running or using red sticks - it's much more gameplay wise than slender, since there is a nice story to back all this gameplay up and the whole design is much better here+ really liked the last areas which were more open , more good-looking and the story started to unfold- technical issues - mainly poor performance and many crashes (had to restart the game many times during the  last stage)- short game, took me less than 5 hours and i was trying to read and comprehend everything , also lost some time trying to configure it to run properly on my system- no replayability even if they claim that it is different every time you start a new game, didn't try it a second time, but these games are about the story which you get to know by finishing it once- although developers wanted to make a game with a simple gameplay like that, still they could at least use some puzzles or more gameplay elements (for sure not fighting) to make it more interestingin conclusion, i enjoyed the game, maybe due to the fact that i didn't expect the next silent hill game, instead i played it for what it was and i recommend it.

												A horror game thats both short and randomized, but if anything else slender works better even if this game uses Unreal 4 Engine "" Which may be true but if so then this was a poorly use of the engine"" Your obejectives are to find items that later will let you into the next arena while also being chased by ghosts or witches..You can use flares to stop them from chasing you or use torches to see better in the dark but it all comes down to run around in a arena and hope that you will find the item before an enemy finds youTo the conclusion is this game worth anything? Well if you want to play something similer to slender ""Meaning that you run around finding items before an enemy finds you"" but is not quite a slender game but with a mental asylum and witches then try it outBut for the rest  look for something else, its better that way			"

												Such wasted potential.  I came into this game hoping to experience a truly horrifying game with levels that are never the same twice.  What I got instead was a extremely formulaic find-the-hidden-object Slender clone Piewdiebait with levels that all look the same; making it very easy to get lost and a lot of boring cheap scare attempts that are so cliche and poorly executed I would have thought that this game was supposed to be FUNNY.  The entire first level and most of the second level are completely void of any danger and just try to creep you out with such scary tactics as a chair sitting up by itself or drawers flying open or a wheelchair wheel spinning by itself.  The only times when I was GENUINELY scared were the times when you're not allowed to carry a protective flare and you have to take the Macguffin back to the gate while being chased by a ghost; and those moments were only scary because it's easy to get lost in the samey-looking levels and the ""spooky"" ghosts making a loud noise whenever you look at them.  And the thing is that because of the formula (find six letters that let you unlock the Macguffin that opens the next level and run away from ghost) these moments don't stay scary for long as you know EXACTLY what to expect by the third time around.  And it's a shame because the game actually has a quite nice athmosphere with dark, claustrophobic hallways of a rundown insane asylum and a dark forest.  But these are the ONLY two sections of the game and by the time that you're done with these sections, then the game is over.  However, as the game is only 2-3 hours long, this might not be a bad thing.			"

Had to stop my Let's Play early cause i was gonna crap my pantsmade me scream like a B*tch cause the chick kept popping up infront of me, but hey, atleast i wore a clean pair of boxers!Don't listen to these cry baby reviews of how it's ""bad"" or ""not scary"" this gave me exactly what i expected from it. People complain too much for a 10$ pre order/ 15$ game. The Unreal Engine 4 works great. The atmosphere is amazing and makes you feel alone 24/7, the ghost/scary chick/floating screamer/chick always on your d*ck/whatever you wanna call this B*tch is one hell of a jump scare when it hits you in the right spots at the right times.In other words id recommend this game to anyone with a sense for good atmosphere and proper scares.The game isn't ment to be hard nore is it ment to be amazingly easyIt's got great scares and amazing timing when it you're tense and when ur hearts pounding.Don't believe these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviews people are putting up, this games worth every penny			"

However, the game is a simple/cheap late night scare or a quick scare.The storytelling did have potential, but ended up being very convoluted...and inconclusive or non-relevant to Daylight's conclusion. The story of Daylight is very short and can be completed perhaps in less than an hour. I did expect a bit from Daylight, but in the end were never met.

												Wont even work, I have talked with people since release still wont work and many people cannot get it to work , or have problems with it playing. I have everything up to date everything I need the devs told me that I had everything good, and also I passed the diag test tool they give you (since there was such a problem they needed one) I honistly rarely post bad reviews or feel I should get my money back, this is the first time I feel completely screwed. Even Orion dino horde worked better at launch and at least they did fix stuff( saying this because that was also a horrid indie game at release). For running the new UR4 engine from what I am seeing is not very amazing. And the patches they do roll out seem to break things even more or fix one thing break another.   This upsets me, being said that I talked to the people who made it and it still failing to change anything and doing all I can to fix it. I wasted my time, and I am not sure it was worth my time to fix from what others are saying. Many people say it runs really really hot on high end rigs even for how bad it looks. This is a Alpha it seems, for being delayed it is not at all finished, I mean even at release the first patch was 1.0 so I do think it was sent out from beta. Yet still doesn't work, heck even with EA I don't have this many problems, and at least they are fixed and not telling you to do the same 3 things 100 times and jump through 200 hoops to play a 2 hour long game about. Please intill this is all fixed if it ever is save your money, it isn't worth it go buy slender for 2 bucks on sale or something or dread out, I was so hoping for this but just feel robbed , I even pre ordered because it looked so cool.

												This is the first indie survival horror game that I have ever beaten start to finish. Let that sink in... Having played a bit of amnesia, a few the fps/tps horror games and that jazz, this falls short in comparison to it when it comes to writting. As a lot of the dialog doesn't make sense or is misused in certain areas as the player will use the same phrases over an over at random points. Gameplay wise, it's not so bad the core concept of this game actually reminded me of slender combined with the randomly generate worlds which made the first 2 diablos fun mixed in with a few jump scares. Which by the way get pretty predictable but still can catch you off guard from time to time.So over all I probably can recommend this game with the disclamer those who are new to the genre such as myself or casual horror genre players who are looking to only get their feet wet. Those of you who are die hard fans, you probably wanted to play slender to begin with if you want to play this game.			"

												Had Daylight been released before a game like Amnesia, it may have been an okay if not brief horror experience. However as a 2014 release it must be held to the more recent standards set by games such as Amnesia and even Outlast, trying to settle somewhere between the pure tension of the former and the roller coaster thrill ride of the latter, yet falls very short of either. Finsihed in less than 90 minutes and with a weak and thin ""story"" I can not recommend this to even desperate horror fans yearning for a new release. Boring fetch quest mechanic, enemies destroyed with flares, regenerating health, unlimited sprint, bad attempts at jump scares and a total lack of tension all make for an ulitmately disappointing horror game. The only noteworthy thing about Daylight is the procedurally generated layout of the levels, however I will not experience this myself as I don't particularly plan on playing Daylight again. At least it was free with my video card.			"

												Daylight: probably one of the strangest names that Zombie Studios could have given it, as there is an immediate scarcity of the stuff. ‘Nighttime’ probably would have been a more fitting title for the game, as it’s cliché, much like the rest of the game itself. Daylight is a survival horror game in which each area is randomly generated upon entering it, thus allowing a different game each time you play through it. Being the first game ever to use the Unreal Engine 4, it has a lot to live up to in order to make it a game to remember.As you start, you wake on the floor with no memory of who you are or how you got there. All you have is a phone, which acts as a flashlight, a map and a means of communications for a mysterious voice that guides (or attempts to) you through the game, but rarely actually helps. Instead, the voice either confuses you with riddles or mocks you in some way. After investigating the room, you open a door and discover you’re in an asylum. You progress past each level by collecting remnants (pieces of paper that contain information of the asylum’s past.) Once you’ve collected enough remnants, a key appears, which is an object that one of the former inmates were very fond of, like a doll or The Bible. This is used to unlock the doorway and progress to the next level. Not all remnants appear during one playthrough, meaning people who like to 100% games will find joy in playing through it multiple times.Through the areas you can find glow sticks and flares. Glow sticks cause objects of interest to glow, whether it is because they can be searched or moved, making them an invaluable tool which you will find yourself using a lot throughout Daylight. As you collect more remnants, your threat level gets higher, causing the Witch to appear. There is little to no explanation about why the Witch is there or how she got there. The higher the threat level is, the more persistent she is at attacking and following you. Unfortunately, she is too easy to evade. Lighting flares keeps her away for the duration of the flare’s light, but merely running in the opposite direction or even running straight past her also suffices, as once you have seen her, she seems to forget the aspect of using her legs, meaning she just stands there gormless until you look away.I’m not going to lie though, the moments when she does appear are terrifying, especially when she is dangerously close to you when you see her. The moments when she does appear are pulled off just right, the obvious things such as how the camera pans round to her automatically when she’s a set distance to you, the sudden music, the scream she lets out to the way she immediately lurches forward slightly once you see her, as if she’s going to jump through your screen and slap you across the face as you scream like a little ♥♥♥♥♥.If this is sounding scarily (no pun intended) similar to Slender, that’s because it is. Running around in circles, hearing loud noises until you find all the pages gives a strange sense of déjà vu. Like Slender, the most annoying part of the game is when you have all but one remnant (or page, in Slender’s case) and you’re running in circles trying to find the damn thing whilst desperately avoiding whatever it is that is practically hanging off your buttcheeks.Each level is a different part of the asylum, starting with the hospital, then the prison, then the sewers and finally ending with the forest. These (theoretically) should get harder as they go on, but it goes the opposite way. For me, the hospital was the largest area and was made a lot more like a maze, even to the point of having multiple floors. The game actually gets easier after that. The prison is a rather small area, as are the sewers. The forest is literally that; a big open forest area, meaning getting away is easy, especially as there isn’t any stamina to limit your running, allowing you to just sprint around until you find an area of interest. I understand that they are randomly generated, but so are the levels in The Binding of Isaac, and they get larger and more difficult the deeper you get, so why can't it be the same here?The game itself took me two and a half hours to complete, and about half of that was spent looking for the last remnant in each area whilst avoiding Witch attacks every ten seconds. Point is, if you’re looking for a long game, Daylight is the wrong place to be looking.As I mentioned before, Daylight is the first game to use the Unreal Engine 4, and it has put it to very good use. The environments and game itself is beautiful to look at (except the screaming ladies) and very clearly boasts the power of UE4. Even to things such as how dynamic the lighting is. For instance, at one point I was standing behind a table, trying to regain my composure not long after a Witch attack. As I was standing still, my character started waving the glow stick in her hand around, and as she did, the shadow of the table I was behind moved accordingly to how she moved the glow stick. Just small things like that show the potential of what Unreal Engine 4 can do and really add to the experience.Overall, Daylight is a game that had the potential to overthrow games like Outlast and Amnesia. Armed with randomly-generated areas and Unreal Engine 4, it should have, but boring and repetitive gameplay, cliché design, small length and general unoriginality unfortunately let it down massively.4.5/10Pro’sLooks brilliantBest scares I’ve seen in a long timeMultiple playthroughs appeal to hoardersCon’sToo unoriginalWay too shortLittered with horror-cliché’sGot easier the further I gotGet’s boring after a while "

												It's a good game for the price but MASSIVE OVERHYPE done by YouTube Let's players....Bad points:*Micro stuttering - specially when turning around*No matter what graphics card and CPU you have,FPS is not going to reach any higher than 40-50 at any resoultion at any settings*Some bugs*When I play this game,6-7 of my 8 GB ram is used*Fully eats video card memory *CPU hog (my FX-6300 runs at 70% with it while GTA IV takes only 40-50%)*Bad/blurry graphics compared to nowadays*Too many glowsticks/flares that make the Witchßitch go away...*No ablity to jump,only climb boxes with the same animation of a climbing left hand and a right leg*You usually can hear the Witch behind you,so there is no jumpscare when you turn around because you know what's gonna happen*Every corridor basically looks the same and as the game map is randomly generated,many places repeats (once happened to me,entering a room opening the door entering an other and than an other room that was exactly the same as the first hall/reception like room in the hospital)Good points:*Now I feel like they kinda patched the difficulity,there are more jumpscares than I beated it first*Easier to die*Creepy athmosphere and graphics*Some good camera shaking effect*Sometimes does some good jumpscares*The game is not too expensive/reasonibly priced*Good to play at night,alone :)Additional notes:Many player did not manage to start-up the gameDoes not support almost any video capture software (like FRAPS or Bandicam)DX 11.1 compatible graphics card neededNot for low-end PCsDo not bother buying it unless you have got at least as powerful graphic card as HD7850-HD7870 or the R9 270X / GTX 660TiRandomly generated map supposed to offer infite replayibility but after a time,you get bored at the jumpscares that are almost all the same and saying *whatever* after each one.

												I played this game with two other people, and if your not used to horror games you will get scared, even the slightest movement will make you jump. I had fun watching my friend play and had some fun playing it as well. I got this game for free so I don't really have anything to complain about.I don't really like the story how it makes no sence and you are pretty much thrown into the game. That is the only flaw. I have also read this is a copy of some othere game, but if I didn't know this I would of thought that game was a copy of this. I'm not big on horror games so for a first one I will say go ahead and get it, it's your choice after all.TL;DR - Good game for some scares, I got for free so don't any better. Buy or don't your choice.			"

												This is literally Slender: the 8 pages.After reaching each new HUB area you are tasked to finding 6 'pages', with each one filling up your on-screen 'Threat' metre. The higher this metre is, the more chance Slender - er, I mean some random ghost/witch thing has of spawning and chasing after you. Sound Familiar?It just seems to follow the same formula over and over again. Interesting puzzles/change of pace in gameplay as we've seen in Amnesia or Outlast this is not, sadly. =(The selling point of 'procedurally generated' maps sounds awesome at first too until you literally stumble across the second or third identical looking room in a row over a 10 minute period.The protagonist's VA work of gasps and screams leave alot to be desired, much of the time these come across as eye rollingly cringeworthy, and other times humorous even.For one of the first Unreal 4 engine games it certainly doesn't look much impressive either, I actually had to go and google to make sure that this was indeed the one I had heard about using the new engine because of how mediocre and not-at-all special it looked/played. This is one of those game Devs that can't seem to comprehend or understand the problem with FOV's either, the default value being something reminiscent of The Darkness II's motion sickness and nausea inducing narrow as hell fiasco. Thankfully (via the community's involvement and not at all by the dev themself...) there's editable .ini files to bring this up to basic PC playable standard, still it just baffles me that in this day and age how this can continually be a problem with each new first person game release... is it ignorance or laziness?At the end of the day I personally can't complain at the $5 deal I got this through via Hookups, and I guess alot of the hate stems from the hype of the new engine whereas the game in question is actually pretty average, but.. yeah I would recommend to wait for a sale at the very least.

												+ Good graphics (but nothing that couldn't have been done with UE3)+ A couple of good scares+/- Navigating with the map is awkward but somehow also keeps things tense- Ugh, finding documents, then a key/item, then opening the lock. Then repeat this entire process over and over again- Sometimes you're out of items and/or can't get any further and you can't move past the ghost quickly enough...- ...which results in death, meaning you have to redo that part of the level all over again; documents/key/lock.

I only played it for short period of time, but I can tell you that this definitely is not a fail. It's eerie as hell for now and makes me uncomfortable and that is what I want from a horror game.It's cheap, you could get it for 10$, even 5$ and you can't go wrong with it if you like horror.I will change the review when I get in the game a little more.

Musics and sounds are very enough to get you in mood of fear.I have no idea why some people don't recommend it but DayLight deserves more!!! if you play on hard difficulty at night , you can even jump out of your place :) Each time you play maps and the rooms change..i finished the game twice but still desire to play more..sadly, it could be longer..ahhhh and one more thing..

			Review of Daylight for PC and PS4. You can find written review at http://www.heavenforgamers.com Daylight Walkthrough Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvjzWpWt7ja4YG3NX71_Kp54LVQbBm3Is...		

Daylight is a survival horror video game released on 29th April for PC and PS4. It’s being developed by Zombie Studios and it’s first game which is using Unreal Engine 4.Despite many previous horror games which are similiar size, Daylight have to provide a lot more. Beside really creepy and scary atmosphere 99% of the time player will not be able to escape their destiny, to be scared !You are in control of character who have aweoken in a random abandoned hospital. You have no idea why are you either your female character in that hospital but only way to find out whats happening is to seek notes, documents and possessed messages that find their way to your cell phone. Only navigation and constant light is your cell phone which will be shaking around while you are running so no matter how much you are scared you will need to find safe corners and observe explored map and potential ways to go further deep into level.You arent going to have access to any weapons but whatsoever you will have glow sticks which will light green colour and show you clues, your footprints and potential objects with which you can interact, flares which you need to defend yourself from ghosts and all scary things which surrounds you.Game environment and levels are randomly generated for each time when you die or you simply load a latest checkpoint. Antagonists are randomly spawned aswel which will make you fear even more, every time.Your goal in each level as it’s mentioned already is to search for notes and logs from the hospitals past, referred to as “remnants”, by looking for markings using a glow stick. Sometimes by discovering remnants it will make marking on your arms which will attract what you simply dont want.You have 2 choices, use your flare and make them disapear for couple seconds or run away as fast as you can without turning around. Sometimes it will take only one turn and it will appear in one corner, believe me you dont want to do that.

By exploring levels you will always find locked door and empty room with a lot of signes all over the place but once when you collect all remnants you will be able to acquire a “sigil”, an item or significance for hospital past, teddy bear or a Bible for example. Once when you have your sigil you will need to run for a door without ability to use your flare or glowing stick which will tear fear in your bones and make your andrenalin go crazy.Optimization is fairly good especially if you have on mind that this is first game on Unreal Engine 4, graphics are good but not so impressive and most of the time FPS is exactly where you want to be.With all that being said it’s time to conclude this review.For around 10 bucks you will get really amazing experiance from this horror game. Dont expect long adventure but you will get enough to be satisfied in all segments including atmosphere and storyline. Replay ability is always there with fact that levels will always be regenerated and random so you will definitely want to play couple times until you dont leave this title in your gaming library. My rating for this game is 85/100 when you look from all aspects which is fairly good and solid title. My recommendations without thinking twice.			"

												Daylight is an Unreal Engine 4 powered survival horror game created by developer Zombie Studios that puts you into the shoes of a woman known only as Sarah. You’ve been abandoned in a hospital with no recollection of how you got there or how you are supposed get out. You’re prompted by a voice to use your cellphone that acts as a combined GPS and flashlight to find all of the memories within the hospital which come in the form of scraps of paper, notes, and pictures. With the assistance of tools like glow sticks that highlight items of importance like boxes that contain items, valves, and switches; and flares that ward off enemies you make your way aimlessly through the rooms and corridors of this abandoned hospital.First off I must address the elephant in the room. Daylight by Zombie Studios and Outlast by Red Barrels are indeed similar games and I expect comparisons will be drawn between the two. And as someone who has played through both; I’ll be internally comparing them and this will show within this review.Anyways, what sets Daylight apart from other games within the genre is the way it handles environments, enemies, content, and encounters. Daylight features a procedurally generated world and is touted to be the same experience twice. The layout of the hospital and prison, spawning of enemies, items you need to obtain and even how you complete these objectives are set to be different for every playthrough. Although some parts remain the same, specifically rooms with switches and the storage / break room, the rest of the environments are random. During my second playthrough I found myself trying to remember where I had gone the first time and this caused me to use up the most precious resource, flares. Speaking of flares, these items are the only things that can ward off enemies so it’s important to use them sparingly especially when the game scares you into using them when you didn’t truly need to. This leads directly into sound design and my oh my did Zombie Studios do a fantastic job with that. Daylight executes perfectly in balancing your fear level. Much like a good horror film you reach moments of tension that put you on the edge of your seat, and soon after are lulled into a false sense of safety before once again being put on edge. As you make your way through the halls of the hospital and prison you hear the telltale sound of an enemy approaching from behind you and this happens at random. But what happens is when you hear the sound of an enemy coming up from behind you; the enemy might not be there. This caused me to erroneously use my flares and left me without defenses when the enemies did come.The phrase silent protagonist does not apply here as you are constantly updated with the thoughts and feelings of Sarah, you can hear her breathe heavily as the tension rises and even gasps out and yells when trouble is near. As you collect these memories you will occasionally hear the guiding voice which has just the right amount of creepy to leave you with that unsettling feeling. As enemies approach your cellphone, which acts as a mini-map that displays key locations and all the areas you’ve explored begins to glitch and the map becomes difficult to see. Because the mini-map is in your hands there is a degree of difficulty in seeing it when you’re running which can cause you to walk into dead ends. Now normally this would be an issue in game like Outlast, but in Daylight if you end up cornering yourself you can run through the enemies. This broke the illusion for me, either Sarah is an Olympic distance runner with incredible stamina or the running is a little broken because this entire game can be run through including through and away from the enemies. While this certainly helped in my second playthrough, it completely killed the tension that is integral to what makes Daylight a survival horror game. This made the entire outside area a complete joke. Let it be noted that you can “die” in this game. Once I discovered I could just run away from the enemies I thought that it meant that nothing would happen if I stood still to let the enemies “get me”. Of my two playthroughs I only died once and it was only to see if it could actually happen.The entirety of my first playthrough lasted roughly two and a half hours, much of this time was spent reading every piece of paper and discovering all the memories that I could. But my second playthrough was completed after just 38 minutes. The game stops you from running through by forcing you to collect a certain amount of remnants that are scattered out throughout the level, once those remnants are collected you must then retrieve the “sigil”, an item of important like a bible, or a teddy bear and bring that to the locked spooky gate. This is repeated four or five times and then the experience is over. It becomes a pattern that can be solved rather quickly and frankly it gets a little boring. The thing that would slow me down would be the layout of the hospital and prison solely because it is randomly generated.On my first playthrough I ran into difficulties playing the game after reaching a waterfall area, if I was to look at the waterfall room directly my computer would completely lock up with the only solution being a hard reset. I got past this issue by looking at the ground and walking aimlessly until I found my way through that part. This was an odd issue that could only be replicated on my computer whose hardware was just a tiny bit better than the “minimum” specifications required. However, on my second playthrough I used a computer that had exceeded the “recommended” specifications and only noticed a slight performance drop during this waterfall area. The biggest issue here is that it if you crash or stop playing at this waterfall junction; you are returned to the beginning of that section which takes a good 10-15 minutes to get back to. I am not deducting any points here for this, but it was something I had experienced in my review experience. This review was using a beta version of Daylight so this must also be taken into consideration.Daylight is a great example of what a small dedicated team can do. Daylight will leave you feeling uneasy and wanting more. With excellent sound design and great looking environments thanks to Unreal Engine 4, Daylight should be a game that you’ll want to play over and over, but because of the whole “find X number of items and proceed to the gate” mechanic you’ll only want to play it once. On a second playthrough the game becomes a chore and what was creepy and scary in your first playthrough become a joke. Although you won’t get too much replayability I would still recommend anyone who enjoys the survival horror genre should give it a try. Daylight releases on April 29th for both PC and PlayStation 4 for just $15.00.75/100 Good "

												While its atmosphere is often electrifying and it’s procedurally generated levels provide a truly gorgeous horror environment, it can also be quite repetitive running down the same corridors only to become lost. However the story and atmosphere easily balance out the good and bad points to the game. For $15 (£11.99) it’s defiantly worth picking up turning out the lights and putting some headphones on as you play the game.A more in-depth review can be found on our site at http://www.senshudo.tv/news/Daylight-Review "

												When you can full on sprint throughout the whole area without so much as flinching at anything that happens (and trust me, that only happens once every 5 minutes of nothing happening while you run in circles) that isn't a good thing for a horror game. Even on the rare offchance you run into an enemy, the game holds no fear over you, why? because a simple flick of a flare keeps them at bay, which there is no shortage of, in fact my danger is of having TOO MANY flares. The enemy isn't scary anymore when you can scare them off without a second thought to their existance.			"

												SPOILER alert somewhat...OK At first I HATED this game and gave it a scathing review.  Now ok partly because after playing every FRICTIONAL game repeatedly I am spoiled and nothing holds a candle to their work.  I HATED this game UNTIL I figured out that to keep progressing you unfortunately have to RUN through it, literally, looking DOWN for the most part and scanning around for those letters that glow and are called remnants that tell the story. I only got to the prison before being killed repeatedly and staring at the map. SO I restarted the game once I had read most of the remanants and discovered that Once you look ahead the damn ghost thing is there to nail you. ALSO I learned to save glow sticks and flares, light up a glow stick when you come upon a possible cache of more so you can ALWAYS have 4 in your stash, ditto flares when u find them. Also used flares to vaporize the annoying ghost things.That being said I played from beginning again and finished the entire game in a couple hours, with time in between to make cookies. SO while it kind of sucks to play a game spending the entire time trying NOT to be killed... it does work when you keep your eyes focused DOWN. forget staring at the walls I tried that still got killed. You have to RUN.			"

												I'm going to be honest here for those of you who aren't set on wether to get this game or not.  Now, I'm not a person who gets scared easily at all.  This game in my opinion, is very slow paced;  Half the campaign is to get some teddy bear or key and raise it up in the air to open the next door and continue on and do the same.  Don't get me wrong though, it gave off very chilly vibes and the dialogue was astonishing.  On the other hand, the framerate I was getting on this game was a little lower than expected.  When I play this, it feels like I'm playing a sort of puzzle or maze game.  The game wasn't as scary as I thought it would be, but then again, it's very difficult to get me screaming.  If you get scared easily and have much patience for games that usually repeat the same process to get to the next level, then this is the game for you.			"

												I hated Daylight at first until I understood what it was than then chillaxed and for the £5 I paid for it on ebay, it wasn't bad. Basically this is a souped up chase/light puzzle game like slenderman, with some procedural aspects in the way the world is generated. Very little storytelling and the tutorial elements are lacking, so here's what you have to do. Hidden around each level are ""remnants"", sheets of paper which glow read in the dark. You can see how many you have next to an icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. When you have them all you have to find a key item which then allows you to exit the level. All the time you are being chased by shades which you can dispell with flares, which you will find dotted around each level.You will also find glowsticks which, as well as illuminating your surroundings, show you objects which can be manipulated: climbable blocks; searchable boxes etc. Environments in the playthrough I did include an old hospital, catacombs, a beach, and forest.At the end there is a reveal of sorts but it is brief and confusing but interesting nontheless. If you stream the game on twitch, it responds to things people type in chat, producing 'scary' sounds and events in response to various keywords people type. Apparently, I was never quite sure if it worked.Might give it a replay to see how much things change with a new iteration.			"

												If a horror game is valued on how scary it is, then Daylight is scary good. When I was a little kid, I always thought that horror stuff is just some comedy thing for me. Daylight made me stop thinking that way. I jumped 3 times within one hour of gameplay, and was subconsciously thinking ""oh please no more of those Shadows"". I even felt relieved after I stop playing it.The gameplay was simple. Find Remnants, get the Sigil and unlock the lock. However, as you search desperately for those Remnants, you will be bombarded by noises that makes me search for the source of the noise, just so I can breathe easier. Things gets worse, however, when your smartphone, which is your source of light that doubles as your map, gets distorted. It is a sign that means you have to prepare to be terrorized. And yes, it is what caused me jump 3 times.Daylight doesn't put much into its storytelling, however. Remnants have a little bit of text that might explain some things, but it wasn't made very clear what was all of this mess about. It means that the only source of suspense in Daylight is its horror factor, not story. It was somewhat disappointing, but a game whose experience-between-games are never the same are ill suited to receive a story.Graphics-wise, it was fine. The Unreal Engine 4 draws shadows and textures finely, but user interface can be improved to give a better ambience. However, objects may fall somewhat awkwardly, to which I question about the ragdoll physics. It's still good, nevertheless.The audio for Daylight is pretty solid. The SFX for falling objects, disturbances and when the Shadows are attacking you is fairly good. VO isn't bad either; the main character speaks lines at pretty much random intervals, but it was made clear that she was scared and tried to put up a front at times, just so she can stay alive. There is no music in-game, but the menu music was describing the ambience fairly well.Simply put, Daylight is good. If you're thinking that horror games don't scare you, try Daylight.			"

												I was excited like a little puppy when I saw the review about this overhyped-unreal engine 4 game. It wasn't a really good experience though, was trying to love the game, but I failed. The control is quirky and not so precise most of the time. The randomly generated map every time the protagonist died is pretty awesome, but that's all I can be proud of this 'horror' game. If you're expecting something like Outlast or Amnesia, you better stay back, It's nothing like those scary games. It's basically a Pacman game slash Slender, with 3D environment and addition of keys to unlock next progress. At least I bought it a third of the normal price.Thank you for your attention.			"

												its not even about the game being the same as all the other horror games. it just doesnt seem well put together for me. i dont know why this bothers me as much as it does, but it reallllllly takes away from the fear factor of the game....pull out a glowstick, look down and walk backwards. with each foot step you see 2 sets of feet landing on the ground as  if the person is hopping around. with horror games, if you want them to be effective, then you need attention to detail. small subtle things to build up suspense...not something that is going to keep me from wanting to look down due to how annoyed ill become.i realllllly wanted to like this game. i was super super stoked about it coming out and finally being released...but it just isnt what i thought it was going to be. the reason amnesia, pnumbra and outlast were so successful is because they paid attention to detail. comparing other games to it isnt a bad thing because they set a milestone for what other games should strive to be like.I understand that a lot of love and care was put into this game...it just ultimately feels like a modded version of some other game. I wouldnt recommend it.			"

												I'm actually on the fence on this game. The game basically have you running around finding these remnants which you have to collect in total of 5-6 in order to proceed further into the level. It really reminds me of slenderman the game, its the like same type of game but at a variant. The game is very good on the first few levels but drastically drops through later into the game and because its a horror game, once you get used to it, the scare factor wont be as effective since the beginning. Once you figure out how the game is played, you would just hold shift and never look back. I would give this game 2.5/5 rating.

												This game is...interesting to say the least when it comes to jump scares. Slow start off, but even on easy mode you'll find yourself in situations where a good jump scare leads to being stuck in a corner and eventual death. The ambient sounds, minor enviromental changes, and off in the distance ""what is that?"" make for a good play. The fact that the game is randomly generated will lead to a new feeling each time the level restarts after a death. I'm sure those who live stream on twitch will find the extras there for their viewers to be a spot of joy while playing, but this is about where my praise ends.Unfortunately, the random generation has a pitfall in that you might have to go through endlessly reused rooms/doors to find the remnants needed to move to the next section. This has the downside of creating a lack luster use of enviroment. Textures feel a bit bland for being a DX11 game, and what little changes there are as the game progresses is not done adequate justice.While the pitfalls in no way make the game unplayable, or have the overall effect of killing the immersion, it feels like an oversite on the developers end. All in all the game is otherwise a good game to raise the hair on your neck or send the heart into the players through with a well placed jump scare. I hope this developer plans to make additions as time goes on and flourishes in their game making skills down the road.			"

												Why do I keep buying these games?!? Outlast was good at making me jump nearly out of my chair whereas Daylight does something much different. In just the beginning of the game something I spotted gave me the chills. But it was so creepy that as the chills started to fade, they came back for a second round taht was stronger and longer than the first.Gameplay is simple and done correctly. Of course any good horror game needs to be minimalistic in its controls so that the environment and the content can deliver the intended experience. Compared to Outlast, this game seems to be a little nicer in all areas. Graphics, gameplay, and the overall environment all seem like a step or two above Outlast. However, Outlast did a  great job with the night vision function on the camera. And just the idea that you have something in your hand - your only ""weapon"" in the whole story - that can reveal something terrifying in the darkness just in front of you is really brilliant. Super creepy. And if you like this genre then you must own this. I actually dont like horror games but I keep buying them. End Note: For some reason Steam says that I only played the game for a little over a half hour. But I actually put in 1.5 hours..			"

The game worked fine for me without any crashes, although I did encounter a small lag spike near the end, it was not game breaking.I very much enjoyed this game. It's nothing ""new"" you're in a haunted hospital, trying to escape, and the graphics are average. However it did succeed in putting fear into my mind and absorbing me into the game. And found my heart beating fast as I made a break for the door once I got the ""key"". As ending, which I will not reveal here for spoiler reasons, I feel was very well pulled off.I feel this is a one playthrough game though, unless you generally enjoy mazes as the best part of the game is reading the various notes scattered throughout the rooms and hallways.  The maze itself does change with each playthrough so if mazes are your thing, this game will have infinite replayability. For the cheap price, I would definitely reccomend buying this game.			"

												Game is bad. The menu system is atrocious. I can not find a way to rebind the horrible controls. Gameplay is bland it adds nothing to the platter of horror games already. They give you no direction so you can end up getting lost often. The game is locked to 30 fps with the graphics being standard to pc gaming.			"

												Not a bad game. In fact, I'm enjoying it.The game does manage to build tense moments, scares and even frightens - I've run from a few ghosts several times. At times, I couldn't help but feel like something was lurking behind me, and sometimes there was.My only complaint is that Sarah, the main character, speaks. Maybe the devs thought this would immerse the player, but it does the opposite and makes me aware of the developer. Yes, Sarah, I know someone (or something) is there. I'm thinking about it as I play.I picked this up for $10 on a pre-order. No regrets.			"

												Enormously underwhelming and derivative, Daylight takes elements from just about every survival-horror game you've ever played and offers nothing in return. Though decidedly and mercifully short, Daylight still manages to be a repetitive chore, directly implementing game mechanics from Outlast, Slender: The Arrival and Amnesia: The Dark Descent, without ever transcending or doing justice to those titles. The entire production feels lazy, from the writing, to the bare-bones sound design.  It's almost insulting to think that the game's length (and price) could be justified by its apparent ""randomly generated"" enviroment, when in fact its an exercise in back-tracking and uninspired level design with every playthrough.If you are any kind of fan of survival-horror, avoid this disaster at all costs.

Even with good hardwares, it runs poorly and is a bad example for showing the Unreal Engine 4. As being promoted as ""procedurally-generated"", it is more like take a lot of time to load, every rooms in the game are pre-defined and are the same at every tries, false advertising strikes again.

												Slender meets Outlast:Daylight promises an procedural gameplay and succeeds when it comes to that point.No play through will be the same, you will have different build maps and scares each time you start a new game.The cell phone you find at beginning of the game trackes your way on a map showing you important points and the regular orientation points like staircases, points where you already found documents, stuff like that.I needed the map from time to time, you may lose your orientation or predict the location of the missing documents you need to proceed further by looking at the points for already found ones, thats the moments when it comes in handy and the design and idea of the cell phone is a good thing for the game. But the scares aren't that scary, so personally I was scared more by the scares of Amnesia and Outlast but this is very subjectively and will of course differ from player to player.There is only one creature that hunts you through out the game (just like Slender Man)You even collect a number of documents through each area you go through , this is getting kinda old and is nothing new or creative.potential spoiler (skip if you don't wanne be spoiled)-SPOILERFor that they do a kind of spin off of the original slender man at the end of the game, which is at least something to admit to them.-SPOILER ENDThe new unreal 4 engine is pretty and produces some good graphical atmosphere.The glow stick you use during the game to find clues and the flare to beat off your stalker looks really good.You can't complain about that and the sound design is also well done.I still recommend it to people who like scary games but don't expect a long game, it's short and don't expect anything better then Outlast or Amnesia, if not already, go for those games first if interested in those kind of games.As you may have noticed I didn't mention the story at any point yet,well that's for a reason, it's nothing special at all, the documents you find are giving you some background and there is that man talking to you through your cell phone during the game but it's not like you go deep into some kind of really intense story.The end may not have been predictable but it also has not been a suprisingly ""wow"" moment as well.pro and cons+ graphics and audio+ light and shadow effects+ atmosphere+ procedural- playing time- monster variety- scares- Slender Man gameplay			"

												The voice acting is a great performance, bar a couple of cliche lines that made me chuckle. The game is a good mix of exploration and tension; made me simultaneously dread and eagerly await the next witch encounter. A good 4 hours playtime I enjoyed thoroughly. I'm just guessing that the game isn't well optimised, I didn't mind the low framerate though, more of a movie 24 fps look :P The ending also left much to be desired; but it's the journey that matters, not the destination. 7/10 for $15.

												Open the windows folks! Talk about a stinker... Daylight reminds me of the old Quake II Mods in it's simplicity and looks. It's scary for a second and then it's done. Daylight is akin to a knock knock joke, when you hear it the first time you laugh... the second time, you groan... the third time you just want to punch the person telling it in the face. In Daylight,  once you see the spooky, Ring girl once, it creeps you out, you laugh and the game is over; because after the first time she scares you - well, that's it, the surprises are done and it's the same thing over and over and over and over and over.... You get the point. Save yourself some time and money by having a kid tell you a knock knock joke and then go play Myst instead of buying, installing and ""playing"" this hunk-a-jalopy. You will get more far more entertainment that way. Glad this bomb came free with a vid card.PS, why this game required the Unreal 4 engine is beyond me... This game could have been made with the same engine they use for the game SIN, remember that stinker?			"

												“Daylight” should have been left in the dark.This survival horror game leaves players in the dark with a serious lack of direction, but does contain music that will inspire the fear of darkness. There is very little to offer in this horror game except a marketing tool. “Daylight” will frustrate you just as much as it will frighten you.“Daylight” places players in an abandoned hospital, where they play as a woman named Sarah. She wakes up clueless and disoriented, with only a cell phone and a few glow sticks and flares to guide her in the dark. With only a mysterious voice giving her vague clues, she must explore the hospital and discover its history before she is able to escape.This kind of story has been told before in survival horror games, and “Daylight” hardly offers anything different. With a worn-out setting like a hospital, one can already expect things like evil doctors and crazy patients, making things predictable.The gameplay is simple and easy to learn. Players have to use their cell phone light, glow sticks and flares to navigate through the dark halls of the hospital. Shadow people will randomly appear throughout the hospital as the game moves on. Being caught by them is almost an instant game over. Players can run away or toss a flare at them to make them disappear.Players will have a difficult time figuring out what to do, as the game provides no clear indication of what to do or where to go. The clues provided are vague and will have you literally running around in the dark hoping you’re on the right track.A big problem with “Daylight” is the lack of a save function. Players can only save their progress by reaching a checkpoint. There is no indication of where or when you have arrived at one, making it frustrating when the shadow people catch you.The game’s music and sound is frightfully amazing. It’s eerie and quiet, and the unsettling sounds mixed with the subtle but tense music really pulls you in the game’s world. When you run, you can hear the soles of your shoes scratching the floor. The audio cue for nearby shadow people is a quick and loud screeching, making the player look around at where they are coming from. “Daylight” gets the music and sounds right, but doesn’t make up for the game’s lack of direction.“Daylight” was something that should have never seen the light of day. It offers nothing new or unique to the genre. Players can stumble through the game in about three hours and leave it in the dark after they are finished. It is exclusive to PS4 and PC. Even priced at a measly $15, I still suffer from buyer’s remorse.			"

												   First of all I would like to say this is one of the first games to try using the new Unreal Engine 4. Also if your still deciding to purchase make sure that your video card can use DX11 AND that if your using windows 7 that it is updated to Windows 7 SP1 or higher. As for the review Ill try to keep it as brief as I can:Pros: - Random generated enviorments (To an extent) - Multiple ghost that haunt you instead of just one main one - Audio is well done  - Use of glow sticks and flares that help find messages or send ghost away - Special Twitch commands (Viewers can type special commands that could possibly add more creepy atmosphere to the    player) - Fun to force your jumpy friends to play - Random encountersCons: - Character audio cues sometimes hit and miss (Girl says she sees the ""entity"" even though it never showed up in front of the player) - Poor implementation of the Unreal engine 4 (Kinda felt like UE3 then 4) - Slightly repetitive  - The ""Mystery Voice"" that the main character hears isnt really that intresting; speaks in random riddles Personal Opinions: - A stamina bar would help greatly in this game. Being able to sprint unlimitly through the entire game ruins the survival horror aspect. - PLAY WITH HEADPHONES! Like any real horror genre gamer create the perfect mood when you play this, imerse yourself in it! You played the whole game with low volume and lights on? Good for you, you just ruined it. - Make sure you got the right hardware to play this! (See above)Conclusion:     I had low expectations for this game but it did considerably well. Most of the scares are jump ones but so what? Its only 15$ or the price of a movie ticket. One of my experiences I had was when I was walking down a hallway and heard some screams coming from the dark room to my left so I went down the right hallway only to see a dark apparation walking slowly towards me forcing me to go the opposite way causing me to hide in a room were suddenly all the lights went out....... If your a real horror enthusist I would recomend picking this up. This game reminded me alot of Grave Encounters to btw7.5 out of 10+ Cheap but fun scares+ Felt like a horror survival+ Random generated corridors and object locations- Poor use of new engine- Repetitive			"

												Ok, this game has had some bad reviews. But being a horror fan i enjoyed this title, the atmosphere the game creates is great and leaves you feeling nervous and quite frankly scared. The gameplay is decent and the enemies are kind of weak and the same scares kind of wear off on you after the first few times of encountering them. One thing i loved about the game was the randomly generated levels which opens up another playthrough. The graphics are impressive but there are a few bugs, after one of the recent patches my save got corrupted and had to start the level i just completed but that wasnt too big an issue. The price is ok for this game, it isnt long though i completed it in just under 3 hours or so but like i said you can replay the game and get a kind of different experience through it. 8/10			"

												If you like your games to be super repetitive and lacking in atmosphere, then this is for you. It's much like being caught in one of thoe Maize Mazes in the countryside in summer. At first they are ok but it soon wears off as you go around and around, looking at the same thing, over and over. Yet, with Daylight we get a story, which isn't much. I played this for about an 40 mins and basically I couldn't take anymore. The graphics are really poor, despite having everything set on max and having a good system to run it on. I was hoping that given that this was one of the firsr games to use the new engine we would see something different, but instead it's really rather poor. Granted the game is cheap, but seriously, there are much better games on Steam and elsewhere that deserve your money. Polygon rated this as a 5 and I thought that perhaps they were being harsh. In reality, they were being generous. This is quite easily one of the worst games I've played of this genre, come to think of it, of any genre.			"

												So on the bright side this game is creepy at first. Things go bump, and you hear noises and apparitions sometimes appear behind you or at the end of a hall providing a good jump scare.But that's about it. I spawned in a hospital of some kind an ran around a bunch of hallways. I found 5/6 ""remnants"" which were pages strewn about the level. None of these pages seem to tell a cohesive story and they are all just random 'spooky' notes.I went through the entire area available to me like 3 times, even using the maze trick where you only make left turns unless forced otherwise, and I was still unable to find the items I needed to progress. Even after I found 6/6 remnants I still could not progress past a door blocked by a glowing symbol. This is not good level design, its like being lost in a crappy maze, where every hallway looks identical, and every prop and piece of scenery seems to repeat its self over and over in different locations.I wouldn't really reccomend this game. It's not fun and it's confusing. Even with a map it's very hard to tell what areas you have explored and what areas still might lie undiscovered. It's basically a walking simulator in the dark, where you have no idea where you go or what you do, and where 99.99% of the environment can't be interacted with.			"

												This game is supposed to be a randomly-generated horror game that builds tension through immersion.** Randomly generated environments do not work when all of the things you generate are so fungible they're indistinguishable.** Horror does not work when the story is too shallow and the premise for said horror is never adequately explained.** Tension does not work when there is insufficient pacing to generate anticipation, instead of constant running.** Immersion does not work when there are only four different ways you can interact with your environment.By the end of an utterly anemic run through, I had no idea who the protagonist was, no sense of why I should care about her, no horror or fright that extended beyond predictable jump-scares, no desire to play through again, and a profound sense of disappointment.  Not worth the price of admission.			"

												When you walk into a room and a faucet turns on, or a wheel chair moves, it all plays into the terror the game is eliciting from you. Additionally, this game has new content generated through each play-through. So, every time you restart, the layout will be different, remnants will be in new locations, and these beings won’t pop out in the same places—all ensuring the element of surprise is in the opposing hands. This, unfortunately, comes at the expense of longevity in a single playthrough – you could be disappointed to find out that the game can be completed in 1.5/2 hours, and while there are reasons to replay it, it still seems a bit too low considering the price tag.Overall, I would say that Daylight’s shortcomings are overshadowed by the way this game scares the absolute crap out of the player. This game is one of the few that stay true to the genre, while reviving it in the same instance. My advice to prospective players: run "

												This game is supposed to be a randomly-generated horror game that builds tension through immersion.** Randomly generated environments do not work when all of the things you generate are so fungible they're indistinguishable.** Horror does not work when the story is too shallow and the premise for said horror is never adequately explained.** Tension does not work when there is insufficient pacing to generate anticipation, instead of constant running.** Immersion does not work when there are only four different ways you can interact with your environment.By the end of an utterly anemic run through, I had no idea who the protagonist was, no sense of why I should care about her, no horror or fright that extended beyond predictable jump-scares, no desire to play through again, and a profound sense of disappointment.  Not worth the price of admission.			"

												When you walk into a room and a faucet turns on, or a wheel chair moves, it all plays into the terror the game is eliciting from you. Additionally, this game has new content generated through each play-through. So, every time you restart, the layout will be different, remnants will be in new locations, and these beings won’t pop out in the same places—all ensuring the element of surprise is in the opposing hands. This, unfortunately, comes at the expense of longevity in a single playthrough – you could be disappointed to find out that the game can be completed in 1.5/2 hours, and while there are reasons to replay it, it still seems a bit too low considering the price tag.Overall, I would say that Daylight’s shortcomings are overshadowed by the way this game scares the absolute crap out of the player. This game is one of the few that stay true to the genre, while reviving it in the same instance. My advice to prospective players: run "

												Daylight falls flat on its face right out of the gate. Useless items, redundant level design (even with the procedurally generation), vague uninteresting dialogue and text, and level design that can cause massive amounts of lag for no good reason.  This game was obviously designed because someone wanted to make a procedurally generated horror without actually considering what that even means.			"

												(Personal Score & Reasons to buy down below)  Daylight promised a lot of things, and most of those things weren't delivered. But let's not focus on what it should have been, but on what it is. I am a huge horror fan, and I have probably played most of the horror games out there, or at least tried them.  Daylight is procedurally generated, which is a double edged sword, on one hand, you have supposedly unlimited ways to get scared, but here lies one of the biggest gripes of the game for me: there's not enough variation on the scares. 30 minutes in I had experienced most of the random scares more than once each. The same whispers play over and over, there's only a number of times that a chair moving or something falling will be scary, and then there are some very awful jump scares. So it got tiresome a bit. What kept the game very tense and kept me on edge at times was the sound design and a couple of times where the witch was chasing me. That said, the ambience is top notch, and so is the soundtrack and sound design.  Another gripe I have with the game is that the main character talks too much. Again, there's only a number of times that you can hear your character (for whom you feel nothing) comment on something or just saying ""I know you're in here!"" - which totally breaks immersion. That said, I liked that they added the commentary, since I felt it gave a bit of humanity to the character, but it should have been kept to a minimum.  And now this is a personal complaint: I am a fan of exploring and I like to take in the atmosphere, but in Daylight you can just turn on a glowstick and it will tell you where everything is by making it glow. I think this makes the game way too easy, since you're just wandering around and collecting remnants (more on that later) and picking up glowsticks and flares. I felt that this was too much handholding. The glowsticks even illuminate the beautiful and dreadful environments more for you, which takes a bit away from the ambience (it changes it a lot). I like the flares though, you use them to scare the witch away (even though it makes it a bit easy, although they can be a bit scarce at higher difficulties) and I really like how they light up the environments. And this brings us to the witch: I think it's awful that on easier difficulties, during the first levels she cannot kill you (false sense of security? No. Just stupid), and I felt that on later levels and higher difficulties it just became too hectic, the tension wasn't given time to grow, it was just jump scare after jump scare, and that's a smaller gripe I have with the game. I say smaller, because this made it extra difficult to explore the environments and that made me frustrated, and I say that in a good way because that actually achieved the tension that the game should achieve even for people who are not fond of exploring. It worked for me, but it won't work for everyone.  You progress through the game by repeating a simple objective: grab X amount of remnants to spawn an object that serves as a key to a door that is locked by a force field while evading the witch, whose aggressiveness goes up as you grab the remnants. The remnants are, by the way, notes that fill out the story of the game. Seems familiar? It's almost a glorified Slender clone in terms of gameplay, and although I like Slender (heck, I even developed a Slender clone as my first game with my team) it has been overused and this just feels lazy from the developers' part. They could have easily brought more variety to the gameplay to make the game feel more unique.   Now on to the story: it is GOD awful. I consider the story one of the most important elements of a horror game, it brings that extra spice to the atmosphere through context, and this game is an awful example of it. The story, albeit not horribly written is completely uninspired and cliché. They picked up every cliché from a couple of popular horror movies and built something with no heart and no soul. I saw a lot of Poltergeist there, and even a bit of Silent Hill, if we touch on horror games too. I felt nothing for the characters, because they were barely characters. I could hear Sarah breathe and comment on some situations that happened during the game, but I could not FEEL her character. Why should I care that she was brought here? Heck, why was she brought here? Who the hell is this dude talking to her through the phone, why is he talking to her, why is she not questioning that he is talking to her, why is she not questioning that she has been sent into this creepy old♥♥♥♥♥hospice and WHY WHY WHY? Etc. You get the point. And then the ending comes (no spoilers) and you're just left speechless due to probably one of the worst endings in the history of entertainment (IMO). And probably shortest too.  That said, Daylight is still entertaining and worthwhile if you're a horror fan and want to get your fix, but wait for a sale. I finished the game in 4 hours and a half, found most of the remnants (all the remnants available during the playthrough) and, to be honest, I don't really feel like playing it again so soon. I might go for another playthrough just to see how much it changes, but I will only play it again in a few months up to a year. Getting more of the story is not really an incentive to go through again since the story is not good, and the fact that the layout changes does not change much of the core gameplay since the objectives are always the same and so is the witch's behavior. Overall, Daylight is okay.  Personal Score: 5/10  You should buy it if: - You are a horror fan - You are able to lower your expectations - The game is on sale - You like Slender / are not bothered by Slender clones (which this is, almost) - You are able to put the story aside and focus on the ambience and exploration			"

												Female protagonist, scary, easy to play, replayable, and creepy.  It has everything I wanted for a decent price.  It's not anything that's going to change the genre or something you *MUST* experience.  It certainly delivered on anything advertised and *I* enjoyed it.  The replayability of it is part of the fun, as I can't memorize the maps and such.  Even dying and respawning, would change parts of the puzzles into different areas.Now, for the more depth review.  You wake up with a cell phone and some guy talking to you presumably through the cell phone.  You get glowsticks that you can use which will highlight things you can get.  You get flares that you can use that burn ghosts and such.  Those are the basics, the puzzles are simple, I almost always had a glowstick out as they were very numerous, and only ran out of flares once at where I ended up dying.Dodging the ghosts is simple, you can usually hear them and turn your back to them and walk past them backwards or whatever, it seems you must look at them for them to be able to kill you.  You can run past them and a whole lot of things.  No hiding places like in Outlast, that I could find.  The game is ridiculously simple.  You just progress by finding ""remnants"" (basically information written by people), when you've found the required amount of remnants, you then need to find the ""sigil"" which acts as a key to enter a puzzle area, where you are challenged with some little puzzle and more ""remnants"" to find, and you progress to the next area that requires more remnants and a new sigil, etc.. etc.. until you beat the game.  You start over and it happens again, the rooms are randomized, the locations of the remnants seem to be, as do the sigil rooms, and locks, and the puzzles have some randomization to them.  The graphics are nice, ths special effects are nice, the game is a simple $15 game that is designed to cause fear with an odd story that made some sense, but not enough to be important.  Once I beat the game the first time, I don't even read the remnants or anything, I just run through the whole game.tl;dr - Game is fun and scary, short, and simple.  If your system can handle the graphics and you want a simple $15 game designed to scare you, it should work.  If you're going in looking for an intriguing story like Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Anna, you're really not going to find one here.  Personally, I enjoyed it, the hype around it was far too high, for what it ultimately was, however I still recommend it, even at $15.			"

												This is a great game for first time horror players. For anyone who has finished a game like Amnisia or Outlast however, this may get a little slow paced after about an hour or so. The feeling of 'i'm in danger' is less present than 'i'm really lost,' most of the time.-Visuals take a little getting used to but they are fine, the effects of the different light sources are cool and the glitching of your map could be a challenge if your trying to move fast and forgotten the layout of the area.-Gameply is basicly this: Explore, memorize routs, Find objects to uncover the story, fing the 'level key', and bring it to the sealed door. This seems to repeat, however at this point I have only gotten past two levels before wanting to get back to playing Dark Souls II...So a good game for horror noobs, but may be blan for vetrans of the genre. If you like mystery, this game has a lot of not knowing exactly what is going on. "

												A randomly generated set of corridors where you try to avoid seeing anything scary... but a mess of a game.In my short three hours (why Im NOT writing a full review of this trash... I can't make myself keep playing) I have had the witch spawn literally right in front of me killing me by blind luck multiple times, lost untold flares and glowsticks due to needing to find the required notes being hidden in lockers where instead I was told I just couldnt hold more and now the locker was opened and unsearchable, had lockers WITH said notes refuse to open due to exact exact possitioning of it falling over in front of me, and been stuck in the room with the sigil you need in my hand, but the witch spawning RIGHT in the door so trying to leave is a death sentence.The random generation used for this game is actually to it's detriment as it leaves little for you to hide with that is even less effective... and the general gameplay is a reminder of why Slender: the Eight Pages and all it's clones were only good in a pre-Amnesia: The Dark Descent world.Avoid this game.

												I'll be giving this game a thumbs up but just barely. Reason why is because though it isn't the greatest of games, it certianly isn't the worst game that people have been calling it for the past few months. I can see some of the negatives that people are talking about but here's the Pros and Cons I found about the game and I'm sure you'll be surprised:Pros -- Some scares actually do make you jump and the dark hallways do give you the sense of dread.- The controls are soild as a rock. Nothing needs changing about them because the gameplay is actually really decent.- The mechanics of the game like trying to shine a light on the item you need to look for is pretty cool.- The levels are pretty neat in their design.Cons - - The scares can get old very fast but still might give you a jump from time to time.- The graphics for a game using the latest Unreal Engine is pretty disappointing because the game really doesn't look that great. - Some of map layouts can be confusing as all hell.- Voice acting = D Movie level of cheese.Overall:The game really isn't that bad but be warned though, I'd recommend you get this game at least 5 pounds because at the price it's at now it's still a caution buy.

												If I had to sum it up, I would say that it's a bad slender clone.Now for the long explanation. I got this game when I purchased my GTX 760, so I didn't pay actual money for this game, so if it sucked, then it wouldn't be the worst thing ever. First I must mention how barebones the option menu is. There is little to nothing to adjust there, and most of the things that you can adjust there arn't very well described at all. Now the graphics. This is a section which I don't entirely hate. I actually think that the visuals are really good, with some exelent lighting effects here and there, what I hate about them, is that even on my GTX 760, it chuggs from time to time. I think this might be due to some sort of autosave thing working like ♥♥♥♥, but it's really abnoxious. The sound design isn't that bad either, and is probably the game's best strength about it. Now the story. I didn't complete the game entirely because the beforementioned preformance issues were too much for me to handle, but from what I played of it, the story, while not bad, wasn't good either. Now the enemy, oh boy. The enemies in this game follow you around sorta like slenderman, exept without the teleporting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, so that's a plus I guess. But my big problem with them, is that you can just stash a bunch of flares, and run into the enemy when you rarely see them. And for the gameplay, you colect stuff and go to a certian area to escape, like slender :PThe only reason I'm not harsher on this game, is because I never spent actual money on it, and got it with my graphics card, but don't buy it, it's a turd among greater horror games.

												Not a full review yet, I'm not really into supernatural horror. I'm more of a sci-fi/fantasy horror guy; stuff like Resident Evil and Left 4 Dead. Mainly because the jump scares are less something lurking around the corner or that huge beast that busted through the door, but something running across a doorway or something magically appearing behind you. I kind of hate that.For starters, since I only just got started, I can say this game doesn't scream next-gen, but it subtly whispers it to you. You'll notice no jaggies or sharp edges popping out at you. And I don't even remember there being a tessellation setting. The game performs well on a 7970@1440p only stuttering occasionally, otherwise the slowness seems more a design choice as even with the controller sensitivity cranked up. You can imagine a game with this engine that has a superior art team.Update: After playing a while, it's okay, kind of creepy--dig the atmosphere--but again, I don't really like these types of scares. Some of the level design indoors seem very repetitive, like I had no idea aside from the map where to go because it all started to look alike. I read somebody say it was partially randomly generated, but why? The levels are pretty small.And there are ""levels"" you can clear. It seems like a better design choice would have been to have an open mansion or hospital or whatever. You use your glowstick, find 4 remnants in the first two stages and them find the special item I can't remember the name of. Level clear. Whatever. I was more interested in the game as a no combat thriller using Unreal 4 than I was of it being an actual game.At $10 perhaps I'd recommend it like a phone or tablet game. I'm going to play it like a casual horror game to pass time, get a few scares and enjoy Unreal 4.I had to get this, even with the Unreal 4 demoes available I had to just see what it can do. Now I'm semi-excited for Arkham Knight, even though it's a console optimized game. Hopefully they'll allow PC gamers to ratchet up the settings as they see fit. I will say this game immediately makes the fans on my 7970 spin up. I guess Unreal 4 must be more parallel as it must immediately start to put the card to work just for stuff like lighting calculations alone. I hope devs keep pushing our cards like this with well optimized games so PC can stand above console legitimately, not just with ports.			"

												Why....why....why did I have to select the ""Do NOT RECOMMEND"" button. Well future buyers (Let's hope not, cause BEWARE!)- First of all, this game heavily overloads/uses system resources, GPU overheats, CPU, and not to mention the long loading times, stuttering, hickups and more...AND...this is practically with the game on it's almost medium to low settings. Granted graphically then the game looks fine, but still performs AWFULLY! I really wanted to enjoy it to the fullest extent. But I just had to uninstall it due to the constant weird noises it made my GPU produce, oh and the framerate ofcourse. You cannot rebind the keys, you can't do pretty much do anything other than the default settings. So beware...until they FULLY adress the issue at hand with the abysmal performance...for the sake of your hardware, don't buy it....not worth your money...at least not for now. I'm sorry to have said this about a ""horror"" game as I'm a completely overly obsessed freak with anything having to do with horror...but even I can't lie to myself...or others. AVOID....for now.

												Daylight is a horror game that was created to freak the players out but will it scare you or will you want to go play a better horror game ? In Daylight you play as Sarah, she wakes up in a hostpital and you hear a mysterious voice of a doctor that guides you to Daylight. So how is this game ? This game is not worth your time. Now lets go through the pros and cons. The pros: The atmosphere is amazing it really feels lonely and scary in these kinda places. Controls are fluid and simple to use. Unique approach to the horror genre. But thats all of it thats good about this game. Now about the bad. The game is a maze and the map on the phone barely helps so no point in using it you will have much more luck wandering around. The game is short you can pretty much beat it in an hour. The story is consisted of scraps which you have to find to understand the story. Boring objectives which are always the same. Overall Daylight is a pretty mediocre horror game which i cant recommend.

												If you glean one thing from my review: Caveat Emptor. If you own outlast, eithe Amnesia, or hell, even that Slender game that came out, play those. Play them again. If you don't own outlast, just buy that and see a better version of this like a few years ago. Whistleblower is coming out for Outlast, so thats worth your time and money at a comprable price, and even having paid the preorder price, This is in no way worth your time or money.First impressions were not good as my framerate chugged down to a number I could count on one hand. I learned later this is because not only does the engine enjoy bending my laptop's processor over a table, but the generated mazes are created while you lounge about in a safe room. Normally, good games with persistent worlds like darksouls use little tricks to get around this while not sacrificing framerate, but this game is pretty content to keep you waiting while the labryinths decide to load.Barring that, the setting is uninspired. They say that a writer's first work is either about someone trying to write something or something taking place in an insane asylum, and this definitely falls into the latter. Something about a myserious plague, a curse, I don't know and the game did little to make me care. The main character, despite having a model and a name does barely anything to keep the game interesting. Well, she informs me when a triggered spook time event is happening or when a shadow is in the room with me, but then again my framerate really didn't kick in enough for me to see the events. Not like they're that scary, just get yourself used to jumpscares and all the atmosphere is taken out.Gameplay is bad. Run around, pick up uniteresting threads of a story about some victorian asylum some people think is still scary while a voice gives you What I assume is supposed to be existential fear inducing quotes. Block puzzles, too, so theres that, another waste of your time.However, in these kinds of games, thats par for the course. Is it scary? As I said before, jumpscares are the name of the game, and I admit the first time I got jumped, I jumped. Then, its hand having been shown, I quickly stopped caring. Shadow monsters of a burning victorian woman that is not in any way Alma from FEAR haunt you in this quest, and not only are you provided more flares than a fireworks store, they basically provide both light and immunity from the monsters (something that will no doubt get patched, but hey. One chance to make a first impression.)This game has good sound, though. Very good sound and really you could say that the sound engineers carry this game, giving a sense of dread with each eerie sound. Plug in headphones and you're bound to be unnerved by the ambience, and that works to an extent. Does it excuse the rest of the game? No, it just happens to be the only redeeming feature.gameplay boils down to a slender-style fetch quest, and I can say that the labryinths are all samey, and this random generated dungeon thing is wash. Every map is different, but then again, they all feel the same, paradoxically. The only thing that changes with each playthrough is which confusing turns you need to make, and which dead ends you will inevitably run into.This game has twitch settings, which to me seems a bit cocky. To be honest, I had hoped in outlast that my camera would have been able to record my game, so that I could upload my unique experience. That feature is wasted here.I could go on and on, but then again, what else can I say? Its not bad, its worse. Its mediocre, simple where it tries to be profound and misguided in direction and scope.I had high hopes for this, and it doesn't survive the hype.			"

												I would love to tell you more about this title.  However, the game is so unstable and crashes so often that I can't get into the game very far, which is a SUPER huge disappointment.From what I can tell you, Daylight consists of wondering corridors and hallways.  Periodically, pictures move, lights flicker, and wheelchairs roll past your path.  The story seems disjointed as do the characters reactions to most of what happens.  The mystique of an unfolding plot with interesting material is not really apparent in the game as far as I've played it.  Additionally, for having used the latest greatest Unreal Engine, the game doesn't look much better than say Metro Last Light.  In fact it looks worse in my opinion but runs much worse.Overall, a huge disappointment of a title. TL:DR:  Incredibly unstable and buggy (expect crashes), disjointed reactions from the character, lack of interesting plot dynamics, and HUGE system requirements but looks less impressive and runs worse than other games with similar requirements.

												A randomly generated set of corridors where you try to avoid seeing anything scary... but a mess of a game.In my short three hours (why Im NOT writing a full review of this trash... I can't make myself keep playing) I have had the witch spawn literally right in front of me killing me by blind luck multiple times, lost untold flares and glowsticks due to needing to find the required notes being hidden in lockers where instead I was told I just couldnt hold more and now the locker was opened and unsearchable, had lockers WITH said notes refuse to open due to exact exact possitioning of it falling over in front of me, and been stuck in the room with the sigil you need in my hand, but the witch spawning RIGHT in the door so trying to leave is a death sentence.The random generation used for this game is actually to it's detriment as it leaves little for you to hide with that is even less effective... and the general gameplay is a reminder of why Slender: the Eight Pages and all it's clones were only good in a pre-Amnesia: The Dark Descent world.Avoid this game.

It's got a habit of catching you with a jumpscare when you least expect it and its brilliant, I was just casually looking at my map realising i had to double back for something, i turn around nice and casually and there's a f&&king monster right infront of me, i proceed to be scared out of my wits but didnt die and thought wow that got me, well played game well played then i turn around and its still there and scares the life out of me again! It has alot of ambient noises and random creepy things going on and the enemys can appear at any given moment, has a very Outlast feel too it thus far & I'm loving it 10/10 well worth the wait/money!

												A scary game to be sure, though not as scary as the likes of Amnesia or Outlast. It's also a good looking game, but a little power-hungry; Likely due to UE4's DX11 effects.Daylight is a game of discovery, so I highly recommend playing without any advance knowledge or expectations. That's how I went into it, and I enjoyed it much more than I would have otherwise. Expect a 2-4hr playthrough.The checkpoint-saving system can be annoying due to a lack of ""Save and Quit"" option, but you learn to deal with it. Also, you can't rebind the controls. They're basic WASD, but still.			"

												I haven't really played it enough to pass any sort of real judgement on it, but so far so good and certainly scary enough :creep:I can speak about the technical part though...It really needs some collision detection polishing, especially with lighting going completely off when near objects and your own footprints are stretch over objects you didn't even walk over.The (feels like) fixed 30fps, which makes it feel too games console toy like, which is both hard on the eyes and fluidity of the game.Very limiting controls. A part from just the typical WASD, you have just a few other options (flare, glowstick, throw and map. Once something is opened, you can go back to it, to pick the items left and if you throw your glowstick (when you crack it), you can't pick it up again.No 8Ch (7.1) audio support only 6Ch (5.1) which is OK, but for a game of this genre and using sound a great deal it's shame it doesn't output above the typical 6Ch.For some odd reason it uses the same amount of systems resources whether I play in Stereo SBS 3D (2x 1920x1080), Oculus Rift v1 or standard old school (1x 1920x1080) with none hitting above 30fps (fixed fps?)Many are having technical problems with the game or feel it doesn't look like much. A few things to note, the game was built on Windows 8, 64bit architecture, DirectX 11 and ran on at least an Nvidia GTX 6 series (and above). Compare it to anything less than this and the game looks very different, plays poorly and downgraded (will look and play like a games console game ...ewww) :Eye_tv:Final review TBC "

												Daylight is all about procedurally generated levels in a first person horror view. Which tries oh so hard to be scary, only to fail after the first 30 mins into the game. Its more of a first person adventure game, or hidden object than a horror. It has more of a fun house at a carnival feel than a horror game. The story is written so weak to where I don't know whats going on and nor does it ever make you feel like your part of it. Nothing but cheap jump scares which lose their power very fast, even more so once you realize how worthless and weak the ghosts are.

												Yes, this game will give you some jump scares no matter how tough you think you are but only at the early stages of gameplay because this game uses the same way how to scare the player from the beginning to the end.Unfortunately the game has optimization issues on PC as many players have already reported and it might run poorly on certain rigs. The game crashed multiple times while playing and it hasn't happened to me in a very long time with steam games so yes this game obviously has some optimization problems.Short, scary game but nothing special as there are better games in this genre at the moment.WAIT FOR A BIGGER SALE IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME!!!

												It was pretty good. Had it's scary moments but definitely not as scary as Amnesia or Outlast. Once you know how to deal with ghosts, it's pretty easy to just run around and never have to see them. The game doesn't do anything new or original. I completed it in 2 hours. Didn't understand the ending so much as I think I got bored of reading the thousands of notes.I'd recommend it to any fan of horror, however £11.99 feels a bit overpriced. I think it's more worth the pre-purchase price I payed (£7.99).			"

												Wow Daylight, truely a horrifying game.  I personally found this game scarier than any other game I've played before.  I haven't gotten around to finishing the game on this account but I played through the game while hanging with mates and they definitely enjoyed torturing me throughout the game as they knew the game was getting to me.There are a lot of horror games out there but I would definitely say that Daylight would be the scariest one.  My first time playing the game did not go very well as that was done on this account, the game scared me quite quickly to the point where I actually quit and decided to play another game.  My mates eventually talked me into playing through it while I was hanging with them and the horror value of the game stayed high throughout the game.This game may not inflict the fear in other players but it definitely did a good job at scaring me and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror game.

												Awsome game. I crap myself out. Scares you when you dont expect it. As it is expected -.- A little bit too short for delaying it that much. I finished the game in 1 and a half hour. Graphics are outstanding.While the graphics are outstanding I can't say the same for the in-game mechanics. Don't get me wrong. They are smooth as hell, but they don't give you the freedom you payed for ;) EX.: You can't crouch. Neither jump. Just run ,push and climb.Another flaw of the game is that if you stay were you are and the entity is behind you can stay there and she/he will be gone. So there's no point if she/he follows and then he/she goes away because you didn't turn around. Apart from that the overall game is interesting. I bought it when it was 9.99 bucks so it worth it. I give it a 6/10.			"

												Devs should feel bad about selling this unfinished work. It's poorly optmized and barely runs. I can play battlefield 4 on high at 60+ consintently, but I can't get more than 20 fps with this game... It frustrates me so. I wished there was more effort put into the story as well. The intro sequence sums up the level of emersion you'll feel overall. I'd recommend watching a video on the first 5 minutes of gameplay. I'm easily scared, for horror games and horror movies, but I find myself more irritated than anything else. I'd recommend outlast over this, that game is terrifying.			"

												It wasn't the worst game I have ever played, but I feel that it was far from good. It felt like it had potential with the story. The sound effects and witches weren't terrible and did an okay job getting me in the horror atmosphere. But all in all, it felt like an Amnesia clone (the cell phone being the lantern etc.). It's too bad that it turned out less than mediocre, I've been wanting a horror game that actually does a good job. But I suppose that's like expecting a good horror movie.			"

												This was an impulse buy. I dont usually do that ever...but I've been following this game for awhile.  It seems promising. Procedurally generated levels every time you play = differant game every time.  Scary setting with nothing but a phone light and glow sticks to protect you. Seemed pretty interesting.  I played it for about an hour wasn't terribly impressed.  I was a bit scared at times sure, but not terrified as I wandered the hospital looking for items. Gameplay revolves around going from floor to floor finding notes. Once you've found 6 notes on for each level or ""board"" you go to a certain room that has an item of one of the insane people. You pick it up and carry it to a special locked door that allows you to progress to the next ""board"".  That in a nutshell is the gameplay. Along the way you find glowsticks that show hints if you really need that.  All you do is click on everything, desks, cabinets, cupboards, whatever.  It gets very tedious very quickly.  There are some jump scares but  those are all that will get you the least bit frightened.  I only paid 10 bucks for it so its not terrible for a game like this. I just doubt i'll get 10 hours of enjoyment.  More like 2.  That equals 5 bucks per hour of entertainment. I guess for a video game thats not terrible, I just would've wanted more gameplay variety.  For a game like this it works, it really does. Its not annoying like outlast, where your camera light runs out of batteries after 5-6 minutes. You dont have to worry about battery power. You don't worry really about much at all.  Just click on all the doors, explore the hospital and pick up all the notes.In conclusion I think its not a terrible buy.  Get it now while its on sale. Its not worth more than 10 bucks.			"

My review is biased to the steam/stream connection play, so I can't account for a regular playthrough.

												I've been having lots of issues playing, as I apparently haven't got up-to-date DirectX 11. Everywhere says I need to update service pack, and there seems to be lots of people having the same problem as me. If I try to update the service pack it tells me I already have the update installed on my computer, yet the error I get when I attempt to run Daylight tells me to go to this page: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=36805 and I cant install that update because apparently I already have it. From Gameplay videos and reviews I've seen the game looks great, only problem being I cant get it to start. I do recommend this, but only if you have up-to-date DX11 or Windows 8.1+. If I get Daylight to work I will update my review and give an opinion from my own gameplay, for now, please add me if you know anything I can do to get it working.Thanks.			"

												Here it is ... DayLight ! I preordered it for only 10€, and i can tell you that i'm proud to have bought it ! I have played maybe all horror games that exist, from Dead Space to Slender The Arrival, or OUTLAST etc...then i played this one, first of all :- This game is a real Engine Showcase ! It shows perfectly the whole new Unreal Engine 4 ! Which is absolutly awesome ! Depth of Field is so realistic, as the lights and the awesome shadows (Real time, of course ! )-No bindings !!! This is a thing that should be fixed quickly, i managed to change them by heading to the Main folder of the game and manually change them for further information : (QWERTY TO AZERTY)First go in your DayLight Folder, located in Steam/Steamapps/CommonFirst to edit the movement, edit the file named ""BaseInput.ini"" located in Engine/config/Find the lines : +AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveForward"", Key=Z, Scale=1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveForward"", Key=S, Scale=-1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveForward"", Key=Up, Scale=1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveForward"", Key=Down, Scale=-1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveForward"", Key=Gamepad_LeftY, Scale=1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveRight"", Key=A, Scale=-1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveRight"", Key=D, Scale=1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveRight"", Key=Gamepad_LeftX, Scale=1.f)And change them to : +AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveForward"", Key=W, Scale=1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveForward"", Key=S, Scale=-1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveForward"", Key=Up, Scale=1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveForward"", Key=Down, Scale=-1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveForward"", Key=Gamepad_LeftY, Scale=1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveRight"", Key=Q, Scale=-1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveRight"", Key=D, Scale=1.f)+AxisMappings=(AxisName=""MoveRight"", Key=Gamepad_LeftX, Scale=1.f)This is for AZERTY, right handed ! if you are like me and left handed, do the same and replace only the Q and D key with ""Left"" for Q and ""Right"" for D (No quotes, and yes it is inversed with the AxisName)Then, let's speak about the Game itself, i finished it of course ! +The game has an amazing ambient, sounds are perfect and match perfectly with the environment !+So scary !! Probably one of the scariest game i played ! The ghost haunting you is just horrible and his moving are good, and of course, he can jumpscares you ! I also like the sounds he makes when he is right behind you, threatening !+ The price ! Of course 10€ is nothing compared to this game ! + The maps : Every maps is generated randomly, this means you can never have exactly the same maps, some places stay (Like key places, or some rooms) but are placed randomly in those corridors. Otherwise, it is now no more possible to fallow a youtuber like Pewds or anyone else and playing the game without understanding anything, and then, this has a great impact on the hours you will pass on this game, a lot of replaying possibilities !+ Achievement, as usual, makes you pass longer hour on the game, some are hard as hell !+ Difficulty : The difficulty is changeable, to fit better with your experience, try Hard mode without destroying your pants !Now what is bad in this game ? Here : -Bindings (See on top)-Short ! Story to short ! But replayable-Problems with DX11....................and thats all !17/20, We want more !			"

												A game that disapointed me, I pre-ordered going by what the developers said and what they promised was not delivered. No random worlds, poor level design that just gets boring and repetative fast. And the enemy just keeps resawning so fast later on that it gets unfair to do anything. So do not buy unless you see it on sale for a max of 5 bucks. any more is a waste. So only pick this one up if on sale but not now at full price.			"

												Best UDK horror game I have ever play. This game is so suspenseful which keeps you on edge, figuring out what to expect when walking down a long hallway with a phone has your only light and your flare has your only weapon. This game will put random jumpscares without you realizing. Despite all the crashing that people have been mentioning, I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys suspense, jumpscares, and chills.

												I didn't get far into this and I won't play it.Couldn't really tell you if it's scary or not, didn't get enough time with it to know.10 minutes in I was ready to throw up.I don't know what it is, if it's FOV, some lighting effect or motion blur, whatever. It was uncomfortable for my eyes to look at the screen and it made me nauseous. Of course that may not be the case for everyone.I'm still dizzy when writing this... ugh.Gameplay though.. I guess I can say the idea is nice, though the controls seemed odd to me. There's some guy talking to you and I had trouble understanding anything he says. He sounded way too mumbly.I'd actually looked forward to this game, long time before its release. I can say it didn't quite feel like the footage i'd seen back then... It feels way too covered in screen effects, which seems to be a trend since Outlast.Oh and there's options for Twitch in the game, which is naturally convenient, but it seems a little too much on the nose to me. Like it's a game in heat, presenting itself to Pewdiepie and his kind.I can't recommend this game since just 10 minutes made me feel like I got a hangover.			"

												This game is bad, the main problem with it for me is the fact that it has no option to disable head bobbing. It makes me feel sick, and my eyes get very tired looking at the screen for more then 20 seconds. It uses the unreal engine 4 and you would think it would look impressive. Instead it looks very bland. The levels look empty and very boring. Plus you just run around dark halways finding notes that I had not interest in reading. At the same time some voice talks to you but you have no idea who it is and it makes you confused. There is no guidence of anykind. Once you find all the parts of the notes you have to find a key to the next level. Then the next boring section starts.The scary parts get old pretty fast, because you get so distracted by the motion sickness, and the bad graphics. This game is not worth any money.			"

												hard to put into words how diserpointed i was with this game. One thing i will say is dont buy it!!firstly its only 2 to 3 hours long making it the shortest game iv ever played in my life!The storey isnt much good ether and leaves alot of things unexplained.There were a few good points to be fair. The game is really scairy and made me jump alot.The game looks and sounds great too. There are lots of random sounds, screams,footsteps,bangs and bumps keeping you thinking is that something thats going to jump out and slice my face off or am i safe.The downside though is most of the game looks the same all the time. Every hall every door every room there all the same just repeated over and over again and it just starts to feel lazy and a little dull.The first hour or so of the game leaves you not really knowing if you have gone anywere at all as it still looks the same as when you started out.This game could have been great but its falls so short of even been average. The people that made this really didnt try to do anything with it at all! other than test out the new unreal 4 engine.1 out of 10 at best.			"

												Daylight gave me some wicked nice scares in certain parts. However, after you figure out how the scares are triggered, they're fairly easy to avoid. While this is a disappointment, the ones I was not expecting gave me a nice surge of adrenaline.Daylight generates randomly, but occassionally breaks. I had to reload two levels during my playthrough when the ""key"" room failed to spawn. Additionally, I often had to start the game up twice to get it to actually load when I selected ""Resume Story"". Minor annoyances, but annoyances nonetheless.Daylight is about finding a set number of pages with a story on them, collecting the key that spawns subsequently, and getting the hell out of dodge before the ghosty-goo catches you. Every level repeats this pattern with the ghost getting more aggressive as you progress. Most levels, however, are not that grand and you can beat the level (without dying) in about ten minutes. It's fun, but not groundbreaking.Bottom line: If you have fifteen bucks you're itching to spend, you're patient with getting it to start and know it will work with you PC, you don't mind playing in the dead of night with the lights off and the sound way up, and you can give yourself to the story, give Daylight a try. If technical glitches and repetitive horror aren't your thing, go elsewhere. I recommend it based on a few good scares it gave me, but can understand why others do not. For fifteen bucks I can say I got what I paid for. My Playthrough on YouTube  "

Wasn't much of a story is why it's hard to follow.As I streamed it on twitch and it's unique twitch commands i was hopeful, but the game is the same, no point in EVER redoing it, so why the hell have twitch commands....I don't think this game will ever be remembered, unless they revamp it entirly and add like some weird DLC.it's like portal meets outlast with the worst of both games.

												hard to put into words how diserpointed i was with this game. One thing i will say is dont buy it!!firstly its only 2 to 3 hours long making it the shortest game iv ever played in my life!The storey isnt much good ether and leaves alot of things unexplained.There were a few good points to be fair. The game is really scairy and made me jump alot.The game looks and sounds great too. There are lots of random sounds, screams,footsteps,bangs and bumps keeping you thinking is that something thats going to jump out and slice my face off or am i safe.The downside though is most of the game looks the same all the time. Every hall every door every room there all the same just repeated over and over again and it just starts to feel lazy and a little dull.The first hour or so of the game leaves you not really knowing if you have gone anywere at all as it still looks the same as when you started out.This game could have been great but its falls so short of even been average. The people that made this really didnt try to do anything with it at all! other than test out the new unreal 4 engine.1 out of 10 at best.			"

												Short 1st person horror game.  Collect the scattered letters, pictures, and documents to unravel the mystery.  Very short and little replay value once you know the story.  It's horror so there are jump scares and the atmosphere succeeds at being creepy, preventing the achievements from popping while playing is a nice touch.  Get it if you like horror but only for a small price.			"

												Well here is the mixed feeling know as ""Daylight"".First off I bought this game during early access and only recently got it working, ill note the problems I had and how I fixed them.1. Starting with twin screens (Oculus Rift mode), just open your local directory for the game and go into plugins and remove the ""OculusRift"" file.  2. Crashing when starting story mode. For me the problem was ""Alien FX"" as soon as I put this in ""Go Dark"" mode it worked fine.Now as for the game itself, your placed in an abandoned hospital just trying to work out why or how you got there in the first place. If your into your ""Paranormal"" experiences then you'll proberly enjoy this one, yeah it can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get it working and yeah its only about 2-3 hours long but its quite enjoyable overall. As you play the game you go around reading notes, which tell you about the hospitals patients or photos of the area itself, some of these notes you have to collect to move onto the next area which are called ""Remnants"", but as you collect more of these the higher your threat level becomes making encounters all the more likely, and your defense is just a flare. Not amazing but not bad either, graphics are decent aswell.			"

												This game is amazing in the sense that it is absolutely frightening in its unique ability to generate various forms of scares. If you're looking for a game simply to scare the pants off of you then you found the one. However, the plot of this story is horrible, and incredibly short. You could play this game non-stop and finish within an hour. That alone isn't worth the price. Upon reviewing the trailer, it's almost completely unlike the trailer. And don't get me started on the flawed engine this game runs on. It's so poorly produced, framerate drops so hard in the simplest of areas. TL;DR Only buy if you want a good scare. Not a story. Also keep in mind it's laggy as hell.			"

												A shallow story that is dully told by a protagonist with no personality or discernable characteristics whatsoever and an almost abscent and cliché narrator in an unimpressive nightmare world.The ambiance is quite creepy, i'll give you that, until you notice the whole scenery in each stage is just a copy and paste of the same sections over and over  game, making a confusing maze, yes, but also a boooooring one.Moving objects are not enough to scare anyone these days. The only actual frightening thing is the only thing that can kill you: The nurses ghosts... but that's the only enemy in the game... and there's only 1 way of repelling it... and it gets old really soon.The game is linear and short, and there's no involvement whatsoever, you NEVER feel any empathy towards the protagonist or what's happening.And the ending.... there's no ending... just a stupid final phrase and a still illustrations aaaaaaand credits roll. No use in re-playing it. Not recommended. Maybe some jumpy players will enjoy a couple of jump scares, but for anyone who has enjoyed terror games such as silent hill or fatal frame, this will come as a waste of money.			"

												Hrmm... I really wanted to like this game. Very disappointed. 1. Stutters terribly. Very low framerate (10-20 fps).    This is on a i7 processor with a Nvidia GT545 card with 8gb RAM.    Same computer plays Arma 3 at native 1920x1080 at 45-50 fps & Outlast at same, gfx set to high at 40-45 fps2. Non-programable controls.    What decade are the Devs stuck in? I use a Razor Nostromo that is already setup for up, down, left, right and custom keys that I use for all my other FPS games. Suddenly you force me to use WASD? Thats fine if you're developing at Flash game. For crying out loud Doom and Wolfenstein 3d allowed for custom control configs. I tried to play this for about 3 hours maybe and spent most of my time trying to figure out what was worng with the engine and framerate/stutter when looking left-right issue. I have DX11.1, latest drivers, low textures, low res.... every setting imaginable = no joy. Finally gave up. I've waited a month to see if the Devs would complete this botched launch. Sadly they have not. I would like the money back (14.99) BUT not from Steam. I would like the Devs (Zombie Studios) to cut me a check as I feel they knowingly foisted an incomplete product with a broken engine onto the unsuspecting Valve guys. All I can say is to wait a while and thoroughly review the forums and reviews before purchasing.			"

												This game is bad, the main problem with it for me is the fact that it has no option to disable head bobbing. It makes me feel sick, and my eyes get very tired looking at the screen for more then 20 seconds. It uses the unreal engine 4 and you would think it would look impressive. Instead it looks very bland. The levels look empty and very boring. Plus you just run around dark halways finding notes that I had not interest in reading. At the same time some voice talks to you but you have no idea who it is and it makes you confused. There is no guidence of anykind. Once you find all the parts of the notes you have to find a key to the next level. Then the next boring section starts.The scary parts get old pretty fast, because you get so distracted by the motion sickness, and the bad graphics. This game is not worth any money.			"

												Traditional Rating - 52/100Recommendation - Buy on SALE, horror fansTagline - Decent for what it isIf I had played a demo - I would have purchasedI actually kind of enjoyed this game. First things first though, THIS IS NOT OUTLAST. It does not pretend to be Outlast, and I highly doubt it was ever intended to be compared to Outlast (even though it is, rather frequently). Sure, it's in an asylum as well, but that's hardly an original idea on Outlast's part. As for the light source, in Outlast, the camera was useless until you held it up to your face to record and/or switch the nightvision on; in Daylight, the phone light is on all the time and does nothing other than map the area. In reality, the phone in Daylight is functionally closer to the lantern in Amnesia.Basically, this game is NOTHING like Outlast.If you ask me, this game plays much more similarly to that Slenderman game where you're gathering pages in the woods (right down to how you gather remnants in each area before performing a ritual and moving on). Compared to Outlast, this game is the epitome of lameness, but when compared to that Slenderman game (which I did not care for in the slightest), it is rather brilliant.Taken as a whole on its own, the game is rather middling, but it sets out to tell a story (which it does, even if it is cliche as hell) and make you jump (which it also does). I figured out all the tricks by about the halfway point, but I still had fun in the later chapters, even if part of that was laughing at its B-movie nature.Don't take this as a glowing endorsement, though. There are quite a few serious issues with the game. It is not very well-optimized, there are loading-induced stutters and frame drops GALORE, the times when the dialog kicks in are often nonsensical (and hilariously immersion-breaking), the story is opaque from a mile away, you rinse-repeat the same exact actions in all 5 areas, and the game is too easy (although they would have had to be smart about making it more difficult). The reason for my last parenthetical is that, should you die, you ""awaken"" back at the entrance to your current area with none of the remnants you picked up, and you have to do the ENTIRE section over again. It would have been MUCH smarter if they instituted a manual save game feature like so many other horror games. Case in point, I had to attempt the 3rd area 3 times, and I was so annoyed by the 3rd try that I was beyond scaring.The game does a few things pretty well too, though. While there are copious amounts of blur, dust, and focus issues preventing you from seeing them, the graphics are actually quite pretty. This is the first game to use the Unreal Engine 4, and if you look closely enough, you can see the subtle upgrades over UE3. Also, the menu theme is interesting, if not entirely memorable. I've tried to think of a 3rd good thing to say, but I can't.I can't say this was my favorite horror game of all time, or even in the top 5 (maybe even 10), but if you're a horror fan and you understand it for what it is, you should get a decent amount of fun out of it. DO NOT pay $15 for it though. The entire thing is about 2 hours long, even with having to replay some areas.			"

Chasing a 'monster' results in it fading instead of punishing the player.This game leaves a lot wanting.See my first impression:

												Awesome supernatural horror game that places you in a creepy atmospheric abandoned insane asylum.  You'll experience jump scares from the malevolent ghosts that ambush you as you're walking/sprinting the hallways search for clues/key objects that unlock bits of the dark history behind what happened back at the asylym and the overall story.  I had this in my steam library for years and am glad I just now tried it out.  It's too bad that Zombie Studios shut down.  Would've liked a sequel or a change of setting, like what Outlast/Outlast Whistle Blower DLC is doing with the new Outlast 2 coming out.  Anyway, I would definitely recommend grabbing this game when it's on sale and then spending an evening/night playing this in the dark with headphones on.			"

												First of all, i dont understand why alot of people had issues running the game.It clearly said GTX 470 or up, and the error message tells you to update win7, thats what i did and thats how the game started to run for me without any problems this far, except for one freeze only.about the game itself, its the first Unreal Engine 4 game to be released and i have to say, i like what i see.some of the reviews here say it looks like some bad UT3 mod or something, but i doubt they played it on the highest specs.the game itself is running on Dx11 basis and you can add some neat effects, like HBAO + which is considered a next gen feature.the physic effects look nice and add to the creepy atmosphere, altough the textures could be a little better at some places.the gameplay was enjoyable for me so far, didnt make much progress, but there was enough difference, i didnt have to see the same doors and walls over and over again, it can also be very scary when you know somethings coming closer, but you dont know where its coming from. youll be surprised by some really terrifying looking ghost.this game does what its supposed to do:be next gen, be a scary maze/puzzle/survival game, that actually really changes whenever you load it up and look good doing it. the sounds and the creepy atmosphere really add up to it.my final verdict would be 8.5 out of 10, i can say the 9 EUR i payed for the pre order were not misplaced.

												I beat this game in 2 hours without trying to speed run. A lot of the setting is cool looking, but the bad guys are all the same and repetitive. Sometimes the horror movie style creep moments are cool, but really not a lot of substance. The 'story' felt like it was going somewhere important, but was ultimately pointless.Also, when I bought the game it wasn't made obvious that the Oculus support was DK1 only... which upset a lot of people. They've never added DK2 support, and I'm pretty sure the company is now dead...			"

												Let those who argue about 'definitive' in the genre.  What this game has taught me is a far greater lesson.  The lesson is that I don't care for survival horror.It's not that I get freaked out by video games from time to time.  A jump scare is fun sometimes.  It's not that this is necessarily a bad game.  It could be very good in its genre.  But outside of Code Veronica, this game has galvanized that I do not enjoy the genre.  I don't get scared by the monster chasing me in the hall.  I don't get scared by the popup ghosts.  I just don't get scared.  I get curious, I work through the motions of investigating or leaving, but that's about it.  The genre becomes less of a game and more of a chore.   I'm the one that's broken, but this game has showed me it's me.As for the game itself, I can't give it a negative review.  It has a good atmosphere that it's aiming for.  There's plenty of backstory to fill in with all those papers left around.  Graphically and audibly it was pleasing.  Possibly I could appreciate it further in VR or 3D (this game seems to heavily support those kinds of options).  As it stands, it seems to have direction and only climbing the boxes felt truly tedious.The fact that the levels are supposed to be procedurally generated by some degree should lend some replayability to this game.But, I've found this isn't my genre so you may want to shop around other reviews.

												Well what is there to say about Daylight you might ask? Many things. Is there any positive things to say about the poorly produced game that looks like a two year old with a birth defect that affected his brains functioning skill crafted you might add? Well if you some how find a way to start the game up with out crashing (me being the lucky Romania sex slave i am, i find a way) and manage to get through the first 10 seconds of the eye gouging testical ripping lag and low fps minefeild and the little to no information about the storyline and what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on and why in all of satans red flaming pubes did they name the main character Sarah, i guess you can say the spider at the start was moderately scary. 420/666 would get into a car tape and rusty nail to the dash board find and old woman crossing the road to hit but applying pressure to the breaks before impact so hitting her causes her to die from impact and me to die from my head hitting off the nail taped to the dash again			"

												Today's Review: DaylightWhen you play games like this one you have 1 of 2 things to say, the truth or a convincing lie, i'm gonna go for the truth. This game is utter CRAP, from early the game uses MUCH more cpu and memory that is minimum or recomended, far more in fact, to be straight with you, watch dogs runs better in my computer than this game, this can be caused by a numerous things but the main reason is the poorly optimization this game have, the anwful work design and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea of using the unreal engine 4, i mean this game is just a benchmark for the UE4, and fails at it because i meet the minimun requirements and i almost have the recomended to play and still after like 10 minutes of play (the game loads while you're playing, so you have to stand in front of a door waiting the game to load the next part) and it hangs completly, while you still hear the music, this game sucks in every posible way and it's trully the work of useless programers trying to make a quick buck, don't buyt it even if is on sale, even free it's a bad choice.Metascore: 1/100 ""If you look for the world♥♥♥♥♥♥(s-hit) on the diccionary, you'll see ""Daylight"")			"

Just took our money and provided us with ""nothing of a kind"" experience - BUGS, FAIL STARTS, Short story, dumb texts. As for the graphic !?!? Unreal 4 Engine?!!? Hell it looks like game from 90s. Don`t get me wrong I LOVE the 90s games - Thief Series / System Shock. DOOM 1 looks waaay better. Look at the furniture - just no comment. And the jump scares - pfff are very bad. Random paranormal events they`ve said, just a minute ago I`ve died and beeing reborn, before even 1st step appears in front of me a ghost and kills me again without even timing to react to lit my stupid Flares. DON`T SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AND DON`T SUPPORT THE AUTORS - THEY DON`T DESERVE IT!!!			"

												Daylight. This game will ♥♥♥♥ing blow you away.I never dreamed it will come to this, game world evolving real fast. Horror games on Unreal Engine 4!While playing this horror game Daylight i saw great graphics, gameplay and excellent story.You playing as a middle aged woman, who wake up in the haunted asylum. You need to find a way out, avoiding ♥♥♥♥ing ghosts and trying to find flares, they are really helpful. You will travel from asylum to prison and other locations including house, which will collapse in the end, but you will manage to escape before ghost got you, then end titles roll up.I found this game very big and original, you can explore big areas and dark rooms. With new map system, your every playthrough will be unique, random generated rooms/areas. You can replay and enjoy this game for eternity!Be careful, ghost can ♥♥♥♥ you up real quick, so just run pass them or hide somewhere. Its pretty scary i admire how ghost looks and behave, you could swear they look the same, but its not true. You getting slowly paranoid :DSuch an underrated horror game, but people want to play♥♥♥♥♥♥like Witcher and Counter-strike these days :C10/10We need Daylight 2! Please!			"

												My early first impressions of, Daylight:Technical problems aside, and yes there are a lot of technical problems, my early first impressions of Daylight as far as the game itself is concerned, is that it is a horror game masterpiece. And just a video game masterpiece in general.The main number one reason why I say this is because Daylight is a procedurally generated video game which means that things are different each time you play. Procedurally generated video games are a work of absolute genius.Because what this means for Daylight is tons of re-play value.I personally don't re-play the majority of games that I have. I'll play through most of my games once and then move on to something else, especially the ones that are heavily scripted. I find scripted video games to be the worst. Because after you learn the patterns of a scripted video game, it gets boring after a while because you know exactly what is going to happen. For example the original un-modded version of Doom 3 which is heavily scripted. You know that no matter what, no matter how many times you play through the game, this monster is going to show up at this exact same location, that monster is going to show up at that same exact location once you reach the certain areas to trigger them to spawn.Daylight is a whole different story. With each play through, things are different. The notes are in different locations. The sound effects are different. The monsters spawn at different times and different locations. The layout of the map is different. The glow sticks and flares are in different locations. All of this is just absolutely incredible. This keeps Daylight fresh and new at all times. Plus it makes the game even more scary because you never know exactly what's going to happen next because the monsters spawn at random with each playthrough.Add top notch scary sound effects to all of that and Daylight is an absolute horror masterpiece.It's important to note that I haven't yet completed the game yet. So this is just my early first impression of the game. And it's definitely on the right track.			"

												This game, well if you can call it that is a broken mess on the PC. The PS4 version is actually playable!!!! If you can stand it. Repititious is one of many well deserved slanderous terms for this game. The PC version has you chugging along on a pretty good gaming PC, or if you are chugging along your PC recieves a Fatal error and the game crashes, it is god awful! It is like they did not even try to complete the PC version! As soon as you load it it just pretty much begins running laggy for me at least, the frame rate is disastrous! It literally just chugs! Than like most people and I just said, fatal errors and glitches GALORE! I am almost entirely certain you will crash at some juncture in this train wreck, the PS4 version shows that this game is just complete repititious crap. You will be sick of it in ten minutes.			"

												Sigh, after playing this game for 6 hours I finally stopped to write this negative review. I've been playing for six hours but I have been stuck looking at the wall the entire F'ing time. The controls aren't very specific or easy so I accidentally ran up to the wall in the first minute of playing and i haven't figured out how to turn around so I've just wasted all this time. I wish I could have my money back and 6 hours of my life back. 0/10			"

												Its a good game, for 7.99 i think ill dive into it a couple time more, which people dont understand reveals more story. Its a good game to give yourself chills and yet make it to sleep without nightmares. Its no outlast. But in many ways thats a good thing, it wont make your drop the game for a while to recharge. You can have a hour of randomly generated scares then play something else. Yeh its not very deep its a 7/10 But i would play this more than AAA games like titanfall and infamous second some which bored and disappointed me to sleep. I wanted a randomly generated, small film lenght horror game and i got it. Dont know why everyone♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ not like you payed £40 for another failed dead space 3 resident evil or silent hill.			"

												You awake in a building and you don't know where or why you are there. As your proceed you start to find about where you are, what happened there and why you are there. The gameplay is rather simple. You slowly explore areas and use glowsticks which help reveal items of interest around you (which is usefull as every playthrough is randomly generated), flares which 'burn' 'monsters' and your phone which acts as a map and light source. The game provides for a tense and creepy experience, although those looking for jump scares will be left dissapointed as the game has little in the way of such moments which I myself did not miss at all.The largest potential issues I fell many may have is the games length, lack of inovation in terms of the horror and how easy it can become to get temporarioly lost largely as a result of its randamoly generated levels (note the levels are randomly generated, the objectives are not). Personally I like it when I get lost in a game especially when I am given the tools to not be lost (eg: thge map). Likewise it took myself three hours to finish though many have reported finishing the game in under an hour though replayability thanks to the levels always bieng different will be higher then in most similar games. Daylight however doesn't bring anything new to the horror game genre and whilst enjoyable will leave those expeccting new and/or unique mechanics dissapointed.			"

												I have recently been able to play Daylight, and I'm glad that I have. This game is like a good horror movie - well-paced, good timing and it finds the player rooting for the protagonist - whoever that appears to be. It's also very creepy. I currently do Let's Plays on YouTube (Flintsiders Productions), and I feel like game has been the source of the best videos I have done on there.

												This is a tough one. Daylight got more than it's fair share of jump scares out of me. For that I think I got my money's worth. There are some serious issues with the graphics though. Anywhere that was a large body of water was just a bunch of untextured tiles. Then there were times when the witches would show up, but my cell phone wasn't showing me that there were any around (and let me tell you that made the hard mode run that much more frustrating). This game is flawed, very much so, but I think if it was on sale I would buy it no problem. You get what you expect. A melodramatic couple of hours of jump scares. If you're looking to fight off mobs of witches this isn't really the best game for that. I'd say if this hits the 5 dollar range you should snatch it up. Over that you really have to want to play this game.			"

												Yeeeaaah I was dissapointed. This game had one purpose, showcasing the new Unreal 4 engine (which is beautiful by the way) Graphically, the environment is highly detailed (for a fifteen dollar game), and DX11 makes the atmosphere more palpable, but its really hard to immerse yourself in a game that sucks this bad. The environment doesn't change nearly enough, and by the time it does change a little bit, you find yourself at the end of the game.     This is certainly not worth fifteen dollars, I would only reccomend it if there is a sale on it and the price drops to anywhere less than eight dollars. It's just so ""meh""    PS; I cannot wait for future Unreal 4 titles. Mmmmm.			"

												I'd love to recommend this game but I can't. I'm sorry guys. The game contain a very strange bug or issue when I click in the ""Graphic Options"" on the ""Settings Menu"". When I do this, the game shut it down by itself and appear one window full of path command lines telling ""FATAL ERROR"" in the title and the next lines shows the full path of the game initiating by one HEX Code error and terminating in /daylight.exe... I've to say here that my rig is good and have not any problems with the hardware. My rig is a DELL Inspiron 15R that brings an switchable ATi Radeon 7730 Graphic Card and I know to put this to run all the latest and next-gen games. So, the problem isn't here! I see the game has been patched today again (version 1.2) but did nothing here.In the future, IF the game become fixed then I'll be here to change my review and recommendation. Thanks!EDIT: Please guys! WTF this game just works IF we do not change the graphics settings inside game options? When I click to see and possibly to change something, the game just forced close! It have some address ram memory error because shows a text file full of crap error lines. I BOUGHT THIS GAME AND I WANT TO USE IT THE WAY I LIKE. So, come on!EDIT 2: Lame game. Doesn't work. Crash after crash, nothing changed at least here for me. My video card support DirectX 11 so it's not the problem with the FATAL ERROR when I go into graphics options on the game. NOW, after the latest patch, the game loads forever in the initial screen and it's consuming 1.8gb RAM.			"

												First, let me start off by saying this is my first survival horror game, so this review is meant more as a supplement to other more seasoned reviews as opposed to a standalone. Also my playtime on record was mostly ""sitting time"". I've spent maybe about 2-3 hours playing the game, and I'm maybe half way through. Most people say they beat it in 2 hours or less, but I try to take my time on games and find everything.I enjoy the genre of the game and am somewhat glad I got to expirience it because it opened me up to the genre. However it seems my first game in the genre was extremely lackluster compared to others which comes at a relief because this game is mediocre at best. I'm fortunate in the fact that I got this game for free with my graphics card I purchased. The sound is the best quality of the game, with random noises in the background you would expect from these games, screams, stomping, whatever that sound is the witches make as they chase you, etc. The music is good and adds suspense, I enjoy the little piano title song. Everything else in this game is below expectations. I'm most disapointed in the graphics. I expected better from the new unreal engine, however it looks like something that would have come out a few years ago. One reviewer described it as ""looking like a student project"" which is exactly what I thought as I walked through the randomly generated mazes.You play as a girl named Sarah in which you really know nothing about, and so far in my playthrough no character development has been attempted. Using a cellphone as a map/flashlight to light your way around the mazes of a hospital, sewer, prison, and forest you search for remnants in the form of notes to peopel at the aforementioned areas that try to add some backstory to the areas you wander. Another reviewer described the narrative as ""fan fiction grade"" which I couldn't agree more. In the last one I found there was even a word missing which really urked me. After you find all the remnants in an area you can then find the key to use on a ""magical door"", as another reviewer described it, to access the next area. While searching for said remnants and the key ""witches"" will appear around corners or behind you with a shrieking noise and then give chase unless you utilize a flare. They were kind of fun at first, but now they are appearing too often and it has just become an annoyance. I had to take a break from the game because everytime I'd walk into a certain room a witch would appear and chase me out making me lose the progress I had made in the maze. Everytime I tried to get back to the room another witch would appear either in the room or in the hallway as I was making my way back to the room and chase me again. It happened at least five times in a row, and I became very aggravated. Sarah walks at a pretty slow pace which requires some patience. I go through the game running pretty much everywhere I go. However, while running the game tries to imitate some of the newer horror movies which are made as if they're home videos in the sense that the camera moves around a lot while the person filming moves. I.E. The Blair Witch Project. Lastly, the game utilizes an autosave function with no way to manually save. There's no quitting whenever you want, so hopefully you don't get too frightened or aggravated in between saves.At the end of the day I would give this game a 5/10 and I can not recommend anyone pay $15 for it. As stated before I got it for free. At most I would pay $5 for this game. If you're looking for a new survival horror game, have played all the other big titles, and this game is on sale go ahead and give it a try. The game is scary but as most others have said there are better games in the genre.My quotes throughout the review were from reviewer ""[AReV]BavarianGod"". You can find his review on this page, as well as his video review.			"

												I'm going to keep it relatively short here and simply say that, having played the frequently mentioned titles favored in this genre, I can still find Daylight highly enjoyable. If I have one complaint so far, it is the fact that it isn't very well optimized and I have a fairly standard set up in my rig.At any rate, I do recommend trying this title out. Maybe not at full price, but during a sale at, or less than, $10 would be fine in my opinion. Anyway, enjoy!			"

												 What a let down:/. This is my first review and, I hate to say this game isn't worth your time.  Here are my issues.I can forgive the graphics, but you become really frustrated and angry that the HUD on your smart phone doesn't really help you locate the notes, (like Slender) to make progress.  Here, you don't feel dread when you find the next note, simply feelings like: ""It's about time! What the ♥♥♥♥? Didn't I search in this room already? *sigh* She better not kill me...""Later check points are horrible. You'll grind your teeth because what works in the beggining with flares, will not work later. Sometimes the ghost will do a stealth kill on you, without you even seeing her. The red blur will affect your vision when you try running away, and it makes it frustrating, not scary, when you are trying to get away.The ending...really?...REALLY?!?! I beat this at a buddies house, and we both looked at each other similar to when Miley Cyrus twerked it up.  It's fun to play horror games with a friend, but I had to see that he was as frustrated as I was. Too bad I didn't save him from buying this game. Just don't waste your time guys.			"

												There was just so much potential in this game. I really could have liked it, if it hadn’t been for the severe graphics flaws. Daylight has wasted enough of my time, so I won’t bother going into the things you might like about the game, which for me, is a big deal as I try to keep an open mind and look for the positives in every game. Daylight’s most severe issue is its heavy requirements to even play. You’ve got a system check to make sure your computer can even handle loading the game much less play it in a comfortable fashion. Now, before I get hate-spam, yes, my computer got all passes on this checklist and all of my drivers are up to date. Still, playing this game with EVERY SINGLE SETTING AS LOW AS IT CAN POSSIBLY GO was almost impossible. I say almost because I have, in fact, beaten it multiple times, but it was a miserable experience and not worth the stress just to get the achievements. Even with the settings as low as possible, the game was choppy, the screen froze, I fell through the world twice in the forest, I had the game completely crash and close without warning, and on at least one occasion I had to reboot my computer to get out of the lock-up. I realized these problems, specifically the screen freezing, happened every single time I tried to use a flare. I would light the flare, and immediately it would freeze. I could hear the flare hissing away, I could even hear myself scream and hear the dying-notice pop up, but I would still be looking at a screen of hand half-raised with newly lit flare, and be unable to move. I ran four playthroughs of this game, and each time I spent the ENTIRE game staring at the floor and relying on the mini-map to move. Another graphics issue is that at the end there are several cut-scenes, and I had no idea what these were supposed to be. It turns out, that is because my screen was ONLY showing a zoomed-in top-left hand corner of the whole picture before fading to blinding white and ending. I still have no idea what the real ending is supposed to look like. And I never will.That being said, whether it’s a graphics issue or an AI issue, multiple times I would have a lit flare up and a witch would come out and kill me, and be completely unaffected by the flare (which is supposed to burn them away and defend you). This happened like clockwork in the prison level hard mode every single time I reached 6/8 remnants and attempted to look for numbers 7 & 8, six times in a row before I finally lucked out. That was the last of my runs. I have not gathered all the achievements on this game. For those that know me, this screams as to the quality of this game as I am an achievement addict and a masochist and will continue to play a game long after I’ve lost interest in it JUST to complete the achievements.All in all, I do not recommend Daylight. For the price they charge, four short chapters worth of content, and all the graphics nightmares of a rushed EA title, I’d recommend ordering some delivery and catching up on your favorite tv shows instead. You will have a much better time.			"

												This game still needs allot of work! I would consider it more of a pre-beta release. I have yet to make it off the first floor of the first stage because of random issues.-The game menu stays open and won't close.-Everything looks like its in 3D even though I have 3D off.-Shading and lighting and shadows all look sub-par even though I have all the settings amped (GTX 770) I'm waiting for some major patches before I dedicate any attention to this game.

												I recomend this game because even though it might not be scary all the time for most those people are going into the game expecting to much from a newley released game its got good aspect like a good build up how ever the lack of storie line is a bad aspect but all in all i belive that if your get into it then the game becomes a whole lot more scary and as you progress then it gets more and more scary so give it a try and enjoy			"

												You're all in for one spooooooky ride with this one...I was so horrified by the display of human negligence set before me, that i barely lasted 30 minutes until i was forced to slam on the escape key repeatedly and run out into the daylight to remind myself that life can yield good things if you seek them. the only thing disturbing or frightening about this game is the sudden realization after you stop playing, that with the money you spent on this you could have bought 10 snickers bars. and let me be the first to tell you, severe chocolate and/or peanut allergies would still yield a much more enjoyable purchase than this disgrace upon mankind. i urge you to stay far far away from this travesty of interactive media. you will probably find more original horror scares in a game like ""Geometry Wars: retro evolved"". I know you may be enticed like i was by the ""first next generation unreal engine 4 game"", but believe me, it doesnt even look good, and it runs about as smooth as a 1962 chevy underwater with the windows down. if this is the next generation of gaming then i don't even wanna know.. I dont even wanna KNAAAAOOOOW!			"

												Daylight was enjoyable. Good, spooky atmosphere. The story is pretty good, recycled but done well. Liked the lack of ""combat"" and complete emphisis on survival. Sometimes the clue hunt got a bit tedious when I had to keep back-tracking endless corridors looking for that one missing clue. Also, very quick death happens when you simply turn a corner and ... you're dead"".Plus, the Nvidia ""special enhanced graphics"" didn't really add much, the production values are obviously on par with a small studio ... I didn't involve this in my review. Startups don't have the biggest budgets and they need to pick and choose where to use their money. I play slowly and I finished the game in 7 ""game hours"".Overall this was a good effort and I give it a solid 7 out of 10.			"

												Really resisting the urge to turn on all my lights right now. Daylight to me so far seems pretty solid. Definitely a game for horror fans and those who like figuring out mysteries. Controls seem stiff but its something you get used to (and by stiff I mean the speed which you turn, tried adjusting sensitiivity, didn't do anything for me.)I've read a lot of negative stuff about this so far. That stuff doesn't work and such. I haven't seen any problems so far. Then again I didn't start playing til after a couple of updates. The atmosphere is creepy. This will look very good on high end machines. The halls look a lot alike. So if getting lost annoys you prepare yourself because you're gonna be checking your phone often to find the right way. Again if liitle things like that annoy you prepare yourself. Then again its another thing you'll get used to.Is this worth 14.99? Maybe. Should you buy it on sale? Yes. When I play more my opinion may change either way for this game.			"

												First level isn't scary at all and i guess is more of a tutorial to get you use to it.  Second level will make you @#$ yourself if you play it in 3D.  After that sadly the 3d screws up and the frames are massivly dropped.  Also it is to short and isn't worth what is charged for it unless they release free dlc later on.  Scare value is worth it though and once all the bugs are worked out this game has the potential to be awesome!			"

												Zombie Studios tried its best to bring hype to their horror game Daylight. They went as far as enabling Twitch commands in the game to have viewers attempt to influence the game with spooky soundbites and occurances (definitely inspired by the Twitch Plays Pokemon frenzy that gripped the internet a number of weeks ago). They delayed the game for a few weeks in attempt to make it scarier (given what is in the game now, they must have forgotten to put the monster into the game and had to buy time). It was all for naught.The game starts with a young woman name Sarah waking up in an abandoned hospital to the strange voice of a man who spouts in riddles. The goal of the game is rather basic and unfortunately repetitive: collect a number of 'remnants' (items that glow in a weird yet cool fashion under the light of a glowstick), find a big magic circle and then move to the next level. There are four levels in all and not much changes outside of the level design. The more time you waste or the further you progress in your quest, you will run into the witch, the only monster and threat in the game. The witch's method of killing you is flying around, popping up in front of you as you do a quick turn and then shove you into a tunnel of red and weird rune shapes until you die or pull a flare out in time to banish them. Fortunately in my playthrough she did this only a few times and gave me some frights when she appeared. Unfortunately she's the only unit in the game and basically a creepy one trick pony. Outside of the witch, the only kind of scares that the game tries to use are feint scares. Items suddenly fly out towards you but do no harm. Screams come down the hall but there is no actual creature wandering around and making that noise. Besides the witch, the game felt like walking through a cheap haunted house that the neighborhood put together for one Halloween night to spook the kids. More silly than scary and no actual harm is done.  Daylight is apparently the first game released to the public that uses the Unreal 4 engine. But given the potentials of the tech demos of the engine, it felt like they didn't even try to create an immersive world and used it more for the sake of marketing. They bought expensive paint but went and fingerpainted what appears to be a red house, a green tree and a happy stick figure family. But hey, they bought that expensive paint! You should consider that!Sarah's character was very hard to immerse with. She fills the atmosphere with her gasps and her occassional strange lines, which are very frequent. I kid you not, I was investigating a desk when Sarah yelled out ""Is anyone in there?"". Maybe she was afraid that the witch would pop out of the drawers and get papers all over the place. The problem with Sarah is how little she contributes to the story. She collects remnants, questions Mystery Phone Man of what's going on and then goes on her merry way to collect more remnants without any hint of defiance or free will whatsoever. It was very strange to see her panic and question every thump in the dark, real or not, and remain silent to the witch that constantly screams at her face. Daylight was written by Jessica Chobot, who is best known as that woman who achieved internet fame for having a photo of herself licking a PSP. She worked for IGN and did a voice role as Diana Allers in Mass Effect 3 (although it's clear that she slept through her voice acting classes). Her writing comes in the forms of Mystery Phone Man's riddlespeak and the dozens of documents lying around about patients being crazy and workers suspecting something isn't right in the hospital. The concept of incredible amounts of notes in games started with Resident Evil and was recently enforced in Amnesia. But those kinds of documents either clued to upcoming puzzles, environmental obstacles and monsters or provided a piece of a story of things slowly going to hell.  The problem with Daylight's notes is that they provide nothing but fluff and make the very short game feel much longer. There are no traps to be warned about ahead of time. There are no upcoming characters that you must help or fight off. Besides vaguely explaining what is actually going on, the notes do nothing to change how the game should be played. I reached the disappointing conclusion to the game in just two hours. For $15 dollars and no significant replay value besides achievements, I feel cheated. Outlast had the atmosphere, Dear Esther had the writing and Amnesia had both. Daylight had neither. It's tradition under my household that a horror game is to be played at night. Daylight, amusingly enough from the title alone, should be just played in daylight. Or shouldn't be played at all.			"

												Although some people are having issues getting the game to run, I still found it to be an enjoyable game. On a 1-10 scale, I would probably go with a 7. The story is very interesting, all the way through the end (which I found to be quite fantastic) - Assuming you actually take the time to explore and find the story pieces hidden everywhere. Your surroundings are always very creepy, and you constantly have the fear of turning around or going around corners. They did a great job with the psychological terror. Though the gameplay sadly is very much the same all the way through (go find X amount of pieces, grab what you've needed, go to next section) I still found it to be an overall enjoyably creepy experience. The only down sides are that the game, I think, is a tad too short. But the wealth of exploration that sometimes comes around and trying to find every piece of the story welcomes multiple playthroughs. So my advice: As long as your hopes aren't way up there, buy this game (but first make sure you can run it), because it was an enjoyable, creepy experience that I plan on going through a couple more times myself.

												I'm a huge fan of horror but this game ♥♥♥♥ing blows. I would like to first brign up that I beat the game and got most of the collectibles on normal in about two hours. From what I payed thats around $5 an hour and I got it on sale. The game has you doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥the whole time too, it's always find 6 letters and then you can finally grab the key that opens the door into the next area. The one saving grace to this game are the collectibles (not the stupid pictures) mainly the letters that do an alright job at fleshing out the creepy lore. Besides that everything kind of fall flat. The games main areas are ""procedurally generated"" which basicly mean you can expect the same ♥♥♥♥ing hallways and rooms copy and pasted around the place. There is only one single enemy in the game (why they could have done so much with variety) that really only teleports behind you and makes loud noises. The enemy is really just boring after a few minutes beause it gives up on chasing you really fast and can be out run easily. It doesn't help that all the scares are cheap jump scares. The rooms lose any automsphere when you've been seeing them all over the place. Also the use of glow sticks and flares should have been toned down or not been in here at all. Glow sticks highlight points of intrest like desks,cupboards etc( only select few can be searched ). Flares on the other hand instantly get rid of ""shadows"" chasing you although throwing lit flares down seems to just have a visual effect, so the enemy vanishes when your holding it but if it's just on the floor lit, it doesn't even notice it...  I KNOW STUPID RIGHT!   Also I don't know why they thought it was a good idea to have abandoned pouches with glowsticks all over the island but whatever guess there must have been a few raves. Unlike for example Slender I don't see much replay value, sure the hallways may be arranged differently but the enemy chasing you isn't nearly as fun. Overall this game had a lot of potential... but ♥♥♥♥ed up. If it's on sale go ahead but you'll probably only play it once, maybe twice.			"

												Daylight: An indie horror game that i believe is worth the money.it follows a semi slender kind of mission where you have to find Remnants to unlock a key and find your way to the next mission.it does have its own unique twist on the slender idea and made for a great game. pretty good story so far as well, with a few jumpscares here and there, a creepy as♥♥♥♥♥♥atmosphere and random whispsers in the backround, it keeps you paranoid, thinking someones watching you, so far i am enjoying the game, only thing i dislike is how hard it is to find remnants without glowsticks, especially if your looking for the final glowstick! i did/ am doing a Youtube walkthrough/ playthrough or whatever you call it, if you want to see what it looks like, heres the game in action, ( Sorry im still working on my commentating skills )

What's more, the error messages I get are BLANK. Really helpful, there.I'd check back in a few months down the line when maybe they've fixed the real problems.

The Twitch integration is amazing - log in after you start streaming, and your viewers can enter commands to make things happen around you.

I installed it expecting the graphics to be jaw-dropping with DX11 and didn't get it.  I installed it with the anticipation that the game would probably suck...and it does.

												Although it looks fun from the trailers it doesnt really live up to the hype. I pre-ordered it because it looked like it would be worth the $10 at the time, however it has fallen incredibly short of expectations. After waiting several days after launch to play the game because of an unpatched crash bug, the game was not off to a good start. Then to add salt to the wound, I spent 30 minutes wandering around without a clear objective of what it is I am to do with poor scares to boot. I wish this game had been worth it but it falls tragically short. Id recommend Outlast and the new DLC over Daylight.			"

												I'll start off by saying that I was looking forward to the release of Daylight. However, once I was able to play the game(which has been an issue for a lot of people) I realized that this game was over-hyped. The game does not play well on my system (FX-8350, 12GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 750 TI,  and an SSD) which I still don't understand considering the graphics are nothing special to me.Other than the playability issues the game does just OK as a horror game. It attempts to scare players with a lot of cheap tricks that are often not scary.So to sum up what I think about Daylight would be that there are a lot better games out there in this genre.			"

												Having just finished Daylight a couple minutes ago, it's still fresh in my mind. I beat it in one sitting in the span of about 80-ish minutes. I can't exactly say it was what I expected, but I don't exactly know what I expected. First off, the game is quiet repetitive. Each area of the game requires you to collect about six ""Remnants"" which if you've played Slender you can just call ""Pages"" Once you've gotten all of the Remnants you then must go find a ""Sigil"" which is a haunted item that unlocks the next area. Each area begins with a small transition stage where a lot of story related notes are. This formula persists throughout the entire game and can get dull after a while.The game's backstory is told mostly by notes and the Remnants you collect around the level, it isn't too much. Mainly just exposition about the hospital, what happened there, and how it was shut down. While the main storyline in the game is almost invisible. The game doesn't tell you why you're there and the only reason I know why is from a developer interview with TotalBiscuit where it was mentioned. But other than that you pretty much walk through the hospital and listen to the voices of two people. Yourself, who's only comments usually consists of ""Is someone in there?"" Or ""Oh god! Make it stop!"", and the... Other person, who talks to the main character (Sarah) throughout her quest. I don't believe the game ever tells you who he is or how the hell he's talking to you in the first place. I'm assuming it's through the phone but I'm not sure. The ending is... Okay. Don't expect it to wow you in any way and expect to get a little whiplash from it's sudden climax. It felt like they were rushing to clear things up, explain it all, and end the game right then and there.The horror aspect isn't anything special, but it's well done. I jumped out of my seat quite a few times upon encountering the ghost. Named ""Shadows"" by the game. You're only way to fight them off are using the flares, which don't look as good in-game as they did in the demos with the incredibly violent, dark shadows. In the actual game their shadows aren't as defined and it's pretty much just a brighter glowstick that burns ghosts. The glowsticks act as the game's ""Help me"" button. Using a glowstick reveals key items such as containers that might contain items and key items. (Mainly containers though.) As well as providing a decent amount of light. The ghosts are scary enough, but there is something I wanted to mention down below.Okay, so this game is VERY inconstant with some of it's gameplay demos before release, mainly in the aspect of the enemy's appearance. Some show them as a floating green monster with a big gaping mouth and long limbs, but in reality the game's enemy is... Well, there isn't really much to spoil. If you've seen a creepy ghost lady in a horror movie, then you've seen the Daylight monster. It's rather unoriginal. It looks cool, don't get me wrong, but it's unoriginal. While the green monster didn't look too scary, if they gave it a better design it would have been really cool to see. As I also mentioned before, the flare's don't look like they advertised in some gameplay demos, casting large, jagged dynamic shadows across the area? No, not really. It just creates a large, bright red glow. I wouldn't label it as false advertising, as later trailers showed the scary woman ghost. It's just confusing.My rating of Daylight would be about in the 6/10 for you people who like that sort of rating. It's a fun game to play while it lasts, and the procedural generation gives it some replay value, but it's rather slow and repetitive with a story which isn't too interesting. Collectibles may be another reason to replay it, however for some reason you can't reread collected notes unless they were Remnants. It's got it's scary moments, and for the price it isn't too bad. I happened to get it for free from a giveaway from a Youtube channel. InstinctiveHDGaming. Go check him out, he's pretty interesting.But enough advertisements, I'm going to go and see if I can rack up enough money for the new Outlast DLC, hopefully that can satisfy my horror cravings.			"

												Hands down one of my favorite Horror game (so far). what's very unique about the game is the fact that each time you start the game, the level is generated (meaning rooms and artifacts are moved and mixed, similar to making a new world on minecraft), so it always feels new playing this game. Where as the story was a little confusing, the gameplay was smooth and controls are very simple. 1 for glowsticks, 2 for flares, and M for map, thats just about all you need to know. the game didn't have much jumpscares for me, mainly because i was on the easy difficulty, so i would recommend being on medium or hard diffuculty for a more ""Challenging"" more ""Frightening"" expirence. it is a little overpriced for a short game, i beat it in one day (i know, i have no life) its a good 6 to 7 hours of gameplay depending on your pace (as scary as it is, it gets pretty fast-paced). as it is a good game, nearing the end, the game got a little old kinda fast. on each level you do the same thing as you did the previous level, i wont ruin much but you find remnants while staying away from ghosts. as for the graphics, they're pretty good. if you've ever played Blacklight: Retribution (which you should) it has just about the same detail in graphics as Daylight (Mainly because Daylight was made by the same people that made Blacklight (no pun intended)) me personally, i dont play much horror games, or finish them, but this game is definentally a must for people who like horror games. but overall, i would give it an 8/10 mainly it gets a little old kinda fast nearing the end of the game. but seriously BUY THIS GAME :D			"

												I picked this game up for free with Nvidia's promotional offer with a GTX 780. I'm going to keep this short and simple.The game starts off somewhat slow, but soon enough you are thrown into what the game is all about... suspense. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long. After about a half hour of gameplay, I'd seen everything the game had to offer... which is not much, I completed my first playthrough in two hours. None of the achievements appear to be working correctly for this game, as the ones I unlocked all popped up, but only one of them appears to have saved.It was a great, if not short, timewaster, however it's not worth it's $15 pricetag. The way I figure it is, for two hours, it's more or less the cost of a movie, the often-compared to entertainment alternative to gaming. Time dependent, it lasts about as long as some movies, too. However, as stated above, after a half hour, I had seen everything the game had to offer, which, effectively aakes a half-decent movie a better buy.The climax and conclusion of the last ""act"" of the game, seemigly suppossed to be the most suspenseful, ended up being the least suspenseful part of the game. I'll avoid spoilers here... but suffice to say, it was completed by just continually sprinting around. You'll understand how effective it is, should you endure through the game to get there yourself.While this game is procedurally generated, and even upon death, the map changes... it offers very limited replayability. All the scripted jump scares happen in all the same places, and you come to expect them.On the onset of my second playthrough, it also appears to be the same storyline.			"

												I'll just put the bottom line good and bad out there from what i've seen so far.  As always with these types of games it is best experienced with headphones in the dark.The good. Dark creepy atmosphere that is easy to get drawn into. Excellent lighting effects. Jump scares abound. Easy to learn and use controls that remind you of amnesia. Interesting story that is told through random flashbacks newspaper articles and some weird old dude talking over the phone. Ghosts and shadows will definately make you jump out of your skin. Pretty good quality graphics. Reasonably priced game at 15$ Though I was smart and preordered. Try to get it for less than 10$ if you can. The bad. Persistant choppy lag that didn't go away even after I lowered the graphics setting to damn near mid 2000s era quality. This hindered me greatly and caused me no end of doom and frustration, Others are having the same issues as well I may add, this problem MUST be fixed as it is causing some poor souls' games to crash in bad cases.  Recycled enviroments that while randomly generated just don't fit together properly. One second I was in an insane asylum then a morgue then a prison cell block then back to an asylum. They could fix this by having certain areas only spawn around other areas that match them, Then we wouldn't have the confusing unrealistic layouts and everything would flow together seamlessly and make this feel like a true full on retail game. Jump scares abound. Hey, This crap has been done to death if you like it more power to you but most people are tired of this recycled predictable scare tactic. ""Penumbra 1-2&3, amnesia 1&2,Outlast, and a whole slew of other games not to mention a few more that are STILL being developed all have already done it."" (PS buy penumbra and amnesia if you haven't already. Totally worth it.) and while the ambiance IS creepy the jumpscare to ambiance ratio is a bit uneven leading to you just being annoyed by damn ghosts trying to kill you constantly.  Shadows that chase you endlessly. It is KINDA difficult to get♥♥♥♥♥♥done and find all the clues you need to get through the game when the same freaking ghost appears every single time your freaking flare goes out causing you to lose health or die almost instantly. It makes exploring and finding what you MUST have to progress through the game nearly impossible and makes you not want to play it again. This must be fixed as well, I actually had to quit my game because I couldn't advance. Repetitive linear gameplay dispite the randomly generated maps. Do NOT let their talk of randomly generated maps fool you into think that this game will constantly be a new adventure, You will STILL be hunting for the SAME objects in the SAME areas and the only thing that will be different is the layout. Nothing else changes and you still have to find 6 objects to make an object appear that allows you to proceed to the next area where you do the same exact thing. It is the very definition of Tedious. IN CONCLUSION. The game would function PERFECTLY if it were not for the lag as that was the only technical issue I personally have had and it seems to be the big issue with the game itself as many others have the same problem. While pretty to look at the quality of the graphics don't mean anything if the game is so full of lag that everything is constantly fading in and out of focus or glitching out! The game flow is obstructed by random out of place enviroments that just don't fit in which makes the game feel unrealistic which can make it hard to put yourself into the game if you are a fan of attention to detail. There are too many jump scares and not enough buildup to get to those scares which makes most of them in turn, cheap, repetitive, and predictable.  The game at it's core is tedious at best and a never ending array of poorly placed areas won't change that and if the developers thought it would distract people from their lazy game design they are dead wrong. As you play this game you will notice that it is nothing more than a mere knockoff of other better indie games, This one will not be worth your time until it is patched and hopefully updated and offered at a reduced price. get it for less than 9$ if you can as it may not even work at all for you. I give this game an A for effort but a D for execution, With a little more polishing this game will be a buyable and enjoyable game but until then I say steer clear and force the developers to put a little more effort into the game to encourage others to buy it. I give it a 2.5 out of 5.			"

												SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGthis game is another psychological thriller game. yknow what that means much percieved danger very little actual danger. the first ""danger"" i ran into could be defeated/avoided by looking at the wall and ignoring it. i had the stupid thing following me for 3 minutes and when i finally deigned to give it my attention it disappeared.played the game and so far the only thing i really remember is the clip clop of the characters tap dancing shoes, or wait are they sneakers? they squeeqe once in awhile so maybe they are sneakers. anyway the character is a winey ♥♥♥♥♥. she does not shut up. and i really wish she would because as soon as she talkes all immursion leaves the game. ""i know your there"" ""hello"" and so on are the general consistency of her limerics.the gameplay consistes of running through the same corridors over and over again until you find a new clue to getting to the next sigil to open the next glyph and getting another part of the story. it has something to do with the demonic presence in a costal town which first imerged in a mental facility. y'know the usual thing. the demonic thing affects the environment in the usual manner just like in any possession movie since the beggining of cinema, so its nothing new.the game also looks blow average with the textures repeated and low res and the same models repeated and reused all over the place. the light comming from your phone being your major source of illumination meaning its hard to notice them while your moving through the game at a snails pace dragging your slow♥♥♥♥♥whineing donkey through the hallways. the sound resources are reused as well with many sounds coming from the oppisite direction of their logical sources though with the demonic sources of some of them i guess it makes sense.i may try to finish it but right now im just fed up with hearing the main character.i got this game for free with a new video card but if i had paid for it i would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥right now.

This game was way over hyped as well, thinking that this game would be awesome due to the new engine is just dumb, it still looks like meh. Oh and another fun fact, everytime I get deep into the poorly structured story I would clip through a wall and just have to quit out, but good thing that autosave feature doesn't work or else I'd loose all my progress. *wink wink* but yeah if you wanna be frustrated with a game just go buy Dark Souls 2.

												I got this game as a first person maze puzzle game, not for its fright factors.   The complaints about uneven video presentation were not experienced.  I found the maze aspect acceptable, The video a bit too dark but probably necessary to have that spooky feel.  The puzzle seems single themed so once you get the premis behind the first couple of stages you have a fair idea how to proceed further.   I liked the poltergise effects as objects move on their own, it was entertaining.I did not like the preditory ghost concept which only gets faster and faster  as compensation for the lack of puzzle variations to keep the players interest up.  Not a fan of reaction time based games.   The suggested ways of dealing with the preditory regenerating ghost, like , dont look at the ghost, back up through it, look only at the floor, all fail to prevent you from being bumped back to the  last programmed save point, This save point   is not under the users control as the player cannot do a save.   You get bumped back when you die from the ghost attacks.  The ghost damage is cumulative and appears not to allow for a return to health, even when the red visual effects of damage vanish.  The repeated use of flares to ward off ghost attacks can work once you know where to find all the replacement flares and run from one flare storage point to the next while burning up some of  the flares you have on the way.  Due to the lack of variations on a theme I cannot recommend this game as it has little attraction to play again once you have finished it.  Perhaps a random maze and clue placement generator built in to this game might entice a revisit and its durability as a game.			"

												If, like me, you suffer from directional dyslexia, you will find Daylight so frustrating. There is the occasional scare but nothing major (outlast was much better on the whole feel of dread and horror). Wandering blindly around a maze is my own personal hell, mix that up with the potential of running into an enemy and dying, then being dumped back at the beginning of an area which your internal compass can find no bearing in. Rooms moved randomly, item shifted into different places, frustrating as hell. Mostly I ended up finding my way out by accident. Graphics are a bit meh, so much more potential in the engine. Save points come at odd times and not when expected. Some character speech comes at the wrong times, "" what was that noise"" there was no noise love etc. Disjointed voice narrative is non-sensical and unhelpful. To sum it up, so much potential and hype, yet totally missed the bar. May be worth a bang when its down to just a few quid.			"

												Probably one of the worst games I have ever played. The atmosphere is not scary, the enemies are a joke, The puzzles are about as difficult as a coloring book, the controls are incredibly basic, and the graphics are sub-par for a next gen game. It took me a whole hour to run through it. It tends to crash at the end very often too. Took me about 6 loads before it stopped. The randomness of each playthrough isn't that random, the rooms get rearragned, but the layout and items remain the same. The story is very cliche. This was a terrible game for the Unreal 4 Engine to launch with. It utilizes nothing that the engine can offer. Focusing on trying to make each playthrough different, they forgot to make a game worth playing in the first place. If you want a boring, monotonous run through to kill an hour or less, then this game is for you. I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this travesty in gaming.			"

												Not too short and not too long, this little title will make you jump more than a few times and look around frantically in the dark, with only your phone and a glowstick as your sources of light. Driven by an often vague and mysterious plot (which is uncovered both by cryptic messages on your phone and collecting snippets and photographs scattered around the levels) the game will certainly keep you playing it at least a few times over, if just to try and collect all of the collectibles and encounter other events, scares and level layouts.

												I got this game free with a Nvidia graphics card. The game is mindlessley tortrous with the ambient noise, and endless cooridors and hallways that all look the same make the game hard to navigate. The game was too hyped for an overall less than good experience. The user interface is dull, and I cant even change the controls?! (After finding out it was a WASD game, it doesnt even say in the control layout) What a crappy game. Should have waited for a better deal!			"

												Do you enjoy collecting nonsensical story notes? Do you relish completely worthless characters babbling idiocy at you? Do you crave wandering bland environments in which inanimate objects move predictably to scare you? Do you wish not-really-scary monsters would pull the same tried and true disappearing acts over and over again? Well, friend, you're in luck! Buy this now and enjoy! To its credit, the audio was fairly well done, but I'm really struggling to come up with anything else to say about this game that is positive. It looks pretty awful, has extremely repetitive gameplay, contains obnoxious and out of place character dialog, and is horribly predictable. The Slender formula was already showing its age, but this game drives it off the cliff. It's time to move on, folks. There are far better crafted horror games than this available on Steam. I recommend any of them over this.			"

												First off if the game starts you should feel blessed, My GPU goes way passed the recomended system requirements and I still get choppy gameplay and sluggish reactions. The game crashes constanly and the autosave feature doesn't work woerth a damn. This game was way over hyped as well, thinking that this game would be awesome due to the new engine is just dumb, it still looks like meh. Oh and another fun fact, everytime I get deep into the poorly structured story I would clip through a wall and just have to quit out, but good thing that autosave feature doesn't work or else I'd loose all my progress. *wink wink* but yeah if you wanna be frustrated with a game just go buy Dark Souls 2.

												Glad i got this as a freebie with a video card purchase. Isn't worth $5.00 in my opinion. U4 engine, pfft, could have been done in U3 no problem with half the requirements. In the dark with lights out it can have it's moments but gets old and boring within the first 20 minutes.			"

												Total garbage of a game. $15?! Make this POS a F2P pl0x. This game sucks so hard it's like it's a demo of the Unreal Engine 4 with no story or actual gameplay other than running thorugh a bunch of rooms. The game relys to heavily on the low draw distance and over used music to ""spook you."" 1/10 DO NOT BUY. Go buy insomnia or something idgaf			"

												Zombie Studios tried its best to bring hype to their horror game Daylight. They went as far as enabling Twitch commands in the game to have viewers attempt to influence the game with spooky soundbites and occurances (definitely inspired by the Twitch Plays Pokemon frenzy that gripped the internet a number of weeks ago). They delayed the game for a few weeks in attempt to make it scarier (given what is in the game now, they must have forgotten to put the monster into the game and had to buy time). It was all for naught.The game starts with a young woman name Sarah waking up in an abandoned hospital to the strange voice of a man who spouts in riddles. The goal of the game is rather basic and unfortunately repetitive: collect a number of 'remnants' (items that glow in a weird yet cool fashion under the light of a glowstick), find a big magic circle and then move to the next level. There are four levels in all and not much changes outside of the level design. The more time you waste or the further you progress in your quest, you will run into the witch, the only monster and threat in the game. The witch's method of killing you is flying around, popping up in front of you as you do a quick turn and then shove you into a tunnel of red and weird rune shapes until you die or pull a flare out in time to banish them. Fortunately in my playthrough she did this only a few times and gave me some frights when she appeared. Unfortunately she's the only unit in the game and basically a creepy one trick pony. Outside of the witch, the only kind of scares that the game tries to use are feint scares. Items suddenly fly out towards you but do no harm. Screams come down the hall but there is no actual creature wandering around and making that noise. Besides the witch, the game felt like walking through a cheap haunted house that the neighborhood put together for one Halloween night to spook the kids. More silly than scary and no actual harm is done.  Daylight is apparently the first game released to the public that uses the Unreal 4 engine. But given the potentials of the tech demos of the engine, it felt like they didn't even try to create an immersive world and used it more for the sake of marketing. They bought expensive paint but went and fingerpainted what appears to be a red house, a green tree and a happy stick figure family. But hey, they bought that expensive paint! You should consider that!Sarah's character was very hard to immerse with. She fills the atmosphere with her gasps and her occassional strange lines, which are very frequent. I kid you not, I was investigating a desk when Sarah yelled out ""Is anyone in there?"". Maybe she was afraid that the witch would pop out of the drawers and get papers all over the place. The problem with Sarah is how little she contributes to the story. She collects remnants, questions Mystery Phone Man of what's going on and then goes on her merry way to collect more remnants without any hint of defiance or free will whatsoever. It was very strange to see her panic and question every thump in the dark, real or not, and remain silent to the witch that constantly screams at her face. Daylight was written by Jessica Chobot, who is best known as that woman who achieved internet fame for having a photo of herself licking a PSP. She worked for IGN and did a voice role as Diana Allers in Mass Effect 3 (although it's clear that she slept through her voice acting classes). Her writing comes in the forms of Mystery Phone Man's riddlespeak and the dozens of documents lying around about patients being crazy and workers suspecting something isn't right in the hospital. The concept of incredible amounts of notes in games started with Resident Evil and was recently enforced in Amnesia. But those kinds of documents either clued to upcoming puzzles, environmental obstacles and monsters or provided a piece of a story of things slowly going to hell.  The problem with Daylight's notes is that they provide nothing but fluff and make the very short game feel much longer. There are no traps to be warned about ahead of time. There are no upcoming characters that you must help or fight off. Besides vaguely explaining what is actually going on, the notes do nothing to change how the game should be played. I reached the disappointing conclusion to the game in just two hours. For $15 dollars and no significant replay value besides achievements, I feel cheated. Outlast had the atmosphere, Dear Esther had the writing and Amnesia had both. Daylight had neither. It's tradition under my household that a horror game is to be played at night. Daylight, amusingly enough from the title alone, should be just played in daylight. Or shouldn't be played at all.			"

												Although some people are having issues getting the game to run, I still found it to be an enjoyable game. On a 1-10 scale, I would probably go with a 7. The story is very interesting, all the way through the end (which I found to be quite fantastic) - Assuming you actually take the time to explore and find the story pieces hidden everywhere. Your surroundings are always very creepy, and you constantly have the fear of turning around or going around corners. They did a great job with the psychological terror. Though the gameplay sadly is very much the same all the way through (go find X amount of pieces, grab what you've needed, go to next section) I still found it to be an overall enjoyably creepy experience. The only down sides are that the game, I think, is a tad too short. But the wealth of exploration that sometimes comes around and trying to find every piece of the story welcomes multiple playthroughs. So my advice: As long as your hopes aren't way up there, buy this game (but first make sure you can run it), because it was an enjoyable, creepy experience that I plan on going through a couple more times myself.

												This game is not one I would reccomend. Besides having trouble actually getting it to work with some ""fatal error"" the game itself was not that great. You walk around in a abandoned building and it is a rinse and repeat horror. The game also crashed right before beating the game (three times, I had to watch the end on Youtube). It was pretty buggy at points and far from frightening.			"

												Got this game with my GTX 770.................Thanks nvidia for giving me a waste of space in my steam library that is Daylight. This game is boring as hell. Not scary. I think the only thing that might be scary about it is jump scares. I remember when I played this with my friends we were not scared. We were laughing and just got bored of it. I ran towards the monster when I ran out of flares and it got ♥♥♥♥ing scared of me and went away. My review isnt very neat. I do know that I will not playing this game again and will uninstall it after I post this. I'm sorry devs that im trashing your game but...............You guys could have tried. Now Nvidia is giving away watch dogs with the purchase of my graphics card. I'm crying so much :( :( :( >:( SO in a nutshell. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL BE ♥♥♥♥ING SO SAD THAT YOU SPENT YOUR MONEY ON IT. -10/10			"

												A game that I was looking forward to. Unfortunately, this game didn't come close to my expectations.I meet somewhere in the middle of the minimum and recommended specs; Having said that, the game was laggy as hell, even in low and 720p resolution. The game was okay from what I've played but it gets super boring and frustrating very fast. The creatures that you encounter are not that scary, I have Outlast and that game knocks me off my seat, I love the horror genre but this game failed me. I always give games a chance before I review them but this is totally unplayable. No real story line either.On the upside, it looks like a decent game and it definitely gives an atmosphere that was intended, tense and eerie.  "

												SHAKY CAM!!!!  Buyer beware that this game has intense shaky cam. Even when you stand still, the camera is bobbing up and down, left and right. There is no need for this. I feeling like I'm going to puke just staring at the screen for ten seconds. Shaky cam in this instance does not add immersion. In real life, when I stand still, my head does not bob up and down left and right.  This is a cheap gimmick that makes the game unplayable. REsident Evil remake for gamecube gave and still gives plenty of chills, and that game had fixed camera! Environments in RE were rendered in 2D. I cannot understand why the developers would think shaky cam adds to the ""horror"" element and immersion. Even if I didn't get nauseous, the shaky cam is so bad I can't even focus on the enviornment. I try to explore but can't because the screen is moving all over the place. It's a good thing I got this game for free when I bought a GTX 7601That being said, the premise of the game is great. I was excited to play. And it runs well on my computer.			"

												This game is half-baked and lands very short of it's ambitions. It leaves a somwehat interesting aftertaste, but the playing itself is rather boring. It feels like a very early alpha of some indie game.Generated levels is an idea that sounds cool, but in the actual game those generated mazes look dull, repetitive and awfully cluttered. If the devs were braver and added more glitchiness and weirness (think Memory of Broken Dimension) maybe it woul've been more interesting. But they chose to just throw a heap of horror game cliches in a weak attempt to follow Outlast footsteps. Unsuccessfully. Gotta be bolder with this type of game.			"

And if you play this with headset on with volume crancked up and the lights out it will make you crap your pants my fav games are horror tittles and ive played them all but dont take my word for it check it out on youtube first and see what you think. I also noticed peaple giveing it bad reviews after not even playing it over one hour and also a lot of peaple saying you indoors all the time thats not true your out side in big open area's aswell i really like this game and its unfair to judge it after playing it for as little as one hour. I hope they make more games like this i love my horror games so much the first hour in this game is slow but when you reach the prison this game really does show its true darkside and read notes you find or you wont no what is hell is going on in the game 8/10 very good zombie studios keep up the good work			"

												Daylight is to Outlast as console inferiority is to PC superiority.I had HIGH expectations of this game. The debut at E3 was me enticed! But since then I had been playing a recent horror game titled Outlast. Compared to Outlast this game blows...My Dislikes about this game:1) REPITITION!!!! It seemed like I was stuck in the same hallway for what felt like forever. And once you ""die"" you have to repeat the same $h!T over... was unamused.2) Poorly implemented! The game had caused my PC to crash, blue screen and everything! Was extremely upsetting. However, I did just install a recent Windows 8.1 update, so it could have been that...thanks Microsoft!3) It just wasn't scary... I felt a little freaked out, heart was pumping a teeny bit faster, but compared to other scary games... I would have rather had more cheesy jumpscares!4) For a final release (past BETA), $10 is seriously overpriced for this game.5) After reading that this had used the Unreal Engine 4, this is such a disappointment...6) LACK OF INSTRUCTION! Like I didn't know I needed to actually collect ""Relics"" before proceeding to the next area. Some objectives would have helped! 7) The monster wasn't even that scary, just got extremely annoying! I would've rather had her jumping around or something, not float and scream8) A hint that I couldn't use flares while holding the object to unlock the doors would have been EXTREMELY HELPFUL9) ... that I am writing such a long review... My likes about this game:1) It got a little creepy... Reading that flares would help protect me and hearing footsteps at the same time got my finger pressing '2'! 2) The setting for the game was interesting, haunted hospitals are always interesting...3) The sound was great, sqeaky doors  and footsteps were good.Overall OPINION:The game was honestly a great idea, I could see what the devs were trying to go for.But all their ideas were poorly implemented. I only spent an hour before I gave up on the game, although an hour was all it took for my PC to crash and be needed to reset to factory standards...I hope this game gets a major update or something that will make this title much better. With all the hype and anticipation, I was disappointed. Also, this game has to compete with Outlast... with how it is now, no way that is even possible.And again, Daylight is to Outlast as console inferiority is to PC superiority.			"

												Daylight had more potiental to be a great game you could buy it still or go buy outlast either way the game is scary and the ambience is really good and well done for this game Cons: Horrible Framrate issues- Hopefully going to be fixedOnly sets you at 2 hours of gameplay Not very good storyPros: It is cheap unlike outlast daylight is 15 dollars which is 5 dollars cheaperScaryReplay ValuePretty good and nice graphics The SCORE: I give this game a 6.5/10 Dull but could be betterMore about the game: The plot is centered around a woman named Sarah who regains consciousness in an abandoned hospital with no memory of how she got there. A mysterious voice tells her to find the secrets of the hospital. With a cell phone, which is her map, she must explore the haunted hospital and its criminal past in order to escape. As she explores the hospital and the adjacent prison, Sarah begins to learn of the hospital's past, where twelve witches were executed and buried on the hospital grounds, with a thirteenth witch escaping death due to her turning in the other twelve witches. Sarah also discovers that she is a descendant of the thirteenth witch, and that the angry spirits of the twelve slain witches seek vengeance on her. However, it is unclear whether Sarah manages to escape the hospital or not find out yourself. the player does not have access to weapons; the only tools available are glow sticks, flares, and a cell phone. The game's environment and layout are randomly generated for each gameplay, resulting in the very first maze game to use Unreal Engine 4. In addition, the enemies and other antagonists are procedurally spawned.The player's goal in each level is to search for notes and logs from the hospital's past, referred to as ""remnants"", by looking for markings using glow sticks. Discovering remnants can cause a marking on her arm, which attracts the dangerous ""shadow people"". The player can either make them disappear by using flares or lose them by running away. Once all remnants in a level have been collected, the player is able to acquire a ""sigil"", an item of significance to the hospital's past, such as a teddy bear and a Bible. Bringing the sigil to ""the Seal of Shadows"" will unlock the next part of the building, allowing the player to advance further into the hospital and, possibly, to freedom.Daylight is a survival horror video game. It was released for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows on April 29, 2014. It was developed by Zombie Studios, and is the first game to be powered by Unreal Engine 4.			"

												Not too short and not too long, this little title will make you jump more than a few times and look around frantically in the dark, with only your phone and a glowstick as your sources of light. Driven by an often vague and mysterious plot (which is uncovered both by cryptic messages on your phone and collecting snippets and photographs scattered around the levels) the game will certainly keep you playing it at least a few times over, if just to try and collect all of the collectibles and encounter other events, scares and level layouts.

												I'm a huge fan of horror but this game ♥♥♥♥ing blows. I would like to first brign up that I beat the game and got most of the collectibles on normal in about two hours. From what I payed thats around $5 an hour and I got it on sale. The game has you doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥the whole time too, it's always find 6 letters and then you can finally grab the key that opens the door into the next area. The one saving grace to this game are the collectibles (not the stupid pictures) mainly the letters that do an alright job at fleshing out the creepy lore. Besides that everything kind of fall flat. The games main areas are ""procedurally generated"" which basicly mean you can expect the same ♥♥♥♥ing hallways and rooms copy and pasted around the place. There is only one single enemy in the game (why they could have done so much with variety) that really only teleports behind you and makes loud noises. The enemy is really just boring after a few minutes beause it gives up on chasing you really fast and can be out run easily. It doesn't help that all the scares are cheap jump scares. The rooms lose any automsphere when you've been seeing them all over the place. Also the use of glow sticks and flares should have been toned down or not been in here at all. Glow sticks highlight points of intrest like desks,cupboards etc( only select few can be searched ). Flares on the other hand instantly get rid of ""shadows"" chasing you although throwing lit flares down seems to just have a visual effect, so the enemy vanishes when your holding it but if it's just on the floor lit, it doesn't even notice it...  I KNOW STUPID RIGHT!   Also I don't know why they thought it was a good idea to have abandoned pouches with glowsticks all over the island but whatever guess there must have been a few raves. Unlike for example Slender I don't see much replay value, sure the hallways may be arranged differently but the enemy chasing you isn't nearly as fun. Overall this game had a lot of potential... but ♥♥♥♥ed up. If it's on sale go ahead but you'll probably only play it once, maybe twice.			"

												Daylight: An indie horror game that i believe is worth the money.it follows a semi slender kind of mission where you have to find Remnants to unlock a key and find your way to the next mission.it does have its own unique twist on the slender idea and made for a great game. pretty good story so far as well, with a few jumpscares here and there, a creepy as♥♥♥♥♥♥atmosphere and random whispsers in the backround, it keeps you paranoid, thinking someones watching you, so far i am enjoying the game, only thing i dislike is how hard it is to find remnants without glowsticks, especially if your looking for the final glowstick! i did/ am doing a Youtube walkthrough/ playthrough or whatever you call it, if you want to see what it looks like, heres the game in action, ( Sorry im still working on my commentating skills )

												I'm not much of a horror game guy and I bought this hoping to start getting into them more. I haven't played much of this so far but I can see where it's going already. It relies solely on jump scares, story is not interesting and oh my god there is a lot of walking around and backtracking. I typically get scared easily but in this just found myself hoping that something would happen. Really boring. The graphics look decent I guess. Not for first timers or anybody well seasoned when it comes to horror games.			"

												I have very mixed feelings about this particular game. I'm recommending it, but only during a Steam sale.On the one hand, there were segments where I genuinely felt scared as I was traversing the level. As you get further through the game, the enemies become more plentiful and harder to fend off with your flares. It felt like I got to a point where a new ghost would spawn every 10 feet and I'd have to activate my last flare to kill it or i'd just have to run away. This always kept me on edge and hoping i'd get another flare soon.On the negative side of things, I don't think this game does Unreal Engine 4 justice. Everything from the textures to some of the lighting just looks very mediocre. Instead of the in-game objects looking sharp and clear on max settings, they seem to just look fuzzy. I don't know if they just directly ported the PS4 version of the game with minimal changes or what. The other thing is the player character's commentary about the area around you. Alot of it seemed out of place and even annoying at times. I understood the context that Sarah, protagonist, is scared of everything around her, but asking ""Is somebody there?"" when it's obvious that no one is broke the immersion for me. That said, in the later levels, I felt her commentary was much more appropriate.Watch some gameplay on youtube before you decide to buy. Otherwise, avoid.			"

												Finally got it working! When it gives you the missing MSVCR110 error, you actually have to download it from somewhere. At least now I was able to try this game out. I have to say, it's good, but still a joke. I never had as many problems with any game as with this. It says Mirillis Action! and Fraps could crash DX 11. It's true for Mirillis Action!, but not for Fraps. The game has several performance lags too. Sometimes I get 60 fps, but sometimes only 30 (still in the hospital level). If they will fix the crashes and performance lags, it will be an enjoyable game, but only on Summer Sale. My original review still stands:This game is a ♥♥♥♥in' joke. Fortunately I got this with my new GeForce videocard, and I thoguht it will be awesome. I have every single requirement, but the game won't start. (Yeah I have 1.4 hours in it. I just left the Diagnostics running and farmed the cards)  DO NOT BUY IT! Save your money for Watch_Dogs instead! If I would have waited 1 freaking day, I could have got Watch Dogs for my card. It would have been a lot better. This game is like an alpha: unoptimized and doesn't have many features. DO NOT BUY IT!			"

			Whoever it is that left us here must be a hell of a party animal... My playthrough of the survival horror game Daylight on PC with live commentary		

At first I felt apprehensive playing Daylight, feeling it did a pretty good job of building up an oppressive atmosphere; however so little happens (and what does  is incredibly predictable), that my mood quickly changed to frustrated, and soon after; boredom. For example the random closing of doors had me spooked at first, wondering what I was going to see when I opened it... Nothing ever appeared. Things get knocked over or gently pushed across the floor, but they're completely unconnected actions; it's not to lure you in a particular direction or deter you, it’s just a random event that the developers thought would be spooky. Any fear I experienced came from my own expectations of what a horror game would involve.The game boasts procedural content; however on the two occasions that I died (once because a ghost spawned right next to me, the other because I fell into water and couldn’t find a way out, exciting ways to go) I didn’t see much to support this. The layout of the area seemed to stay exactly the same, only the letters that you’re tasked with finding seemed to move. If there is more to it I certainly didn’t see it, and if you’re going to claim that each playthrough is going to be different, the game either needs to be good enough to warrant that second time or offer some incentive to. The game fulfils neither of those. The rooms and corridors are generally devoid of content and all look practically the same for a given level, to the extent where it feels like there are two sets of corridors and two room types. Procedural content is pointless if you only experience it once.There's a few different areas to experience, with you being blocked off from the previous one each time you progress, so while there are no loading screens after the initial one, these serve as obvious barriers to save them having to keep too much geometry in memory. That may sound like trying to delve too much under the hood, but the knock on effect of the game play is that the game areas feel incredibly small, and not confined in the “good” claustrophobic way you'd want from a horror game.Glowsticks are provided that highlight objects you can interact with when used; however not only is it not really necessary, it’s usually pretty obvious what you can click on, but it bathes the world in a garish shade of green. The only weapon you have against the shadows is a flare (no idea why), but it takes so long for the lighting animation to finish that if they’re close you may as well just run. Also, as per the silent hill radio, if a shadow is nearby the phone screen flickers, meaning; the moment you notice that, light a flare and spin around, since all shadows are killed instantly by it there is no danger at all in the game. The game provides a “threat” meter on screen, which gradually fills up as you find remnants, which I assume is supposed to be tied to shadow spawn frequency, however I've had shadows constantly spawning every few seconds with only a sliver of the threat meter filled in.As such the game becomes a tedious chore of looking around the current environment for letters that are marked with a red seal, though the game doesn’t provide any context as to why these letters are littered around. Finding all the ones in the level spawns a sigil in the maze room, no indication as to why there are maze rooms in each level, which you then take to some aura… thing, which blocks the exit to open up the next level. Again, no explanation as to what the mysterious power that blocks your way is.Something that really brought me out of the experience was Sarah's insistence on calling out ""is someone there?"" and the like, while I'm trying everything in my power to remain inconspicuous. While I understand it sells that Sarah is her own character and is affected by the situation, everytime I'd assume it was provoked by something and start spinning round trying to work out what it was, unfortunately there never seemed to be any specific trigger, which got really tiresome after the first few times. The other use of audio isn’t particularly noteworthy, you’ll hear the assortment of effects you’d expect from a horror game, but they never appeared to be tied to anything in game.It took around two hours to finish the game, which, considering how little fun it is to play, may be some small solace, but even at the reduced preorder price I paid, I felt ripped off. Regardless of how long it took to beat though, the gameplay is essentially 15 minutes long; once you've been through the first environment you’ve essentially experienced all you’re going to with the game. The “puzzles” (if you get stumped moving a box into position or finding a switch to flip you can remove the quotes) are completely unnecessary and offer nothing to distract you from the tedium at hand.The story itself is competent enough, and put into a more tailored experience where the environments you go through actually mean something rather than being a conduit for letters, it’d be fine. It really is a shame that the gimmick of the game is what ultimately fails it. I’m not going to say the game is absent of horror, I’ve been to plenty of movies where the rest of the audience has been in shock and disbelief at something I’ve shrugged at, but for me, Daylight was one of the mildest horror experiences I’ve had in a long time.

												I'm a huge fan of horror but this game ♥♥♥♥ing blows. I would like to first brign up that I beat the game and got most of the collectibles on normal in about two hours. From what I payed thats around $5 an hour and I got it on sale. The game has you doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥the whole time too, it's always find 6 letters and then you can finally grab the key that opens the door into the next area. The one saving grace to this game are the collectibles (not the stupid pictures) mainly the letters that do an alright job at fleshing out the creepy lore. Besides that everything kind of fall flat. The games main areas are ""procedurally generated"" which basicly mean you can expect the same ♥♥♥♥ing hallways and rooms copy and pasted around the place.

												This is not worth you time, Very dissapointed, Atmosphere is nice and suspenceful at first, but once you see the 'Ghost' and learn that popping a flare is all it takes, the suspence goes immediately as she is not a threat to worry about and you can just dash right passed her with sprint. The game is so repetitive that it feels that you are doing the same part again, you go to one part of the hospital to the other collecting pages (Yes slender...) and then you escape that part and then do it all over again. Different parts of the map is copied and pasted leaving you very confused if you have just gone in a circle or not (The cut and paste job is so bad that the same room that you have just been in will be right next door). If you like Slender and the whole collect page, you will probably like this, but bare in mind, are you willing to pay for the same game concept as slender when you can get that for free?			"

I’m not going to say the game is absent of horror, I’ve been to plenty of movies where the rest of the audience has been in shock and disbelief at something I’ve shrugged at, but for me, Daylight was one of the mildest horror experiences I’ve had in a long time.

												Make no mistake, this game will scare the bejeesus out of you, and if it doesn't, then mister - you're a better man than I.But is that enough?Because, basically, that's all you get. If you're a fan of the horror genre in general, be it movies, books or games then you'll probably be able to predict what happens next. This game unashamedly trots out all the horror tropes - almost by the book - for better or worse, and for veterans of the genre, this might make it seem a little tired. But for some, the fact that it plays from the Horror Cliches 101 textbook can work in its favour. You will be deliciously on edge as you pass by that wheelchair, because you just know it's going to suddenly move its squeaky wheels in your direction. If I look through this window, is a ghastly face going to appear on the other side, looking back?It's moments like these that make this game so intense and frightening at times, to say nothing of the supernatural denizens that reside in the asylum that you may or may not come face to face with.But if you're expecting deep gameplay and open ended exploration you will be sorely disappointed. Although this game does what it promises - scares the crap out of you - there's nothing much else really to it. You wander around hunting for Remnants, in game lore items, while waiting for the next supernatural event to occur. And, well, that's pretty much all she wrote.It becomes somewhat tedious after awhile trudging through the same recycled corridors. And let me tell you, there are a LOT of corridors. For a game that was hyped as much as it was for using the Unreal 4 engine, the graphics and textures look somewhat muddy and washed out, at least they did on my rig. They definitely have a previous-gen look about them. And this is baffling, considering the fairly hefty system requirements. Though the sound design is excellent, and perfectly complements what's going on onscreen.For the price though, give it a shot if you're a fan of survival horror games or horror stuff in general - you'll enjoy it, at least for a while - for this game is best enjoyed in short chunks, rather than extended play sessions.In summary, it's horror-by-the-numbers fare that will absolutely have you browning trou, but apart from the scares, there is little on offer here in the way of gameplay and with surprisingly meaty running requirements at odds with the ordinary graphics you'll want to be a survival horror fan to appreciate this. If you want something you can savour, and enjoy being scared then, for the price especially, you can't go wrong here.A slightly above average 6 out of 10.			"

												yawn!  What a snoozefest. Procedurally generated boredom.  So cliche it's difficult to count the infinite ways it's derivative. I had high hopes, which have not even slightly been met. Game play mechanics just short of watching a dvd. Bits of story and plot which could have been lifted from Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Siren or any other true survival horror masterpiece. The environments are done well, and it's amazing that it's procedural, but it's a boring maze which utterly failed to capture my interest. If I'm a rat in your Spooky Procedurally Generated Maze, where's my cheese?  This game has ZERO FPS elements and ZERO RPG elements and ZERO RTS elements. What exactly is the point? Wandering around a haunted house so you can jump out and say BOO? I got this for FREE when i bought my GTX770. I wish I could get my time back, since I didn't waste any money. I Don't think anyone else should waste money on this either.			"

												If, like me, you suffer from directional dyslexia, you will find Daylight so frustrating. There is the occasional scare but nothing major (outlast was much better on the whole feel of dread and horror). Wandering blindly around a maze is my own personal hell, mix that up with the potential of running into an enemy and dying, then being dumped back at the beginning of an area which your internal compass can find no bearing in. Rooms moved randomly, item shifted into different places, frustrating as hell. Mostly I ended up finding my way out by accident. Graphics are a bit meh, so much more potential in the engine. Save points come at odd times and not when expected. Some character speech comes at the wrong times, "" what was that noise"" there was no noise love etc. Disjointed voice narrative is non-sensical and unhelpful. To sum it up, so much potential and hype, yet totally missed the bar. May be worth a bang when its down to just a few quid.			"

												Probably one of the worst games I have ever played. The atmosphere is not scary, the enemies are a joke, The puzzles are about as difficult as a coloring book, the controls are incredibly basic, and the graphics are sub-par for a next gen game. It took me a whole hour to run through it. It tends to crash at the end very often too. Took me about 6 loads before it stopped. The randomness of each playthrough isn't that random, the rooms get rearragned, but the layout and items remain the same. The story is very cliche. This was a terrible game for the Unreal 4 Engine to launch with. It utilizes nothing that the engine can offer. Focusing on trying to make each playthrough different, they forgot to make a game worth playing in the first place. If you want a boring, monotonous run through to kill an hour or less, then this game is for you. I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this travesty in gaming.			"

												Hands down one of my favorite Horror game (so far). what's very unique about the game is the fact that each time you start the game, the level is generated (meaning rooms and artifacts are moved and mixed, similar to making a new world on minecraft), so it always feels new playing this game. Where as the story was a little confusing, the gameplay was smooth and controls are very simple. 1 for glowsticks, 2 for flares, and M for map, thats just about all you need to know. the game didn't have much jumpscares for me, mainly because i was on the easy difficulty, so i would recommend being on medium or hard diffuculty for a more ""Challenging"" more ""Frightening"" expirence. it is a little overpriced for a short game, i beat it in one day (i know, i have no life) its a good 6 to 7 hours of gameplay depending on your pace (as scary as it is, it gets pretty fast-paced). as it is a good game, nearing the end, the game got a little old kinda fast. on each level you do the same thing as you did the previous level, i wont ruin much but you find remnants while staying away from ghosts. as for the graphics, they're pretty good. if you've ever played Blacklight: Retribution (which you should) it has just about the same detail in graphics as Daylight (Mainly because Daylight was made by the same people that made Blacklight (no pun intended)) me personally, i dont play much horror games, or finish them, but this game is definentally a must for people who like horror games. but overall, i would give it an 8/10 mainly it gets a little old kinda fast nearing the end of the game. but seriously BUY THIS GAME :D			"

												I picked this game up for free with Nvidia's promotional offer with a GTX 780. I'm going to keep this short and simple.The game starts off somewhat slow, but soon enough you are thrown into what the game is all about... suspense. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long. After about a half hour of gameplay, I'd seen everything the game had to offer... which is not much, I completed my first playthrough in two hours. None of the achievements appear to be working correctly for this game, as the ones I unlocked all popped up, but only one of them appears to have saved.It was a great, if not short, timewaster, however it's not worth it's $15 pricetag. The way I figure it is, for two hours, it's more or less the cost of a movie, the often-compared to entertainment alternative to gaming. Time dependent, it lasts about as long as some movies, too. However, as stated above, after a half hour, I had seen everything the game had to offer, which, effectively aakes a half-decent movie a better buy.The climax and conclusion of the last ""act"" of the game, seemigly suppossed to be the most suspenseful, ended up being the least suspenseful part of the game. I'll avoid spoilers here... but suffice to say, it was completed by just continually sprinting around. You'll understand how effective it is, should you endure through the game to get there yourself.While this game is procedurally generated, and even upon death, the map changes... it offers very limited replayability. All the scripted jump scares happen in all the same places, and you come to expect them.On the onset of my second playthrough, it also appears to be the same storyline.			"

												I'll just put the bottom line good and bad out there from what i've seen so far.  As always with these types of games it is best experienced with headphones in the dark.The good. Dark creepy atmosphere that is easy to get drawn into. Excellent lighting effects. Jump scares abound. Easy to learn and use controls that remind you of amnesia. Interesting story that is told through random flashbacks newspaper articles and some weird old dude talking over the phone. Ghosts and shadows will definately make you jump out of your skin. Pretty good quality graphics. Reasonably priced game at 15$ Though I was smart and preordered. Try to get it for less than 10$ if you can. The bad. Persistant choppy lag that didn't go away even after I lowered the graphics setting to damn near mid 2000s era quality. This hindered me greatly and caused me no end of doom and frustration, Others are having the same issues as well I may add, this problem MUST be fixed as it is causing some poor souls' games to crash in bad cases.  Recycled enviroments that while randomly generated just don't fit together properly. One second I was in an insane asylum then a morgue then a prison cell block then back to an asylum. They could fix this by having certain areas only spawn around other areas that match them, Then we wouldn't have the confusing unrealistic layouts and everything would flow together seamlessly and make this feel like a true full on retail game. Jump scares abound. Hey, This crap has been done to death if you like it more power to you but most people are tired of this recycled predictable scare tactic. ""Penumbra 1-2&3, amnesia 1&2,Outlast, and a whole slew of other games not to mention a few more that are STILL being developed all have already done it."" (PS buy penumbra and amnesia if you haven't already. Totally worth it.) and while the ambiance IS creepy the jumpscare to ambiance ratio is a bit uneven leading to you just being annoyed by damn ghosts trying to kill you constantly.  Shadows that chase you endlessly. It is KINDA difficult to get♥♥♥♥♥♥done and find all the clues you need to get through the game when the same freaking ghost appears every single time your freaking flare goes out causing you to lose health or die almost instantly. It makes exploring and finding what you MUST have to progress through the game nearly impossible and makes you not want to play it again. This must be fixed as well, I actually had to quit my game because I couldn't advance. Repetitive linear gameplay dispite the randomly generated maps. Do NOT let their talk of randomly generated maps fool you into think that this game will constantly be a new adventure, You will STILL be hunting for the SAME objects in the SAME areas and the only thing that will be different is the layout. Nothing else changes and you still have to find 6 objects to make an object appear that allows you to proceed to the next area where you do the same exact thing. It is the very definition of Tedious. IN CONCLUSION. The game would function PERFECTLY if it were not for the lag as that was the only technical issue I personally have had and it seems to be the big issue with the game itself as many others have the same problem. While pretty to look at the quality of the graphics don't mean anything if the game is so full of lag that everything is constantly fading in and out of focus or glitching out! The game flow is obstructed by random out of place enviroments that just don't fit in which makes the game feel unrealistic which can make it hard to put yourself into the game if you are a fan of attention to detail. There are too many jump scares and not enough buildup to get to those scares which makes most of them in turn, cheap, repetitive, and predictable.  The game at it's core is tedious at best and a never ending array of poorly placed areas won't change that and if the developers thought it would distract people from their lazy game design they are dead wrong. As you play this game you will notice that it is nothing more than a mere knockoff of other better indie games, This one will not be worth your time until it is patched and hopefully updated and offered at a reduced price. get it for less than 9$ if you can as it may not even work at all for you. I give this game an A for effort but a D for execution, With a little more polishing this game will be a buyable and enjoyable game but until then I say steer clear and force the developers to put a little more effort into the game to encourage others to buy it. I give it a 2.5 out of 5.			"

												SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGthis game is another psychological thriller game. yknow what that means much percieved danger very little actual danger. the first ""danger"" i ran into could be defeated/avoided by looking at the wall and ignoring it. i had the stupid thing following me for 3 minutes and when i finally deigned to give it my attention it disappeared.played the game and so far the only thing i really remember is the clip clop of the characters tap dancing shoes, or wait are they sneakers? they squeeqe once in awhile so maybe they are sneakers. anyway the character is a winey ♥♥♥♥♥. she does not shut up. and i really wish she would because as soon as she talkes all immursion leaves the game. ""i know your there"" ""hello"" and so on are the general consistency of her limerics.the gameplay consistes of running through the same corridors over and over again until you find a new clue to getting to the next sigil to open the next glyph and getting another part of the story. it has something to do with the demonic presence in a costal town which first imerged in a mental facility. y'know the usual thing. the demonic thing affects the environment in the usual manner just like in any possession movie since the beggining of cinema, so its nothing new.the game also looks blow average with the textures repeated and low res and the same models repeated and reused all over the place. the light comming from your phone being your major source of illumination meaning its hard to notice them while your moving through the game at a snails pace dragging your slow♥♥♥♥♥whineing donkey through the hallways. the sound resources are reused as well with many sounds coming from the oppisite direction of their logical sources though with the demonic sources of some of them i guess it makes sense.i may try to finish it but right now im just fed up with hearing the main character.i got this game for free with a new video card but if i had paid for it i would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥right now.

												I'm really disappointed with this game so far. I know it's one of the first Unreal 4 games, but is it too hard to ask that the game be playable?It's been out for over a month and the devs have apparently released patches to fix the fatal errors that prevent you from playing, but I've followed all of their instructions and the game always crashes on me before it even gets a chance to load up the first level. What's more, the error messages I get are BLANK. Really helpful, there.I'd check back in a few months down the line when maybe they've fixed the real problems. It's very frustrating since I really really want to try this game!			"

												Daylight has its moments, and while they are few, those moments are nice. Graphically, maxed out with nvidia bokeh dof and hbao+, the game has a nice atmosphere. Daylight is not a graphical monument, more of an early test bed for the unreal engine 4. The gameplay revolves around you looking for ""remnants"", which are basically just pieces of paper scattered throughout a mess of hallways and rooms. This reliance of fetch and grab like quests gets old really fast, hurting the potential that daylight could have had. While it is a cool idea to have the game randomly generated each time you play, I don't ever see myself playing this game more than one time, which is a shame.In short, Daylight had a lot of potential to be a great game, but instead is a mediocre test platform for future UE4 games. While I have enjoyed playing it, and don't feel like I wasted the money spent, I can't recommend this.This review may change for the better if Zombie Studios decides to make Daylight more interesting than a horror themed fetch quest. 5/10.

												Not Recommended. If your running windows 8.1 i would wait for a patch to pick this up. Getting the game to work is a hassle and the game (at least mine anyway) seems to bug out or crash quite often. Also from what I've read the game is quite mediocre so you may also want to wait for a steam sale. Just my 2 cents			"

												Daylight เป็นเกมส์หลอนที่น่ากลัวเกมส์หนึ่ง บรรยากาศต่างๆทำออกมาได้น่ากลัวดี คนที่ชอบเกมส์แนวสยองขวัญ กดดัน เอาตัวรอด(เพราะสู้ผีไม่ได้หนีได้อย่างเดียว) แนะนำเลยครับเกมส์นี้ ที่สำคัญคุณจะไม่สามารถคาดเดาทางได้แม้แต่น้อยเพราะเมื่อคุณเข้ามาเล่นใหม่อีกครัั้งไม่ว่าจะเป็นตายแล้วกลับมาเล่นฉากเดิม หรือจะเริ่มเล่นใหม่ทั้งหมด เส้นทางต่างๆที่ผ่านมาเราขอให้คุณโยนมันออกจากหัวไปให้หมด เพราะมันจะไม่เหมือนเดิมอีกต่อไป การวิ่งสำรวจเพื่อค้นหาทางออกอาจจะวกไปวนมาสักหน่อยใครที่เล่นเกมส์แนว FPS แล้วเวียนหัวขอให้ผ่านเกมส์นี้ไปได้เลย ขอติ2เรื่อง1.การเซฟสักหน่อยว่าถ้ามันทำมาให้เซฟได้เองจะดีมากเวลาเล่นๆไปต้องรอจนกว่ามันจะเซฟให้ถึงจะเลิกเล่นได้ไม่งั้นเซฟหาย 2.ระบบดูแผนที่จะเล็กไปไหน "

												I got this for free with my Nvidia card and I still feel ripped off. Nothing is scary, everything is cliche, the gameplay is an awful derivative of the already awful Slender clones, it's repetitive, not fun, the story could have been seen coming from a mile away, the procedural generation hurts the game more than it helps, and the main selling point, the whole damn reason this game comes with a graphics card: UE4, looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥here, and could have been done on UE3.Avoid.

												One word: YES. If you are a streamer, you need to play this game with your followers at least once. The Twitch integration is amazing - log in after you start streaming, and your viewers can enter commands to make things happen around you. These come in the form of apparitions, screams, footsteps, and many other things. I'd highly recommend it on that basis alone, but I am not sure it would be AS interesting if you were playing alone. The viewers really help the experience.			"

												It looks good and has a creepy atmosphere, but there's not much going on gameplay wise.  Each map has an item you need to find before proceeding to the next map.  Also there's ghosts sometimes that can hurt you, or not, depending on whether or not you're holding a road flare.  That's it really.  Maybe there's more too it later in the game, but I'm already bored.			"

												If this game is supposed to showcase DX11 it fails.  It's a boring game and I've seen better graphics in none DX11 games!  While there are some initial scary moments you soon realize that there is no reason to be scared.  I'm glad I got this game for free with a download code included with the purchase of my GTX 780 Ti.  I installed it expecting the graphics to be jaw-dropping with DX11 and didn't get it.  I installed it with the anticipation that the game would probably suck...and it does.  This ""game"" should be a free download on the Nvidia website.  2 out of 10 because it's a playable 'demo'.			"

												Although it looks fun from the trailers it doesnt really live up to the hype. I pre-ordered it because it looked like it would be worth the $10 at the time, however it has fallen incredibly short of expectations. After waiting several days after launch to play the game because of an unpatched crash bug, the game was not off to a good start. Then to add salt to the wound, I spent 30 minutes wandering around without a clear objective of what it is I am to do with poor scares to boot. I wish this game had been worth it but it falls tragically short. Id recommend Outlast and the new DLC over Daylight.			"

												I'll start off by saying that I was looking forward to the release of Daylight. However, once I was able to play the game(which has been an issue for a lot of people) I realized that this game was over-hyped. The game does not play well on my system (FX-8350, 12GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 750 TI,  and an SSD) which I still don't understand considering the graphics are nothing special to me.Other than the playability issues the game does just OK as a horror game. It attempts to scare players with a lot of cheap tricks that are often not scary.So to sum up what I think about Daylight would be that there are a lot better games out there in this genre.			"

												I'm really disappointed with this game so far. I know it's one of the first Unreal 4 games, but is it too hard to ask that the game be playable?It's been out for over a month and the devs have apparently released patches to fix the fatal errors that prevent you from playing, but I've followed all of their instructions and the game always crashes on me before it even gets a chance to load up the first level. What's more, the error messages I get are BLANK. Really helpful, there.I'd check back in a few months down the line when maybe they've fixed the real problems. It's very frustrating since I really really want to try this game!			"

												After going through the hassle of trying to get it to work lag free on my $3,500 system I wound up supremely disappointed. You know, unless the point of the game was to scare you by making you think you were in the same room no matter how many of the same doors you go through. Everything looked exactly the same, which could lead you to get lost...I guess...because there's nothing unique about any of the rooms/settings in the game. If you really tried hard you could get a bit of a tense atmosphere from it but you shouldn't have to do the work to make a game somewhat edgy.			"

That never happened though.I picked it up on sale for 10 dollars with the pre-order, and I'd say it was worth that. It's even worth 15 of your hard earned dollars.Yeah, so.Cool.			"

The story was also interesting and the way the game was set out was very interesting and unique. Only downside is that the constant jump-scares did get rather annoying and frustratingly unecessary as the settings and noises managed to scare without them. Good game though, definitely worth a look.			"

I think someone told them that if you let a cat run up and down on a piano its scary.. no its just annoying. I dont recommend the purchase, I am glad i was gifted a copy so I didnt waste my own money on it. 3/10.... and those 3 points are just because the cellphone map thing is ok.			"

												好吧，之前写的确实有点过激，俗话说的好，期望越大，失望越大，看PEW玩还以为是可以超越OUTLAST的神作，由于预购了一个月，结果当天花了2小时装了WIN7 SERVICE PACK 1和补丁才将问题解决，还有很多BUG，现在终于可以进去玩了。言归正传，题材很新颖，每个关卡的房间和DARK PEOPLE出现都是随机性的，这意味着可玩性非常高，不像OUTLAST，玩第二遍不觉得恐怖了，DAYLIGHT的魅力在于你不知道下一秒将出现什么，可能下一个转角就要碰见DARK PEOPLE，或者是个死角，那种被追没地方躲，然后拐进一个死角的感觉真心要HEART ATTACK!!虽然很恐怖，但我个人认为DAYLIGHT的缺点是致命的，那就是重复。读者一定觉得前后逻辑不对，怎么前文说关卡里东西都是随机的，现在怎么又以重复来评论这个游戏呢？我这里的重复指的是游戏模式。DAYLIGHT一共有6关，每一关的过关方式都是一样的：找文件，到下一阶段，找关键性过关物品，再到下一阶段，将物品放到指定场合，然后过关。正因为如此，虽然物品东西出现随机，我要做的就是蒙头跑步就行了，对，看见物品就捡起来， 这就是游戏要你做的，你会发现你其实就是在玩一个找东西的游戏，而不是恐怖游戏。说实话，你只要一直按住SHIFT键跑步，DARK PEOPLE就纯粹是酱油啊，根本看不见你的影子或者追上你，和你照面的机会太小了，也就是说，除了声效，其实游戏真的并不是那么恐怖。为什么呢？缺少剧情。游戏的设定是随机，自然剧情向的东西必然很少，凡是都有两面性，如果摸清了这个游戏的玩法，我觉得大部分玩家在第一第二关后就懂这个游戏要你干吗了，而后确实失去了体验SUIVIVE HORROR的感觉。（其实PEW不用那么怕的。。。个人浅见。）总的来说，游戏构思非常新颖，但关卡过少，剧情基本没有，模式单一，是这个游戏硬伤。我的评分：7/10			"

												Finally got it working! When it gives you the missing MSVCR110 error, you actually have to download it from somewhere. At least now I was able to try this game out. I have to say, it's good, but still a joke. I never had as many problems with any game as with this. It says Mirillis Action! and Fraps could crash DX 11. It's true for Mirillis Action!, but not for Fraps. The game has several performance lags too. Sometimes I get 60 fps, but sometimes only 30 (still in the hospital level). If they will fix the crashes and performance lags, it will be an enjoyable game, but only on Summer Sale. My original review still stands:This game is a ♥♥♥♥in' joke. Fortunately I got this with my new GeForce videocard, and I thoguht it will be awesome. I have every single requirement, but the game won't start. (Yeah I have 1.4 hours in it. I just left the Diagnostics running and farmed the cards)  DO NOT BUY IT! Save your money for Watch_Dogs instead! If I would have waited 1 freaking day, I could have got Watch Dogs for my card. It would have been a lot better. This game is like an alpha: unoptimized and doesn't have many features. DO NOT BUY IT!			"

I think the only thing that might be scary about it is jump scares. I remember when I played this with my friends we were not scared. We were laughing and just got bored of it. I ran towards the monster when I ran out of flares and it got ♥♥♥♥ing scared of me and went away. My review isnt very neat. I do know that I will not playing this game again and will uninstall it after I post this. I'm sorry devs that im trashing your game but...............You guys could have tried.

Unfortunately, this game didn't come close to my expectations.I meet somewhere in the middle of the minimum and recommended specs; Having said that, the game was laggy as hell, even in low and 720p resolution. The game was okay from what I've played but it gets super boring and frustrating very fast. The creatures that you encounter are not that scary, I have Outlast and that game knocks me off my seat, I love the horror genre but this game failed me. I always give games a chance before I review them but this is totally unplayable. No real story line either.On the upside, it looks like a decent game and it definitely gives an atmosphere that was intended, tense and eerie.  "

												SHAKY CAM!!!!  Buyer beware that this game has intense shaky cam. Even when you stand still, the camera is bobbing up and down, left and right. There is no need for this. I feeling like I'm going to puke just staring at the screen for ten seconds. Shaky cam in this instance does not add immersion. In real life, when I stand still, my head does not bob up and down left and right.  This is a cheap gimmick that makes the game unplayable. REsident Evil remake for gamecube gave and still gives plenty of chills, and that game had fixed camera! Environments in RE were rendered in 2D. I cannot understand why the developers would think shaky cam adds to the ""horror"" element and immersion. Even if I didn't get nauseous, the shaky cam is so bad I can't even focus on the enviornment. I try to explore but can't because the screen is moving all over the place. It's a good thing I got this game for free when I bought a GTX 7601That being said, the premise of the game is great. I was excited to play. And it runs well on my computer.			"

												I have mixed feelings for this game.  The gameplay of Daylight is sure as hell scary, but it kinda gets repetitive.  You go through contless rooms that all look the same, finding reminents to get a sigil to unlock a door because some creep that's talking through your phone (even though you aren't caling anyone, plus you have some sort of magic phone that lasts forever) told you to.The graphics are not that bad, but fell short of my expectations.  This game is the first to be released with the u4 engine, and still looks like u3 with a high budget.  And now you're probably wondering: ""4, why do you reccomend this game if most of the things you are saying are bad?"" Well, you see, this game, even though repititve, is pretty fun to play and pretty scary too.  I really did enjoy playing the game, even though I had no reason for the actions I was doing.  I reccomend this to basically anyone, even if you aren't into the horror genre, this game would be a great start.Overall rating: 6/10			"

												What can I say?  Great concept – poorly executed.  Good textures, sfx aren’t bad but the a.i. seems weak.. the storyline a bit wishy washy with an ominous voice over that talks some trash and relies far too heavily on drawing from other survival horror genres instead of aspiring to be creative or original.  Sure, the level does change layout which is kinda cool but the execution is EXACTLY the same!:  collect 6 documents while threat level increases, go collect the key/artefact and then go unlock the next area – repeat (After 3 repeats I deleted the game lol).  What were you smoking over at Zombie Studios?!!  Requiem, System Shock 2, Clive Barker's Undying, Doom 3, F.E.A.R., Bioshock, Condemned, Resident Evil 4, Dead Space, Amnesia, Slender and Outlast etc. tried to bring something new to the table and I’d have to be a little harsh in terms of a rating and full heartedly agree with Gamespot’s, “Daylight accomplishes nothing. Its attempt to expand on the Slender formula is only enjoyable for as long as you’d ever want to play Slender anyway, and it isn’t nearly as effective.”			"

But whatever, name a game that didn't use some bs claim or gimmick to sell pre release. You get what you pay for. EOS			"

												This game is short. So is my review. You can easily beat it in one seat.Daylight adds not too much to the horror/survival/run & hide genre. It is actually not obligatory run & hide, because you can repel your enemies with a flare, because a bright light fears these pesky shadow creations just like Mogwai fears Satan.The remarkable things about Daylight are the following. It is the first game, built on top of the Unreal Engine 4. It is the most remarkable thing. The graphics however are not of any next-gen look. The physics too is not of any particular interest, so the Unreal Engine 4 is not really a big deal here.Just like the other games of its keen, I mean Penumbra, Amnesia and Outlast, it introduces a new source of light — the smartphone with unlimited battery life. It easily lightens up any dark in the game, but you are encouraged to use two different and somewhat scarce light sources (worth to mention, these borrowed from Penumbra series) — green glowsticks and bright red flares. Unlike Penumbra's counterparts, these two are not last enough, but glowsticks highlights key items, unveiling an intricate ‘mazy' lines on top of it, and flares fears Satan... em, sorry, Shadows. Shadows are a ghostly witches, which are the Sarah's sole enemies in the game and in the most parts of Daylight there is just one Shadow to be aware of.The gameplay is conforming to the next pattern. At first you enter a randomly generated maze, often it is the hospital's corridors and ruined rooms. In it you should collect some quantity of so called remnants (basically notes, explaining the game's events, just like in Penumbra, Amnesia and Outlast). After this is done, you go to some weird illuminated room, where you collect some floating object, like teddy bear. It is a key to the illuminated door in the different part of the maze.The whole ‘mazing’ part is not really amazing, but you may get shiver or two, because the Shadow have a tendency to spawn somewhere near you with a frightening sound. But, as was previously said, you should not necessary run away from the creep, just light up the flare and it will disappear for a while.After the maze part here comes a narrative part, where you just proceed through the location, occasionally grabbing some not necessary to be collected remnants (these marked with a blue lights apart of necessary red). Then the maze part again. Repeat it four or five times and you will find yourself finished the game.'This is all?’ you may have ask yourself, starring to the final credit titles. Yes, it actually is, and there are even no hints to the possible sequel. That's it. That's Daylight.Important question may come to your head, when you reading this review — is Daylight any scary? Is it worth a time? The answer is yes, it is a somewhat scary. But not that scary, as Outlast, Amnesia and Penumbra. Because of flares. Flares adds a good amount of comfort to the overall feeling.Will I recommend this game? I am a bit hesitant on this and if there is a kind of abstain button here on Steam reviews page, then I will press it. The game is a worthwhile and not at the same time. But as there is no such thing, let it be 'Yes, I recommend'.			"

												I really like this game, and the graphics and sound design are pretty good for a budget game; the environments are especially creepy and the use of glow sticks and flares is fun too.  This game’s main downside is that it suffered an increasingly popular gameplay mechanic that indie developers (mostly) utilize in budget ($15-$20 on Steam) horror games – that of the random and/or pointless ‘fetch’ quest.  In Daylight’s case this takes the form of finding scraps of paper with a glowing sigil on them.   Once you find enough, some key-like item can then be collected from a magically-bound room that you in turn must use on a magically barred room/passage to proceed on to the next location, etc. Of course you have to backtrack to find said ‘barred’ room/passage which can be a real pain in the a$$ considering that you can’t use a flare at that point to ward off the witches (the ghosts that appear in the game) and the map on the phone your character continually holds out (light is always on at least) in her right hand isn’t very helpful.  One other factor some will have an issue with is length - Daylight will only take most peeps on Steam about 1.5 – 2 hrs to complete.  Granted, that is a pretty short length for a game, but when considering that the basis of this game is the proverbial ‘fetch’ quest, that doesn’t seem so bad in retrospect (seriously, would anyone want to endure a game that is 10+ hrs, or perhaps far longer, when that was the sole basis of said game? I think not!). There are trading cards, achievements and controller support as well, so that makes playing more enjoying and the achievements at least add some replay value if that’s your thing.Not a bad game to finish on per se (the developers closed up shop after 20+ yrs recently so hopefully you won’t suffer a bug that prevents you from playing this game properly, if at all, as you just may be SOL at that point) and with the drop from $15 to $10 it definitely wouldn’t hurt to look into grabbing a copy for yourself.

												I'd recommend this game if it weren't for the lack of field of view settings. Nvidia surround 5760x1080 res and no settings for depth of field besides enabled or disabled (which makes no difference what so ever) makes the game rather unplayable. Please make better depth of field settings. The game is terrible otherwise because you can't see anything around you. Tried finding a config file to set it manually but is written with another program.			"

												Poor attempt at cashing in on the horror genre hype. The story is boring and I really don't care about what happens to the bland main character. She keeps saying things like ""What was that!?"" over and over again despite there being nothing there. It pulls you out of the immersion when you can tell that the character is basically programmed with a timer that sets of her lines no matter what actually happens.It's also very difficult to be scared in a horror game when the character is so bland that you kinda want her dead anyways. There is also a VERY heavy filter effect that is used to hide poor textures. You may argue it's there to make it more atmospheric and scary, but the filtering is so heavy I can't even play the game without squinting. I can barely make out what I'm even doing. Voice acting is fine and the randomly generated map is a good idea. It's just a shame that you're endlessly walking trough the same collection of pre-made halls that randomize until the game is over. I got this game for free when I bought my GTX 780 at the time so I don't care too much. I just wish to warn people from spending actual money on this shovelware			"

I can play outlast and amensia with turtle beaches and feel nothing, but this game makes my back sweat lmao. I enjoyed this game, it scares my **** inbetween my legs. only because the ghost is unpredictable. whereas outlast and amnesia have things who monitor or lurk around that isnt scary thats just time consuming waiting to go to then next location, but dont get me wrong i love both amnesia and outlast equaly, i just felt Daylight had more of a scary luster. im on my second playthrough and theirs a whole other area i didn't see before. I'm also a big paranormal fan so this game is my icing on the cake. well, that is all, hate if you want to hate, love if you want to love. lol this game is my nightmare fuel literally.			"

All your lights out. And late at night. It can be very scary. It's not the best game i've ever played. But it sure as hell is not the worst game i've ever played. If your a fan of horror games this is one you sould get. But maybe wait till it's on sell. But in the end it's an okay game.    6 out of 10.			"

												To be honest, the game isn't bad, but it is very repetitive in my opinion. It stopped being spooky after the first level. I was so bored that I didn't bother playing any further than the second level, so I went on YouTube to see what's up. As it runs out, the story is a typical and unimaginative plot and the gameplay remains repetitious throughout. Based on what I've played, what I've seen, and on my friend's similar feelings on it, I do not recommend this game.			"

												I thought it was really good; I enjoyed the graphics, scares, and idea of the game. What I didn't like was that right as the story starts getting deep and hooks you...it's over...It seems like they ran out of production time or something....I would love to see more done in the future. Worth the playthrough though!			"

												The atmosphere is great but the visuals are so blurred and muggy that it gives me a headache! Turning all the settings off didn't make it sharper (as in anti-alias off). Could hav e been great but is just technicaly bad.			"

												Daylight has poor performance, is repetitive, and doesn't really offer anything new. It does have frightening moments, but they aren't enough to substantiate its existence.			"

												Game was quite enjoyable getting the occassional scare, was made better by playing with an audience in a dark room listening to ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"".Alcohol with a group can make it last even longer.Achievements is easy to get as you can speed run the game in under 30minutes.Also encountered zero bugs.

												Cool!I'm about 2 hours in to the game right now so I'm still walking around the same-looking corridors of the hospital but it feels like I have plenty left and I hope for some change in scenery.Though I have to say, there doesn't seem to be anything more to it than just navigating a maze, finding all the clues, unlock the key and proceeding to the next area. ...Except sticking to your balls, lighting a few flares and enduring a few cheap-scares.Runs fine on my specs.Intel i5 3570kRadeon 7870 2GBGraphicwise I see some pretty lowres textures almost everywhere. Lighting is impressive though. It's a tad disappointing since this is the first game I've got running the Unreal 4 engine. I suppose I expected more. I don't think this game brings more eyecandy than Outlast, but if you're like me and couldn't enjoy Outlast because of the constant breathing sound then this will be awesome.The sounds in this game is stellar.Anyway, the pricepoint isn't farfetched at all and the game is kind of cool, I like it.

												Do I recommend this game?Yes.Do I like every aspect of it?No.It has an interesting story, with overused, redudent story telling.Overall, I'd give it a 7.5/10This is very Outlast in nature, while not exactly following up to the latter.  You start off in a mental institution, and as the story progresses, I think some old crazy dude talking to me on my phone wants me to explore my past?  I don't really remember.  The monologues from the characters aren't exactly memorable, however the puzzle/horror style of the game, at least to me, is pretty memorable.  This game heavily relies on jump scares, most of which do have some shock value.ProsPuzzle/horror/atmospheric worksFun storyMostly memorable gameRuns smoothly on higher (not highest) quality graphics.ConsVery repatitive   (AS IN, FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH THIS MAZE LEVEL TO GET TO THE NEXT!)Some jump scares fall shortSometimes the guy on the phone really breaks you out of the atmosphere of the gameBONUSHOW HAS MY PHONE NOT RUN OUT OF BATTERY YET?  SERIOUSLY WHAT KIND OF BATTERY DOES THIS THING HAVE, BECUASE MY IPHONE 5 COULD REALLY USE IT! "

												Nice atmospheric survival horror, werty short, not much of a replay value for me. Proceduraly generated levels (at least partially) might sound nice but running around with copy&pasted parts of levels became soon quite boring. One type of enemy makes this more of a technical demo than a game. Getting all collectibles seems to be more of a chore than challenge. The voiceover of the acrtress is very annoying: Repeated blabbering about visibility and generic scrreaming.			"

												I really like this game, and the graphics and sound design are pretty good for a budget game; the environments are especially creepy and the use of glow sticks and flares is fun too.  This game’s main downside is that it suffered an increasingly popular gameplay mechanic that indie developers (mostly) utilize in budget ($15-$20 on Steam) horror games – that of the random and/or pointless ‘fetch’ quest.  In Daylight’s case this takes the form of finding scraps of paper with a glowing sigil on them.   Once you find enough, some key-like item can then be collected from a magically-bound room that you in turn must use on a magically barred room/passage to proceed on to the next location, etc. Of course you have to backtrack to find said ‘barred’ room/passage which can be a real pain in the a$$ considering that you can’t use a flare at that point to ward off the witches (the ghosts that appear in the game) and the map on the phone your character continually holds out (light is always on at least) in her right hand isn’t very helpful.  One other factor some will have an issue with is length - Daylight will only take most peeps on Steam about 1.5 – 2 hrs to complete.  Granted, that is a pretty short length for a game, but when considering that the basis of this game is the proverbial ‘fetch’ quest, that doesn’t seem so bad in retrospect (seriously, would anyone want to endure a game that is 10+ hrs, or perhaps far longer, when that was the sole basis of said game? I think not!). There are trading cards, achievements and controller support as well, so that makes playing more enjoying and the achievements at least add some replay value if that’s your thing.Not a bad game to finish on per se (the developers closed up shop after 20+ yrs recently so hopefully you won’t suffer a bug that prevents you from playing this game properly, if at all, as you just may be SOL at that point) and with the drop from $15 to $10 it definitely wouldn’t hurt to look into grabbing a copy for yourself.

												The real problem with this game is that there isn't any threat to you at any time. If you look away from the ghosts they can't hurt you. It took me maybe half an hour to figure that out and after that it ceased being scary and became SUPER boring. Don't waste your time.			"

												I've played a lot scary horror games, and for me, this wasnt a scary horror game. I basicly ran through the game, collecting some files on the way, which was quite boring.Game basicly consisted of running, few ghosts, and reading..I would have wished something more,Something to make this game unique and special.

												Okay. This game started out interesting and scary. It is extremely similar to Slender in that you have to collect multiple pages, referred to as remnants, to advance to the next level. The more pages you collect the higher the ""threat"" level. I won't give too much away, but as you progress further into the game it becomes much less scary and more of a hassle. The story line is interesting but hard to follow as none of the articles collected are put into a coherent or chronological order. The ending was extremely dissappointing and, as much as I hate to use this as a descriptive term, stupid and quick. The game is overall, confusing with no real explanation as to why the character is in this place. It leaves many questions unanswered and has an extremely predictable and cliche ending. The game hits the ""climax"" if it can so be called, and quickly ends with barely a falling action and no resolution. The graphics were very well done and it looked very beautiful. If you want a game that is good with jump scares for a little while and good looking, then look no further. Each level has a randomly generated map, presenting with a unique experience with each play, but, overall, it is wasted on the poor plotline. (Last line of review credited to my boyfriend who watched me play this and chimed in as I reviewed.)Fun 2/5, Scary 3/5, Graphics 4/5, Plot 1/5, Worth the Price? For graphics yes, for plot and gameplay no. Buy on sale.			"

It is constantly loading and so I am stuck in the beginning.Seeing as I cannot continue the game after multiple attempts, I solemnly cannot recommend this game.			"

												This thing came free with my video card when I was building my current rig.  No clue what game play is like since the game would never load.  I'd get an intro splash screen, black screen, and CTD.   Every.  Time.  As I didn't pay for the game (exactly), I shrugged and uninstalled it and never looked back.  Not my type of game anyway.			"

												Have you ever hated a game?Have you ever hated a game so much that you keep beating your head against it, like it's a brick wall and you're not going to stop until you get a concussion?Daylight is that game for me. Zombie Studios is notorious for producing sub-par products - and Daylight is no exception to that rule: the challenges that it present are laughable at best (in the case of the intended challenge of the witches, which can be avoided by staring at the floor like a shoegaze guitarist and - well, shoe gazing); and absurd at worst (in the case of achievement hunting, which is a chore). Like the gameplay, the story is clunky and poorly delivered. There is a cyclical system to witchery in this world, that begins with the death of witches, and follows a twelve-step program to awaken the power within the witches' descendent.The one thing that's charming about the game is the narrator - a spooky doctor who's doing his very best to monologue like Anthony Hopkin's Lecter. His overacting is a source of unexpected levity in an otherwise tedious experience.That aside, don't make the same mistake I did. I'm going to finish the long quest of achievement hunting and then uninstall for good.			"
