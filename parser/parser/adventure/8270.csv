Short version:Moai Better Blues is probably the strangest episode of the season with its backwards solutions and disjointed puzzle setups, but it also has ridiculous amounts of entertainingly crazy dialogues.Long version:Sam & Max arrive home from the North Pole—where they may have caused some irreparable damages to the spirit of Christmas in the last episode—in time to get entangled in a strange series of events involving Bermuda triangles (yes, plural) and the Eastern Isle.Therefore, the special setting of the second episode is a nice tropical island, where we meet quite a few new characters, including several historical figures (and not just Abraham Lincoln, who spends a nice picnic there with his girlfriend).Their banter is the high point of this episode, because the puzzles are strangely bland and really insanely difficult at the same time. Bland, because most of the subtasks feel like a random series of puzzles with little cohesion (for example, the C.O.P.S. minigame here makes no sense, and not in a good Sam & Max crazy way). And difficult, because the lack of a clear theme means there is very little to go on besides some of the hints hidden in dialogues. It is also the first time in this series where time becomes a part of the puzzles, setting off the insofar laid back, casual nature.I couldn’t say Moai Better Blues is bad, since it has the true essence of these characters, down to the sometimes almost cruel comedy bits and the really wonky banter and situations. If for nothing else, it should be played for its script.			"

												A hilarious chapter to a hilarious game. It's just so much fun getting to play as younger Sam later in the game (Can we have a game where we just play as Kid Sam & Max?)			"

												Sam and Max, Freelance Police! ... are back in season two.(You can never have enough Sam and Max!!) - and yes, they are just as good in Season2. And if you thought they couldn't go further than season 1... you will be surprised.Note: You really need to play these games in order. The story builds, characters are introduced, and if you haven't played previous games, you won't understand the backstory.Hilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable. Recommended! 9.5/10			"

												one of the better adventures. Season 2 has alot more portal action and this one seemed to take the cake. Moderate in length and puzzle difficulty, its not too challenging that its impossible to figure all the puzzles out without any guide or hints, but in one place a hint from max is almost mandatory. Its not as good as episode 201 but its an ok adventure.			"

												this is the weakest and shortest episode of seson 2. first the  babies have  interesting background stories, but the game didn't explore them. they babies are just being there doing nothing.  second when you backtrack  to town , there is nothing  going on. stinky, bosco aren't doing anything.i do recommend this episode, simply to be able to understand what is happening in the following episodes "
