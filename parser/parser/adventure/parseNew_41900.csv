												I bought this for The Bards Tale II: Desteny KnightMy dad purchased a commodore 64 when I was four years old, along with this game.He spent hours upon hours moving one space and drawing it down on his graph paper. I was a cool kid and would fetch him beers while he mapped every square inch of the towns, dungeons, and forrests.He made a character that was ""mine"" and would ask what to do when that characters turn came up. He even let me name him ""foopicker""  <--- I was 4...We spent so many hours having fun playing this RPG, it brought back a lot of memories when I seen it on the market.Today, thirty years later, it's fathers day and I took my laptop over to my dad's house.  I created a party and had him name one of the characters.He choose ""foopicker"" and laughed then went to the other room as fast as his broken, old body could take him.He returned with a weird smile on his face, in his hands was a dusty old shoe box that looked like time forgot about it.When I opened it, it had his old graph paper maps, some barely visible. He then handed me a beer he got from the fridge, sat down, and we played this RPG together again, perhaps for the last time.This is the power of The Bards Tale. "

												I enjoyed the game from the very beginning till the very end and probably will replay it at least once sometime later to buy all the extras (funny songs and arts there) and find two last tunes. The game is short enough (about 20 to 25 hours of gameplay tops, and you level cap could be achieved easily) but very funny and costs every cent of its price. The strongest part of the game are its witty dialogues and excellent voicing, however the plot is not so bad too and jokes are good (and yes, I’m almost forty). Combat is simple, especially with a bow and easy mode (which affects only start attributes and number of save points, so don’t bother with harder difficulty). This game is really a game, not some kind of computer sport where you need huge guides on spell usage and skills allocation. Still, the summons are fun and efficient, the weapons are sparse but don't become obsolete too fast. You are free to experiment. Save points number and location are well chosen. Songs and music are awesome! I sing them under my nose now and then.In short I like the game, the way it is designed, its gameplay and humour. If you are not combat-obsessed power gamer try it. If you are, still try it to for a change.			"

												I have never bothered to review this game because, meh. However, since they added the original trilogy, this just got 1000 times better.I still have my original 5.25 floppies and graph paper maps for the first game. I still have my character disk for the party I took through the whole trilogy. I think the fact that I still have those things is a testament to how much I loved the games. (or I'm just a hoarding nerd)I highly recommend you play the old games in the old way. Get yourself some graph paper and make your own maps. Don't use the maps provided (cheater!). Print out the documentation and the map for Skara Brae and time warp back to the mid 80's.			"

												The Bard's Tale is a great casual RPG that takes  you back to gaming as it was nearly ten years ago. So be prepared for a top down third person view most of the time.  What makes it most enjoyable are the bawdy humor in the dialog and the lyrics to the songs.  Our hero in the game, The Bard, is not really a hero; but a scounderal given to snarky comments and possessed of an ability to get himself into trouble.  His comments are not limited to dialog with NPC's.  He is equally capable of taking issue with the narrator and both seem to have a mutual hate relationship which adds to the fun.  You'll also encounter Scottish, English and French accents with a healthy dose of Scottish words for things, which is fitting for story based on legends from the Orkney Islands of Scotland.  The Bard needs to recruit a team to help rescue a damsel in distress and true to his character, he's not willing to help without a reward, which the damsel offers.  That offer ought to make you chuckle.  Along the way you'll summon many creatures and finally figure out which ones are most useful to you.  After that you'll have an opportunity to really wreak mayhem and get yourself into some interesting situations.  The game is full of cliche's on purpose and they spice it up instead of detract from game-play.  And of course there are always complications along the way to add dimension to the game.The screen resolution choices are based on what was available at release time.  Don't fuss over them too much.  Pick the largest resolution with the same ratio as your screen and it ought to look fine anyway.  Works fine on a 1900x1200 monitor.It can be played with a controller, but you may find the onscreen prompts to be confusing and awkward.  If you do use a controller, you can find a useful list of controls at http://www.gamefly.com/Rent-The-Bard%27s-Tale/109860/GameplayControls/ - seriously though, the game is best player with a mouse and keyboard.  It just works better for a game this old.  The original game was released in 1985 and twenty years later this version was released with much improved graphical content and music.  If you want the full retro experience, the menu system will let you load up the original game and have a go at it.If you want to get a feel for the music and dialog in the 2005 version of the game, I would recommend these YouTube videos:*  The Tale of the Nuckelavee*  The Bard's Tale Silkbeard and the Viking Song*  Here's to the Bard*  The Chosen One #4 (There are several variations of this song and all of them have an Oompa Loopa feel to them right down to ending with a Diddly-Do.)I just replayed a bit of the game on my Win gaming rig, but it will play equally well on a computer with low graphics capabilities.  Worked just fine on a stripped down Mac Mini when I played it a few months back. (Disclaimer - used non-Steam version on my Mac.)			"

												Top-down view RPG-lite, more of an action-adventure, I suppose - one of those titles that focuses more on the characters and story rather than loot, combat, or game mechanics in general.That is not to say it abandons game mechanics completely - just simplifies them compared to more mainstream RPGs (especially ""western"", as opposed to JRPGs).However, in the story department - it excels, with witty, humorous writing (it's essentially a parody/spoof of fantasy RPG games) and superb voice acting (at least in English version). Well worth playing just for that! And you'd be surprised how much is based on real world mythology and places.There are essentially two main characters in the game - the eponymous Bard, whose misadventures you follow and whom you control directly, and The Narrator, who holds the Bard in great contempt, never failing to throw in some sarcastic commentary. There's fourth wall to be broken for sure, and generally the game does instill this idea that it is a tale, sort of reenactment you're witnessing, rather than directly participating in, at least that's how it worked for me - I would place myself, perhaps paradoxically, more next to The Narrator, who's spinning the tale, rather than the Bard, who's living (reliving?) it.The story mostly revolves around Bard being a Chosen One, enduring trials and tribulations to save a princess, although his motives are clear: coin and cleavage, and definitely not saving the world. Which rapidly enters worse and worse state. Which may or may not be related to Bard's questing around. Nothing really to dwell on much, you're here pretty much to enjoy the ride.I finished it on hard difficulty, but I wouldn't really bother if I were you, it only serves as annoyance really rather than a proper challenge, and everything can be easily cheesed anyway, with you shooting offscreen enemies with bows, minmaxing dexterity and rhythm (as a bard, you can summon variety of allies and rhythm makes them stronger), so playing it easy just lets you enjoy the ride more.If you're unaware, it's well worth pointing out that none other than Brian Fargo is behind this game, one of industry titans (does Fallout ring a bell? something he was personally responsible for, not mentioning other great titles he was more or less involved with, and most recently, Kickstarter backed great promises of Torment and Wasteland 2). You really should cast away any doubts with regard to writing quality this game has to offer (mind though, again, it's not a ""serious"" title, and not big one either, giving off somewhat indie, passion project vibe rather than triple-A vibe Interplay could muster and inXile not so much, at least until Kickstarter and ever growing technological advances.. but I digress; look the guy up on Wikipedia if you don't know who he is).Oh, it's bad luck to be you.A chosen one of many isn't newWhen you think you're full of luckin the bullocks you'll get struckOh, it's bad luck to be you.

												The creators of The Bard's Tale (2004) said that they wanted to create something special and that's exactly what The Bard's Tale is. The game is something of a fractured fairy-tale and focuses more on poking fun at the fantasy/adventure/rpg genre than creating just another entry in the sea of fantasy rpgs. You play as The Bard (voiced by Cary Elwes) who is more interested in women, wine, and coin than adventuring. He uses his magic for his own personal gain. Being pulled into an adventure to save a damsel in distress and stop an evil sorcerer was the last thing on his mind. So of course... that's what happens. And so our story begins... The game serves more as a vessel for crude humor, snarky remarks, and breaking the 4th wall. This may not be for everybody but certain lines are bound to make you chuckle. As for the gameplay, it's not bad at all. The game is solid, simple, and different from most fantasy games. Rather than having convoluted tech trees and a long list of abilities, The Bard's Tale focuses on simple top-down combat and using summons. My main complaint is the repetitiveness of the combat. Some segments felt like they were there to pad the game time and give you more experience but gaining new summons and the occasional weapon upgrade help to keep things a bit more fresh. Overall, I had a lot of fun playing this game and enjoying some sharp wit and silly songs while exploring a unique Scottish fantasy setting. For those who are fans of the original games, the original Bard's Tale trilogy from the 80s now comes with this game. I haven't played them but I've heard that The Bard's Tale (2004) hardly resembles the original games. With 4 games in 1, this may be enough to hold you until the release of the newly kickstarted The Bard's Tale IV.7/10			"

												This game is not a challenger to Diablo. You will not horde items and decide whether you would like the quicker sword with a less power, or the more powerful t hat's a bit slower. You won't have to make difficult decisions about whether to save a woman or save a town. The RPG mechanics are not innovative or thought-provoking. And the quest will not demand countless hours of your life. You will, however, enjoy every step in your (short) journey.It's funny, it's quirky, and you'll never have to worry about anything except from moving forward. Everything you pick up is something you automatically equip or something that turns instantly to gold. (you should still look at what these things are, though, as often times it's hilarious). Even new weapons when you find one, will be automatically equipped, and your old sword will turn to gold. These are not admirable designs in deep, generic adventure games. In this game though, which you play alone, they are godsends.It's cheap right now on Steam, and worth every penny. It won't change your life, but it will leave you happy.			"

												Interesting game. It's very dated in the gameplay, lots of stunlocking (from you and enemies) which means fights later on can be completely one sided. To seemingly combat this, there are save points practically every 5 feet. I've had fights where I have sat with my back to a wall spamming parry+counter attack for a few minutes, staying invincible while doing damage. I've also had fights where I get charged in to a stunlock and killed before I can move.The game pokes fun at the standard RPG quest requirements, where the main character often mocks how stupid the idea of climbing an impenetrable tower is, but every time there's a silly thing you are forced to do, you just joke about it then do it anyway.All in all it's entertaining.Controller recommended.

												An action RPG where you play as Robert Downey Jr.It has nothing to do with the first 3 Bard's Tale in both gameplay and story, it's still pretty decent. There's a wide range of summons and a fair amount of equipment to use that'll keep the gameplay interesting enough till the end. The game doesn't take itself seriously, the Bard always has a casual attitude a which I didn't like that much at the beggining but started to grow on me. The humor is hit&miss, I found maybe a few moments legitimately funny which is alright in an era where developers either think they're too grown up to put in a little life with their game and end up making grimdark garbage or either think that stuffing their games with ebin 9gag memes will make it hilarious.The game also has some songs of pretty good quality, on top of that each summon is made through playing a bit of music with your instrument. That music changes with each instrument and as you learn upgraded versions of your summons it gets more and more elaborate, a really nice touch.			"

												There are very few games I play through more than once.   There are even fewer RPGs.  This is one of them.  With the amazing vocal talents, excellent music, laugh-out-loud funny comments, asides, and conversations, this game will forever give me a smile.   As with the majority of RPGs, you're a low-level schmo who gets 'invited' to partake on an ever-expanding adventure where you ascend the level tree, getting bigger weapons, fighting bigger monsters, and eventually get the girl, and live happily ever after.  Except in this case, the game shows that things aren't quite peachy, and seem to go downhill, rather than up.   The game shows you the wonderful side-effects of your murderous misanthropy, as you gaily stab, shoot and zap your way across a beautiful scottish and norse-themed fantasy land... Whether you follow the plot, or try to deviate from it, the wonderful writing keeps you amused, and on your toes, guiding you in the right direction at all times.There's a LOT in this game, although it sometimes doesn't feel that way.   The level-grinders will find a lot to keep them amused, the magic-lovers, the archers, the swordsmen, will all find that the balance is quite nice (although I think the bow may be slightly under-powered compared to the sword, but only by a fraction, and the ability to sit out of the action and pepper opponents with arrows is fun enough.).  I've played this through as both sword and bow, and both are very playable.  I can heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good old-fashioned RPG, but wants something with its tongue firmly wedged in its cheek.    Wonderful on both PC and android, it's a great game for whiling away the hours.  The voice acting of the wonderful Tony Jay will forever be missed.  His voice lives on in all the games and TV media he did.  You should play this, just to hear his wry humour and phenomenal voice.  Thanks  InXile! You've made an old-fashioned RPGer very happy!			"

												The Bard's Tale is a nice RPG game with lots of humor. The story is the driving part in this game. It's mocking the cliches in the fantasy genre. So, don't expect to play this game as a chivalry knight but as a half-drunk wisecracking bard. Even that he don't want any adventures, the adventure wants him. About the gameplay, it's a simple, more casual type of RPG. The fights are little repeatable but enjoyable. The level design is little flat. Good voice acting and songs. No need to play it on hard difficulty, there aren't any achivements. In this case this is a plus. If you want just to relax, this is a good game for you. And to not forget to mention, that the original games from the Commodore era are included with an ingame emulator.			"

												First off, i feel this game is not good for young children. It could be played by 15 year olds and up. Also, this is not the orginal Bard's Tale game, this is the remake from 2004.Ok, here are the pro's and con's for this game:PROS:`Humourous dialogue between narrater and the Bard`Numerous quests and some side quests`Lauging your butt off at the jokes`Unlockable things in the menu, including art and songs`Sung songs by the ""Trow Trio""!`It features the Original trio of games, but a warning about that ""The games usually super fast, coppy, and only allow you to use keyboard on them.""CONS:`Outdated graphics(it did not bother me, but some might not like it)`Some jokes are told over and over again in different ways, which can get tiring if you play it for a long time`Cliches`Old trilogy is touchy and does not work all the time..`Some grinding is required near the end of the game.All in all, a great little game that features hilarious interaction between the narrator, the bard himself, and NPC's found all over the game.Definetly Recommeneded!

												~~~To make a small clarification for people who might not know~~~This game does include all three text-based Bard's Tale games from the 80s but that isn't all, the game you see screenshots of is the ""sequel"" made in 2004 by a different company that never actually owned any rights to the original games. Hence it's not really a sequel. This short lil review is about the 2004 edition.Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ it's been so long since I played this game last. On my long-gone PS2 the week it came out in 2004. Got it from one of my best friends not long ago, haven't played anything else since. Playing it as a kid was amazing, but I can't begin to describe how much fun I'm having now that I'm older, understand sexual jokes and implications, and know what the heck the 4th wall is.This game is a gemstone among PS2 games, and having it re-amped in HD on my PC is beyond amazing.If you played this even once as a child, getting it now is like giving your childhood memories multiple ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but even if you never did, it's a game definitely worth playing. More suggested and recommended than any other game I've played <3			"

												A fun little romp in nostalgia, The Bard's Tale is a Diablo-esque action RPG that, instead of demons and a dark atmosphere, takes place in a relatively pleasant land where humor abounds.  As you venture through the game you'll encounter all manner of singing goblins, hilarious misunderstandings, and of course, your own personal bard who doesn't so much want to adventure as get laid.Playing as an all around shady individual in a hilarious atmosphere is good fun but the majority of the mechanics in the game are noticably dated at this point.  I recommend the game for those who enjoy humorous stories that don't take themselves too seriously and for those who had a blast in old-school action RPGs (Baldur's Gate or Champions of Norrath on consoles come to mind).  I do not recommend it for people looking for anything groundbreaking in today's era or those looking for a game with complex mechanics.A good game as long as you go into it expecting it to be what it is and not something more.

												The Bard's Tale is another classic dungeon crawler, originally released in the mid 2000's. The story is about a Bard who is recruited on a quest to free a princess named, Caleigh. There are several different endings you can choose from, each with their own consequences and humorous rewards. There are several songs throughout the game which are memorable and still fun to listen to today. While graphically lacking by today's standards, The Bard's Tale is still a fun game to play.  "

You play The Bard, a quick-witted silver-tongued minstrel with the power to summon creatures and companions through song.

												This dude is such a bard♥♥♥♥♥br>(Non-pun-including review below)I doubt I'm even 1% done. This game is actually pretty good. It's graphics aren't bad for the time they were made, and I kind of like the feel they give. They aren't really retro, but still bring nostalgia. The voice acting is great, and it has a great storyline, with different responses you can choose, a kind response or a rude response and both change the outcome of the story, whether it be a small change or a large one. It's got a thorough skill system, and might I say, one of the most descriptive smithy shops in a game. The works are very described, but not so much in a way that they take forever to understand. They are clear, to the point, and yet aren't short. There are a couple glitches, and one that has halted my progress 4 hours in, which I am very upset about, but still, I love this game. And hey, every good game has glitches, It's possible to beat Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time in under half an hour because of them. Who doesn't love glitches?			"

												I purchased this game primarily for the three original Bard's Tale games - which were favorites back in the days of my old C64.  However, I've been pleasantly surprised by newer version, even though it has little in common with the original series.  The Bard's Tale has a sharp wit and isn't afraid to lampoon traditional sword & sorcery RPG games in a most amusing fashion.  With Carey Elwes providing the voice of the Bard, the producers couldn't help but tip their hats to ""The Princess Bride"" at various points in the story.  While the game is hardly cutting edge in terms of game play or graphics, it is a breath of fresh air compared to much of the turgid and predictable fare found in fantasy gaming.  An overlooked gem.

I would Recommend it to ""Old"" and ""New"" fans, but; I'd say, it you do not like a Boarish, Crude, Sexist, Male Anti-Hero, Protagonist, then maybe it's not for you... but I'd at least can comfort you that Everyone, including the Narriator, seem to hate him, and the ""4th Wall"" jokes, seemingly over the top at times actually made me laugh, but the Dark Humor, and Lighter Humor of the Game is around the Misery and Hell the Bard has to go through to ""Rescue"", the ""Princess"" again no spoilers, but that makes me laugh... Good luck knowing you get what you sow, and literally the Endings all three are good, the ""Neutral Ending, while semi-dark is kinda funny, and I loved the Dance off with the Zombies Vs Skeleton-Zombies (A.K.A., the ""You Got Served"" Scene), too funny and original. Story is great, actors are original, and your choices of ""Snarky"" or ""Polite"" at ""Certain Points"" of this game are ironically funny, again no spoilers...

												This game is old but gold. Its an interesting tale of some guy named Bard who became hero of his new tale. For me most enjoyable parts are a lot of humour, narrator and system where you rely on creatures that you can summon with your musical instrument. Story is pretty common but still fun, with a lot of mockings of modern fantasy settings and tropes. The only downside of this game that you cant get throught some game progress without grinding and btw you can easily level your Bard bad so the game will become unplayable so better use autoleveling. 8 out of 10			"

												If anyone could ask me to point to the funniest game I've ever played, instantly I'd point to this little obscure masterpiece of a game.The Bard's Tale: A Quest for Coin and Cleavage is a rather unique sequel to the interactive novel series Bard's Tale, which revolved around a Bard with a magic lute going about saving the day. This technical third game in the series is relatively simple on the surface: top down 3D light Role-Playing Game with stats, unique weapons, and magic. Gameplay-wise, it's very simple: use weapons to kill monsters, get gold, level up, progress through the game, yadda yadda. A unique element the game has is the Song System, in which the Bard uses magical instruments to summon different helpers to either aid in battle, heal quickly, disable traps, locate treasures, light up dark places, and be good little arrow meat shields.HOWEVER, the story and writing is really where this game shines. The premise is simple: guy gets chosen to rescue a princess from a wizard by disabling the barriers to her prison. The catch: the alleged 'hero' is probably one of the biggest♥♥♥♥♥hats on the planet. When the subtitle of the game is 'A Quest for Coin and Cleavage', you know you're in for a treat. All the Bard cares about is getting rich and getting laid. The first mission of the game literally only occurs so Bard can get with a sexy barmaid! Oh, and that's not all. Throughout the entire course of the adventure, the player can make choices to either make the Bard seem like a decent human being or the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ever with the Naughty and Nice dialogue system. Be warned, depending on your choices with Naughty and Nice, certain quests may become either difficult or unavailable, but the humor is plenty. OH GODS ABOVE THE HUMOR!The Bard's Tale's writing can be summed up in one word: Satire. The entire game's writing is satire on the fantasy and pretty much all RPG genres, making jabs at pretty much every turn. Example: the first mission in every fantasy games is the standard 'rats in the cellar' jazz. Bard's Tale has that, except the rat is the size of a house and breaths fire! You know how in fantasy games they play to the rule of the 'Chosen One' being the one who can save the day. There are a LOT of Chosen Ones in this game to the point it's a running gag. Oh, and need I mention that there are musical numbers around every turn, and they never stop being funny and catchy.If all I've said hasn't convinced you to buy this game yet, then let me say one last thing: The Bard is voiced by Carry Elwes, Robin of Loxley and the Dread Pirate Roberts himself, and the cynical narrator is voiced by the late Tony Jay. And the two fight... a lot...Anyway, if you're looking for a good fun game from the old days, then I highly recommend buying this gem. Or else ya must really be an♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The Bard's Tale... truly my all time favorite game.  Not this game, the original, I played it as a teenager on my Commdore 64.  If you were to try to play it today you'd not make it 5 minutes in.  I know this because as big a fan as I am of the game, I tried to play it and didn't make it 5 minutes in.  Yet I will always look back on it with great fondness as the first game to truly open another world for me to explore.Is this Bard's Tale as good as the old one?  Who's to say really, it's a completely different game.  What I can tell you is that I found it quite a lot of fun to play and so extremely funny it had me LLOL.  (literally laughing out loud)  I waited for a sale and there's no question it was worth every penny I paid.			"

												This game's humor isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed it. The gameplay works as a basic ARPG style but is kind of novel in its party/summoning system. The enemies and dungeons get pretty repetitive but it doesn't take overly long to complete.I'd definitely recommend it, but don't think it has too much replayability. Saving before the end will let you see all three endings or you can actually purchase the cutscenes from the priests in the game.			"

With game like Diablo and Baldurs Gate Dark Alliance there was just something missing from this genre.  And then it came to be, The Bard's Tale!  Of any comedic style dungeon crawler, this one will always bring sweet memories.  From the song of Beer to the dancing skeletons.  Nothing beats a good Bard's Tale.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: The Bard's Tale 

			Views: 2,092		

			The Bard's Tale is a comedy action adventure RPG on Steam here http://store.steampowered.com/app/41900/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

The Bard's Tale is a comedy based action/adventure with RPG elements. The plot of the game is your sterotypical 'rescue the princess and live happily ever after' story, but with a comedic twist.  Ironically, the game that centers around a Bard has a distinct lack of music, which does take away from the atmosphere somewhat.Despite this being a game from 2005, graphically it does a good jobof keeping up with the times. Visually the only issue I noticed was as the game wasn't designed for 1920x1080, the overhead view waslacking a bit in peripheral vision, making it difficult to see far ahead.The level design does hint at its' age, and although it isn't bad,and ties in well to the world map, it does harken back to ye old ""05.It does a good job of showing different atmospheres, but does get repetitive as you travel between the main towers of the game.  That combined with the limited combat makes for a stretched out feel, andtakes away from the enjoyment of gameplay. The UI is well done, and every object in the game has the potential for synergy with other objects.  One big plus is that unwanted loot is automatically changed to money, eliminating the need for constant return trips to merchants, or constant inventory management.  As a self-admitted loot ♥♥♥♥♥, I found this to make the game stronger by playing around its' limitatons.Overall, this game is well balanced, has a strong and entertaining story,and while it may not be 'game of the year', it's a fun experience thatI can happily recommend.For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of what I cover in my video.

												Something went wrong with my game, which makes me very confused and sad. The gameplay was off, the way you moved was like in slow motion, not like how I remembered in the PS2 version, NOTHING else was slow though, the voice acting and sounds were fine, and so was the lip syncing. Not sure what it was but I had to get it refunded.			"

												I first played this game on the PlayStation 2 and from it I found a rare gem amidst the gaming industry of that time, it has an essence of Baldur's Gate; except it had it's Tounge placed Firmly in its' Cheek, whether it be from the Bard himself, the menagerie of characters around him or by the Narrator-(who by the way is none other than the Late 'n' Great Tony Jay of Notre Dame and ReBoot fame)-who has an ongoing sence of contempt for the Bard.The Gameplay utilized an interesting Summon Mechanic where the Bard could call Warriors, Mages,Mystical Monsters and the Odd Rat to his disposal with a high degree of abilities such as the Heriones Flurry of Arrows to the Knockers Wide Range Lightning Rods.The Original Trilogy to me is a bit of an afterthough as I am not a man of the Commodore Days, but if you are then I'd give it a good ganders.the only critiques I can offer is that the Enemies tend to get REALLY powerful around the Mid stages and that the story begins to stale out around the third act, but hopefully the humour can palate you all the way through the adventure.P.S. visit the churches often, they're more rewarding than you would first think...

It's a good roleplaying hack and slash taking place in scottish fantasy world. Also like the dry sense of humor which game is filled with.In addition of wide-screen running possibilty and windows 7 compatibility - steam version is enchanted with 3 ancient ""Bard's Tale"" - games from mid 80s.

												Originally bought the game to play the NES version, but the new one is surprisingly good. The game plays with a top down view.  Combat involves alternating between sword/melee, bow/range, and bard songs/spells. Bow is slightly overpowered, as it can hit enemies that are off screen. The game narrator makes funny comments every now and then. Game took about a day to finish.			"

												Three great classic games, they may not have aged well for some, but I'm still having a lot of fun with them. Most importantly you get the newest Bard's Tale, voiced by none other than the magnificent Cary Elwes. It makes fun of almost EVERY single rpg trope you'ver ever seen. *Very Tiny Spoiler* (This happens in the first couple minutes)Always the rat problem to take care of in RPGs, eh? Well our ""Hero"" summons rats with his Bard skills to come in and play the Hero, rescuing the big bosomed damsel in distress.Gameplay is good, graphics are damn decent for a game of this age, dialogue and story is hilarious. Must buy, if you ask me. This game alone could sell for 10 bucks, here you get this and the original oldschool games for 5. Or just buy Wastelands 2 directors cut and you get it for free :D			"

												A fun little (2004) action rpg. You play a bard and navigate (pretty) linear areas, use melee weapons, bows, and summons, and collect money to buy better gear. The best parts about the game are it's humor (it is actually pretty funny) and the freedom of combat options (depsite being only able to play one character). You level up abilities which in turn allows you to specialize in summoning, melee, bows, etc. Worth a play. Around 12-15 hours or so with one or two optional sidequests. Like I said, It is pretty linear, so dont expect Diablo.			"

												This game is sort of alright.Love the songs in this game.That is probably the only thing going for it, the humour and awesome songs.The controls, combat and camera are very clunky and awkward and the constant load screens are annoying as well. No inventory, little depth to the game and it becomes repetitive.Though no inventory can be classed as a good thing especially if you're a hoarder who finds it hard to part with anything in case you need it later. Not so with this game, no need to sell anything, it is automatic, any loot you pick up whether it be wolf pelts, or jewels etc. immediately turn to silvers, the currency of this game. If you find a weapon more powerful then the equipped, it immediately equips it and turns the old into silvers. But it also means less depth and not really any choice of what you equip. Such as you would rather equip a faster sword that has less dmg, but nope it would equip the weapon does the most dmg. This game is also very linear and more like an action adventure game than an RPG. I like the main character he is rather snarky and selfish and not a typical save the world hero, which makes for a nice change. He's in it primarily for coin and booty.But even so the fun songs become repetitive and don't vary much, always the same bad luck song with slight variation sung by trow. So 7 Trow songs and only 2, more unique songs that I came across and Iam very thorough in exploring so don't think I missed any.Can't recommend this game for the humour alone does not make up for the negatives.I  found it a bit too repetitive to recommend, I only kept playing as I hate leaving a game uncompleted and it was not so terrible that I couldn't stand playing and now that I completed it,  it's not a game Iam likely ever to play again. And to see the other ending I can just watch it on You Tube.5/10			"

If someone gives it to you for a buck, go for it, but it's generally a subpar game.Also, if you use Steam OS or Linux (i.e. on a steam box or Linux distro), I would recommend against this, as the port seems to be massively broken for the systems I tested it on.

Decided to give it a try couple of days ago and have to say one of the most enjoyable experiences I had so far. The gameplay is solid but nothing special yet the story and the humor is what makes this game so enjoyable. The exchanges between narrator and main character are hilarious and the songs within the game are flat out hilarious. The possibility to summon and create your own party from a big variety of companions which you can find/unlock/upgrade was one of the best gameplay features of the game.			"

The game plays of every one of the horrible overused RPG clichés that remove them from being realistic (such as how animals drop items) with alot of wit and charm.Overall a great game.  Better than a lot of AAA titles.			"

												The story seems to be your typical fantasy RPG story: the world needs saving and you are the one to save it. Here's the thing though: you don't really want to.The Bard's Tale is a comedic fantasy RPG set in yet another medival fantasy land with your typical story, but a rather atypical hero, mostly because he doesn't want to be a hero. But after he's promised money and the damsel in distress, he moves out, fighting bad guys and monsters, meeting up with a whole lot of strange characters, collecting new gear and summoning the help of his magic companions, all while arguing with the narrator as he goes along.It may not be the most refined RPG, but it's a lot of fun. The combat, while a bit tedious at times, is good, the dialogue is absolutely great, partly so because of the voice actors who do a great job at delivering the lines.All in all an enjoyable game, especially for action RPG fans who don't mind the abscence of serious business.

												Tony Jay, I miss you so god damn much. Cary Elwes, you made 12-year-old me realize whole new tingly implications of the word ""sexy"". Bard's Tale, you bring me back to a time of Reboot and Princess Bride and Dragonlance and 3D Doritos. You also manage to do this while being pretty damn funny, and within a game whose sheer format is telling you not to take it seriously, relax, just enjoy the show. There's a lot of love here. Well-expressed, well-designed love.I STILL CAN'T CHANGE MY SCREEN RESOLUTION GUYS WHAT THE HELL			"

												This game brings back amazing memories of the Play station 2. Bards Tale was the best game I have ever played in my childhood. It was great. I seriously recomend this game for my buddies. All the characters and graphics may be considered low quality today, but this game is one of the funniest. It really does gve you a great challenge and hours of endless fun with a story line that is flawless. I hope anyone reading this would get this game and enjoy it as much as I have.			"

Posted: September 2, 2015
												First, this is a review from The Bard's Tale, not the 3 originial bards tale 1-3 that come with the game. The Bards tale is  a lackluster, basic rpg that you will enjoy playing but doesn't have the depth, roleplaying aspect, nor versitily to be a good rpg. Most characters wind up exactly the same, the only difference is if you want to concentrate more on an archer character (recommended) or a melee character. You start off as The Bard, and like all rpgs you run into problems, have to fight monsters, visit stores and talk to people, and bla bla bla. Unlike some rpgs this game tries to keep the Bards Tale humor in it, with funny comments and happenings. Sadly this does not add to the gameplay or the depth of the game so instead of making the game better, all it does it make it a tad funnier. If i wanted funny i'd watch a comedy stand-up show. You can fight either with melee weapons or archery, and your main ability is to summon allies to help you in your quests. You really have no choice on your character build other than if you want to focus on melee or archery, all characters usually wind up with max summoning, luck, endurance, etc. Your real only choice is to have strength and use melee weapons/shields, or dexterity to use bows, and since bows seem to be vastly superior to melee choice, most just go with bows. You only have 1 line of bows to be skilled in, while if you focus on melee you have a variety of choices such as 2 handed, dual welding, weapon/shield, etc. If you pick bows, you just focus on bows and get better much easier. Plus bows let you attack out of range, bows are useful vs all foes in the game, and only bows are useful vs some foes in the game, making picking anything other than bows as your main attack ability wasteful. The maps are small, basic. The gameworld map overland map is small, not many locations, linear in nature, you do get a few extras while playing such as artifacts to use in combat, which sadly you won't use 99% of the game because it isn't a hard game especially with your summons. You can summon a variety of helpers to use, a few you will use a lot but many you won't even touch due to there not being a huge variety of combat gameplay that would need them. You can summon melee warriors, area-of-effect summons, distance attackers, plus support healers, light casters, etc. As you progress you can upgrade the summons once into better summons, but again you will find yourself simply using a half dozen or so summons all the time while the rest sit in the dusty closet never to be touched. You and your bow are the main force in combat so you'll have some melee fighters to hold off foes while you plink away at them, and a backup healer just in case. Thats about it.Most fights, even boss fights just require you to smack them until dead, very little strategy nor difficulty. Some boss's i just blasted with arrows and my summons and they were dead in 10-20 seconds.. Not very difficult boss fights. There isn't really an inventory system, there isn't really a stat/skill system to vary your characters other than noted earlier, melee or archery. There isn't any crafting, not many secrets, not a huge store variety to buy stuff (you are given most of your gear as you play), and absolutely no replay value to the game at all. Lackluster graphics, gameplay, maps, and rpg elements make this game a nice buy when its on sale due to the inclusion of the original bards tale 1-3 games, plus the game isn't incredibly bad, but just make sure to pick it up on-sale so you can enjoy a basic so-so rpg game that you've seen 1000 times before, usually with better gameplay.

												Classic. A very nice game, the story is interesting, full of humour and songs. The gameplay is repetative, enemies are strong and usually there are many of them, but the story really worth it and several bugs can make battles easier (sometimes enemies just stand in a corner without casting spells or attacking). If you are going to buy this game - don't expect really interesting gameplay features, but I'm almost 100% sure that you will sing songs along with the NPCs and laugh at dialogs between characters or narrator's comments.

												Your standardish Diablo clone.  The gameplay is repetative, but is rarely boring or tedious.  Almost all of the creatures you can summon are interesting and useful.  However, you will always be down one summon slot for the Witch (who heals your troops) since she is so useful.  Half way through (maybe before I can't remember the specific point) you'll have your team of high DPS/strong critters decided on,  and with my remaining summon slots devoted to them I ended up with little reason switching them out.I played/toughed through it mostly for the humor and songs.  The Bard is the perferct parody of your standard RPG character.  If you don't want to put in the time to actually play through it, you should at least look up the songs/cutscenes on youtube.			"

												The Bard's Tale is a hack 'n' slash, dungeon crawl style RPG that doesn't take itself seriously. Straight from the off you'll find extremely blunt sarcasm and tongue-in-cheek puns, the humour of which not always finding the mark and at times will leave you cringing, other times providing you with a good chuckle.Ignore Diablo II comparisons, this is more along the lines of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, there isn't a loot system to speak of, all findings add to your gold tally and you make purchases from shop keepers as you go along. The summon system is functional, if a touch on the conservative side, with choices becoming quite obvious as you get deeper in the game which rules out the need to experiment with your companions.Whilst The Bard's Tale doesn't provide anything original to the genre by any stretch of the imagination, it is worth a punt when on offer and will keep you engaged for a short stretch of time.

												One of the best rpgs ever made. you don't have to now the forgotten realms or the prequels, you can pretty much just dive in and you WILL love it.stellar writing, voice-acting and gameplay make for a grand game even today. yes the grafics are dated, but tbh. with a high enough resolution your eyes won't start bleeding. if you got just an inch of love for rpgs or great story-telling you gotta buy this pearl.you will learn summoning diffrent allies: starting with a simple rat, a healing ""witch"", or a wartorn mercenary and and and. you got the choice between diffrent melee-weapons or bow (recommended).there is also your usual rpg char-progression: every level you can spend 2 stat points, ever second level you get to pick a trait.it's more the love to detail which makes this game: you get an ""explorer"" summon, which is basicaly an old man running around disarming traps for you (by walking into them..which is hillarious on it's own), now try walking into trap while you got him summond-> he's quite amused by thatthe game is filled which such small little conversations, songs and the writing made me laugh my♥♥♥♥♥off more than once. definitly a must buy for adventure or rpg fans. some starting tips: go ranged, pick easy (which gives you more save-points and more initial starting attributes) and be nice to the dog.

												Bear in mind, first, that I never finished this game.That said, the six or seven hours I played back when I had it on Xbox were a blast. The combat is....okay, I guess. Exploration and loot? Eh....I've had worse. Classes and playstyles are....well....Look, honestly? To me, none of this is what the game is about. If you're playing this game, you're doing it to have a laugh, and a laugh you shall have, my friend, because the Bard is a womanising, sarcastic, world-weary sleazebag, but ultimately a pretty likeable guy. He is frequently taken advantage of and made the butt of some fairly sadistic humour by an array of entertaining support characters - and his morals are so mercurial that you just know, bone-deep, that he'd do exactly the same thing given half a chance.Bottom line: the actual gameplay ranges from dull to forgettable, but the story and comedy are well worth making the effort. It's dirt-cheap, will probably run on a calculator, and will keep you thoroughly entertained with the dialogue alone. Seriously, if you can't get a laugh out of this game, you're a pod person or something and have bigger problems than the three bucks you shelled out for it.			"

The game may get a 70 on Metacritic, but in terms of fun I'd put it at an 80. Definitely worth a spin at less than $5.			"

												One of the best rpgs ever made. you don't have to now the forgotten realms or the prequels, you can pretty much just dive in and you WILL love it.stellar writing, voice-acting and gameplay make for a grand game even today. yes the grafics are dated, but tbh. with a high enough resolution your eyes won't start bleeding. if you got just an inch of love for rpgs or great story-telling you gotta buy this pearl.you will learn summoning diffrent allies: starting with a simple rat, a healing ""witch"", or a wartorn mercenary and and and. you got the choice between diffrent melee-weapons or bow (recommended).there is also your usual rpg char-progression: every level you can spend 2 stat points, ever second level you get to pick a trait.it's more the love to detail which makes this game: you get an ""explorer"" summon, which is basicaly an old man running around disarming traps for you (by walking into them..which is hillarious on it's own), now try walking into trap while you got him summond-> he's quite amused by thatthe game is filled which such small little conversations, songs and the writing made me laugh my♥♥♥♥♥off more than once. definitly a must buy for adventure or rpg fans. some starting tips: go ranged, pick easy (which gives you more save-points and more initial starting attributes) and be nice to the dog.

												GET THE MOBILE VERSION.This is a fantastic game, full of ""flavor content"" that you don't often see in an RPG like this. Full voice acting, narration, even sing-a-long drinking songs - it's hard to ask for more. Story is quirky, even slightly parodic, but not over-the-top like Grotesque Tactics. As a mobile game (played it on my Android phone, but also available for iOS), I'd give it a 9/10.Unfortunately, the PC version of the game is just clunky and weird. The controls are slow, un-intuitive, and often buggy - and the graphics... hardly make it worth playing on a bigger screen. (Not to mention the added features in the mobile versions, like autosave, that are not implemented in this version). I had to stop after about 5 minutes and switch back to my phone. If you don't have an Android or iOS device, and can put up with the annoying controls - it might still be better than not playing it all. But not by much.			"

												A Bard's Tale: A Quest for Coin and CleavageQuite the catchy title for a game wouldn't you say?I was pretty happy to see this package on Steam.  The original three from way back are nostalgic titles, even if they were just on Apple IIe. Was a Vic-20/Commodore/Amiga owner myself so wasn't privy to the series until I was at my friend's house who was an Apple fan, and let me 'try' it out a few times.If you're a BIG fan, you might want to check out http://www.bardstaleonline.com/ for all your Bard's Tale needs.Now, for the recent Steam release of The Bard's Tale (original game release in June 1985 according to Steam), I'm having a blast playing it.  I had played it just a little bit on the old Xbox since my son had got it from some bargain bin at Zellers.  Now that I've played it for 8hrs, I'm really wondering if my young son 'got' some of the off-the-wall comments our Bard throws out there or the one's by the commentator for that matter.  One thing is for sure though, I'm finding it very funny and have been laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off at some of his antics and those impromptu singing groups that appear throughout the game.The gaming itself is pretty basic with a simple questing system with corridor like zones where you complete these quests received from the denizens of various towns you travel to.  Other than having to set my compability settings to Windows XP Pack 3 to eliminate a nasty Crash-To-Desktop (CTD) issue when starting the game, I've had no issue whatsoever playing the game.  I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, an i5-2320 CPU @ 3.00GHz (4 CPUs), DirectX 11, and a somewhat crappy (ok, crappy) Nvidia GeForce GT 520 card.So what does the game entail and what does it let you do?1. You do get to upgrade your gear by buying it from a blacksmith or looting some in chests you can loot,2. Smash and break tons of barrels that don't hold anything, but you do get paid.  You may ask, ""Uh? How? Why?""  Those are well asked and valid questions, since I had made the same response.By the vendor who actually makes the barrels of course!All depending on how many replacements he sells to replace the ones you smashed up obviously.  You obtain the quest from him after you break one of his barrels just outside his place at the starting town.  I believe he pays you $5 for each barrel you break, and you can collect payment anytime you come see him.3. Obtain new songs, which are a bard's magic spells per say, which allow you to heal yourself and friends, or summon a helper with specific skills, and other things,4. Each level you get 2 points to spend on your stats: Strength, Vitality, Luck, Dexterity, Charisma, and Rhythm, to a maximum of 20, except luck is 21 due to skipping the unlucky number 13.Wow! Ok, just noticed how much stuff I wrote into this review of mine, so I'll shut up now and let you guys go and buy the game so you can also play this pretty fun and funny game of coins and cleavage.For more fun stuff about the game and a walkthrough, if you care for those, see an IGN guide at this website: http://ca.ign.com/faqs/2006/the-bards-tale-810205-walkthrough-562447Silly Me!!  Almost forgot to mention a true hero to us all who has a tribute in this game.  None other than Charlie Mops! The mythical inventor of Beer!

												Well, I spent the time to complete this, and was pretty satisfied.  Wasn't spectacular, but provided a few chuckles along the way and a somewhat casual pace, easy to play in 10-20 minute chunks til you got to the next save point.  I very much enjoyed the dog companion, especially training him to attack and dig up treasure... once he joined me  I don't think he ever left my side.  The story was corny and cliche (intentionally) and voice acting was well done.  The songs with the oopah loompah type guys got annoying after about the 2nd time, but I toughed through those moments.  I do have to be fair to the content and the game that was made.OK fun.  Probably about 8-12 hours of gameplay for this new Bard's TakeAbsolutely worthwhile if you do want to go back and play the originals Bard's Tale 1, 2 and 3 as well.I did play these on C64 back in the day, Bard's Tale was one of my favorite RPG/DnD franchises of all time (others including Wizardry, and Ultima).This new game was different and ok, but so nice that they included the old school originals as well for when/if the urge hits (though the originals might be a bigger timesink than this new game).Thanks for reading.  Good night, good luck, and game on.Wiseone :ccknight:			"

												With an awesome ideia, this title manages to bring some original elements to RPGs. Adding importance to music attracts me so much that I got hooked from the very begining. Everything has a pinch of comedy behind, making many parts of the game funny, even though the background history is not that original.Through the game you'll sure notice that usability has not been on focus, like save points badly positioned, movements too slow (not only walking, but atacking, defending, conjuring and so on), lack of explanation of some mechanics (not really a problem for many games, but the kind of info that is missing and the way the game exposes things to you doesn`t get along with this point), and other things.It should receive a positive recommendation, but there is one thing that hurts the game badly: too much useless scenarios. Too much walking that could be cut in half, too much useless ""do this"", ""do that"" and missions that doesn't make sense. Beyond the acceptable. I could've spent half the time and still had the same fun.Sadly, this makes me want to give this game a negative recommendation. Still, I would recommend for RPG lovers.6/10			"

												If you are purchasing this for the original 3 games that were on the Apple IIe and Commedore 64, Don't purchase the game. Though the game is fun for the first 15 minutes. It locks up every fifteen minutes and you lose all progress from the last save. You find yourself not wanting to go adventure because you have to stay near the adventurer guild to save. Very disappointing since I really bought this game for the original games and nostalgia.  I will try play the Bards Tale IV just to see what that is like, but that is not the reason I bough it. So for now... I don't recommend the game, especially since i doubt they will debug a 1984 game.			"

												I could only stomach a few bites of this turd sandwich. It's supposed to be a humour based parody action RPG and it badly fails at being all of those things. The writing and humour is so bad you'll be cringing hard. RPG elements are so light they're almost nonexistant, and the combat/encounter design/level design are all absolutely terrible. The longer you play the worse it gets. It sucks, and Brian Fargo should be ashamed.Edit to add that if you like this game you have bad taste and are probably a bad person. Think about it: You enjoy playing abysmal games and have a terrible sense of humor. Admit your folly, uninstall this garbage, renounce Fargo and his deformed Bards Tale baby and go play a game more worthy of a humans attention.			"

												Personal Rating: 0 of 10I do understand that this is a very old game, looking at the dated graphics. We shall begin with the pros.- This game has fully voiced dialogue- Hilarious songs and dialogues (not your usual lame jokes)And this is as much I can say for this game. The main reason for the low rating is mainly due to constant framerate drop (not entirely sure but the dialogue does not follow the subtitle) to the state where everything is in slow motion. Few reasons I could think of:- Game does not support Windows 10- Outdated engine- Not compatible with ATi Radeon Graphics Card(I have a decent machine that can run Battlefield 4 on Highest Setting)And since this is a quite old game there are a few things you need to know before buying/playing too:- Hit boxes are horrible (the sword clearly swings right pass the crate but it did not break)- Voice dialogue are recorded poorly (sometimes it gets soft slightly)- Controls are awkward because keyboard movement does not work sometimes (other actions are fine just WSAD)And there is as far as I can comment too.

												In my eyes this is a game you play primarily for the dialog and plot: the game is VERY funny and well written. The problem is that the gameplay isn't up to par. While it's not really bad it's basically a sloppy Diablo clone taking in aspects of typical WRPG traits while overall not executing it well. I did enjoy my time with it but don't expect to be blown away by its game design.			"

												I was expecting an update of the old dungeon-crawl series. I was very disappointed. This has absolutely nothing to do with the games that it is named after. That's not to say that it's a bad game, but I wish they had named it something else.This is a 2D isometric view hack and slash, and you learn summoning magic instead of actually picking up companions. Or I didn't play the game long enough to pick up my first companion.Bard's Tale is just okay. I bet it gets better as you go (I've seen videos that look like a really fun game), but I just don't have the will to sit through the fart jokes and rat-killing.			"

What is killing it for me is the clunky combat controls. All in all its a very generic hack and slash trying to pass itself off as clever.

												These are the actual, old-school bards tale games.  I have no idea why this ia 4 gig install.  If you have nostalga for them, then I guess you should buy it.  I thought they were enahcned somehow, as in these were a remake of the bards tale games.  But no, they are the actual orginals.  As much as I like adventure games, I can't deal with the bad UI. (I am not talking about graphics here).  For example in combat to cast a mage spell, I need to type out the code for the mage spell I want to cast.  One additional problem is, I have NO IDEA what spells my mage even knows.  There is no way to tell as far as I know.  Then combat:  You can face 4 stacks of 99 monsters each.  On round one you need to give orders to your party, each member.  You might do 10 hp to 1 monsters in rank 1, out of 99 total.  Then you go to round 2 and you give orders to your party again, and manage to kill 1 monster, then repeat like 600 times and you fnish the encounter.I didn't get very far, I just couldn't take it.  Maybe back in the day when this was the ONLY choice, but not today.			"

												Bard’s Tale is an action ARPG that takes everything good about the games it’s copying, Diablo 2 and Baldur's Gate, and ruins it. For starters the controls and gameplay make it feel like you’re fighting in water. The combat is clunky and slow and it’s nowhere near as fluid as Diablo 2 is. The other thing I couldn’t stand about this game is the humor, beneath the seemingly clever satire of ARPGs is tasteless “lol boobies” and “cursing is so cool” jokes that only middle schoolers enjoy. I couldn’t stand to play more than half an hour of this game, good thing I got it in a Humble Bundle otherwise I’d be mad.			"

												Wow.  I'll admit, I only made it through 6 minutes of this game.  But honestly, it only took me 6 minutes to be completely offended by the painfully blatant sexism rampant in everything about the story.  First, I wasn't allowed to make my character female.  Ok fine, I recognize that sometimes it doesn't make sense to replace the gender of the character.  However, once we meet the female characters, every single one is in skimpy clothes, often with clothes that defy the laws of physics.  As soon as I made it into the inn and we got a close-up screen shot of the clevage of the widow mary whatever as she was giggling while asking me to do a job for her, I couldn't take it.  There's bad, and then there's bad.  Whatever 12 year old boy wrote this needs to grow up and realize that female gamers exist and we have better things to do than be treated like useless objects.

HOWEVER...you may use cheats, like I do :-)i simply don´t have time to deal with dying over and over, and thus want to go through the story, cause it´s really funny!yeah! the dialogues are hilarious, the jokes are (mostly) intelligent, and the satire is obvious. that´s something I really love about the bard. the pointless quest of neverending saving of a princess is wonderful when served like this. the story is a big motivation for me to go on. and the bard himself is just a selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, who just wants to reproduce and drink. whis is totally ok with me :-)+ story+ dialogues (fun satire)+ songs+ the hero+ the narrator- repetitive gameplay- backtracking- frustrating health-recovery system- poor weapon variety- hard overall difficulty			"

												- No summoner kicks here. Only summoning here is the will to change the title to ""The BAD Tale""- Awful RPG, only hack and slash adventure here is to your wallet and time.- Falling in mud combat systems.- If you find the jokes in it funny, I recommend spending some time with actual british wit and humour.

												Unfortunately I wasn't able to actually play this game.  I was really excited for it since I've read so many great things about it.  However, I run Ubuntu on my pc and there is evidently a graphics bug in the Linux version of this game.  Several people in the community hub complained about the same problem starting in at least Feb 2016, so I doubt the developer is making any attempt to correct the issue.....and so, I can't recommend this to anyone.

												This might be humorous to the <12 crowd.  To me it was inane and insultingly stupid.   No character progression.  Story lacks motive or interest.  The only challenge is fending off boredom as the repetitive click & wait combat grinds inevitably towards completion.  The game is horribly prolonged by long boring combat that simply takes a long time with no risk or challenge.  Levels are 1-track railroads.  No significant puzzle element.  No relationship at all to the original Bard's Tale series.  I don't understand why this has any positive reviews. Literally one of the worst games on steam.  Don't even buy it on sale.			"

												This is the one game I would instantly recommend to any fans of Monty Python-style humor. Not only are the priorities of our hero at odds with the fulfillment of his tasks, he also happens to blindly run into any obvious trap with such style and conviction any British gentleman would be proud of.Take the hero's first task, which is the obligatory rat extermination in a cellar, only accepted by the Bard due to the quest giver's well-shaped bosom. When the invincible, 6 feet tall fire breathing rat inevitably forces you to retreat, the game's narrator dryly and in a classy voice comments: ""and so, our hero turned tail and began running up the stairs, all the while screaming 'I'm on fire!'"".

												The bard's tale is an enjoyable experience made by people that obviously had a lot of fun making the game. The game features silly humor and could be interpreted as a parody on the whole rpg genre. The story is as cliched as you could possibly imagine wich works well with the whole parody thing. Combat and stats are very simpel but good, and there is a big arsenal of weapons and spells that summons allies with cool abilities.There is a few negative things about the game. One thing is that you can only save when you are at a savestation, which would be okay if there were more stations. There exist a graphical bugg that causes the game to run in slowmotion whenever a certain rain effect is used. It could also have been shorter by reducing the amounts of enemies.Overall the bard's tale is a good and memorable game: 4/5 "

												A pretty good game; if you've ever played any of the Dark Alliance games, this is in the same game engine and follows the Dungeons and Dragons stat system (stats maxed at 20, etc.). The best things about the game are the writing (which is hilarious), the Bard himself (also hilarious), and the battle system. While not deviating heavily from the DA games, combat is heavily reliant on summoned monsters; if you try to go into any situations alone you'll get murdered. Overall, I definantly say it's worth a purchase, especially if you can nab it on sale for 5-10 dollars. The game is pretty short (I'm not 100 percenting, and I'm nearly at the end, with about eleven hours played) but has a ton of places to explore and a whole chapter that is optional (and awesome!)

This title should only be gotten by those with a sense of humor, and if it weren't for the combat this would be a gem. Keep in mind, though, that this old game suffers from the ""Seinfeld syndrome"", in that the type of humor it provides was original and groundbreaking at its time, but nowadays so many other games have tried out its methods that its no longer as funny (still funny, mind - just not as it once was).

												The humor in this game is a driving factor for why I play. It may be dated but the ease in which the story unfolds is akin to being sprawled out on a sofa next to a fire. It is an omage to simpler times in a modern package. The combat, however, doesn't suit the game type. What has historically been a multiplayer genre (pen and paper RPG) is now a single player experience with no ability for co-op fun. This alone hurts this game and ultimately prevents it from reaching 'Classic' status. Worth your money? Yes. Could it be better? Yes.			"

Play a Han Solo-esque adventurer more interested in coin and cleavage than saving the world and end up saving the world anyway. Positive and negative dialog options shape the outcome of situations (and positive isn't always necessarily better). Summon beings to fight by your side and find some great weapons including a guitar axe at some point. It was an excellent adventure that I will be replaying again eventually.Available on Linux now with Dualshock 4 support. Would recommend.9/10			"

There are so many single moments in this game I bloody loved, but I won't spoil it for you. If you're concerned about the graphics (it's still a 2004 game), you should absolutely look past the aesthetics and do yourself a favour playing this. You won't regret it.It even comes with the original 3 games, developed for Apple II. Absolutely amazing.			"

												This game is filled with humor. The Bard is vibrant and brought to life through banter with the narrator and other characters in the game. The character skills and attributes are similar to diablo 1, you can sort of choose how you want to play, as a tank, as an archer and some magic but in the end it comes down to being a tank. Unlike Diablo 1 it is not a game to be taken seriously, there are jokes and clever come backs around every corner. It took me about 20 hours to complete the game, there are a couple of things I missed but I don't really want to play through again to find them.The bad things about the game are that it is an older game, the models are pretty low quality (you can't really zoom in on some of the characters ;), the engine doesn't ""do"" 1080 -that is you can see creatures freeze/activate in the corners of the screen on a larger monitor (lets you have a 1080 screen though), the game mechanics are basic and some things are missing (you can't buy everything you need (magic crystals for healing) to prepare for the final boss, no fast travel, you can't give advanced orders to your followers like tell one to stay back and heal -the healer always runs into the middle of things and gets killed).I enjoyed this game and would recommend it to others!

I'm sure I would have had much more to say but it's been too long now for me to recall all the finer details.			"

												So if Mel Brooks' version of Robin Hood went rogue... oh but then again he was a rogue.  Let me start over.   If the Dread Pirate Roberts were a scoundrel... oh dear.  OK If the surgeon from SAW were a roguish scoundrel, then the movie would be called The Bard's Tale and instead of blood and guts, the would be full of jokes, japes, puns, wierd creatures, random lunatics, a cranky narrator, and a healthy dose of skin.  And Cary Elwes.  How can you lose?			"

												This is the one game I would instantly recommend to any fans of Monty Python-style humor. Not only are the priorities of our hero at odds with the fulfillment of his tasks, he also happens to blindly run into any obvious trap with such style and conviction any British gentleman would be proud of.Take the hero's first task, which is the obligatory rat extermination in a cellar, only accepted by the Bard due to the quest giver's well-shaped bosom. When the invincible, 6 feet tall fire breathing rat inevitably forces you to retreat, the game's narrator dryly and in a classy voice comments: ""and so, our hero turned tail and began running up the stairs, all the while screaming 'I'm on fire!'"".

												This game sat dormant in my library for some time, as I assumed my craptop wouldn't be able to run it. However, to my surprise it runs beautifully. And now I regret that I didn't start playing it sooner, as it is one of the most funny and fun games I have played in a while. I haven't been able to put it down.I have enjoyed the gameplay. I'm a fan of the action RPG type genre, and this fits that bill. The best part of the game is the humor. I find myself laughing at the dialogue, and the god-awful singing! Stitches.I look forward to playing the rest of this game, and hope the remainder of the chapters are just as enjoyable as the first!			"

So does ""The Bard's Tale""! It's an awesome RPG, even if doesn't have high graphics! I really like the storyline of this game and I like that you can choose which side to be on, what you can say in the NPC Chat, and other cool stuff. I really like and recommend this game !!!			"

												Oldschool RPG game. The Bard can be trained in any kind of weaponry, however his strongest ability is playing songs to summon mercenaries (pets) who dish out damage, tank or heal.Mixed with a classic comedy, as the narrator actually insult the Bard whenever you play. Likewise the Bard often argue with the narrator ending with some epic moments! :D			"

												The humor in this game is a driving factor for why I play. It may be dated but the ease in which the story unfolds is akin to being sprawled out on a sofa next to a fire. It is an omage to simpler times in a modern package. The combat, however, doesn't suit the game type. What has historically been a multiplayer genre (pen and paper RPG) is now a single player experience with no ability for co-op fun. This alone hurts this game and ultimately prevents it from reaching 'Classic' status. Worth your money? Yes. Could it be better? Yes.			"

I don't know how much the new game relates to the original, but it was quite enjoyable.  The player controls a roguish bard who learns to summon allies.  The dialogue is funny and worth playing different ways just to see the different reactions.  Very good action rpg.			"

												A highly underrated classic from the PS2/Xbox Era of gaming, The Bard's Tale offers challenging combat along with hilarious dialogue that will keep you lauging through out the entire quest for Coin, Clevage and Song. The Combat system is fairly similar to what's seen in the Fable games and offers many different ways to dispose of various threats to The Bard, you can chose to use a Sword and Shield for a balance of attack and defense, dual weilding to increase your Damage output or Two Handed for similar results. Or you can use a Flail to execute an unblockable attack, or you can summon allies through various songs you'll find through out the land and have them take care of your light work.The Songs that play through out the game are not only hilarious but also very catchy, you'll no doubt find yourself singing at least one of them at some point after playing. Though there isn't much in the way of background music, the amusing and witty banter between the Narrator (Voiced by the late and Great Tony Jay) and The Bard (Voiced by Cary Elwes) is more than enough to make up for it. The humor is enhanced more if you're familiar with the various scottish folklore that inspired many of the monsters you encounter through out the game,Graphic wise The Bard's Tale sports standard PS2/Xbox quality while not the most spectacular graphics by today's standards, at the time of the game's release they're not hard on the eyes either. All in all I recomend playing through this game at least once, I guarantee you'll end up laughing out loud numerous  times.This version also comes with the original Bard's Tale games so you can experience  the classic games in addition to this one.

												The bards tale is a action comedy rpg, and the spiritual successor to the old school ""bards tale"" games.The story of the game is as sterotypical as it gets. A princess is trapped in the top of the dark druid tower, and sealed there by an evil mage. Your task as the bard is to rescue her. However, the story is much more interesting than it sounds, as the game actively takes pokes at the sterotypical plot points of fairy tales and will take every chance it gets to mock the main character. From the main motivation of the character being the furthest thing from noble, to the many dead ""chosen ones"" who litter your path and who die pointlessly. The main gameplay is murdering dozens of enemies at a time with one of five types of weaponry. Two handed weapons, bows, sword and shield, sword and dirk, and flail and shield. Its really up to your tastes as to which one you use, personally i preferred the two handed weapon as it had the greatest damage. Then there are your summons, minions that follow you around and help you in battle. Each summon is drastically different from each other and serves a specific purpose, however, you can only summon one at the beginning, but you can upgrade to 4 slots by the end of the game. Typically, you need to carefully plan which summons you want to have out before going into any encounter, especially later on in the game when they can potentially deal more damage than you.The game does not look pretty, it has no really unique looking characters aside for one or two exceptions and the soundtrack is pretty bare bones save for the few times you actually get to hear characters sing. These rare moments are the best part of the game, and had me laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off every time they came up. They are pretty spaced out, but if there were any more, it would be very annoying. It does have quite a few flaws though, the combat normally devolves into a button masher where fights can often be decided by how often the enemy randomly blocks and whether the AI decides to crowd around your character or just go after your summons. Though, it doesn't matter if your summons die, just that if you die, then the game is over. This can often result in you just running around in a circle while you resummon all of your minions, which is really dull. The boss battles in particular are extremely dull, since you can literally just sit back and let your summons do the work while occasionally shooting an arrow in there. The gameplay gets pretty repetitive after a few hours, by that point, the only real draw of the game is the comedy, which is pretty good, but its difficult to sell this game on that aspect alone. This game also had a very bad glitch of sorts as well, when i played it, i found the game extremely slow, and after getting stuck on a bit, i looked up a playthrough and saw how fast it was compared to mine. So i had to install an external mod that forced the game into windowed mode in order to restore the game to full speed. This was after i was an entire five hours into the game...Bards tale is a decent, simple action rpg, but lacks any elements that make it genuinely fun to play aside from the comedy. I would recommend giving this game a try or looking up a video before buying this to see if you would enjoy the jokes in this before buying, because unless it gets a laugh out of you, there is literally no point for you to play this.

												If you want a game with more insane plot twists than a rabbit has children, this game is for you.It's humor is hillarious, and it's a master at shattering the 4th wall, right next to deadpool if you're asking me.I don't know what else to say about this game.You'll travel across a contry that shares similarities with the scottish culture. I think...I'm not entirely sure about that though.Anyway. You will level up your character as you go, and you will gain the power to summon allies with a musical instrument, be it a lute or a harp.The story is well written, and some of it will come out in the words of a song with sing along lyrics if you're feeling up for a little karaoke ;)This is probably THE best hidden gem I've ever played.

												I have mixed feelings about this game. The humor is great but that is counter balanced by the extremely repetitious and monotonous combat sequences. The combat sequences tend toward simply trying to overwhelm you with large masses of critters which you have to slay with little help and then often have to repeat in the next area and this goes on again and again throughout the game.  If it weren't for the really great quirky humor in this game I would simply have stopped playing it at some point. The humor is so funny though that I went to cheat mode and just ran through the game until I completed it, doing combat when there was no other choice. To sum it up this is a game you will buy for the unique sense of humor and cut scene dialog, and not for the highly unbalanced combat.....			"

												I originally got this game for the PS2 and when I found it on Steam I literally jumped on it. One of my cousin recommended that I check this game out and so I hunted it down, able to find it in another state. As for the Steam Version it like the Hard Copy and I love that. It is enjoyable that I can play it on the computer when I am away from from my PS2. The Bard's Tale has a rich story with the Bard as the Hero (or just the only person dumb enough to take on the quest) keeping with the personality of a Bard. They are more than just merry singers entertaining for a few coin, they are also the ones that end up becoming fodder most the time. If you like a good story line in a game, with characters that make you laugh or ask yourself what you just witnessed then this is the type of game for you. Your choices in the game make for an interesting story.			"

												Kind of like an old school Bastion, and still very playable. Voice acting (for the main characters) is brilliant, while general sound design and music are very solid. Graphics are passable, especially for a fairly old game. Progression system is simple but allows you to customise your style of play a decent amount. There aren't too many items to be bought, which is a shame. Usually simply upgrading power and occasionally adding an elemental power. Runs very smoothly, no problems with the framerate. Keep in mind that this also comes with FOUR games, the entirety of the Bard series.			"

												As soon as I played the demo, years ago, I knew I had to buy it, and so I did.Even though I do not know why exactly I waited years to play it, I found this game to be absolutely brilliant, fullfilling all fun and sarcasm present in the demo, and delivering it in spades. There are so many single moments in this game I bloody loved, but I won't spoil it for you. If you're concerned about the graphics (it's still a 2004 game), you should absolutely look past the aesthetics and do yourself a favour playing this. You won't regret it.It even comes with the original 3 games, developed for Apple II. Absolutely amazing.			"

												This is a fun top down action rpg, in which you summon allies to help you (plays kind of like a variant of Diablo II, combat wise), though you play this game primarily for the humor, the songs and the fact you get the original Bard's Tale trilogy with it.			"

												Oldschool RPG game. The Bard can be trained in any kind of weaponry, however his strongest ability is playing songs to summon mercenaries (pets) who dish out damage, tank or heal.Mixed with a classic comedy, as the narrator actually insult the Bard whenever you play. Likewise the Bard often argue with the narrator ending with some epic moments! :D			"

												Ah poking fun at RPG and then still doing it. Saving that lovely buxommed girl expecting her to be.. eeeh well right then no spoilers. But in short this is about having  fun. It is a rather old game so well there are limits. But it is a fun time and has a lovely cynical tone to it.			"

												If you're a fan of old school RPGs...  This game has all you can handle and then some.  Not Just one game, but the original three Bard's Tale games from the mid 80s.  Not for those that need modern graphics, but a great set of dungeon crawls none-the-less.			"

												The Bard's Tale is a fairly linear ARPG with humor interspersed throughout the overall grind. Truthfully the game could have been cut in half level-wise and still retained all of its charm without all the unnecessary repetitive content (and boy does it get repetitive). Still forgivable in the grand scheme of things and a decent RPG in the end. The light-hearted python-esque mood really saves this game from a bad rating.			"

												Bought this for the Classic Trilogy. Bards Tale II keeps freezing after about 30 minutes of gameplay and is unrecoverable causing me to lose all progress. Makes it unplayable.			"

												Gameplay wise this is average hack and slash game. What sets it apart is amazing humor. If you are looking for serious RPG, look somewhere else. If you are looking to just have fun killing monsters and maybe laughing a little at silly jokes, then you are at right place.			"

												 Let's see here besides treasure beer and cleavage what more could someone ask for? Besides an Epic Tale of a Bard and a story with so much twists and turns it will have you playing though all the endings, with a sarcastic narrator and chars with a wick and sick humor all around this is a good game. Get it, so much to loot kill and buy You will have hours of gameplay you will love every moment of.Get it now!			"

												Kind of like an old school Bastion, and still very playable. Voice acting (for the main characters) is brilliant, while general sound design and music are very solid. Graphics are passable, especially for a fairly old game. Progression system is simple but allows you to customise your style of play a decent amount. There aren't too many items to be bought, which is a shame. Usually simply upgrading power and occasionally adding an elemental power. Runs very smoothly, no problems with the framerate. Keep in mind that this also comes with FOUR games, the entirety of the Bard series.			"

												So I played the original back in the day and yes this one is very, very different. Some people say it's unfunny but I disagree. For what it is the graphics are pretty nice and the story was worthy of a good comedic movie. It was also one of those games that took almost 10 years for the graphics cards and drivers to catch up and make the game playable. Overall a very simple game you can plow through in a matter of hours or couple of days.			"

												I first played this on the PS2 after playing Dark Alliance half expecting the cliche D&D adventure game, which is basically is with quite a bit of humor. The Bard is selfish, he breaks the fourth wall, he's sarcastic. It's all quite good. Combat can be a bit repetitive but it never dulled my experience. Would recommend to any adventure RPG fans.			"

												It's all about the originals, The Bard's Tale I is a classic, and though (for me anyway) there are some sound glitches, honestly it's as good as I remember.The new game is OK too, as some have mentioned the dialogue is witty and it's a solid game, though honestly I won't play it nearly as much as I will be revisiting the classics.  It's like a free newer game with 3 older ones you've been missing all these years.			"
