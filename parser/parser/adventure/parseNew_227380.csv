												In a nutshell: this release of Dragon's Lair is as perfect a version of the original laserdisc game from 1983 as you're likely ever to need, for better or worse.Here's some longer thoughts on the game...For anyone old enough to have frequented arcades in 1983 you'll undoubtedly remember the stir Dragon's Lair caused when it was released.  I vividly recall seeing the local game with a second television monitor mounted atop the cabinet so that the crowds of people standing around could still see the game playing even from a distance, and when *anybody* made it to the end to face off with the dragon there's was a clamor of excitement.  That was 30 years ago.  Video games were so primitve back then that not only were characters limited in visual appeal and animation but gameplay too was barely more than a joystick moving in 4 directions and tapping a button.  In that context Dragon's Lair soared above the rest with its genuine cartoon animation and even the stilted mash-buttons-and-learn-patterns gameplay wasn't too off putting.  In 2013 however Dragon's Lair has little to offer anyone who didn't fall in love with the game back then.  The gameplay is only slightly more compelling than hitting the fast forward and skip buttons on your DVD player, and there's grade school fan fiction of King Arthur that's deeper than the plot put in motion here.  The animation is very competent and Princess Daphne is a riot of laughter with her breathless exclamations and anatomy that should be poking holes in her costume.  Thankfully there are options to make the game easier to play from on-screen prompts to just watching all the sequences play automatically... a much appreciated choice because it gets really tedious playing some sequences over and over because the timing isn't split-second accurate.  There are ""achievements"" for playing the game in arcade hard mode (no audio or visual prompts) but that's strictly for the masochistic.For the life of me I can't understand why the video files aren't in 1080p HD quality... it's 720p instead which makes me wonder if there's going to be yet another release somewhere down the line.  I also would have liked to get a proper freeze frame mode in order to do animation analysis, and for some reason I wasn't able to take any screengrabs while playing.  Very odd.  But, I did pay money for this and I definitely feel like I enjoyed my purchase.			"

												Back in '83 when this game first came out, we had a single arcade in our small city (that's not so small now) that had Dragon's Lair. Many of us fell in love with the game and a new challenge was present in our community arcade... to beat the dragon and save the princess. I dumped way too many quarter's into this game and came back late from lunch on more than one occassion. The owner of the arcade had installed a monitor above the machine so others could watch while you played. In time I had developed quite a few followers that I think figured I was most likely to complete the game. Some would even let me play ahead of them even though they had their quarters lined up. A couple of times other people even paid for me to play the game. One afternoon, it finally happened. Amidst a small crowd of people surrounding the machine I reached the Dragon's Lair. Of course I didn't beat it the first time, but I played again and much to the enjoyment of the crowd, I defeated the dragon and we all saw the end of the game. I was very proud to have been the first person in our city to have defeated the game.The next challenge of course was to defeat the game without dying. This challenge did not take very long at all.Of course, seeing the game on Steam meant I must purchase it for nostalgia's sake. Playing through it was not too difficult and for the most part I had no problem with the control response (I was surprised how many moves I remembered from all those years ago). I actually found the graphics to be very decent for this version.Their are two versions of the game, Arcade and Home. I've played the Arcade version but have not tried the Home version uet. There are also two difficulty settings; Easy and Hard. I think on Hard the timing of your moves just has to be more precise and easy is a little more forgiving on pressing keys at the wrong time. You can also turn the moves indicators on or off (move indicators are not the flashes that are built into the animation but arrows and a sword icon that appear when it is time to press a button), You can also turn the move accepted sound indicator on or off. So if you really want a challenge, put it on Hard, turn the move indicators off and turn the move accepted sound off and try and complete the game without dying. :)The game is all QTE (but it was the only way we were ever going to play an animated game 30 years ago.There is also a mode where you can just watch the game all the way through just like watching a Saturday morning cartoon.If you're a fan of cartoons or nostalgic for the game than I would say it is definitely worth the purchase. I know it was for me.			"

												Very good game, but a few things to keep in mind before buying this game:1. It's nothing but quick time events, so you're not really controlling where he goes, meaning no exploration2. This was originally an arcade game, so you can beat the game in half an hour3. There are different difficulties and the original arcade mode to play, so it has replayability.Don't buy the game if you want a long game to fill your time.Buy the game if you want a quick thing to play, and enjoy classic animations and arcade games			"

												Dragon's Lair is an arcade classic and I was a huge fan as a kid. In the era of Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, a video game cartoon was amazing to my young eyes. Nostalgia and a Steam sale compelled me to purchase the game and relive my childhood.  I enjoyed it for a bit. The game play is simple and sometimes frustrating, but that is how the classic game is played. Unfortunately, I don't consider this edition the definitive version of Dragon's Lair. I say this for several reasons:- Scenes do not seem remastered, unless they mean... - Animation is zoomed & cropped for widescreen (my biggest criticism).  - It may run in 720p, but the picture quality looks like an old VHS tape.- No native controller support or custom key bindings.- Doesn't work in Big Screen Mode - Imprecise button response for a game that requires precise input.- Simplistic user interface. Limited Options.    Never-the-less, Dragon's Lair has a special place in my gamer heart and I am not unhappy to have it in Steam. I just wish it was a better version.			"

												Dragon's Lair is a high definition port of a 1980s Arcade game featuring a brave knight on a journey to save his princess.I was a little tricked by this game, but maybe it was my fault. When I purchased Dragon's Lair, I thought it was HD remake, which perhaps provided extended gameplay or extra content, a fully fleshed out experience, based on the old 1980s Arcade game; but this is not the case, it is as advertised: the 1980s Arcade game.So, I just wanted to throw that out there in case anyone was wondering. Now, to the game. It's kind of fun, though a little repetative. The game design is essentially based around memorising a path to the princess, and getting timings just right (press Left/Right/Up/Down at precise moments or you die and restart at a checkpoint). This, back in the 80s, I'm sure was a genius idea for getting tonnes of quarters out of kids playing the Arcade machine, but as a game I don't need to plug money in to continue, it's just a little droll. I would recommend this game if you're looking for nostalgia. Maybe you played the game back in the day and never saw the end of it, or you were a Dragon's Lair champion and wanna relive your glory, you'll love it. But, if you're looking for a challenging and engaging title, with a story and interesting/creative gameplay, I would not recommend it.Nilesy			"

												Loved this game then (1983), love this game now.  This is the game that turned me from a pinball wizard into a RPG/ video game junkie. I even own the PC release they made way back before Steam even existed.  Simple enough game, unfortunately no joystick control.  A joystick would make this game easier in my opinion.  Controls are right, left, up, down, and space bar for sword (which was a button on the arcade console).  Seems easy, but it is not.  The gamer has to pay attention to the cues on when and in which direction to move then do so on time.  From years of playing here is a hint: the scenes play first either to the right or left then in the opposite direction later in the game.  It can seem tedious I suppose, but I guess that is half the fun.  Really can you go the distance, all the way to the dragon's lair without losing track of which side (right or left) one played or losing all your lives.  Also if I remember correctly the Black Knight and the Lizard King are basically bosses somewhere about a third and three fourths of the way through the game. For me this is an absolutely must own game and I wish I had found it sooner on Steam.       Best features for me in this game: is instant replay from where one left off without inserting more quarters and a full playthrough without interaction (like watching a movie).			"

												A victim of its own success.Since its modest beginnings back in 1972 with Pong, video gaming has grown in leaps and bounds, especially since the release of the Atari 2600 in 1977. Since then, the demand for better graphics and sounds has exponentially increase from year to year. Now (then) at 1983, we witness a game that can rival any animation screening with both quality sounds and graphics. This game, Dragon’s Lair is a marvel to behold as it shows us how far video gaming has gone in its short history (using the baseline of 1977). As much the game is a total mind blowing exercise, the core gameplay is where it fell down as it’s a lot better viewing the game than actually playing it. However someone has to play it to view it – quite ironic to say the least.Dragon’s Lair can be completed within about thirty minutes or so. Once completed its game over however there’s a good chance that you’ll be playing the same sequence more than once during a play through. I remember going through that elevator stage three times and visited the rapids twice in one play through. Yet, as mentioned before, it’s a game where it is best viewed (like an animated flick) as opposed to playing it. However someone has to play it so we can view its glory. Also the QTE takes away from viewing the game as you will be concentrating more on what symbol comes up next, unless you memorised all the events. That said, it’s a victim of its own success as great visuals comes with a great loss; and that loss is gameplay. Still it’s a terrific game nevertheless thanks to the laserdisc technology.Full review: http://www.gamespot.com/dragons-lair-1980s/user-reviews/2200-12697053/8 / 10			"

												The memories... the nostalgia factor... how many quarters did I lose at the arcade playing this beast of a game?!?! Way too many allowances worth (and my brother's allowance as well!). Oops, that's me showing my age!Ah to heck with it! I was first introduced to it in 1987 when I was 5 years old, and remembering thinking ""This looks kinda like the Secret of NIMH o_O!"", and little did I know at the time that Don Bluth was behind this awesomeness!I was never very good at the game, I admit, but I loved playing it! I just had to see how far I could get, just to see what happens next! It's like an interactive movie, and is lots of fun! NEVER AGAIN SHALL A QUARTER BE LOST TO THIS GAME!! ...Though, there will be plenty of FAILs, and LoLs X3! Sorry, Dirk, I still suck after all these years!			"

												A faithful recreation of a early arcade classic that would eat so many quarters it was nearly impossible to finish on a 80s kid's budget. The animation in this game still looks amazing to this day, short of finding a working laser disc Dragons Lair (good luck with that) this is as good as it gets.  I would give negatives for the lack of steam overlay (this game is begging for screenshots) and trading cards etc. Bare bones but functional version of this classic gem, now please give us Thayers Quest. lol yea right.

												This game has a quite a few things of which I'm not particularly fond. At the same time, however, it presents me with just enough that I don't want all the bad to seemingly outweigh the good. So, I'm going to list all it's good qualities and it's faults intermingled together, to try and paint a better picture than a block of negative text would.- I don't like the menus. They're horrible and clunky, and I hate having to put my name in the high scores before it lets me leave. There are some horrendously bad scores in there that it forced me to input.- Don Bluth. Make of it what you will. (I see it as a positive)- The game doesn't go  fullscreen for me. Since it's eighty percent about the visuals, having to watch it in a small window sucked out some of the fun.- Gameplay is simple, almost to a fault. Sometimes it's boringly easy, (I'm looking at you Lizard King!), but other times it flows well and the motions make sense for what's happening on screen.- Sometimes you die for next to no reason. Maybe you pushed the button too late, or didn't realize you should be doing anything, and then sometimes the game just hates you.- Every time you die in arcade, you're dropped into a different, random event. It helps keep away monotony.- This is not true for home mode. Home mode not only forces you to repeat the same section repeatedly until you beat it, it makes you repeat old stages constantly. Avoid home mode!-This game is crazy hard. I don't even know why there are two difficulty settings, I can't tell the difference when I play. -Sometimes you can feel that ""Feed me your lunch money!"" vibe that the more gimmicky arcade games give off. It's easy to die and you only get five lives. Infinite continues though!-The blood boiling difficulty can be avoided (kind of) by using the motion guide feature. I'd suggest it on your first go through, unless you really hate yourself.-Daphne the princess' voice acting is terrible. Thankfully she doesn't talk a whole lot, but when she does, my ears bleed.As much as Dragon's Lair infuriates me, I can't bring myself to hate it. For all the frustration it's questionably timed movements and poor menus give me, it has an oddly charming appeal that makes me want to keep getting back on that mechanical horse and riding it straight into a wall.C+I'd recommend it, but only during a sale.Avoid entirely if you don't like quick time events!

												The game is a series of quick time events (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT or SPACE to use your sword) that progress an hilarious and smile-evoking nostalgia of 80s cartoons. Fail the QTE and you'll get to see an equally humorous death scene (though nothing gory, kids could play this without concern). The game takes about 30-40 minutes to complete but it's 40 minutes of entertainment that will make you smile at every second.The game is tough, with many of the QTEs offering little time to react, but if you're paying attention to the scene you'll be able to predict what to do as they're all rather fair. I grabbed this on sale for about 50% off and I definitely feel I got my money's worth. It's a fun little gem to have in your library, especially if you can fondly recall 80s style cartoons.			"

It's fast paced, fun to play and I love it. If you didn't grow up with it or don't have family members who grew up with it, it may be hard to get into, but I'd say give it a try and see what you think!

												This game is one big QTE marathon with a simple yet charming story.At first the animation style was strangely familiar to me until I realized that Don Bluth was the man behind this.(Insert Titan A.E. and Land Before Time childhood nostalgiagasms here.)The gameplay itself can get a bit annoying occasionally when it wants you to react with the reflexes of a fly, so you better learn the inputs of the electric knight room segment and the final boss ""fight"" if you want to spare yourself a handful of restarts, but aside that I can't say anything negative about it.If you're a gamer of history or just a general appreciator of QTEs, you should totally give it a go.(10 euros are a bit much for it though, imho, as the game does not have that much of a replay value and even during ONE playthrough the player gets to go through mirrored versions of level segments.)

												One of the most fun classic arcade games I've played. It's actually more of an interactive cartoon, but definitely has a certain replayability with the ever changing randomised order of rooms and the QTEs themselves.The game is full of QTEs {quick time events}, you don't really get to do anything else than to wait for QTEs, as in you're presented an option with a time limit and you will most likely die if you don't act quick enough. So I think it's safe to say there's constant action that requires quite a bit of hand-eye coordination in this one. It can be frustrating and very hard at times but if you don't mind the QTEs, fun is guaranteed.The most important factor that got me into the game was the beautifully hand-drawn visuals and animation quality, not to mention the main character ""Dirk"" sounding like Homer Simpson. This is what they call a FMV {full motion video} game and they don't do good stuff like these anymore. Definitely a gem of a game worth trying.			"

												In the mid-eighties, my Mom would drop me off at the arcade while she went shopping, and I'd just hang around and watch older kids play this game.  Back then, in the arcades where I grew up, teenagers would put ashtrays on arcade machines and smoke while guiding Dirk through the castle's myriad traps and hazards.  I'd be entranced.  This is the game that got me into gaming.If you have a strong sense of nostalgia for Dragon's Lair and other laserdisc games, then you want buy this.  It's a perfect translation of the arcade original, and I'm glad I lived long enough to see it.  I never had enough quarters as a kid to beat it, but now I've been able to earn the Lair King achievement, a challenge I've always wanted to master.If you're new to this game, then it might be a tough sell.  The gameplay isn't very engrossing: press a direction or the sword button at the right time to progress through the game, but if you appreciate the look and sound, then you'll enjoy playing.  For that matter, if you're into animation and/or you know who Don Bluth is, then you should check this game out.			"

												To be honest, I haven't heard of Dragon's Lair, until I saw the Nostalgia Critic's review of it. But I grew up, watching Don Bluth films, like The Land Before Time and All Dogs Go To Heaven, so I'm definitely familiar with Don Bluth. And I have a lot of fun, playing Dragon's Lair, because it makes me feel like I'm in a Don Bluth movie, and I've always been a fan of action, adventure, and fantasy, which Don Bluth has always been awesome at making movies with. The characters are awesome, too. It's very fun, playing as Dirk the Daring, fighting monsters with a sword, and saving the beautiful Princess Daphne from the dragon. I'm also glad this remastered version of the game has the option to have arrows to guide you through, because the flashing light that tells you what to do doesn't always show up, like in Dragon's Lair II. But this game is another classic revived by Steam. And I'm super excited to see a Dragon's Lair movie by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman! Finally, after all these years, Don Bluth will return to animation to make this movie!			"

												Actually quite fun. I lol'ed a little at some of the deaths too. I would recomend this game, its fun. But it is a game that requires only the arrow keys and spacebar. Now for those of you who think this is like a game where you can conrol your character, sorry m8 but it aint. You dont actually get to conrol him just make the right moves and choose which way he goes. But the main reason i recommend this game is becuase its very relaxing. Its not a high stress CSGO tkae it or leave it. Its a calming action packed game, where you let the animations conrol your guy. How can i put this; Its like watching a movie that your controling, about a Knight named ""Dirk"" who has to make it through a deadly castle and save the princess. Another pro: This game only took me 34 mins to beat, which is great becuase that means you can Download, play, refund. In that order. Sounds like a win win to me :)And TBH there isnt many cons if your not picky about old games. This game came out in 1983.  I remember playing it in 2004, was top of the line then.Thats all for my review. Thanks all for readin.			"

												I just don't think I have the words to tell you how truly amazing this game is.  I was always a fan of the Disney movies growing up and when I found out that Don and his Amazing Animators were going to take a stab and making a video game...well...lets just say I had to check it out for myself....but where?????? Where else, but Showbiz Pizza and low and behold there it was crowds all around daring to take their turn in the crazy castle in hopes of treasure and one very hot babe.  I like the other snooks took my kicks but eventually figured out the correct sequences to actually beat the game.If I told you this game was worth it, would you listen?  The graphics have been redone to make it look absolutely amazing, and the various modes make it so you can play and try your hand yourself or simply just sit back and watch Dirk do his digs.I recommend this game to anyone that like myself, dig the nostalgia and wants to relive some AWESOME memories.CHEERS!

												Basically it's an interactive disney-themed animated short brought back from the dead but that doesn't mean it's bad by any means.The game is split into zones and the game saves after each one is completed successfully. In these zones you fight off bizarre-looking creatures, navigate traps, avoid falling debris, but above everything.. die a lot. Each zone has about 5-10 QTE's and you will rarely get through one without failing a few times. The QTE's are punishingly fast (on hard difficulty) but not overly frustrating as the humorous death scenes make you laugh and the directional cues don't change so you can be ready next time around. Unfortunately not every zone is unique; there are some where they have just flipped the cues of an old one.Even though the game only lasted me about 30 minutes and that's with failures, it was entertaining and funny. That being said I don't know if it is worth the price (think I got it one sale).			"

												The first time you play it is vital that you turn off the move guide for the full challange of the game. half the game is just figuring out what the proper command is based on the screen. And often you have to pay close attention to figure out exactly what to do. Having the move guide on ruins this by simply telling you what button you're supposed to press. It's still somewhat fun with the move guide turned on but it really ruins the full experience.			"

I'd recomend it if you're into QTE up to ying yang, because that's all this game is gameplay-wise.Bonus points if you like Don Bluth films!			"

												I really enjoyed this game. I have been a fan of Dragon's Lair since I saw the TV series and the animation in this game is done by the legendary Don Bluth, it doesn't have his story to it, which makes sense considering such a old game it would be hard to put anything as deep and thoughtful as, say, Secret of Nihm.The gameplay is basically from the birth of QTEs, but even if you failed the animation was always nice to see and it's sometimes quite comical how Dirk can die from a simple trip to being eaten alive by something. If you're a fan you'll have a lot of fun with this, however I can't really say much to be honest as i've already described what the entire gameplay is. If you're searching for something with a real deep and epic story I would give this a miss, but if you are interested in in QTE gameplay with wonderful art which is enjoyable, even in it's frustraition then I suggest you pick this up.

												The video quality itself: The Hi-Res video re-master is great, they didnt cut or shred the image at all. The controls are perfect, it plays just like the original, the game-timing and difficulty has been set properly.Only downside is...and its kinda a biggy, there are MANY missing scenes from the original game. I know because i worship the vore in this game :P It makes this game NOT worth buying, im a little pissy about this and here is why: about 30% of the games rooms and video...IS MISSING!, which is all of the rooms containing monsters which eat you if you fail to respond in time, and ALL of these rooms have been taken out of the game to make it sellable to a wider Age-Range of customers....very very lame.The mobile phone version is broken, this version is missing tonnes of the games original content, will this game ever be sold on PC without being tampered with? One day......one day. Only way to play the FULL, WORKING game right now is by emulator...and not legally.The remaining amount of content after that huge chop of missing content makes the game far more repetitious as you keep coming across the same scenes over and over again, only they are flipped horizontal (LAME!!!!!!!!)i DO recommend this game, but if you want the Original game, just keep in mind that this version is missing a lot of content from it. I'd definitely only grab it on a steam-sale. Less than $10			"

I played it once thus far, died a few times, but surprised that I remembered almost all of the moves that I finished the game as well.If you are an arcade child of the 80's and remember this game, it is fun to kill time. I would LOVE to see Dragon's Lair 3D on steam! All in all, great for nostalgia reasons, but I don't know if younger generations would or could appreciate this timeless classic.For what it's worth, you can even just watch the actual game without having to play it. How cool is that!			"

												Holy Toleeedo this is wonderful!  Beautifully remastered, fun as hell to play and watch.  Plays nearly perfect on my PC.  I LOVE IT!  Thank you Digital Leisure!  With that said, this isn't everyone's bag of bones & nostalgia.  But for me it's nostalgia overload.  I used to just watch people play it in the arcade and only a few time paid my quarter (only to lose before the first few scenes).  The game was aluring, but ominus/intimidating to my younger self.  If the guide icons were available at the time I probablty would have played it to completion eventually, using a LOT of quarters.  As an adult, I won't use the guide icons but I will play the ""Home"" version since I think each scene should be conquered to get to the next.   It's much funner that way when quarters aren't required.  This is the version to get if you ask me.  I've owned several, Amiga and PC floppy, and PC CD.   Today, I also picked up DL2 and Space Ace.  Can't wait to play those too.   Wondeful!  Wonderful!!!!			"

Dragon features hgh quality animation sequences for your timely choices. It was probably the model to the now Telltale adventure games. Simply Follow the adventure as Dirk races against time to stop the nameless dragon and rescue Daphne. PROSA: Beautiful animation that holds up even todayB: Kids pick it up quick and have a ball C: Can set up a controller or simple keyboard use, not alot of buttons on this oneD: Along with Dragon's Lair 2 and Space Ace great classic 30 year fun.CONSA: Avoid the entire film on yahoo or what isthe point on playingB: Some systems have had issues with the game. So check the requirements.C: I am not sure if Adults will enjoy this more than kids, but a fun family adventure. OVERALLWell no one past 30 needs me to tell them about Dragon's Lair. I waited for this to be on sale and added it for the kids for 2 bucks. A steal.Dragon's Lair is cute animated click and move fun and one the kids will enjoy.			"

												I was lucky to see this game when it was launched at an arcede saloon way back in the 80's.In essence the game is very simple: in each sequence you have to input (with cursor keys and space) the correct actions to progress to the next scene and thats all... but if you fail you lose a life and you have a finite number of them..So, the real difficulty is ""remember and execute the right moves at the right time""; then, why I like the game so much even after all these years? The mechanics can be too easy (or too hard if you, like me, dont remember the right moves!!) but the characters, music, sounds and visual are a magnificient opera of the early age of digital computer gaming.It's the best interactive-cartoon-movie (and you can watch all the movie from the main menu!), an old classic which brings me memories the very first age of videogaming.

												As someone who feeds off of classic arcade games, Dragon's Lair was no exception. This innovative gem revolves around laserdisc technology and that you can play in conjunction to the cutscenes happening on screen. The concept for newcomers is a little trifling, but the controls are very basic. Use the directional keys (WASD or arrows) to move you knight in shining armor, Dirk, to avoid any hazard that occurs in the cutscenes. The one thing you need to be careful about is how you perform these inputs. A sound effect will give you the indication whether or not you made the right action. If you get a buzzing sound, Dirk will die in comedic fashion and you will have to start from the beginning of the cutscene. Three lives and it's game over. This game will require you to remember each of these cutscenes as they follow specific input patterns. One thing to take note of is the fact that this game has the habit of making you repeat certain scenes. It can get very obnoxius when you return to the same room for the third time, but at least by then you will have a pretty good sense and muscle memory of where to go. High scores can be saved and the game also features the option to play on a beginner mode such that the game will flash specific directions just in case you haven't gotten your footing quite yet and still need more practice. This game is not very long, but it will challenge you to keep playing until you get to the dragon's keep and save an unrealistically beautiful princess. For long-time arcade fans, this game is a must. For those looking for a challenge or just want to play something old school to pass the time, give this game a go.			"

They were laughing and screaming with glee even when they screwed up their next move.  This game originally graced arcade parlors back in 1982 and moved into the home arena in 1983.  This was top notch entertainment then and top notch entertainment now.  Warning:  If you have no rythim and can't memorize moves then move on LOL.  It also can be played in arcade mode at difficult level to interest those needing a challenge.			"

												Great, quirky game from the 80s. If you're into old school games or just bored and looking for some silly fun, definitely something to play through. Simple mechanics and a straight forward plot; slay the evil dragon and rescue the princess!			"

												Dragon's Lair is still Dragon's Lair - a game of often dubious visual cues coupled with split-second reactions. If you never liked it, this won't change your mind.But if you ever liked it, this is the version to get!It's beautiful!It has all the scenes (as far as I can tell) and they proceed as they did in the arcade with the input blips present and no stupid onscreen prompts to degrade it into a stupid QTE game.OR...they proceed like some previous home versions where you must finish a scene before starting another, with no input blips, and onscreen prompts.It's your choice! Toggle-able options. I remember those from the Atari 2600 days.It's also beautiful.			"

												Jacko Rating9/10The original Don Bluth masterpiece in all its former glory.  If you have not heard of this game then come out from under your rock and be treated to the best looking game by far back in the 80s & 90s.This arcade classic is identical to the original laser disk version I used to throw money into when it was the Show Piece of all the arcade gaming rooms across the globe and it brings back fond memories of a miss spent youth.This is not about gameplay but rather takes you on a little adventure that you watch whilst following directional cues on screen.If like me you are an old school gamer then you will not be dissapointed so just buy and add to your collection for the occasional trip down memory lane.  The youth of today will most likely not enjoy this and complain as they do about almost everything that isn't catered towards them but this game was not re released for kids, it is a collectors item for the real gamers who invented this gaming concept and supported it from the begining.Now please re release Space Ace so my old school Bluth collection is complete :) "

												While I enjoyed my time with the game, the gameplay itself (obviously no secret for a game released in 1983) is like any quick time event sequence in today's games. It's great to see game design hasn't progressed one bit, but this will only appeal to retro fans or Dragon's Lair fanatics. I'm in the former category and there is a lot to like here with multiple difficulties (and helper features) available, different sequences with Home and Arcade modes, and the animation still holds up very well. Unlimited continues does take some of the challenge out of the gameIf you are a Dragon's Lair fan, get it. This is an almost perfect reproduction. (Controller support?)If you are a retro gamer, get it. This is beautiful video gaming history.If you are a modern gamer, pass. There's nothing for you here.			"

												It's the father of all QTEs, and even though some later games did it better (Space Ace, Time Gal, Dragon's Lair II), this is the one that started it all.If you are a child of the 70s and 80s, and you played this game back then, you know the excitement that comes with beating it. You probably also know that it cost you more than $10 in 80s money to beat it in the arcades. At $10, this is probably a lot cheaper than what you spent back then!			"

												The classic cartoon qte available on Steam. In my opinion a beatifully done game, artistically speaking. This game was created by Don Bluth, the man behind cartoon classics like The Secret of Nimh and  An American Tale. Most younger players will become bored with this very quickly. It really shows how far games have progressed in 30 years. I would basically recommend this to gamer's age 35 and up. They will have more appreciation for this because of nostalgia. Even as awesome as it looks it was about 30 minutes for me to beat it and now I have recaptured part of my youth and moved back on to the first person shooters and teabagging that are so prevalent in todays gaming. For $3 or so I would definitely try this out myself because I love the art work. For the average modern day gamer I would tell you to pass. If you pay $5 or more I think the game really isn't worth it. It's more like watching a cartoon than really playing a game. You can also get this on Amazon for $5. If you still aren't sure you can test drive it on Amazon here http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Leisure-Inc-Dragons-Lair/dp/B006K4CG1Q/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1389500898&sr=8-2&keywords=dragons+lair I give it a no recommendation because it's rather short and there isn't much replayability. I will probably play this game once a year or so and that is simply from nostalgia. I think most kids today would not play it a second time.			"

												As a 1980's child, this fully-animated game is a work of art visually.  However, this game is very repetitive, as one could expect from a story game this old, and the key prompts you face are so quick you can barely keep track of the animations.  At the price of $10, this game is an absolute ripoff.  Only buy it for a couple bucks or less...it's not worth the price you pay for it just for a very, very short dose of nostalgia.			"

												Nostalgia, nostalgia, blah blah blah Showbiz Pizza when I was 7, holy crap so many of quarters, etc.Now that we've got that out of the way...I like this game and I'm not sure why, because it epitomizes nearly everything I dislike about modern gaming. Quicktime events? Check. Quarter-chewing continue button-mashing difficulty? Oh yeah. Unskippable cutscenes? Creepy hypersexualized damsel in distress whose primary mode of communication is breathy squeals accompanied by the presentation of her ample, barely-covered butt? Paging Princess Sideboob, your close-up awaits. Seriously, add DRM and forced multiplayer and it'd be a sweep.And yet...I had fun with it. Somehow QTE are less offensive when they're expected rather than jammed into what's supposed to be a completely different type of game. The art, as with pretty much everything Bluth ever put his hand to, is gorgeous. So is the character design (Princess Perkynips excepted, perhaps). Dirk the Daring is instantly painted as both stalwart and supremely doofy, setting the tone for the whole thing. And there's a great surge of satisfaction you get the first time you complete the game in a single run.That said, I'm fully aware this is nostalgia talking. If someone came out with a game like this today I'd be shouting. So if you're of sufficiently advanced age to have memories of Dragon's Lair going in, pick it up on sale and have a go. Pretty much anyone else will want to steer clear.			"

												I took a shoot at this game. And I missed, since it is really really bad in my opinion. This is even hardly a game, more like a set of animations connected loosely with QTE elements. Each area can connect to random other area/animation. To pass through you need to type LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN or SPACE. the indicators sometimes appear long enough, sometimes they barely flash before they are gone and you die. The also appear in top,bottom, left/right of the screen with poor visibility. The game is more of a chore to play and grows to irritate me quite fast. Also, even with flawless execution (which I highly doubt) animation transitions are bad, there is no fluid gameplay, all areas feel cut out of the whole thing and break immersion. Also sound as a whole is poor. Graphics are maybe not top notch but can be liked and are genearlly the only good part of this whole... expirience.			"

												I used to remember trying to play this game in the arcades back in the 80s.  It, along with Fire Fox, were the two big laser discs based games back at the time.  They were also more expensive per play than most games. I bought this mainly for nostalgia reasons and to see if I could finally get to the end, which I have never seen.  Well, it still plays like utter crap.  The game should be called ""Quick Time Lair"".  You have to hit the arrow keys or spacebar at PRECISELY the momement the game wants you to or else....POOF!  You're dead.  Moreoever, there are only a limited number of rooms/scenes to be encountered, and you will see most (if not all?) of them played one way, then show up later in a mirror image of moves that need to be done. Most unforgiveable is that the game is not remasted in full HD.   On my system, it only filled about 2/3 of the upper left of the screen, and playing it in a window did not help any either - the image stayed in the upper left portion of the window also.This game is hardly worth it, even on sale at $4.99,  So much for nostalgia....Save yourself some money and go here to view it all:

												Dragon's Lair, a 1980s Arcade game featuring a brave knight on a journey to save his princess. This game has it's pros and cons as any other game. I suppose if you're a big fan of arcade games, looking for some nostalgia from the 1980's, or simply just something short and fastpaced action/ adventure related then this is a game for you.If you on the contrary want an in-depth plot to your adventure then I'd be inclined to suggest you seek out another lair.Down below I'll try to mix the good with the bad, so you'll get an overal picture about the game.* The menus. From a former design student's point of view they look horrible. Then again, it's from the 1980's so I didn't expect much. What did annoy me a bit though was that the game started lagging while in the menus option. In addition I'm not terribly fond of the whole ""high scores are mandatory before you can play a new game""- thing. Though that's only if you decide to either quit the game in a fit of rage, or complete it. Otherwise you pretty much have infinite lives, and it doesn't take the game long to reload where you died the last time. (A feature I've grown to love about this game)* The gameplay is so simple it's almost boring at times, but it's made up for by the short reaction time you have in most scenes.  The animation flows well and the motions make sense for what's happening on screen most of the time. (Thinking of the princess monologue scene *cough* *cough*, something there doesn't sit right with me. I'll get back to that in a bit.)* Sometimes you die for next to no reason. Especially if you pushed the button (a fraction of a second) too late, or didn't realize you should be doing anything, and maybe pushed the wrong button in the ""crucial moment"" *Point's at myself*Apparantly the game has several modes you can play. I've only played home mode so far, and I found it to be overly repetative. The game forces you to repeat the same section repeatedly until you beat it, and makes you repeat old stages constantly. The only slight difference separating some scenes form others being that they are mirrored.This game is difficult. I've only played on easy mode so far, but I'm concerned for when I'll try hard mode, as I've died so many times in this game it's embarassing.- On a side note, I've seen a couple of reviews stating that the game does not work well with windows 8. That is not the case. I'm currently using windows 8 (or 8.1 to be exact), and the game has worked completely fine for me. If you try playing the game while your power option is checked to ""power saver"", then of course you'll have a problem playing it. If you set your computer to ""high performance"" and make sure that you don't have tons of other programs running at the same time, you shouldn't experience that much trouble.* Now to Daphne, the damsel in distress... I don't even know where to start. This is the thing that has bothered me the most about this game. First off the princess' voice acting is terrible. And I have to agree with Puppet_kamon on this: ""Thankfully she doesn't talk a whole lot, but when she does, my ears bleed."" Second is the oversexulisation. The princess' outfit looks like it's taken right out of a strippers' closet. In addition, her over-the-top, unnecessary posing and gestures, while she is explaining how you defeat the dragon seems very odd to me. It looks like she is, or was ment to say something entirely different than the lines coming out of her mouth. In the end I was left with the impression that the princess was more of an object to be desired and obtained, more than anything else. I also wondered why the creators didn't make time-apropriate clothing for Daphne, as the knight's clothes/ armor looks like it's from the early middle ages, and hers from an other century entirely. (I have lots more to say bout this, but I think I'll leave it as is.)* Animation-wise I have no complaint. I absolutely love most Don Bluth directed projects. The backgrounds are well made, and as stated before, the animation flows well. Otherwise I'd wish for a pause button in the game, as I'd like to view the surroundings a bit more.As much as Dragon's Lair grinds my gears, I can't bring myself to hate it. It's an overall good game for it's time, and was groundbreaking in terms of going from pixel based games to animated ones. I bought it on sale, at 50% off, a completely ok price for a game like this. Though I would not recommend this at it's intended price. 4/10 points.			"

												If you missed out on this experience back in the day, or are simply too young to of been around and are looking through some gaming history... gotta say you're not missing much here. What you likely already know about it, hencce why you're likely even looking at this, is more than enough experience with the game. This game is a monument to bad 80's arcade business practices to swindle kids out of their hard earned cash and nothing more. Most reviews being written by people going back for nostalgia tend to paint this game as something a bit better, but as someone who was born in '88, this was part of a game history I missed, so I bought it to check it out myself. As you most likely know, this is a ""game"" based on just being a very long QTE cutscene and nothing more. What you may not know is how finicky and unresponsive it is. Sometimes prompts show up too late and you die despite pushing the desired key at the right time, and sometimes it lingers with there only being a certin sweet spot in which it registers. I've redone rooms so many times simply because of late prompts or simple unresponsiveness.Now, if you're just here for some Don Bluth animation... then just watch it on youtube or something. The whole experience here is repeating the same two dozen rooms or so(think it's randomized from my two playthroughs) for about 20 minutes(depending on how much you die) all to save the most annoying and overly sexualized damsel in distress and then it's just done. It's a pretty short trip of nothing special even just by animation standards. But since it's coupled with atrocious ""gameplay"", it's definitely not worth the money or hassle.I bought this on sale for about $2.49 and that was still too much in my book. Full price you might as well just shoot yourself in the foot instead. Probably less frustrating, though maybe more painful. Physically anyway.3/10; because it does offer some replayability and has a nice frontend UI and extras where you can just watch the ""game"" without putting up with terrible input reads. Amazing.

												The thumbs-down is from the angle of someone looking at the game and being interested in buying it but has no previous experience with it.  If you don't know what you're getting into, the chances of you liking this are extremely small.  It's basically a 30 minute or so QTE.  You literally hit your arrow keys in the direction of the screen prompts, move onto the next scene, and repeat until you beat it.  It can also be incredibly frustrating, as the checkerboard black knight scene has prompts that seem to rely on a very small, and almost misleading, frame of input.  The last boss is a pain too, mainly because you're forced into a cutscene that features some of the goofiest video game voice acting ever every time you die, and you'll probably die a few times on it.  That scene is worth youtubing for Daphne's dialogue alone.The game does feature a theatre mode, where you can watch the game and enjoy the art without having to play it, which is nice since you'll likely being too clued in on looking for arrow prompts to appreciate the scene.  You can also turn off the annoying prompt indicator as well, which I'd suggest since its sound effect outweighs any good it'll do you.In short, if you're coming into this completely blind, you're better off waiting for a deep discount, otherwise you'll likely to be disappointed with what you'll play.

												The mother of quick-time-event gameplay.The entire gameplay consists of pressing the right key (up, down, left, right, sword) at the right moment, with fraction-of-second precision. This means the gameplay is essentially trial-and-error. Press the wrong key, or press a key at the wrong moment, and you lose a life. (Truth to be told, some scenes are more lenient and don't punish you for pressing too early.)I can imagine a kid in the 1980s or 1990s looking at this game at the arcade: ""Wow, this game looks incredible! I want to play it!"" Then the kid puts in some quarters and plays for no more than two minutes: ""Wow, this game sucks! I don't want to play it again!""During a single gameplay (in ""home mode""), there will be repeated scenes/rooms, which left me thinking if the game had any ending or if it would just repeat itself indefinitely. (In other words, a poor design choice by the developers.)Oh, and Daphne, a stereotypical over-sexualized damsel-in-distress. It serves as a reminder from the 1980s culture. ---+ Great animation, looks like a cartoon from 1980s.- The animations are usually short, sometimes less than a second or two.- Quick-time-event gameplay requiring very high accuracy.- No gamepad support.- No rebindable keys (although the hard-coded keys seem okay: WASD or arrows, and space).This is a good game for the historical value, for its place in video-games history, but the gameplay is boring and frustrating.

												I'm sure I was among the many that were excited to finally see this game as a playable title on the PC.  This was an arcade game from the 1980s that had something special to set it apart from the others:  The animation.  Don Bluth was the man most notably responsible for this, as he had worked with animated films for Walt Disney, and numerous ones outside of the Walt Disney company.  The gameplay is simple; it's all QTEs (quick time events).  There are other games where the gameplay solely revolves around QTEs, or a majority of the gameplay does.  I've played a few, and to be honest I enjoyed them.  So why can't I recommend this game?  It's due to the fact that despite the game having an easy difficulty setting, there are times when the QTEs feel broken.  They are barely on screen for half a second before disappearing.  So if you miss it or happen to press the wrong button, you die.  Sometimes you might even accidentally press a button.  The result?  You still die.  I personally feel that if you're going to include an easy and hard difficulty option, the easier one should be slightly more forgiving.  Otherwise, what's the point?  The home mode offers checkpoints after each room is cleared, allowing you to pick up right where you left off should you die.  However, take the the broken QTE timing on easy, and factor in the arcade mode where are there are no checkpoints... It's frustrating.  Sadly, not the good kind (I know, oxymoron) of frustrating either, where you want to keep playing.  It's a ""I feel cheated"" frustrating.  There is also the lack of controller support.  Which is something I find very strange for a game that was in the arcade. Nostalgia can only go so far, and had these two things not been issues I would've gladly gave it a thumbs up.			"

												This review is not for Dragon's Lair itself, which is one of the best games ever created and a true milestone in gaming history. This review is for this particular implementation. It worked the day it came out and was amazing, then it started going blank on half of the screen (which I was able to fix). Today it wont start up at all. I am on Windows 7 and have WMP 12 which is required to have this game run right. It still just never starts up. After reading on forums for a solution and seeing that one member (with a similar configuration to mine) was told ""we don't know why it wont work, feel free to ask Valve for a refund"" I'm writing this, very disappointed. What DL have done is shameful, shoddy and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't even use the videos from this game (which downloaded over a 5 hour period on ADSL) in Daphne rendering everything useless.Seeing how they handle their other games (including Braindead 13 which is iOS only and although I love that game I'm not about to buy an iPad for it) and factoring this into the situation, I am done with Digital Leisure. Yes my friends, they DO deliver when they promise the moon while taking your money. Unfortunately that just means they wave their naked♥♥♥♥♥at you as they laugh to the bank. Avoid.			"

												I have never seen a game more dependant on hard drive speed in my life.  Every scene in the game is a .wmv file that loads and plays for every action.  This means that while playing, the game is constantly accessing the HDD without any apparent pre-load into RAM.  This results in lag between the rather fast paced events that can cause you to lag on one scene until the file loads by which time you have almost no time to react to what you're seeing.  I've tested this both with my standard hard drive and a solid state drive on the same computer and it's clear that the hard drive is the primary bottleneck for this game.To be fair, the one in the arcade suffered from the same problems (or at least the one I played on) as it ran off a laserdisk, which was far worse to be honest, so the frustraitions I have carry from the original, but when I bought this I was really hoping to experience the game as it was meant to be rather than the way it was.

												While I don't recommend this for reasons I'll list below, I do recommend this for those who originally played it in the 80s - 90s when the Don Bluth games originally came out.  This was all nostalgia for me and after one play through I was satisfied and will most likely never pick it up again.  The graphics look decent and the sound is good, but it's the gameplay that lacks depth to keep you interested in dying a million times more.  Once you figure out the appropriate keys to press, if you didn't play it the easy way where the computer tells you what to press, then you'll find that this is a very short game.			"

												Yes - get this if you gamed in the 80's.  Quaint to the max.For people not familiar, it's basically a cartoon game with ""QuickTime events"".  You have to hit the right direction at the correct time to cue the correct solution to each ""room"".  The game then cues the video from your move making it look like one long movie.BUT! play it as it's meant to be played, go into Settings:BEEPS OFFMOVE GUIDE OFFThe beeps wouldn't be too bad since they feedback that you are actually doing something.. but they are completely annoying sounding.. they really should have made a beep sound effect that was in the world of the game.. instead it's this horrible lo-fi beep noise that is in your face; like a plain old square wave and completely raw soudning; it doesn't fit at all and ruins the immersion.It's a pretty short game, but it's difficult so that makes it long.  Without the guide move arrow you have to figure out which way to move or swing the sword. There are plenty of sequences built into the game that play if you do the wrong thing (some pretty funny). With the move arrow guide you never see these and the game becomes incredibly easy to beat (within an hour) and for $10 or even $5 on sale, that's not really worth it.  Back in the 80's you had to learn the sequences (i.e. LEFT, UP, UP, UP, SWORD not including timings) and tell them to your friends or if you were lucky you could find the sequences in a magazine. So you are better off not using them (guide arrows) - they are basically CHEATS.  Unless you are the kind of player who buys a game and goes right to the cheats, then by all means, go for it.  However, that said, the game is very punishing so you really have to put your timecapsule hat on and play it knowing this is how it was meant to be played (love it or leave it).In small doses it's fine though.  It's not a game meant to be played for hours anyhow.  You used to have to put in 50 cents into the machine and you'd get 3 lives.  So the game was tuned to maybe 10-15 mins of play at a time.. maybe 30 mins for people with money to burn and really wanted to figure it out.Also don't play the WATCH mode, otherwise it completely ruins the game and why would you even play it after seeing that?  Bad idea to have this in the game.I actually find the things they did to this game (beeps, arrows, watch mode) quite interesting and says volumes about how games are played today.  Back then games were so punishing, especially arcade games. Rewards were so fleeting and paltry.  These things that were added to this game completely break it, so if you want the REAL Dragon's Lair experience: turn off above mentioned settings, turn out the lights, and turn UP the volume (or use headphones).  This game had a very juicy eye/ear candy and tactile feel to it that created hoards of people lining up to play it in the arcades (back in the day). This game was a dramatic shift from the bleeps and bloops of the everyday 80's arcade games of it's time.			"

This game in a nutshell is QTE: The Video Game but you shouldn't shy away for that part of this game. This game is great for the hilarious deaths Dirk the Daring has and of course.... the Animation. I highly recommend this game if you're a big Animation fan or a fan of Don Bluth in general. Get it.... because Don Bluth :D.			"

												Dragon's Lair would be utterly forgettable and barely worth mentioning at all if it weren't for its lush animation and incredible visuals which were provided by Don Bluth and his studio. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and is satisfied just being a fun cartoon. Although the mechanics are as simplistic as it can get and eventually led to the more degenerate music rhythm genre, Dragon's Lair is even today still undeniably entertaining from start to end.			"

												One of Don Bluths masterpieces from the innovation this game brought to arcades in the early 90's to the amazing disney esc art style that this game is well known for. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's curious about the game as I was based on it's interesting simon says meets ddr gameplay or to arcade enthusiasts that are looking to add this game to their steam collection. Anyone else it's hard to say as the game is pretty fun but suffers from chopiness and repetitiveness after so long as the game tends to repeat itself after awhile.			"

												I bought this game even though I had no experience with the old arcade version. I'd heard of it as a classic of gaming though and it was five bucks at the time so I thought I'd give it a shot. I had no idea what to expect other than the reputation but I was suprised to learn that for a classic of gaming it consists entirely of something that the modern gaming community constantly complains about, which is quicktime events. Really the whole game can be completed with a total of four buttons. Don't get me wrong though. I don't really have a problem with this but it suprised me that the game has the reputation it does when so much of the ""hardcore"" community loves to pick fun at quicktime events and yet this ""classic of gaming"" consists entirely of that.If you're ok with that concept or if you're a fan of the original then there's really no problem here. I can understand the appeal even if it does seem strange by modern standards. If I was a kid with an unlimited supply of quarters I would have probably played the hell out of this just to see what happens next and watch the cartoon visuals unfold. Overall, recommended for fans of the original and people like me who are willing to spend a few bucks to get a look at gaming history. Otherwise you may be sorely disappointed.			"

												This was a GREAT game. It really reminds you of how appreciative we should be for the games that were made back then. Its extremely hard with TONS of challenges, its a quick game, but hard. Imagine being in the arcade playing this game, you would probably spend at least 50 dollars trying to complete this game. I completed it in 2 hours. I thought it was amazing.What you need for this game?-AGILITY-QUICK-TIMING-RIGHT-ON TIMING, NO WAITING-YOU SEE...YOU DO-IF THERES A SECOND CHANCE, TAKE IT!!Got all these things?Then get your fingers on the right keys and get ready for rapid finger exercises.Have fun!

												  I remember playing this in the arcade when I was a kid. It was a great game when it first came out, with excellent graphics (for the mid-eighties), a good storyline, and a very likeable hero. I wasn't very good at it then, and apparently I still am not, but getting killed is still very humorous. (Sorry Dirk.) Anyone old enough to remember this game should definately spend the couple of bucks for a quick trip back to their youth.			"

It's a pretty fun 1980s saturday morning cartoon game. NOTE: There is about 10-15 minutes of video and the game will take you about an hour to beat on easy. 8/10			"

												The pros and cons of Dragon's LairPros:+Visually stunning and revolutionary (for the time it was made).+Has an option to let you watch a full playthrough instead of actually having to play it.+Move guides dramatically improve performance.+Comedic.Cons:-Hard.-Not much of a difference between ""easy"" and ""hard"" difficulty.-No audio or video options.-It's basically just one big quick-time-event, so you won't like this game if you don't like those.-High score entry is manditory, even if you exit a game before you've beaten it.Most of the cons aren't that much of a problem, so I definitly recommend this game for anyone looking to buy it.

												Yes - get this if you gamed in the 80's.  Quaint to the max.For people not familiar, it's basically a cartoon game with ""QuickTime events"".  You have to hit the right direction at the correct time to cue the correct solution to each ""room"".  The game then cues the video from your move making it look like one long movie.BUT! play it as it's meant to be played, go into Settings:BEEPS OFFMOVE GUIDE OFFThe beeps wouldn't be too bad since they feedback that you are actually doing something.. but they are completely annoying sounding.. they really should have made a beep sound effect that was in the world of the game.. instead it's this horrible lo-fi beep noise that is in your face; like a plain old square wave and completely raw soudning; it doesn't fit at all and ruins the immersion.It's a pretty short game, but it's difficult so that makes it long.  Without the guide move arrow you have to figure out which way to move or swing the sword. There are plenty of sequences built into the game that play if you do the wrong thing (some pretty funny). With the move arrow guide you never see these and the game becomes incredibly easy to beat (within an hour) and for $10 or even $5 on sale, that's not really worth it.  Back in the 80's you had to learn the sequences (i.e. LEFT, UP, UP, UP, SWORD not including timings) and tell them to your friends or if you were lucky you could find the sequences in a magazine. So you are better off not using them (guide arrows) - they are basically CHEATS.  Unless you are the kind of player who buys a game and goes right to the cheats, then by all means, go for it.  However, that said, the game is very punishing so you really have to put your timecapsule hat on and play it knowing this is how it was meant to be played (love it or leave it).In small doses it's fine though.  It's not a game meant to be played for hours anyhow.  You used to have to put in 50 cents into the machine and you'd get 3 lives.  So the game was tuned to maybe 10-15 mins of play at a time.. maybe 30 mins for people with money to burn and really wanted to figure it out.Also don't play the WATCH mode, otherwise it completely ruins the game and why would you even play it after seeing that?  Bad idea to have this in the game.I actually find the things they did to this game (beeps, arrows, watch mode) quite interesting and says volumes about how games are played today.  Back then games were so punishing, especially arcade games. Rewards were so fleeting and paltry.  These things that were added to this game completely break it, so if you want the REAL Dragon's Lair experience: turn off above mentioned settings, turn out the lights, and turn UP the volume (or use headphones).  This game had a very juicy eye/ear candy and tactile feel to it that created hoards of people lining up to play it in the arcades (back in the day). This game was a dramatic shift from the bleeps and bloops of the everyday 80's arcade games of it's time.			"

												A nice and convinent way to play an almost 100% accurate port of this arcade classic. I have to say it is really nice to play with digitally remastred video and a modern aspect ratio, but on the minus side there is no setting for amount of lives which have been featured on almost all of the ports of this game. (It bothers me as I was used to play this with 3 lives). For those who are used to play this emulated on Daphne, the timing is a bit diffrent (and not as strict) but arguably gives a better experience especially for new players. Also I haven't had the best experience when trying this on a Mac as I couldn't get full screen to work.Otherwise I would definitely say that this is one of the best Dragon's Lair ports out there.

I don't reccomend playing with the move guide on, but the game is just so much fun to figure out what you're supposed to do. Whether you play in Arcade Mode or Home Mode with Easy or Hard, doesn't matter. Dragon's Lair is a casual, must-play, action-packed adventure game.			"
