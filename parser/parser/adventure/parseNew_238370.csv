												First of all,I've read many negative reviews about Magicka 2 and I partly agree with some of them, but overall I'll think that Magicka 2 deserves to be a ""good game"".Here comes why.I am going to compare Magicka 2 with Magicka 1 right here because it's the point why the most people complain about Magicka 2.To see why Magicka 2 differs so much from Magicka 1 we have to look at the spellcasting system and gameplay. Magicka 1:  Water (Q) and Fire (F) combine themselves to the NEW element Steam Cold (R) and Water (Q) combine themselves to the NEW element Ice Combos like QFASAA or EQRQRRS can be created like that You cannot walk while casting spells You controle the movement of your whizard with clicking and dragging the mouse, if you stop clicking, your whizard stops walking Magicks have no cooldown AT ALL You cannot stagger while having a stone shield (ED) on yourself You cannot heal through stone shields (ED) on yourself When attacked by any source (fire not inclueded), nothing goes through the stone shield (ED) on yourself The more elements used (DF x DFFFF) the more AOE the spell has Magicka 2:  Water (Q) and Fire (F) do combine, but don't create a new element in the element bar (Steam) Cold (R) and Water (Q) do combine, but don't create a new element in the element bar (Ice) Combos like QFASAA or EQRQRRS cannot be created like that You can walk while casting spells You controle the movement of your whizard with clicking and dragging the mouse, if you stop clicking, your whizard walks to the last point where your mouse was Magicks have a small cooldown when casted manually (like WA x SPACE) You can stagger while having a stone shield (ED) on yourself You can heal through stone shields (ED) on yourself When attacked by any source, mostly everything but pure physical attacks go through the stone shield (ED) on yourself. The shield gets also damaged by that Usage of more elements do not (or very slightly) increase the AOE, but only the damageThose are the most differences between Magicka 1 and Magicka 2 refering on spellcasting and gameplay (those, that many are complaining about).I think the other differences are almost visible so I'll gotta tell you, why I prefer Magicka 2 over Magicka 1. Resum√©e People who played Magicka 1 as long as me do have the most problems with getting into the new System of Magicka 2.Most of your old spell combinations don't work anymore or feel weak. Everything just felt weak when I've started playing Magicka 2.That was, mostly, because I didn't knew what I was doing because I was playing like I played Magicka 1.That is a fault. And I would recommend every new Magicka 2 player who comes from Magicka 1 to test new spells and combinations because some (*caugh* Spam QSR *caugh*) are more powerful than they were in Magicka 1.It is something you have to get into. It takes time, but also makes more fun to play than in Magicka 1.That comes because it is now harder to survive and you need more knowledge (weakness of several enemies) and reaction (or friends who revive you) in order to be effective.But it also feels better if you made it through a level just by *knowing what you're doing*.Also I prefer the new graphics and music, there is still some good humor in the game and its more long-time-motivating because of artifacts and things you can unlock by playing on higher difficulties (also playing on higher difficulties itself is challenging but fun, too).So, my statement overall is:  This game takes its time until it shows you its potential and fun factor, and you have to try out new things, which you also did in Magicka 1, you only have to remember. Give this game a chance and the game will totally be in love with you ;) I know that my Review was mostly focused on the comparison between Magicka 1 and Magicka 2 and I'm sorry if you waited for a ""standalone game review for Magicka 2"" but it just shows my own experience and I think that many other people had such an experience.I hope, I helped you guys with my Review,cheers =) NOTE  Magicka 2 Update: ""Added Steam and Ice as Individual Elements. Just as it was in Magicka 1 these will take up one slot in the element queue: Steam is made from Water and Fire Ice is created from Water and Cold"" "

												The game has been updated since it's initial release. They brought back rebindable keys, and the old spell and movement system. Steam and Ice are their own element, as well as adding a new element, poison to change up the balance of the game without negating the old balance altogether. The Jokes are funnier than ever, the multiplayer is better than ever (you can drop in and out). The campaign is a little weak, but it really is Magicka 2.0. If this was the game that had come out instead of the original version released in May, then nobody would be complaining as much as they were. I still don't think it personally holds a candle to the epic scale of the original campaign, but it is definetly a solid product overall.Update: They just keep updating it. You can ping for revives (though you should be using voice chat anyways), they added two new magicks (teleport and thunderbolt), They made it easier to differentiate new enemies, they made ice and earth armor have ""no knockdown"" like in Magicka 1. Most of all, these changes signify they're in it for the long haul. They want to make this game as well-loved as the original and are willing to do whatever is necessary to make it that way. I expect the campaign won't get any additional levels, but there's going to be a lot of long term support for this game and it won't just be DLC made to milk us. They're taking care of the community before anything else, which I think is awesome.			"

 ~~ THE UPDATE ~~ EDIT: The return of combined element slots (for steam and ice) and the addition of a completely new Poison element have drastically changed Magicka 2. They return not only to restore what once was, but add even more to the game. If you had any doubts before, they are now gone.The devs have gone above and beyond to continue to improve the game, so much so that a 64% approval rating on steam is simply an insult. As a member of steam I trust you all to rate this game as it deserves to be rated.I will now readdress all of my previous points with the update in consideration.1. ComplexityThe complexity of Magicka 1 is back and more. Steam and Ice Slotting has returned with Poison to add into the mix. Do your classic combos and more.2. Enemy DifficultySingleplayer difficulty has been made easier with patches and you can revive your familiar. Stay mobile and use weaknesses. You can do it!3. MovementNot only is it an improvement IMO, but you can now revert to the original game's click and hold to move. Keep in mind though, this prevents scoot-n-shooting and makes things harder.4. Rebind KeysAdded in a patch.5. PvpStill want this------- Slightly outdated review below ---------As someone who has greatly enjoyed Magicka 1, I find many of the complaints people have regarding Magicka 2 to be mainly due to losing footing in their new environment. It's by no means a perfect game, I just want to share my opinion on some of the issues people have, and ways people can improve. (My time in Magicka 2 so far mostly consists of about 7 hours of the Sneek Peek)1. One of the complaints I see the most is a complaint about less complexity because of an effective rebalance to spells that used to combine multiple elements into one slot (frost + water = ice, fire + water = steam). In Magicka 2, the elements stay in their base form, taking an effective limit of 10 elements (if all were steam or ice) to a hard cap of 5. The elements are all there, but the combined ones now take up more room.A: You could rightly say that this removed complexity from the game. However, you would not be taking into consideration the developer's desire to base game balance on a true limit of 5 elements. I can understand it's fun to know and use only the best spells, but it is now more important to focus on the weakness of your opponent than just using the same combination of elements in 80% of all fights. The main use of combinations utilizing these elements was just the DPS increase. This change forces players to introduce diversity into their casting, and make more informed elemental choices.2. Enemy difficulty. So, it has been brought up that in Magicka 2 that enemies are harder to kill, and this makes the game very difficult for solo play. This is true. If you simply take Magicka and head right into Magicka 2, it is going to be a lot harder. The focus on elemental weaknesses and game rebalance have a lot to do with that.  Enemies are fast. It's now harder to just block them with walls. Ranged units are more accurate.A: What I found myself not taking into account until I got more accustomed to the game, was movement. In Magicka 2, the game expects you to keep mobile while charging spells and casting. This takes a little getting used to, but your movement as a wizard is now essential. While moving, ranged units have much more trouble hitting you, and melee units struggle more to keep up. Just set your path away from enemies and use whatever elements you want to take them down.  Feel free to stay just out of range while moving and casting electric varieties of spells. Take more advantage of the frost element to slow enemies. Also, as a slight aside, you now get a free revive from a little wisp buddy which helps the singleplayer difficulty.3. Movement. I've seen some complaints about the movement system in Magicka 2 feeling too slick. A: I am in support of allowing people to use Magicka 1's system of movement as an option menu choice. Constant movement is a big change. Having to manage your elements, movement, and aim can be tough. However, you'll be at a major disadvantage as far as kiting enemies, casting spells, and dodging projectiles are concerned if you revert back to the movement of the first game. The game has been balanced with its movement in mind (go figure), and frankly after actually adapting to it, I like it.4. The ability to rebind all of the keys.A: Needs to happen5. Official PvP modeA: Needs to happen.			"

TL;DREDIT: I was a bit harsh in my comparison with the original; I recently replayed the first game and after a little longer with Magicka 2 I can see the benefits of the balance changes that were made.Magicka 2 is different from the original. It doesn't feel like it has improved greatly on it in any meaningful way, however it does feel more polished and there is a sense of freedom that was not present in the first game. Being able to move while you cast is part of the way you have to play the new game. My cohort and I had fun, but I can't say whether I had more or less fun than in the first game. Without my rose coloured glasses, I'd say this is a solid sequel. But the buzz killing bugs really bit me hard.6/10 Learning to Spell AgainWhen I saw this in my Steam feed I bought it immediately as I reasoned that if it was as good as the first, it would be worth it. It downloaded in a couple of minutes and my first impression was not good; everything felt a little ""detached"" compared to the original; I think it might have been the camera, but also the controls didn't feel quite as responsive. I played through the prologue and put it aside as it just wasn't as fun playing by myself as it was with others and I didn't want to ruin it by playing through it on my own so I put it aside until a few more friends had bought it.It wasn't shelved for long as this weekend my brothers and I found ourselves with an evening to spare, so they both picked it up and we jumped on the opportunity to learn to spell again.We had started on Normal difficulty but because I had already played through the prologue and when I clicked ""Adventure"" the game decided to start from Chapter 1, so we restarted (on one of my brothers machines) and increased the difficulty while we were at it as we were kind of breezing through the first chapter even without remembering what we were doing. We started again on Bananas and it was a lot of fun, we really felt as though we were battling to make progress, wiping on the first few encounters until we found our rhythm and got our comms back up to scratch. It was quite rewarding on this difficulty level, and while occasionally frustrating it meant that we really felt like we were battling.There was an encounter in the early chapters involving some crabs. It took us a few waves to figure out how we could stop them spawning, and we beat the encounter. We were also exploring the levels as much as we could, trying to find the inevitable jokes hidden around. We were loving it. Until it glitched.My brother (the host, unfortunately) had gotten stuck somewhere off the map. There are no checkpoints after encounters so at this point we tried basically everything we could to get him out of that spot. We didn't have any emergency teleport spell at that point, but he was unable to summon any elements anyway so he couldn't have cast anything. The camera for some reason at that point wouldn't let us leave a man behind (while it quite willingly leaves people off screen in other situations, more on that later). All the fun and reward that we were experiencing while we were playing the game on Bananas difficulty was instantly converted into anger and frustration when we were unable to progress in a level because of an engine bug. Angry, we quit the level and switched out for a mini retrospective while we took a short break.What went well?The game was fun and challenging.What didn't go so well?The game crashed, punishing us for playing it, especially on higher difficulties.What would we do differently?Introduce a suicide option so when a player is glitched they can opt to die and a fellow player can res them.Oh wait we didn't build this. OK...What could we do differently as players?We were out of the refund windowStop doing things like pushing each other off the mapStop trying to explore every little corner of the mapDon't spend as much time in the game so it's less likely to crash out (rush through it)Don't spend as much time on encounters so if it does bug out it is less punishing (reduce the difficulty)All the above basically boils down to: have less fun.And we did.GraphicsBuggy animations; sprites would often remain electrocuted or in other states incorrectlyNew graphics are really niceUI/HUD takes up way too much of the screenWizard sword effects would randomly not be shown, or would show even if they were already usedCamera gets way too excited about cutscenes and leaves players behindControlsBuggy: conjuring some elements and then casting using the ""right click"" too quickly would often miss mouse input; this happened many, many times and forced me to introduce a conscious mental delay between when I would cast an element and when I would click the button to cast. That broke my immersion greatly and really frustrated me as it felt like I was battling with the input system. I didn't remember any such frustration in the first game, which I remember being far more responsive. I think this may have been latency related as I don't feel like it happened at all when I was playing single player.Movement sometimes jerked around, probably netcode (we really felt this during the final battle with the orbs)SoundsBuggy. Every level started with NO sound effects, just music, for like the first few seconds. We couldn't figure out a reason why, and it broke our immersion every time.Music was enjoyable and fit the atmosphereSound effects were fitting when they worked, but didn't play a huge part of the game; I would have liked more audible feedback for some aspects of casting, like some kind of clearly audible sound that indicated that you had successfully started charging an earth element's casting.GameplaySimilar to the first - pick your elements, spells and combinations based on your opponents and the situationSpells didn't carry the same powerful feeling as they did in the first gameReduced number of elements and made combinations simpler; less fun, less tricky to cast thingsQuick cast slots in addition to above nerfageBizarre HUD in multiplayer; really don't need to see the HUD of my teammates. Show me more of the world.ConclusionOverall, we enjoyed the experience but nowhere near as much as we had hoped. The game has a few bugs, and not fun ones. The experience of being a wizard feels nerfed from the original; spells feel less powerful, We had issues with controls, we had issues with stability and we had engine glitches that lost us progress and we had consistent sound bugs.As a fan of the first game, I feel a little let down. The first game was buggy as all hell, especially in the early days, and this game feels more polished but still has the sort of rage-inducing issues that hurt its overall enjoyment.If you are playing on a console or have some kind of physical impairment that means you can use a controller but not a keyboard+mouse, this game is probably a better choice than the original as casting has been simplified and you don't have to remember spells anymore. But if you are a veteran wizard who was looking forward to using all 8 fingers on your left hand again, you may be disappointed as it feels as though casting has been nerfed.			"

												Magicka 2 is a fantastic game from what I have played.  I feel the negative press is from those who expected to be as good at this initially as they were after many hours in magicka 1.   On most of the thumbs down, the justification has been a comparison to magicka 1, usually on THESE grounds:They say: There's quickcast now! Filthy casuals!I say: It's optional and disincentivized by cooldowns.  It can be handy in a pinch.They say: There are cooldowns! This is so toned down.I say: They do not apply if you do not quick cast, apart from like a 2 or 3 second default cooldown, which provides anecessary balance to overpowered spell spam in the first game like lightning bolt or summon elemental.  You could rapidfire those spells as fast as you could type to win any battle, eliminating challenge/balance.They say: It's like wizard wars now I don't like the controls! I run off cliffs 2 die D:I say: Controls were improved to allow move and shoot, channeling healing, and other little tweaks, persistent sword buffs etc. If you ran off the cliff its because you clicked off the cliff.  You'll be revived in 2 seconds if you're playing multiplayer anyway, I'm sorry you have involuntary tourettes of the wrist, but your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• spasms do not justify giving poor reviews to the developers and their product.  The only con is nonremappable keys, which I'm sure will be patched soon. Most fans played magicka 1 with default controls anyway, and would likely play 2 as such even given the option, its not really an illogical layout.They say:  The spellcasting is too simplified, I no longer get combined elements!I say: So if you wanted 5 steam in the past, you had to hit 5 water and 5 fire, 10 keystrokes. Each icon of fire or water would turn into an icon of steam when its counterpart was added to the queue. Now everything is streamlined to 5 inputs out of 8 elements x 4 cast types, that is to say, icons do not combine into secondary elements now. Spell strengths are mostly equivalent to what they were before but with less keystrokes, and all of the steam and ice sickles etc are still doable. I fail to see the problem.They say: YOU NERFED ICE ARCANE LIGHTNING SHIELD 2 SWORD WTFI say: So the more professional team balancing and creating this game decided to take away your crutch of a press to win button, and now you're crying.  I'm sorry that you can't adapt and play a game with strategy reaction and teamwork the way it was intended? Also on pros: Working netcode.  Drop in drop out.  Weapon/staff unlocks and selections.  Better balance and challenge, new story blah blah blah. I haven't really seen any cons.  All the bad press is from actual fans of the first game, which are slinging mad bias because if the first game didn't exist and this was the big innovator, most of us would agree the reviews would be like 90% positive at least.  Its a grave injustice, I find it ironic that its the biggest fans of the game raising the biggest stink.  Just get it for yourself and a buddy. In a nutshell, its a 15$ game thats more fun than diablo 3. Quit herp derping and just buy one for yourself and a friend. It is quite enjoyable and everyone I've played in game with shared my sentiments here expressed.			"

												First off, some fo the good things:The graphics look absolutely gorgeous, multiplayer has FINALLY had the fix the entire community was waiting for in that you can now add players in the middle of a level, there are some new magicks and the boss fight mechanics are new and challenging in most cases.So why do I not recommend this game?In short: it's boring. Don't get me wrong, the chaos is still a lot of fun, but it doesn't really change, the story is virtually nonexistent, and it is so obviously intended for people who have already played magicka 1, yet it fails EXACTLY to bring that one thing magicka 1 players have been waiting for for years: something new.Magicka 2 is simply another expansion to the original game with slightly altered game mechanics and improved graphics. To be totally honest, I find presenting it as a whole new game a form of rudeness.I mean, sure, it has a lot of humour, but there is a problem with that as well:In most games, it is fun to find the occasional easter egg and laugh about it. In THIS game, there is so much humour around every corner and under every stone that it feels like the makers tried to conceal the lack of story with a boatload of cheap humour. In my honest opinion Seitokai no Ichizon had less reference jokes than this game.In short: if feel to me like the purpose of this game was not to bring a new and original challenge, not to please the dedicated fans, not to broaden the game's audiance by making a wholly new game from it (because with the amount of bugs in Magicka 1 a wholly new game was much needed)(not that this game is free of bugs, though it has considerably less), it feels like the purpose was to appeal to an audiance as broad as possible in order to rake in as much money as possible. They got me hook, line and sinker, but I have 9 hours in this game and I finished all relevant parts of it.And the extra content? Costs more money. Sorry Paradox but this is not what I paid for.			"

												Magicka 2 has been updated, and people that enjoyed the original are now much more likely to enjoy it.When Magicka 2 was first released we were greeted with a spell creation system that had been gutted in the name of balanced player versus player combat; something I, and apparently a lot of other people, don't care about in a Magicka game.  People that do care about that were probably already playing Magicka: Wizard Wars, and not interested in another story-driven game.  That would explain all the bad reviews this game has gotten.The developers have since fully corrected their mistake, and deserve credit for that.  Developers fixing their bad game design (as opposed to bad code) is almost unheard of in the industry.  It would be nice to see more of that.The Good:The spell creation system now has all the original elements, along with the new Poison element.  Most remaining differences (like being able to walk while casting) seem to be improvements.  I now enjoy the gameplay more than the original.The voice acting and silly atmosphere is just as good as the original.The special effects associated with spells look much better than in the original.The Bad:The first thing the player is greeted with after installation is the requirement to create or enter login information for a Paradox Interactive account, or be unable to play online.  I'm sure this didn't help the ratings any.  The justification, that Magicka 2 owners might receive rewards in Magicka: Wizard Wars, was extremely weak.  I already have a Steam account that is perfectly adequate for lobby service.  I wish companies would stop thinking they are so special that they should contribute to everyone's account proliferation problems.  I really, really, don't need to have yet another username and password to remember when it's time to upgrade my computer.The only thing I miss from the original spell creation system is the ability to push with water beams.  It would probably be most reasonable to simply add that effect to the Poison and Life Water beams.  Enemies that benefit from being poisoned (undead) are usually harmed by healing, so this shouldn't cause problems.Difficulty is not scaled based on the number of players, and is clearly balanced with 4 skilled players in mind.  It is often frustrating in multiplayer, and is almost impossible to play solo.  The original Magicka had this problem in some of its DLC (most notably The Stars Are Left).  Since feeling frustrated and laughing are usually mutually exclusive, this does a lot to harm the humorous atmosphere.  I play Magicka for the spell creation system and humor, not the challenge.Magicka 2 is shorter than the original.  Perhaps DLC will improve this, but given the damage the original design did to sales, and the damage over time the bad ratings are doing to sales, I wonder if Paradox Interactive will consider it worthwhile to develop much DLC.I don't like the soundtrack as much as the original.  It is in no way bad.  I like it more than most games' soundtracks.  It just doesn't feel as memorable as the original.			"

												I just finished the game on my own on bananas (hardest) difficulty. The difficulty is not an issue, if you know how to play.This game is definitely more of a challenge than all of magicka 1. The engine is far more refined than magicka 1: the graphics are better, there are barely any bugs (one or two at the end), and the gameplay has been smoothed out. The physics are still rather clunky though.Just as the first game, however, the 2nd magicka game is made for co-op.The humor is in the gameplay (with friends) and in the story / script. The writing is excellent.I had a blast playing this game because of the intended challenge by the game developers and the writing. I'm not saying that people who do not recommend this game are wrong, but they are definitely short-sighted. They simply do not know that damage dealt against enemies depends on the enemy, rather than the spell you cast. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Fairly simple test to find out if you will enjoy this game. Buy the original Magicka and play through it, then download and try Magicka Wizard wars. If you feel that Wizard Wars moves in a direction you are really not a fan of then DO NOT BUY this game, its more of a sequal to Wizard wars than the orginal. Now, there is nothing wrong with that persay, but for me (would disliked the changes made by wizard wars and hoped for a return to form) it was bitterly disapointing.EDIT:As of an update of the game the spell mixing mechaics are way more interesting and more fun as in magicak 1. Its now much more of a middleground between the two and more enjoyable, however I personally have to play the game completly differently with the shields changed and with less room for back pedelling in the levels themselves. As it was I did convice all of my friends to play magicka 1 with me to force co-op play upon them. but due to the nature of the claustophobic locking into battles and lack of safe shield hidy holes I wouldn't really want to play co-op. As such I still can't activly recomend this if you played around the shield like I did but its now a more reasonable successor and something I will probably work my way through rather than leave in the dust as I was planning too prior to the update. (This was playing through with the beta spell balance update)			"

												Magicka 2, while promising to be a renewal of the original Magicka's splendor and gameplay, falls short due to it's core mechanics being defined by the clunky and unpolished wizard wars on which it was founded.Before I even go full rant mode, the most important thing for anyone reading this to realize is the following.-You are not allowed to cast spells as fast as you can input them-Somehow the developers caught enough good sense to put ice and other mixed elements back into the game, along with a few other things that were glaringly terrible about this sequel, but they never got around to removing this global cooldown time that is placed on all magicks in the game. So as a result, all single player gameplay involves you spamming intermittent nonsense until you die, casting revive on the fairy as you return, then scrambling for a few moments to see if this time around you can squeeze something useful in before death swallows you again.This along with changes to the implementation of a few mechanics makes the game decidedly less entertaining. For instance, in Magicka one, using a bunch of water and then weapon equiping it would increase the ""force"" of the blow drastically enough the send lighter enemies flying to their death, either by smashing into walls or off of an edge. Wheras in Magicka two, the enemy will simply get wet and pushed slightly.  There are a few physics changes like these, and they all point in one direction, the ""shenanigan"" factor of the game has been shaved off by about 80%. By having the game elements even be partially borrowed (Mostly even) from a game that was attempted to be balanced for multiplayer pvp gameplay, they have removed the ridiculousness that made the pve of the first game such a unique experience.As a result, the game that turned you and you friends into left handed master pianists who slung giant instakilling lighting ice paths and huge rocks towards your foes, occasionally gibbing yourself and others in the process is long dead, covered in foam and with shortcuts and cooldowns slapped onto it.TL:DR The edge is gone, the fun is gone.

												Well...Ill start with a simple statement , If you didn't like magicka 1 this is not the game for you.Magicka 2 is more of the same but with a few changes that are arguably worse.Ill be reviewing this game with comparisons to the first.Controls:The controls have been change around since magicka 1 , personally i don't mind it too much.You can rebind the keys if need be.The biggest change to the controls is the ability to move while casting ,It seems like a small change but it has a big impact on the way you approach enemies and the level design.You have 4 spell hot-keys to easy cast various spells and all spells have a cooldown.Casting from the hot keys increased the cooldown.The controls themselves are responsive and easy to learn once you dive into the meat of the game.Story:There basically is non , You are told to go find a ""child of prophecy"" and that's it.you will go from level to level and just kill things , you reach the end of the level and you are told to go somewhere else.You will complete the campaign in about 5 hours.Throughout the story missions there are puns and easter egges to find but the level design in extremely-linear and obvious so its not really secretive , there are no unlockables to find , you will recieve a set of thingsbased on the difficulty level you chose at th end of the mission.The campaign feels like a slug through endless maps that look the same with no reason to do so past unlocking new things and that makes me just sad.Gameplay:The general gameplay of magicka 2 is quite the same as magicka 1 , you have 8 basic elements ,You combine them to form spells and launch them at enemies or friendly Npcs or your friends.You have 3 upgraded elements that can be used by fusing 2 lesser elements.Above that you have ""magicks"" which are powerful spells you need to carefuly construct and execute.They often have powerful effects and do massive damage or control.Magicka 2 however seems to be designed to be played as a more hit and run style of play, you have very limited amount of powerful ""magicks"" and due to enemy resistances to certain elements you are encouraged to use your basic spells often. Magicka 1 on the other hand was more relaxed , you had 21 ""magicks"" with some exrtas as Dlc that all had strong effects on the battlefield and knowing how to cast them effectively separated the beginners from the veterans.Enemies , level design , difficulty:This is one of the more subtle yet impactful changes to the game since magicka 1.There is a strong lack of enemy variety , There are factions and each faction will have the same enemy ""types"";Melee fodder - weak , runs in a straight line to you , weak to most elements.Melee specialist - stronger , runs straight line to you , has a quirk , has some resistances.Ranged fodder - weak , stands in place and shoots at you , weak to most elements.Ranged specialist - stronger , moves around , has a quirk or special weapon , has some resistances.Spell caster - rather large amount of health , moves around , uses magic typical to the faction , has strong resistances.Medium sized brute - large amount of health , sprints at you , mostly melee some tiems ranged , whole lot of resistances.Large size brute - most health , walk about stomping things , very slow.the spell casters , medium and large brutes appear sparringly , or even just in specific scripted parts.Magicka 1 had a lack for enemies as well but it made up for it with unique level design and scripted events.Magicka 2 has little to no unique areas to fight in , You get quickly bored of using the same spell on the same enemy-every screen.Speaking of level design , There almost is non.The majority of the levels are just linear walk from left to right with little to no hidden areas , special events , unique- encounters , Combat areas often are just normal grounds with maybe a hazard or 2 (hazzard being a puddle of water).Again magicka 1 didn't have a huge amount but it had some and they were almost all unique to the level,Often making a normal fight intense or empowering.Difficulty in magicka 2 can be summerized with one line;Made for 2-4 players.Going through the game solo , you quickly discover how the game completely shafts solo play.The enemy AI always gets close as posibble and swarms around you , often stun locking you in place.Due to resitances and quirks you must use cheap tactics like suicide / revive cycle where you unleash spells with no regard until you are imminently killed to be revived and then revive your ferry to proceed.( a mechanic thats allows solo play to even exist).The ferry simple acts as a reviver , you WILL die , often.The limitation on spell spamming and removal of a large ammount of ""Magicks"" since magicka 1 Force you into a corner of defensive running around trying to kill priority targets and avoiding one hit kill enemies.Its just not as fun , magicka 1 had a similar issue but with strong ""magicks""  and the knowhow to use them propery you could control the battlefield like a master wizard.Visuals , UI :Visualy magicka 2 is beautiful , the magicka 1 style with higher resolution textures and improved effects.The game has a neat presentation however not even close to magicka 1s.The UI is simple , to the point , sometimes confusing.I had to google a lot of simple UI features because the game never tells you how to do a hell of a lot of stuff,Such as how to change equipment.Overall experience/verdict:Magicka 2 feels like a 2 step forward 1 step back kind of deal.The core of the game didn't change much but with the new gameplay additions it feels more refined upon.the removal of ""magicks"" , focus on challenges / multiplayer , little to no story feels like a rushed job to make a quick buck on the magicka name, hopefully future updates  and Dlc make up for this.I would recommend buying on sale if you REALLY like the magicka series.

												Okay, first off, when this game was freshly released it deserved most of the hate that it got from the community.As others stated before, controls were clunky, steam and ice didn't combine anymore, you got zergrushed to death when attempting singleplayer and the magick system was reduced to nothing.Though you have to give Paradox credit that they are trying to fix this mess.With the newly added ""Spellbalance Beta"" they switched most of the changes that turned out to be a disaster back to the way they used to be. So far, I believe that all of the changes are an improvement to the game:-Steam and Ice combine again, they even added a whole new poison element (water+death), giving you new options.-Keys can now be changed and you can also switch back to the old movement style of Magicka.-Stone now charges a lot faster also flies faster, making it a valuable element again. -Knockback has also been buffed so you can cherish sending your enemies (and allies) soaring across the entire screen once more.-The rather sad variety of Magicks is being increased by the day, with old ones being re-implemented as well as new ones being added (I especially like the prisms)-Stone now charges a lot faster and flies further. This combined with increased knockback has the same satisfying results as a fully charged fireball of death in the original Magicka used to have.-lightning no longer overwrites beams. Now that hasn't bothered me too much, though it is nice to use the good old lightning-steam beam of doom again (though it is no longer overpowered, but still valuable).All in all, the gameplay feels MUCH better than when it was first released and more improvements are still being made.The only thing still bothering me is that you rather quickly run out of stuff to do. My friend and I have been playing this for 5 hours and have almost unlocked every single thing in the game. But maybe they'll add a thing or two in that aspect aswell. As things stand now, Magicka 2 is an entertaining game and surely better than a 65% positive rating.			"

												I have seen a lot of people giving negative feedback in reviews about Magicka 2 because they think that the spellcasting system is a worse version of the first game. This is simply not true. There is a distinction between Devs making deliberate balance and gameplay choices and removing features for the sake of removing features. Yes, there are many things that have changed and that have been adopted from Wizard Wars, but in my opinion a lot of these are not worse or better, they just change the way the player plays the game. Going over the comprehensive list of changes I've seen since the first one and why it's still a great game:- Spellbar nerfed. The elements that used to combine to one in the spell bar don't. This is the most major complaint I've noticed. However, the only thing this affects gameplay-wise is that lightning no longer works in the same spell with steam (intended effect), and lightning no longer works with ice (side-effect and a combo I actually miss). Nor can you cast 5 of steam or ice. This is obviously a balance choice designed to make it so that you cannot give wet status and deal double lightning damage to a target in the same spell cast. It's essentially a general debuff to wizard damage and makes the max amount of button presses per spell always 5.- Enemies are are buffed. Enemies move at you faster, are more accurate, have clever skills such as trapping you with walls and can swarm you easily. Noticeably enemies that chill you among groups seem to be pretty deadly if you don't remove it fast enough. There is more focus on finding the correct element to blast enemies with as they all have special weaknesses that take them out quickly. - Magicks nerfed and made easier to cast. There is now a hotkey system for magicks that makes them quick to cast and works on its own cooldown, and you can still manually cast magicks which also has a seperate, short, invisible global cooldown. The two methods can be used simultaneously to cast two magicks in quick succession. There are also a lot less magicks in the game than the first one. Some are still OP (looking at you dragon strike and thunderhead). You also get a little familiar should you so choose that revives you on death in singleplayer/multiplayer which itself can also be revived with the revive magick, giving effectively infinite lives. Push as a standard move (casting without elements conjured) has been changed into a Magick.- Movement is buffed. You can now move while casting spells; this can be hard to get the hang of at first, but is crucial for being able to kite and fight the now more challenging enemies. You can also heal while on the go. One of the more effective ways I've found to heal now is no longer setting up life mines but instead standard casting a rock element with four life element no charge at your feet for quick powerful heals. - Weapon Enchants are buffed. Enchantments that include projectile, beam, and shield type spells work similarly as a one time cast, but spray type and lightning type spells now remain on your weapon no matter how many times you swing with it, unless you come into contact with an element of opposite type or have it ""nullified"" (more on that in a bit).- Resistances are reworked. No longer does one resistance level of an element cause complete immunity to it, nor can you give your resistances to others by proximity. It is now on-self and staged in power, requiring more thinking/investment into certain defenses. One resist simply reduces damage. Two removes the harm of status effects, chilled, shocked, burning, frozen, and wet and further reduces damage. Three grants immunity to damage of the type. Four gives you major absorption to the damage type. This means for example should you choose to shield four death, yes you will be able to heal while spamming mines on your opponent, but you will be significantly weaker to physical damage due to not being able to add as much rock or ice armor to yourself. -Some spell modifiers have slightly less representation. Things such as adding more fire to a fireball, won't cause the radius of the fire explosion after the rock lands to be larger. Similarly AOE attacks won't expand in size. Sprays and lightning retain this ability to grow in range. Other modifiers stay the same, like duration or more damage from adding same type elements.- Lightning has been reworked. It has increased in spell priority to equal projectile type. Since lightning cannot be used with projectiles rock or ice, there's no info on which is higher. This means that beams no longer carry lightning but lightning instead carries beam element types. It also means that lightning mines are no longer available but instead create a kind of life or death vortex wall. Lightning also causes less stun than before.- Water knockback nerf. Water element knockback and knockback in general are greatly reduced but still workable. I still use it to keep enemies at bay and for wet status. Mines also don't send you flying nearly as far but some enemy attacks do. This can be frustrating as you can't que spells while in mid-air, something they should change.- Rock reworked. Charge time greatly extended and distance at low charge reduced. Happens to be a high damage option given that other high damage options are nerfed. AOE Attacks that include rock are particularly powerful since they can be spammed quickly such as water rock death fire (also strong standard cast). Or weapon enchantments like rock death fire x3. Using a single rock in standard cast attacks seems to be best for range and charge.-Ice has been reworked. Granting yourself ice armor does not cause as much damage with the thorns effect and it also has less damage radius. Ice shards remain powerful. Ice walls and armor now reflect beams, making them much more useful.- Shields reworked. They now work on a timer that cannot be extended, allow for movement through the barrier, and still protect against beams and sprays, but do not suffice against projectiles which pierce straight through now. The shield dome - shift-middle mouse - now causes a ""nullification"" effect, where it removes enchantments from your weapon, prevents you from adding more while inside it, and also removing and preventing the effect of status ailments on you, chilled, burning, wet (big bonus there).- Crossing life and death beams in Co-op. Now creates a 2000 damage blackhole. Able to be resisted with death resistance and a great cheesy damage technique. Risky without resistance. Life, death, and cold elements also appear to have kept the same qualities from the first game. On a side note, the campaign feels a little bit shorter than the original, and the humour and references, while still great hadn't tickled me as much this time around. As a plus, the boss battles are all more interesting than before, and enemy type design is more creative. It's a lot easier to hop into a game with friends or complete strangers, and playing through in co-op makes it miles better. If you are a die-hard Magicka 1 fan, and these changes don't sound good to you, stick to Magicka 1. If you're on the fence, get it when it goes on sale. All in all, in my opinion these changes make it a more mobile, defensive, challenging, and strategic game. I have a great deal of fun playing it and look forward to future related projects. Highly recommend it!			"

												Magicka 2 was a decent follow-up to Magicka.Pros:+ Graphics are greatly improved.+ You can now choose to spawn with your preferred staff and weapon.+ There are now quick buttons to cast magicks. This takes away some of the game's difficulty, however.+ Familiars. These feel largely unnecessary but I suppose one could consider this a pro.+ Monsters seem stronger and have better AI.+ Some new and cool magicks.Cons:- Campaign feels very short.- Some magicks are only unlockable in challenges. This makes little to no sense to me.- No active staff abilities.- A lack of enemy casters. What happened to druids, disciples and goblin wizards?- Very easy boss fights.- Can't see where you can unlock certain magicks, weapons or staves.- Cringeworthy references.- Questionable balancing changes. This is only my opinion, but I sure will miss some of the fun combos. The problem lies in that they deliberately wanted to limit possibilities.Why not recommended? Mostly because of how short the campaign was. It doesn't come off as an improvement to the first game at all. The enemies are less varied, the weapons and staves to pick up seem less interesting. Maybe Magicka 2 will have some good DLCs in the future, perhaps then it'll instead be recommended. But as of right now, it doesn't offer much entertainment.EDIT: Additional pros and cons!+ New movement system. You can cast spells while moving. This is a really nice feature, to be fair.- Lots of magick from the first game are missing. Grease, Rain, Thunder Bolt, Tornado, Fear, and more. I really want to know why they weren't included.EDIT 2: Following the release of a much appreciated patch, the game is significantly better. However, this review is based on the release of the game. The poison element is a nice addition and so is the variety of magicks added. Thunderhead, Ice Tornado and the like. It's a step in the right direction.			"

												Lots of problems with this title. Where to start?:# You are *forced* to sign up for a Paradox account and link it to your steam account in order to be able to play online. Something that is not advertised prior to your purchase. No reason has been given by the developers as to why they are forcing customers to do this.# Account creation in game not properly working, workaround of creating an account directly on their website necessary to get playing.# If you have a widescreen monitor, tabbing out and back in will squash up the graphics other than the UI and you will have to restart the game.# Client crashes on first spacebar press for some users.# Fewer spells available than in Magicka 1# There are now preset *special* spells, some of which seem to be very half baked such as ""emergency teleport"" that basically always ports you to the left of the screen.# Seems to be a short campaign, at the time of writing with only 2.4hrs played already 2/3 of the way through.# The ""humour"" is entirely banal, and a clear downgrade from Magicka 1.# Cannot remap keys# Control nuance removed such as hold down mouse button to move is now just click to move.# Being used as a vehicle to advertise other titles such as Wizard Wars on the main menu screen, basically giving an impression that they dont really have confidence in this product and want you to play something else.All in all, pretty much a downgrade from the previous title. Severe disappointment.			"

												Magicka 2 fixes the crappy control set up from the original Magicka and make playing with a controller 100% more bearable. You still have to remember magic combinations, though. This version also takes your basic and much needed spells and place em to a quick button, so no need to cast a basic spell combo and another directly after. The key magic for this game is that you can take a local friend and yourself online and play with other 2 online players. i wish more multiplayer games did this. I can say i enjoyed this version more than the first, though this game is content starved compare to the first one which goes ball to the wall crazy with dlc content. Note: In the future i hope the Devs flush this game out more to follow the dungeon structure/gameplay layout of a ARPG similar to a Torchlight, Diablo, Grim Dawn.			"

												Get the cloak that makes you heal from arcane, spam arcane aoe and smite youself in the head every now and then with hellish power. Turn your skype volume off so you can't hear your friends screaming at you for killing them constantly. Win the game without any help from your sandbag friends.My friends are now actual sand bags... but thats ok because I learned how to summon an army of undead who I can heal with rage inducing dubstep and the blood of kittens.

												Well, first off. Its not a terrible game but it is bad. If you've played it already you might disagree with me and that's fine. If you haven't played Magicka 2 yet however and you are wondering whether to buy it then i would say go buy the first one instead if you haven't already. So far my experience with this game was 20 minutes of trying to get the compulsory Paradox account setup which doesn't connect to the servers half the time. Then after that I ran the tutorial in a similar fashion to the Magicka 1 tutorial, no problems so far except the controls being changed slightly.However, when I started fighting enemies it was so boring and the spells are almost useless as well as using magicks. The goblins are not too bad but the crabs you fight for the first hour of the game can freeze you and one of the big crab enemies is immune to EVERYTHING from the front. I had to invite a friend just so I could get behind it to kill it and then to my surprise they don't send anything but more of these crabs and a crab which fires poison at you for the next hour after that point. Now you may just say I'm bad at the game but Magicka 1 never annoyed me like that and it never felt like a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to kill something. Whats the point in being given access to all these spells etc when half the enemies you meet are immune to them. For most enemies so far all me and my friend have done is just use Fire as its stupidly OP against anything that isn't resistant to it. While Earth and Ice are completley useless, they do below 1000 damage fully charged while fire gets to that damage with it spell (while casting) in seconds.I will probably update this review if I find anything new to consider.Sorry for that rant there.TL:DRBasically the game just isn't balanced well and the enemies are pretty unfair for the player to fight as most spells are ineffective, especially as this is a mere hour into the game (that I've reached). If I find anything else worth mentioning in the future i'll update this review. Thanks for reading :)			"

												While far shorter then the first it still remains a fun sequel to a game i have sunk some time into. however, if you are going to pick between the two go with the first, its longer, spells arent forced into a meta mindset and in some cases more powerful and interesting (look at the ice sword) in that one you really feel like a master of magic (unill your buddy strikes you down instantly with lighting). iin the second one, like mentioned above, spells dont feel as powerful and there are far less combinations. does this make it a bad game? no, i quite enjoyed it... just dont talk to me about crabs			"

												Really disappointing considering its key aspects of the game are removed, compared to the first one.For people that haven't played Magicka 1, you /might/ like this game, considering you haven't been exposed to the first game's brilliance, so your standards may be lower.This review was originally made in May around when it was released. It is now edited on 11/8/2015The positive:-They are adding /things/-You can now change your keybindings to your own liking (yay)-You can now move like you did in Magicka 1 (yay)-And mobs are finally not impossible to kill, as their stats have been reduced (huzzah)They have changed many things, for better or worse, but the game feels different fromMagicka 1. And it is primarily why I dislike this game so much.In Magicka 1, the primary focus was button mashing. And button mashing is /FUN/. Prep yourself pre-battle with SDFE (shield), mash ASF (sprint) in your keyboard , run around and gather some mobs, mash in SDFEF along with a Shift Right click, ASA (teleport) out of the bomb mine and then just spam DF or FQFQASA. Or dang, just spam the hell out of ASA and go in and out and do your own thing. In Magicka 1, you went HARD and you went HAM which was an amazing playstyle. It was quite frankly a Michael Bay movie and when you entered in so many inputs, you felt good and skilled at the game.The negative:In Magicka 2, they removed that core aspect of button mashing. Instead, the general playstyle is channeling spells from a distance, which is /different/.  You can no longer spam spells and the player's ability just feels hindered by the game - you feel weaker, man.The Shields:Beforehand a simple SDFE would protect you from fire, earth and arcane rather well. Now, the shields run out faster and you need to pay attention to them. And especially when you're so overwhelmed by melee and ranged mobs, things just start getting out of hand.Mashing Heal - Before, you'd heal yourself with just mashing W a billion times and clicking the middle mouse button. You'd heal yourself rather fast, but instead now you need to hold heal, which makes you heal yourself slower. It's really a petty preference of mine, but it's the little things. Mashing Teleport: They renamed the teleport to ""Emergency teleport"". You can no longer mash ASA, but instead you can use it once every 5 seconds.Mashing Fireballs: You can no longer mash DF, because if you cast it instantly after you've conjured it, the range will be extremely short. The longer you hold it, the farther it goes. This prevents mashing it, when it was so fun to just spam. Why?I like the fact that you can run and burn/ice people but sometimes the button just glitches some weird‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•happens and the spell doesn't come off. Clunky buttons, man.Going Rambo is fun and in this game it's rather hard to do so.There's a lot of potential in the game, as the humor of the game is brilliant, but Paradox just needs to take responsibility for the blueball of so many people (primarily mine though) that wanted to have fun with this game, and they should increase the AOE range and damage of the spells. And add in spamming again. And stuff.			"

												Well.. There is a lot to discuss about the game actually. But Paradox clearly tried new methods in a good manner. They didn't want to screw up, people liked Wizard Wars! So they implemented those aspects of the game rather than the first one. First of all, Small group of friends and I are playing Magicka related games pretty often. I love the creativity of the game. The freedom of spells and elements. Yet, this is where this game fails. It has it's original humor, original easter eggs (Despite the people who think they are same, there are quite a bit different ones. Look deeper friends!) and a small portion of mechanics. But when you change the core aspect of the game, it can be pretty hard to get used to it. I understand all the hate. When i started the game first thing i thought was ""Dude, what the hell? Why did they made another Wizard Wars?"". Controls were different. Spells were different. Combinations were, well... Simply, you cant mix water and fire anymore. It won't turn into smoke and you can't make stupid combinations. That maybe a plus for a PvP game. But in this kind of game, i expect freedom. Not illusion of choice.Yet, i like the game. I get used to it. Try to get out of your comfort zone. I believe it is about that.This kind of big changes can attract different attention. I don't think this game deserves a negative review. They made a superb story. And if any of you finished the main story, you should also consider the magick dropping mechanic. It is a great addition. It works for your friends, also.So, if i sum it up; Pro;-Superb story. (Maybe a personal opinion.)-Great humor. Very similiar to the first game. You should also play that and Wizard Wars as this game is about both of them.-Pretty pretty Magick mechanics. You will experience them as you go along i won't spoil them.-Vlad is not a vampire.-You can fry everything you see! Almost...-Good puzzles if you know where to look. Best easter eggs and references i see in the game history.Cons;-Oh the mighty optimization. What have i done to you? Paradox can surely work on that, but it was expected.-What i call 'Illusion of choice'. They restrict your ability to cast. If you are familiar with WW, this is not important.-Vlad is absolutely not a vampire.-Pretty short.Overall I don't think this game deserves the hate it gets. If you know magicka, buy this immidiately. If you don't, try Magicka Wizard Wars. If you like it, buy the first, then this. It is the only game that can be this absurd and this good.Hope you give it a try. And let's not forget, it will get lots of DLC's too.Sorry for my English, as it is not perfect.			"

												The joy of the original Magicka was in EXPERIMENTATION & DISCOVERY - being happily surprised at the unpredictable, clever, and often amazing ways that magic could be used and how different kinds of magic would interact, often within somewhat realistic physical constraints, combined with powerful & fun items with unique abilities. This made for exciting opportunites for strategy but also some fun randomness. There was a tremendous amount of experimentation leading to fun outcomes.Much of that feeling was gone, in Magicka 2. There were far fewer spell combinations, far less exciting outcomes, far fewer items with fewer unique abilites, and generally much less opportunity to be surprised by clever interactions, abliites, and outcomes. To be frank, this was a boring and very disappointing follow-up to Magicka fans who were hoping for a game that would take the great experimentation & discovery from the first installment and EXPAND the formula and content.Instead, we got a much more constrained, much less fun sequel, with much less overall content. I understand that people who are coming to this game for the first time may not care about Magicka 1, but imagine if Magicka 3 has even LESS available spells, combinations, and items... it's not a recipe for long term success. Game franchises should get better and add more content over time, not get worse and offer less.			"

												If Magicka 1 has very positive feed-backs, and it is for sure an awesome and unique game,this one is nothing short of outstanding positive.Magicka 2  runs great, dropped some old elements from the previous game but it got  new ones.Gameplay is more balanced and dynamic, Enemies have a lot more elemental strengths and weaknesses  so changing elements now became more important and necessary. You can move around casting spells , different from before.New loot, there's an hotbar now with  4 assignable spells with cooldown. It has some good improvements and that's a fact, Magicka 2 got even better than before, with minor changes.It lives up to the name and fullfills the craving for more  Magicka.			"

												So far, I cannot recommend this game.I loved the original Magicka and can still recommend it for lots of fun, co-op and solo.This? No so much. The combat system is oversimplified, and while I can understand them changing mechanics so people can't just use the same combinations they did in the last game, it seems like all the nuance of spellcasting is gone. Rather than having to come up with complex combos to kill enemies, I've found myself using very simple and boring combinations to kill enemies, like fireballs.Most importantly, I can't recommend you play this game solo. The original magicka had some difficult sections, where you had to really think and diversify your techniques to pass. This game is not like that. It's difficult to the point of being unplayable solo. Enemies swarm you, knock you over, and one single enemy can kill you in just a few hits, and there are typically at least ten enemies on screen at a time. Furthermore, shields are practically useless except for protecting against one single element, and when you respawn you are immediately vulnerable and typically spawned right in the middle of a group of enemies. This doesn't require nuanced, flexible thinking, it *REQUIRES* at least two players to be won. While I love co-op games, this game is supposed to be playable solo. Some would call me a masochist because I insisted on playing through the original solo. But this? So far I've found this impossible. In general though, the controls feel floaty, you've lost the sense of feeling powerful that you had in the original (powerful meaning dangerous, even to yourself), and it feels like they just slapped the terrible Wizard Wars mechanics onto a new story that I likely won't be able to complete since few of my friends have any interest in this game and it's impossible solo.I really, really, wanted to love this game. I was totally ready for another game just as good as the original. This is not that game. Only buy this if you'll be playing it with friends the whole way through and don't mind an inferior product.			"

												This game doesn't deserve this low of a rating. It may have in the past. An update has fixed alot of the beefs people had with and aperently didn't change their negitive review thus the mixed rating.Pros:*Move while casting. (While this does take some getting used to it adds more functionality)*Graphics look awesome watching videos don't do it justice.*Much Improved Physics.*New Element Poison. (This adds alot of gameplay value. Think of the possibiltes with a posin element.)*More in depth sheilding from elements (Ok in Magicka 1 when you cast Sheild + fire it would make you immune to fire. If you added more fire it would increase the radius. Magicka 2's version are as follows ""1 Shield + 1 fire= small damage reduction"", ""1 Shield + 2 fire = Resistant"", ""1 Shield + 3 Fire = Immune"", ""1 Shield + 4 fire = Absorbtion"". I just used fire as an example, you can use any element.)*Spell hot keys*More difficult (Yes that is a bonus dispite whiners that say. People basicly cried because they couldn't finish the level with out some setbacks.*Artifacts (Unlock Artifacts that make it as hard or as easy as you want by equiping them in a play though.)*More Balanced (you can't just spam the heal spell and expect to be fully healed in 2 sets of all heal)*Ice spell is way better now that in Magicka.*You can have a load out preped while charging the spell you got. For example you go all rock spell while the rock is charging you can enter another spell combo so it's ready to go after you have fired the rock.*They have quite a few unlockables giving you plenty to do.*They have mode called trials which is like challenges that unlock as you progress through the story.* Enchanted weapons are not just a one swing and yoy have to re enchant but are timed.Cons: *Some places are still buggy.*The move and casting spells has a slight learning curve but prety easy to get down.*When transitioning into a scene your stored combo is gone. (This might be a balance issue)*NPC Heads aren't realy to scale. (Does it realy mater though?)I realy did try to think of cons but as you can tell by the last one I was grasping at straws.All in all I wish people would update their review this game is worrth the buy.

												Me and my friend loved the first Magicka. It took us 14 hours to beat, and I was satisfied with how much fun I had in those hours. Magicka 2 took us 6 hours, and while the movement was much more fluid, 6 hours is not long enough. I would not reccomend this game. I would rather suggest playing HELLDIVERS, a co op twin stick shooter made by the same people who created Magicka; that game has much more content and is much more fun.			"

												So Magicka 2 is finally here..I played through the first few chapters of the campaign, and did some challenges and trials.Has this game changed a lot compared to Magicka 1? Yes it has.Is it a good game nonetheless? It very much is.So the spell system was redone, or rather, they used the system of Wizard Wars, the biggest changes being the secondary elements now taking two slots with the original elements instead of just one, (example: Steam = Fire + Water instead of just Steam) and the priority of the casting type was rearranged, (Lightning has a priority over Death/Arcane) and while this new system needs some getting used to after Magicka 1, I think it's a good change. It takes away the ability to create some of the most overpowered spells I know, and while it was a lot of fun to just wreck everything in your path with the steam beam, this way it is a lot more balanced.Te controls are different to both Magicka 1 and Wizard Wars. and while I do think this is the best of the three games, (especially the way you can now walk while casting a spell, I'll come back on that later) It would be a good thing for this game series to just be consistent, instead of players from older games having to get used to the new controls all the time. (But hey, at least they didn't change the arrangement of the spells, that would be horrible!)That being said, the one thing I really missed in this game is the lack of the ability to rebind your keys.. I mean.. come on..The enemies are, in my experience, a lot harder than they used to be in Magicka 1. This is partly because there's more focus on finding the weakness of an enemy and using it against it. It takes some time to find the weaknesses, but I like this change. There isn't just one spell that kills every enemy for you. Rather you have to use different methods to defeat different enemies. Additionally, ranged enemies have much better accuracy, and I feel like enemies are made a lot faster, which really means you have to always be moving. The movement mechanic helps a lot with this, as you can now keep walking while you're casting a spell. (It also allows you to come up with some ""impressive"" dance moves) Overall, the enemies are a lot more challenging, and require you to actually adapt to every situation.The new magick system is certaintly interesting, and I like how quickly I can use them now. however, (and this might just be a bug) I was unde rthe impression that if you memorized the elements needed for a certain spell, you would not have a cooldown. This however didn't work for me, and I feel like, even if not the lack of cooldown there should be some kind of ""reward"" for queuing up the right elements instead of mashing 1, 2, 3, or 4. I love the addition of artifacts. it allows you to play the game in so many different ways. I haven't finished the campaign yet, but if when I do, I can do it again with the artifacts I've unlocked, and I would experience it in a whole new way. I like the trials a lot too, though similar to the challenge mode, it sets different goals, for example defeating an enemy within a  certain time span. This further allows the game to remain interesting even after the campaign is beaten.Finally, how can you talk about Magicka without mentioning all the hilarious easter eggs? In my opinion they're just as fun as Magicka 1. And I've had a lot of fun finding them. This really brings a lot of humor to the game, and makes it that much better!So what do I think of this game?Pro's:- Great spellcasting mechanics which balances the game out A LOT compared to Magicka 1.- The movement mechanics. Especially the ability to walk while casting.- Challenging enemies which require you to find their weakness and adapt to every situation.- Artifacts!- Hilarious easter eggsCons:- Controls need getting used to- Lacks the ability to rebind keys- No reward for memorizing magicksDo I recommend this game? Yes. Although, it has to be said that Magicka 1 players might have trouble getting used to the changes. Players from Magicka Wizard Wars, will have less trouble adapting to this, however, it is still a different game.As a player of both Magicka 1 and Magicka Wizard Wars I can say that though it might need some getting used to, this game is just as amazing as the other two Magicka games, and I guarantee you will have fun with this if you can look past the changes they made from the original Magicka. and may even come to the conclusion that the changes are not as bad as a Magicka 1 player first getting it's hands on this game might think.

												death fire beams will get you through the entire game, barring one secret bossThat goes against everything the first magicka was about. The whole point of you being a stupidly overpowered wizard was that you were up against insurmountable odds and had to cleverly find the right spells for the situation. Everything just zerg rushes you in this game and shields are useless except for absorbing a single element. All the weapons are meaningless and they're far and few between. The staffs have no actives and add very little to your gameplay. Magicka 1 would make an impressive sequel for this game. Sadly the opposite is not true. This game greatly improves graphics and somewhat improves online play. The servers aren't‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•anymore, but you have to make a paradox account and you're always online, which is a con for me. The magicka system had all the finesse taken out for some reason, I'm guessing to appeal to console gamers. Now there's a 3rd row of 4 keys to worry about rather than having to memorize combinations. My friend and I stopped even bothering with other strategies about halfway through and just burned our way to the end with death and fire beams. Enemy AI was somehow notably weaker than in the first game and the game only lasted about 5 hours. I'd recommend buying this if it's on sale, or playing it if it's gifted to you. It's nowhere near worth listed price.			"

												The quality is a bit lower than the first game. Me and my friend played coop for almost 2 hours and our experience was:-My friend has some serious issues with his SFX. They just turn off at the beginning of each level and they reappear after several minutes.-My Graphic effects turned off at some point of the game. I'm not able to see any of my spelled casts anymore  (This lasted, and still lasts forever. Restarting the game, verifying game files etc. did not help.)-Stupid AI mistakes. I don't know why, but the enemies just stopped attacking us and just idled at their place.-The camera is horrible. It separates you from previous sections, which restricts access to secret areas you missed.-You are able to walk out of the world (instant death), this is in the second level, when you turn the water into ice to be able to walk over it.-Also, we were drawn into the water by an unknown force.I do not consider this playable.

												im new to magicka, never played the first one, so my review is only based in this one.I really like, i find it challenging and fun, but its not a game you will enjoy playing alone that much, and since there are more players in the first magicka, finding someone to play with is hard.Probably gonna try the first one some day, but until now this one is pretty good.

												Many of Magicka 2's design decisions seem to have been extremely poor.In Magicka 1, the characters you played felt dangerous. In Magicka 2, they feel like bumbling idiots. Magicka 1 may have had overpowered spells, but it felt like they gave you as many tools as you wanted and said ""here's a versatile spell system, go nuts"" and balanced the game via the environment and the enemies. Magicka 2 looks like the developers thought ""we made a clunky spell system, if we make it 100% clunkier, it'll sell 100% more"".The game plays like a bad console port. The controls are clunky and incomplete on the PC version - with a controller, you use the control stick to move. On PC, you click on a point and you walk towards it until you've arrived but there's no way to cancel your movement short of diverting your current action and clicking on yourself.Continuing on the previous point, it's like the spell system was watered down to make the game more console friendly. Everything feels more sluggish than in Magicka 1 - a game where you couldn't move and cast spells at the same time, and feels like it has more pointless combinations than Magicka 1 by virtue of how they altered the spell system to handle repetitions of elements.Pursuant to the previous point, Magicka 1 didn't strictly encourage a wide vocabulary of spells, but it was fun to see what you could get away with. Magicka 2 just feels frustrating to 'play to win' and to 'play for fun' because the best spells for a situation are often from a tiny, counter-intuitive vocabulary and just spammed really fast.Overall I think that whoever developed this game has no idea of what they're doing and looks like they blew most of their budget on graphics that look outdated and didn't spend enough money actually making a game.I don't like change in general, but virtually none of the changes for Magicka 2 feels like it's trying to say ""change for the better"", and they all feel like they're saying ""change for the sake of change"".

												169 hours in Magicka 1, Magicka 2 did not live up to the original.Firstly, the game is still unoptimized. After several years of working on a new engine, I'd expect Paradox to atleast consider some of the problems Magicka 1 had faced. One of those problems include being unable to be played on a labtop/integrated graphics card. Controls are wonky, and are unable to be rebound. Why change the AOE spell cast combination? It feels very uncomfortable if you've played Magicka 1. Mouse movement is confusing to use, and difficult to switch between movement and casting orientation.Spell balancing to Wizard Wars' degree was not required. Changing lightning to override arcane was a bit much. The famous Arcane Steam Beam longer exists. Instead, you can't even mix steam with lightning anymore, along with ice and lightning. Spells are also noticeably weaker. The game is clearly meant for the PS4. Ingame options are not available. Quickcasting Magicks removes some of the aspect of memorizing certain combinations. Memorizing certain Magicks rewarded the player for putting effort into remembering a combination.In conclusion, Magicka 2 has created more problems and flaws than Magicka 1. Spells feel weak, controls are meant for controllers, keys cannot be rebound, Not optimized. If you're a fan of Wizard Wars, this game may be for you, but after I played Magicka 2, I feel that Magicka 1 will always be better.			"

												God damn. I really Wanted Magicka 2. Instead I got a dumbed down version which changed many default combos like Arcane-Lightning into chain lightning instead of a beam, the controls are just ehhh, and the shields can be walked through???? Paradox, im upset. Its just wizard wars with 5 element slots. Nothing else. and we all know that game was a fail. Stick with magicka 1.UPDATE: With friends, it Is a little better , and there is a new very OP combo with the healing and arcane beams crossing, but still, missing key Magicka features. Definitely better with friends.			"

												I want to state, that writing this review, makes me want to cry. I loved Magicka 1, I put 88 hours into that game and this is unfortunately a massive downgrade.First off, always on DRM. You lose connection while playing single player? Hope you like having to open the task manager and close down the damn game!Second, the game play is highly iterative, which is fine. I think we all just wanted more Magicka, but they've made changes to the spell system which essentially mean that not only is there less variety in terms of what you can do, but most of the spells you can create do very little damage, so you're not encouraged to experiment, which is basically the whole point!Because no spell does decent damage, you're basically keeping to the same ones over and over.Some might claim this is balanced, but it doesn't feel fun. In the first game, a fully charged rock would blast it's way through a horde of weaker enemies but in this, it not only takes forever to charge, but it bounces off the first one! This doesn't feel fun, you feel weak.They also removed alot of the ""magicks"", certain spell combinations that triggered specific effects, such as tornados or summoning zombies. So you have less variety with that as well. They can also be keybound, which lowers the skill requirement and thus, the feeling of success when you pull it off.So to recap, the magic casting system has been gutted, castrated and beaten into the ground, possibly to get the game on xbox.Having finished the game, I have to say that I'm very, very dissapointed with the lack of enemy variety. I went through the game and met less enemy types than the original and most of the enemies were cut and paste from the original name. For some reason they decided to dissapoint on enemy variety, yet remove the magicks that had really cool effects, such as vortex.I will say though, the last boss fight is pretty well designed. It played out alot like an MMO fight and even if it is a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in single player, it has good design.BUT unlike the first game, it doesn't test your ability to use various magical spells effectively. In the first game, you had a banished demon wizard (if I remember correctly) and if you didn't use certain magicks (lightning bolt and time warp), it was a really tricky fight, but you had the tools you needed. The last boss fight in this one, is more about timing and positioning, which isn't neccesarily what I wanted.The humour is still there, but if you're after that, I'd honestly suggest watching a let's play and as someone who played 88 hours of Magicka 1, that makes me weep.

												My experience in Magicka 2 vs Magicka 1.I'll start it off with the first time I played Magicka 1. The moment I started to grasp the concept of regular combinations, element combinations, and the special spell combinations, thats when I begun to experiment on so many spells (be it regular spells or the special combination spells, or both), and found it absolutely fun at how I can play the game differently each time and would still enjoy it nonetheless.Thats when I absolutely fell in-love with Magicka. It promised a sort of freedom to your utilization of these spells. And the better you got at utilizing regular combos or utilizing multiple special combination spells, the more satisfying the gameplay was.People tend to have different opinions and first impressions with this game, so I'm going to state my opinion and hope people would understand that I, as a person writing this review, do not present the entire community who plays magicka.As I have loved Magicka, I got excited with Magicka 2. It promised something a bit new. Movement while casting a spell, and I thought ""This is amazing! Just with this Magicka would be even more fun!""... I didn't pre-order. I waited about a year because I had other stuff to do. And when I was finally free, I took the chance and bought this game.The campaign was never spoiled to me. I never knew the story progression. And I certainly didn't look up all the available magicks, whether old or new in Magicka 2.So I got in here. Bought the game without hesitation, downloaded it, load it up, and played for hours.It was hard! I loved it! I was doing it alone as single player, so naturally, it was difficult progressing. And I just wanted to finish the campaign so that I can make a new game and search all the spells. And then join public games.-Now this is the part where the disappointment comes in-As the game ended, and I finally opened up my web browser to search for all the spells.I was shocked to know that so few spells were actually in the game.The old ones that I loved and even the old ones that I rarely used (but still used nonetheless) weren't there anymore.Magicka was more about weapons and dodging, and thinking of clever use with the upgraded regular spells.(Absorption aura is awesome, I'll give them that. but I now have to use more than one element multiple times just so I could be immunite to it. And  you can only ever be immune to just 1 element. And that got me sad.)The madness and chaos of using spells like Thunderstorm, Meteor shower, Vortex, Conflagaration, Phoenix, Invisibility, and even the meager Rain spell... was nowhere to be found. (I used to do Rain spell + Blizzard spell back in Magicka 1. I loved freezing my enemies)It might be found in the other modes. I don't know, I have not checked.But this wasn't the magicka I know.. The idea of making incredible combos and whatnot were slightly there.But the larger special combination-spell combos (Like Rain + Blizzard) were gone.And I couldn't help but feel, for the first time in the entirety of my Magicka gameplay experience... feel disappointed.(Again, this is just my point of view)Magicka is much more crazy now with some few added spells and new upgraded-regular elemental spells.But I think the lack of... Chaos... that the old spells gave... made Magicka lose a bit of its charm.I will still play Magicka 2. It is fun, there is no doubt about it.But I can only wish and hope.. That one day a dlc campaign will be added. And all the old spells added into the game, as well..A man can dream, right? A man can dream.I just wanted to get this off my chest.Because it just saddens me on how I miss my old spells.Well, that's all I've got for you folks. Time to jump back into it...Happy spell-ing!

Polish version is also avaible on this rewiew. Just scroll down.Magicka 2 is awesome continuation of old, good Magicka that we (mostly) know and love. Before update called ""Spell Again, Again"", the game was bad in many ways. For example there was only few Magicks (spells like revive, haste etc.) and there was no steam and ice elements. That update fixed almost everything. And the poison element has been added!Pros and cons: +Possibility of casting spells with 5 elements having a choice of 11 - water, life, shield, cold, lightning, arcane, earth, fire + steam, ice, poison and using them on several ways - front, self, area, on weapon. +Possility of playing multiplayer with wizards from entire world - up to 4 players. +Big choice of robes (+ skins), weapons and staffs, that you need to unlock (witch is fun ^^) +Game modes - Adventure and many challenges +Gamepad support. +BEAUTIFUL soundtrack and good graphic. +Humor on every step. :) -No PvP mode - this hurts me the most. :c -Completing adventure mode for the first time takes up to 4 hours. -Only few Magicks (comparing to the first game, where there was 35 of them).Summarizing the game is really cool, even if you are playing alone. About DLC - They can be a little too expensive, but if you really want to buy it! :)Polska wersja recenzjiiMagicka 2 to wspania≈Ça kontynuacja wiƒôkszo≈õci nam znajej Magicki.

												I will say this. This game is kind of based of the Wizard Wars engine wich isn't bad!But.. pooh.. this game.. I am so mixed on it.Do I recommend it.. sorta..It's still a good sequal, but it falls in the tropes of being overshined then it's prequels.So let me sum up the good and bad.Good:-Gameplay improved. Quick spells as well as manual cast is in the game. Element combining is nerfed but still great and the game feels overall more responsive. The fun thing to do is hit a death beam with a life beam to get a big boom.- Visuals are improved.-Humor is still there-Good replayablity effort in the difficulty / custom difficulty settings-Difficulty improved by mechanics. More control means harder enemies. Nothing wrong with that. You can't steam beam your way out of this game! Gotta be more creative!The Bad:-Game length. It felt shorter then the other one.-The artifical difficulty. Though it is a hard game. They sometimes ramp it up too ludicrious levels by simply putting TOO MUCH ENEMIES into the screen. Especially of different variatiies.-Game loves being wet. There are stage hazard but too many times are there puddles of water or rain or whatever to make you wet. This especially is annoying as enemies are immune to certain elements that combo with wet. While you are constantly wet! Wet immunity recommend or keep a water aura up.-Bosses. Though Some bosses are well designed mechanic wise. Overall they fall flat over it's ancestor.They don't feel epic enough from the last one or are just reskinned enemies.Sometimes stages don't even give boss fights.The worst offender is the final boss as it is gimmicky like hell and it's almost impossible to do!It involves a mechanic you never could pratice + a mechanic that was flawed.-Stage'sStages weren't that interresting to me. The Final stage was a good idea. But other wise.. it felt a little blant.Unconcluded:-StoryThe Story.. is.. well... nothing like the 1st game but interresting non the less.I can say this with non spoiler ways.""I have no idea how to feel of the ending of the game""It is one of those types of stories. Tries to laugh, but.. I couldn't laugh.. something in this story made me feel differnet and think.Overall:I wouldn't rate this game but.. for a magicka expirence it only improves on a few aspects in favor of the others.Bugs are glitches are sitll around some even from the 1st game.But it's still a more polished game in it's mechanics.For now.. I am still saying:Buy the original!This one needs some patching or some DLC to make it enjoyable.As for the final boss..It's ridiclously frustrating.. it's not even THAT HARD of a boss!It's just draining you on frustration rather then trying to kill you.

												Have you ever fallen in love with a movie or a book only to be horrendously disappointed by its low quality sequel? Well if that concept were not already introduced to gaming, Magicka 2 more than fulfills the stereotype. I was looking forward to seeing what new and exciting improvements to one of my favorite games was released only to find an extremely dumbed down cash-grab sequel. Everything I loved about the original game was‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•all over or completely removed. Lets name a few of those things:1.	No more combos- The experimentations and discovery of different combinations of magics is what got me hooked on this game in the first place. I couldn‚Äôt wait to see what new spell combinations awaited to be uncovered in Magicka 2. What were they? NOTHING! In fact, worse than nothing! The most devastatingly powerful spell combos of the previous game were not only rendered completely useless in this pathetic imitation of Magicka but the elimination of the ICE and STEAM elements cut in half the number of combinations available in the first game.  Ultimately you are stuck using the same 1 or 2 spells over and over and over and over.2.	Spell Duration: Sofar the longest spell duration I have seen (haste, armor/immunity, spell walls, etc) only lasts a few seconds. You are constantly having to recast which makes you vulnerable to attacks which totally defeats the purpose of buffing up in the first place. Not even an aoe rock barrier is useful anymore. 3.	Protection:  Physical  armor (rock/ice armor) can be cut through like butter by even the weakest enemies, not to mention there is no weight value anymore (even though it slows you down a lot). You will find yourself constantly being hurled through the air or knocked on your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•by every bit of damage that comes your way. 4.	Weak offence: Status changing effects such as cold, burn and stun may as well have been completely removed from the game. No more lighting fires and running, no more cold spells to protect yourself, no more defensive barriers, no more fun in general. 5.	AOE spells have been reduced to almost melee range. Boulder takes 10 times as long to cast. Lightning doesn‚Äôt bounce worth crap anymore. Shield walls don‚Äôt do damage. Lets face it, you are stuck using beam attacks almost exclusively now, something I hated using before.6.	Shield spell: OMG, just take the damn thing completely out of the game! Enemies walk through it like it isn‚Äôt even there. Shield have 1 purpose in Magicka 2 ‚Äì to deflect beam attacks. Wow, that‚Äôs like, 1 enemy that you will ever use it against, and it isn‚Äôt even useful then since the cast size is super tiny and it only lasts 3 freakin seconds!  7.	Mouse controls have been completely scrambled! This wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if there were some interface options that allowed you to customize which buttons did what- which there isn‚Äôt. If this were a stand-alone game, that would be ok but since it is a sequel  you cant jump back and forth between each game without having to re-learn the controls. 8.	Dumbed-down big magicks: Hot keys? Really? REALLY? What differentiated the pros from the newbs of Magicka 1 is their ability to remember and speedily cast difficult big magick combos. Now just assign them to buttons 1-4 and press once. No skill required.  "

												Pros:-Better Graphics (obviously)-More combinations of elements-More of the combinations have their own unique looks-Extremely easy to play online-You can shortcut 4 Super Magicks on numbers 1, 2, 3, 4-Variety of robes, swords and staves to choose (must unlock)-As in the MOBA version of Magicka, your gear will give you both strengths and weaknesses.Cons:-No Arena (survival)-No PVP (there's a free pvp only Magicka to make up for that)-Only my Xbox Controller worked, none of my USB controllers did.-Relatively Short-Reduced amount of Super Magicks-Only the main character will be saved, the others won't retain customization and will be named (Characters guest 1, 2...)Conclusion:It's a great, fun, casual game. Some extra work could be done, and you shouldn't expect every feature of Magicka 1, but the fun is still here.			"

												This sequel took everything I loved about the game... the overpowered spells to kill your friends with, the unique weapons, useful staffs, secret areas, funny story, the hilarious references to other games and abandoned it all.  There are few weapons, the story isn't engaging, the spell casting is much harder with cooldowns between spells, and the bad guys end up doing most of the damage to each other.  Single player is all about dying and reviving your fairy while letting the bad guys do the work.  Instead of being a cool wizard, your character is a wimpy slow moving cooldown king that can't get damage in edgewize. I haven't done multiplayer yet but single player was so bad I won't recomment that my friends buy the game to let me even try the co-op mode because single player was that horrible.Two thumbs down			"

												Magicka 2 makes me feel... Betrayed. Kind of.Changes are questionable at best.Humour... A bit more agressive. Not offensive, agressive. First magicka was like a shy, clunky but funny wizard, who isn't takes himself too serious. By the times of the sequel he bought a red nose, bright stupid robe and megaphone and roams the streets, screaming ""LOOK I'MA CLUMSY WIZARD! LAUGH!""Point: Most of jokes there have no point.Okay, maybe this one isn't correct, and first game was just as screaming ""I'M FUNNY"", and it's my nostalgic-o-filter removed any bad memories. Soo, this part will be in the final score, but have no influence on it.Magic system changes... Huge nerf hit the best steam-shock-arcane and ice-earth combos. R.I.P. my only usable lategame/DLC spells. Basic wind attack are magicka now. Also, cooldowns for everything. EVERYTHING.They put a high priority in nerfs. Are we playing serious PvE MOBA now? ..wait, aren't those two terms mutually exclusive?..Point: Unnecessary, even stupid changes.Difficulty... I was unable to pass trough a some point where you should spin a water wheel. Why? I was alone. Enemies keep spawning endlessly, and water wheel needs to be constantly showered for... For at least 15 seconds, I guess. More than enough for crabs to butcher a player.Point: Simply unplayable at singleplayer. Like at all. Looks like that part with water wheel got changed a bit, with flow of crabs replaced by a few scripted bunches. That point will be rewritten after I make it to the end. Still, no one of my friends wants to buy it now. Interface and controls... My god.Warning: lots of bunnies ahead.First. What the bunny is this? Hotbar? It's just... Wrong. Magicka is a game about pure button mashing, with disadvantage of high error chance being an important part of the first game. It's like for a fighting game devs to include hotkeys for instant combo attacks.Second. What the bunny is wrong with this camera? At the moment battle beguns it moves to the monsters, basically instantly cornering player with enemies all over the screen. That's bunny beautiful.Third. What is this, strafing? Okay, where is my covers, regeneration, machinegun and first-person view?Games where attack (shot) happens when you press mouse button may need strafing. Games where attack (boulder throw) happens after you release mouse button should NOT have strafing. It's bunny annoying to aim.Fourth. Loading screens. Menus. Tips.Ahem. Are you... Wait a second.Ahem.ARE YOU BUNNY KIDDING ME?! IF DEVELOPERS ARE TO BUNNY LAZY TO SIT TEN MINUTES IN A BUNNY IMAGE EDITOR AND MAKE A TWO BUNNY SEPARATE ""Press X to continue"" IMAGES FOR PC AND CONSOLE, THEY SHOULD ALREADY CONSIDER FINDING A NEW BUNNY JOB. Mostly because such laziness shows how much they care about what are they doing. It's literally twenty minutes of work at worst, and it pokes in the eyes of every player from every bunny loading screen!Okay, maybe it was due to some technical limitations. Then I'm sorry.BUT IT ISN'T BUNNY 80s, AND WE AREN'T PLAYING 8-bit CONSOLE GAMES, ARE WE?Point: Embarrassing. Ugly status effects. Annoying strafing. And I don't want to know what button I should press on gamepad my PC don't have.Graphics... Okay, spells looks cooler than in first game. But they are just taken from Magicka: WW, aren't they?Point: Better than in first game, same as in MWW. Nothing looks improved.Final scores:  Element Effect   Humour Vlad/10   Magic changes Nerf/10   Difficulty Alone/10   Interface and controls Bunny/10   Graphics MWW/10   Combination of those 5 elements? Preordered it 3 months ago and almost sorry about it now.  "

												I've never played any other games in the series, so I can't make comparisons to previous games in the series. But just as I experienced it, the spell system was exhilarating, and exploring more of the seemingly infinite combinations kept the game refreshing. The spell effects are satisfying: if you combine poison and ice, you get poison icicles!The only criticism that I'd have is for the solo mode. Solo play is smooth for the most part, but it can be a bit frustrating when you're stuck on one particular part of the story. They have made it so that you are pretty much guarenteed to win eventually, but the worst-case scenario is ressing, doing a quick W-A-[space], and then dying again (repeat) without causing much damage at all. It's more noticable when the enemies have health regen, e.g. in the harder difficulties.Magicka 2 is fun to play with friends. (Sorry Bob, that high-velocity rock to the back of your head was an ""accident"".) The online community is great as well‚Äîyou might be worried that there'd be trolls all over the place, but most people are reasonable and cooperative.Recommended.			"

												I was immensely excited about Magicka 2 when I heard it announced. I LOVED the first game. I loved everything ABOUT it. The insanely powerful spells, the magic combos, the insane and chaotic difficulty...This one has... none of that. You get a max limit of spells, all on a cooldown. The combos are weaker and having the spells as they are means you don't even need to do the combos to really cast them (quick cast!).The fights are.... the last fight is just a game of ""soccer"" against a little kid in between kiting a golem. Where is the challenge? Half the enemies kill each other, so what's the point of you being there? The campaign I finished in like two hours, and I felt no real sense of epic quest like I did in the first one. It has funny moments, sure, but you basically wandered around a bunch, then you went and imprisoned a little kid forever and it's not entirely explained what they did wrong in the first place. But eh. If you like good magic games... go play the original.			"

												Simply put, this game is made for the guys who come over from wizard wars and not from the first magicka!Disclaimer i played until i got to the first boss (the generals of khan) and then i just quitted the game because it was so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• boring.EDIT: i completed the game and most of my points still stand as they are now. This would have been a great game if the first magicka didn't exsist, but it does so i just can 't recommend the game.cons: - MUCH LESS spell combinations then the first magicka.- All the weapons feel the same! Even wizard wars got this right, how could they f this up? - No F*CKING REBINDABLE KEYS, nuff said! ( even the first one and wizards wars has this!)- Also linked to the 1st con: water and frost doesn't create ice and the same for water and fire whit steam.- Ice element is pretty much useless now, rock is almost every time a better and quicker choise- Weapon enchantmenst are dumbed down also.- fast casting makes remembering and casting magicks pretty damn useless. and the focus system doesn't help either!- floaty controlls (makes me alway walk into the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• water and that insta kills me)- Already encounterd a few annoying bugs- First boss uses cheap tricks to win, knocking you constanly down is not really a 'hard' fight when you most of the time cannot defend yourself from it!- Easter eggs are just not the same as in the previous game! the ones i found so far are just there. you don't get an achievment or a notification or anything they just simply stand there. and maybe do somethign when you talk to themEDIT:- A lot of the deaths i encounterd in the game was cause by knockback monsters flinging your charachter of the brige/screen. the secodn level is the best example of this: smal briges riddelt with monster that kamikaze to your character knocking them off the brige.- they nerfed the standart spell but instead they put in OP staff that pretty much give the same effect as the steam lighting spell did in the original but with less button presses- No more staff specialities, no liberty grenade no aura, no elemental aura. all the items have passive bonuses, with this staff you do more fire damage with this staff you do more cold damage. It is boring and lazy! Pros:- pretty graphics- I do like the absorbtion aura, well that the only neat idea i have found in this game so far.EDIT:- much better chekpoint systemIn short, it still is a solid game but don't play it if you loved the original magcika! it is just allround a better game then this game. especially if you want to feel like an allpowerfull wizard! yes it may have some totaly op spells but that just adds to the charm of the game. while this one is better if you just want to play it casually whitout thinking to much about spell combinations. In other words if you wnat a great game, buy magcika 1. If you wnat a gme where you don't need to think baout anything and just shoot away buy this game or the next fps.PS: i don't get why people find his a 'hard' game the first levels are easier then the original ones. as a veteran player i just cruised trough then. most of the time i died was because i fell in the water because of the floaty movement.

												So what i really think about Magicka 2 compared to Magicka pros : -Better graphics / art style-Amazing soundtrack-Crazy looking new abilities and quick cast options-The maps can be massively explored-Weapons and staff's have benefits and detrements instead of just elemental shields or quick cast spells (the quick cast spells from the wands in Magicka have been moved to the quick cast buttons 1,2,3,4 instead of middle buttoning with a staff)-Player customizability is REALLY good.cons: -AoE is really really small, it pretty much got nerfed...-Cant spam abilities as fast as Magicka, theres a few milli seconds worth of delay between ability casts (minor con)-The single self shield got nerfed, and the barrier spells got nerfed (stone walls with/or withought elements)-Less magicks, cant combine water + fire or water + ice to create 1 new element (so less space in queu)All in all, i was really debating buying Magicka 2. But its a must buy if you want to continue with the story, cause other than the few cons, the game is really fun.My final rating would be a 7/10Forgot to mention you can blow up sharks and horses now.10/10 would blow again.EDITS: additions to cons, pros			"

												It is been 4 years since the first game in this franchise took the world by storm. Its gem you ask? The unique spellcasting mechanic that is. In Magicka you could combine 8 elements to create unique spells to fight with. Together with 4 ways to cast them. Death or Life turns every spell into a beam, add shield to create bombs, or use shield without it to create a wall. Magicka 2 redesigned this system with what they have learned from this games multiplayer counterpart Magicka: Wizard Wars. They have tried to get rid of the redundancy of spells present in preceding titles. They did a sufficient job, Death used to removes lightning unique feature of hopping from enemy to enemy. Magicks are available to cast directly instead of having to sequence the elements, although the option is still available and reduces the cool down timer significantly. while having to  It is all wrapped in a new story which feels much more alive than before. And yes it is still packed with popular references and memes.However the game is still packed with unused mechanics, quite a shame. The game never forces you to think of new spells. Enemies have nothing more than a weakness or strength. This, together with the short tutorial forcing player to remember everything in one go. Results in some unsatisfying gameplay, repeating one spell over and over again. Sadly  people never use complex combination like ice or steam because a simple spell does the job just as well. The same goes for the different ways to cast a spell, cast around you and cast weapon are completely abandoned as soon as the tutorial finishes.This is all not to say that I didn't enjoy the game! The game is fantastic and with a group of friends turns in one of the most hectic games to date. The game stand firm in line of the Magicka series and deserves a strong recommendation. I just hope the developers figure out a way to reduce redundancy even more, may there ever be another game. "

												After playing around in Magicka 2 for a few hours I found it to be a enjoyably chaotic experience. The game teaches you the basics of spell casting, and introduces the different core concepts, but doesn't hold your hand. You're expected to experiment and learn magic combinations, usually by accidentally killing yourself and/or your friends. It also does a good job of forcing you to adapt by introducing new enemies and challenges which may be resistant, or immune, to certain elements, forcing you to change on the fly.I played Majicka 1 and, although I enjoyed it, would never consider it a favorite of mine. The ability to move while casting added in Magicka 2 is a huge improvement, IMO. It gives the combat a more frantic feel, and seems to increase the number of 'accidents' in multiplayer, especially when mines are involved. Many people are upset at the fact that you can only have 5 spell elements at the same time, instead of 7, lowering the total number of possible spells. I'm on the fence about this. On the one hand there are fewer game changing spell combinations available, but on the other hand I never used 90% of them in the first game. Quite a few still exist, but they're require less elements to cast and many of them have been added to a quick cast system for emergencies. It's much better for newer players to pick up but still allows skilled players to use powerful spells without assistance.One of the things that doesn't quite seem up to Magicka 1's level is the writing. Magicka 1 was overflowing with jokes, references and gags. Some of that still exists here, but it's more spread out and subtle (I use that word loosely, and in relation to the first game). The entire world is a parody of... well, everything and unless you've played the first game you'll probably miss some things.When you plan to play Magicka 2, you should definitely try to play in a group. You CAN play solo, but half the fun comes from all the chaos generated from multiple players scrambling over each other to survive.  *NOTE* I was mostly playing a game with either 2 or 3 players and it seemed like the difficulty in a 3 player game rose disproportionately. May have been a skill issue, or game might not be properly balanced for 3 people, not sure.If you've never played Magicka 1 I would definitely give Magicka 2 a try. It's not necessarily a better game, but easier to get into and more forgiving early on. I would suggest Magicka 1 veterans to try it, but I realize not everyone will like it. The changes between 1 and 2, especially the ability to cast on the move, make a huge difference and not everyone likes that.I urge those that are on the fence, or hated magicka 1, to give Magicka 2 a try. $15 less than most AAA DLC these days, and compeditive to most Indie titles. If you like it I guarantee you'll get more than your money's worth.			"

												Finished the single-player with other 2 friends, it's fun! I'd recommend disabling the companion as this trivializes a lot of the content, we ended up doing so half-way through the game.So what is Magicka 2? it's a 1-4 player action spellcasting game with silly jokes and cultural references, you have 8 spells to combine in creative ways, want mines that heal you? combine ""Shield with Life"" want to throw a fiery rock? Rock and Fire will do the trick! and so on...They seem to have simplified the game a little bit, I assume this is because there's now a console version to worry about which might dissapoint a lot of fans of the original game.So do I recommend giving this a try? yeah, for the asking price it has enough content and fun to get you through it, however I felt that the first game had better story/humor and was lenghtier but at the same time it was a buggy mess, crashed a lot and the netcode was broken.Give it a go if you have friends to play this with! it makes for a fun weekend of chaos! ;)			"

It lacks the ""oomph"" of the original. It inherits more from Wizard Wars (bad) than the original (brilliant) unfortunately. If you've never played either, go buy the original first. "

												As fun as it is, I play solo mainly and with my experience so far playing solo is half-impossible. There are situations such as bull charges instantly jet-planing you off cliffs, getting walled with 15 enemies around you, and other instances where there is close to absolutely nothing you can do to save yourself, and since you only get 2 chances to live before you restart, this gets very aggravating. It wouldn't be a problem if the spells that do damage did take as much time to cast, but due to to that, the challenge of actually winning isn't as enjoyable due to how much strain you have to pull off just to live for more than 30 seconds.

												Magicka 2 is great, but it's lacking content.A lot of people are complaining that the spells aren't off the walls as magicka but really there was only 4 crazy spell combos in Magicka, the difference here is Magicka 2 balanced a lot of it; it could sound bad if you want to feel like a wizard bad‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•but they've added larger hordes of enemies and if you do it right, and it's harder to cast perfectly (since enemies are as fast as you), killing every crab chasing you feels amazing.The magicks global cool down feels really bad as a veteran Magicka player but I can understand it from a gameplay perspective, without it you can revive your entire party in a second making challenges and the campaign a joke with  2 - 4 people; though if I'm getting into that Magicka 2 adds ""familiars"" that revive you and you can revive it assuming you stay alive for the duration of the invicibility frames. The quick cast system is obviously catering twards noobs though they don't impose on better players and can infact be used in a sort of ""hidden tech"" fashion to allow a burst of spam casting.If you want large amount of story mission this game will not improve on that, but it feels more varied since your arsenal needs to include more than the ""EQRASR"" pillars of death. Sheilds are less about forcing as many elements into one as you can and more about what is actively going turn you to mush.OVERALL: I think this game is an improvement but it isn't bolting off starting line, We need more levels and arenas.

												Time passes, opinion's change. At the begining, I found this game to be quite fun and good, even with it's issues. Such as:-The game feeling more like Wizard wars than the Magicka we loved-Spells don't feel that creative-Story isn't as funny or appealing as the previous game-Too little unlockables-Over all feels lacky and less creative.In my opinion the game still has it's goods, but it's just not magicka, and it is still full of issues. Mainly those where Melee hits don't register, spells, you can't fuse them like you could, previously... (I think this was patched) But when you use Lightning and Arcane (or death), it makes a shock effect, instead of an electric beam. We loved the electric beam. Taking that away was a horrible choice.Anyway, the map feels less interactive and much more linear than the previous one. Feels ... Just less interesting, and even the interesting parts of it are just, there. ""Fancy castle? Looks like old times? Feels the same as going through the beach map."" They are smaller too, and the visuals, despite being good, I won't lie... It's not Magicka 1. It's Magicka Wizard Wars The story mode.There are many other issues, but these are the ones I felt like I should talk about more.In the end, I still play this game ocasionally, still fun ocasionally, but only for true Magicka fans, that were able to beat even this crappier version of the game we loved so much.Rating: 1 ""Death Electric beam"" out of ""One thousand sad Wizards""Paradox, fix your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•for Magicka 3			"

												They need to scale up the boundaries or scale down the players and npcs the space is too cramped and tking is out of control. The locked team cam is supremely annoying you can't even see whats firing at you if you have someone lagging behind. I like the game though and I hope they address these issues in future patches.

												+ Improved net code and stability (played thro campaign without crashes or connection issues, that alone says alot)+ Same good humor (Dem finnish-gibberish Dwarfs. SAUNAH!)+ Able to choose your robe, melee weapon and staff before starting the game (No need to worry about your stuff going thro floors or grounds when dying, getting resurrect let's you keep your stuff you pick from loadout screen)+ Soundtrack (I always loved magicka series music, despite majority not being too memorable)+ Artifacts+ Closer to wizard wars (more balanced than first magicka)-  Closer to wizard wars (some hilarious game breaking spell combos aren't possible anymore and element combinations are somewhat limited)-  Movement can be quite slippery (feel like someone smeared bacon grease on my feet)-  Somewhat awkward camera (getting blocked by HUD or sitting edge of the screen, unable to see what you're doing)-  Still no vampires (I am suspicious about Vlad tho...)As good as Magicka 1? not really. but doesn't come far from behind and in my opinion it's worthy of an sequel. Get some friends, and you will have good times on the land of Midg√•rd.			"

The gameplay is not that difficult, there's pretty huge variety of spells you can use. You will always find the one you like best!Hours will pass by in a wink if you will start it.Friendship and betrayed are born here. So keep in mind not to kill your friends too much here.I do recommend this game for a party game or just to make somebody laugh.			"

												Coming right off of Magicka 1, this is turning out to be a disappointment. Spells feel underpowered. Enemies move too fast and  swarm around you constantly. The UI overlay sometimes kills you by blocking your player from view. Spell orb selection is faster (at least on a controller) but doesn't stick in muscle memory like it did in M1. Customization of additional players in local co-op seems to be lost between gaming sessions, and you can't change these players' names (this worked in M1 too). A lot of minor frustrations that add up and ruins a game that could have been great.			"

												Magicka 2... what to say... I would rate the game as ""playable"" but thats about it. Overall the game feels really bad and I will try to explain why.1. StoryThe story of Magicka 2 is there but it doesnt really set in. In Magicka 1 they take their time to tell you the story and after each level you get these nice little scenes in the book where Vlad speaks to you. Magicka 2 has none of that, the story just gets told on the go in a blunt and shallow manner that makes your journey to save the world (again) feel like doing some sort of boring sidequest you wouldnt even bother to read what its plot is. The ending of the story is also very anticlimatic and doesnt feel like you finished the game at all. The story starts slow, doesnt build up, misses a climax and then just ends.2. CombatCombat in Magicka 2 is fast paced and action oriented. Sounds like fun but it really isnt. Casting spells is a major part of the game since they have this unique element system but you dont really have the time to enjoy it. Almost all enemies in the game are really fast and come in numbers, they will surround and kill you unless you cast defensive spells but that will just buy you time. AoE works in the beginning stages but later on with harder enemies they will just outdamage you.So what to do? Magicks. About 80% of all my castings in the game were Magicks, as they can be done quick with the new quick-cast for Magicks and some of them are ludicrously strong and will finish off all enemies after 2-3 casts if you use the right ones. Also you will have to teleport a lot.So instead of using this great combinationsystem with the elements you just spam the numberkeys 1, 2, 3 and 4 and use a shield or healing element occasionally to stay alive.3. Enemy DesignThe enemies in Magika 2 feel too fast and too strong, the elemental resistances some of them have are understandable but there are some questionable/random resistances. Some enemies have annoying attacks that are hard to avoid unless you teleport.Bosses are in the game but they feel like unimportant Minibosses. The music, their appearance and their mechanics dont quite generate the feel of a bossfight. There arent that many too and some of them appear repeatedly.The last boss is also very boring and either a pest or as easy as killing a single goblin. Nowhere near Grimnir and Assatur.--I love Magicka and I really wanted to like Magicka 2 but after the first level I was already thinking ""Just play through it quickly so you can put it aside forever"" since the combat was unenjoyable and the whole game just felt boring.

												   (This comes from the point of view of someone who played magicka one, and wizard wars.)Pros.    The new ai is great. faster paced monsters and battles, makes for an exciting expierience. There is a decent variety of monsters for the relatively short campaign.    Similar yet different humour than magicka 1. Laughter may vary, but I enjoyed it.    Not mentioned a lot, but i like the method for changing difficulty by adding different talsimany things. bananas difficulty looks like a hell a lot of fun with 300% friendly fire >:)    Lots of fun easter eggs to find off main path.    Graphics are awsome. A lot of attention to detail in every level.    Casting while moving was carried over wizard wars. 10/10 would kite again. Opens up new strategies, but came with a longer charge on projectiles.Cons   Campaign felt kind of short and wasn't as convuluted and strong as magicka one. With that said I will probably play through it multiple times at different difficulties with different people. (just completed a solo run). (also the unlocking of new items, and challenge levels give the title a little more meat to chew through).   Just like Magicka 1 the expansions will probably all be paid dlc, which sucks.   The higher level magicks are given a coolsown, andcan be activated through a button. You can still qeue elements to cast the spell, which effectivle gives you more spells on your hotbar and can be faster or add more of a challenge. The cooldown is honestly short enough where I didn't notice it (except for revive) but I rarely used magics in either magicka.Other comments   The spell system changes for magicka 2 are not as big of a deal to me as made out by other people.The big difference is you cant combine steam and lightning or ice in the same spell, so comboing spells is more important now than finding your favorite op spell.   The companions don't get in the way and are basically only there to revive you. Solo run became a lot easier when I realized I could revive them after they used up there rivive on me.   There is this one battle early on with a jamming song replayed in the credits, best part of the game. I wish the song and the battle lasted forever. I can see how other people might be dissapointed by change, but I'm not. Nostalgia got in the way of other people, but the mechanics are solid and my biggest complaints are with the plot and the campaign itself. "

												I played through Magicka 1, I beat it. I played it, and I played how I wanted to play. I used many magicks and spells to defeat many foes. It was an exhilarating, humorous, and wondorous experiance. A little while after beating the campaign, I was bordely browsing the Store. I saw this game had a sequel, so, immediatley, I bought it. What I found was a subpar destruction of the play-your-way magicka 1. It was now, not so good. The campaign is riddled with forced humour, where as Magicka 1, the humour felt natural. Like it was made by a bunch of close friends, joking about. Not anymore. Now, it was a good campaign. Although the only entertaining joke I got was 2 people who wanted to mary horses. Might have just been the same guy, actually. But, now that's all humour, what about the gameplay? Turds compared to magicka 1. It was no longer this, play-your-way game. But this thing where the players have next to no tools. Where, rain can make many wizards near useless. And others shake in their boots. Before, there was a way to work around rain. Nullify, AOE sheild + dry off, Arcane. Now, no nullify, your sheild is broken with little to no effort, and it seems they want to force you to use Arcane. If you couldn't use Arcane, you couldn't play in this game. Meanwhile, in Magicka 1, you could cast many spells and magicks without even needing it. Magicka 2 builds up disruption, this ancient spell which makes people drop magicks at will as better than Vortex, if I had Vortex, I would've beaten the final boss without trying. They removed freedom, and nerfed what you have.In short, if you want more magicka 1, turn around. If you are new, play magicka 1. Screw this game where the only way to win is to spam revive because you just got one hit by the final boss.			"

Learn to Spell Again!First, if you are not absolutely a fan of Magicka, you can not love this game too much. But if you're a Magicka fan, why are you still waiting to buy Magicka 2?Magicka 2, was shorter than the first game. If you search secret places, weapons, staffs, etc, you can finish in 9-10 hours. But if you want to finish doing all the achievements, it will take more hours or days. After finishing the game it does not end anything. It allows you to play Challanges mission more.Another favorite of Magicka series of humorous conversation to occur as well. In addition to selecting various artifacts you can make the game funnier or more difficult.  Better Graphics Better Gameplay Better Enemies Better SPELL EFFECTS! HELL YEAH..! Meh.. Good story. Better MusicNOTE: Vlad is not a vampire!Thanks Paradox Interactive Team and if you buy Magicka 2, have fun ;) "

Edit: Some of the best spells are cast as an aoe, however probably 50% of the time my shift key doesn't register and I end up killing myself because for some reason they put aoe on the same key as self cast.

												Is Magicka 2 different from Magicka 1? Yes, in some ways.Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily. It may be more approachable for people using gamepads, but using a keyboard and mouse, I can still use all the Magicks I know by heart whenever I want.The most important thing is: Magicka 2 is just as hilarious as the first one and I still kill my friends almost as often as I kill myself. And occasionally, usually by accident, I even manage to take some goblins with me.The people whining about how the game was ""dumbed down"" mostly seem to be the exact same people who are complaining that they can't fry everything in their path using only QFASA for the whole game. Yes, the mechanics changed a bit. It's ""Learn to spell AGAIN"" after all - it's right there in the bloody title. You have to figure out some new spell combinations. So what? It's fun. It's challenging. THE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING COOP WORKS! Loading screens last about half a second instead of five minutes. The game doesn't crash randomly and refuse to let me rejoin my friends. It's all I ever wanted from Magicka. I could even compare my stats to those of my friends! And I totally would if I didn't have to shamelessly lie about them because, in case I hadn't mentioned, I die. A lot. By dropping rocks on my head, crabs eating my face, and setting fire to my own sorry‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• So I guess it's not that different from Magicka 1 after all...			"

I prefer to write reviews based on a game's own merit, rather than comparing it to it's predecessors or other games.Pros:The game is fast paced and challenging in certain situations.The elements in the game are relatively well balanced. There is oftentimes no catch-all spell that solves every problem.The major boss fight is significantly difficult, but not punishing.Magickas do not need to be memorized, although it is beneficial if you do so.Lots of unlocks and 'artifacts' to diversify your game and lengthen play-time.Everything is deadlier in it's base form, meaning that battles are quicker, and the game gets boring less quickly.Boss battles to get awesome items. Good idea!ConsUniversal Magick cooldown. Not a good idea. Players with quick fingers should be rewarded, not punished.There aren't a lot of Magicks. More magicks would mean more diversity of spells in the game.All summonable minions die in about 5 seconds. They're not worth summoning.Some items make the Death element the catch-all spell for everything.The most useful and complex spell is easily cast within 5 minutes of starting the game. It does not need to be discovered, and no experimentation is necessary. In other words, there's no learning curve.The game feels 'dumb'. Everything is a cinch, and nothing is genuinely challenging until you get to the final boss.Enemies have access to powers you can never hope to use.The boss fight puzzle's solution is thrown at the player in big bold letters. It's easy to understand what needs to happen, but the Disruption spell has about a 2 second warmup phase, and by that time the beam to be blocked is empty. Easy solution, but difficult execution. I would rather there be multiple solutions.The main story is far too short.Elements don't combine. Steam and Ice are weaker than fire, cold, and water alone because they use less elements. Furthermore, why not other combinations? Fire+Earth= Lava, Life+Earth grows tanglevines, for examples. If you're not going to give us a lot of useful magicks, then increase the diversity of ordinary spells.You have to re-do the 10 minute boss fight every time you die in the middle. It requires attempt after attempt after attempt after attempt just because you keep respawning at the beginning of the 4 stage fight.Enemies summon insta-kill spells on top of player, no chance to save except through memorization of the fight.Built for console. Really, this game was never meant to play on a console, and it shouldn't be dumbed down in order to be playable on a PS4.Compared to the original title:Faster paceRuns better on most systemsDeadlier base forms of spellsNo combining elements upon summoningFewer magicksClick-and-hold healing makes for less spamming.Fewer and less useful items and staves.Easier bosses (except for the last one).Honestly, the first game was a lot better. However, you get what you pay for, and this title is worth about $15. I reccomend this game for anyone looking for a cheap way to kill 3 hours, nothing more.			"

												~(*please note anything in this was fixed. I'll give props that they fixed that issue and hell even added a new element, I played al little more and at the time of this edit I still find it to be hot garbage*)~Magicka 2 can be summed up in one word, disapointing.All the mechanics work find and all of the bugs have been fixed.  Net code also works properly for once.  The artifacts seem to add to the gameplay (some may say to much) and do a few cool things.  However Paradox made some real stupid ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing decisions in the process of making this game.   Lets start with the elements.  ~(*IN order to create steam you need fire and water, in the old game this would make it take up one slot now it just shows as fire and water.  NOT ONLY does this take up 2 slots out of your 5 but gets rid of any synergies you could have.*)~  You can no longer add lighting to steam and other suck combinations.  Ice has similar problems.  All spells have been nerfed that are not using the space bars or hot keys.  No longer can you do some crazy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•combination.  It is all sub par, you used to feel like an irresponsable untrained wizard who would often blow them selves sky high.  Now your a sub par piece of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  So if you want any cool spells you have to rely on any books you may find.     Artifacts suffer from they are the only thing you should really know as differnet they have been marketed to there defeat. Artifacts act as a custom difficulty, you can get a certain health percentage, damage done/dealt, also there are a few good gimmick ones. You unlock artifacts by playing the game and completing challenges. Do I think they add replaybility value?  Yes, but not much.  I do have a gripe with them however.  Artifacts don't work as a slider like you think they may, but instead are individuals.  Let me explain:  Say I have a #3 life boost, that will give 150% to life spells.  In order to get a 200% boost I would need to get life boost #5.   This leads to a lot of grinding.  Though you can't get copies where you get the artifacts you want you have to figure out. IF your like me and are not a fan of certain gimics and cosmetic changes when you unlock the wrong one you just get upset.  Finally if you use a custom set of artifacts, which you can have up to 6 active at a time, you cannot unlock anything.  I can understand why that is so, but if your like me I actually tried to set the game to the most like the older one as i could.   Lastly I would like to mention campaign has parts in it where the combat can drag on (specifically a gate where you have to spam the same spell over and over, while fighting enemies.)  They do this a lot in the first game but it felt fun to do this you just drag on to the next level and hope it gets better, so far it hasn't.     There is a limit to the spells.  and where they dumbed it down for ps4 really shows.  The humor is ok in this game.  Some lines are pretty damn good, and the game looks great aesthetically and graphics wise.  I feel like I want to like this game But i simply cannot.  I'm to focused on how much the gameplay lacks and most of which is fun.  Great I'm an average everyday wizard who has one or two good spells.The original game was very buggy and still is, but is extremely fun.  Anyone who has played the original should not buy this game there are so many little nitpicks I could choose to talk about and everyone who played the previous game would know what I'm talking about.  If you really want to get this game then wait till it is on sale.  It is extremely hard for me to say that a 15 game is worth less than the original, but it is.  Hopefully in the future Paradox will listen to people who have bought the game.  Till then I am going to recommend the original over this any day.PS: I hope you found this review helpful, again these are opinions and say what you will.  Also sorry if it was a bit of a read, Cheers ;)			"

												I absolutely loved Magicka 1!!! When I heard that 2 was coming out I was so excited.But in my mind I feared that it'd end up ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like Wizard Wars with just 3 elements at a time. In the end it wasn't that bad but because water + cold (water + fire too) doesn't fuse into one element it limits the amount of spells you can do. So now there is not lightning with steam or lightning with ice for epic damage. Then the camera is zoomed out but at the same time platforms are crammed and shrunk so it's a complete slaughterfest when a horde comes at you. Plus you just slide around stupidly. Everything's been watered down. That's not the Magicka I know and love. This could be great if they touched it up a little.			"

												A bad remake of Magicka 1.The whole game is just a huge zerg and troll of other players... casts deal no dmg, way less combos possible, no real tactical aspects anymore (f.e. a frozen person doesn't gain more dmg by blunt dmg such as stone or meele weapons, and ur able to walk right through a shield + u cant hold it up by pressing space),Furthermore magicks now r mostly casted by pressing 1-4 as in wizard wars (which i also wouldnt recommend) etc. pp.. At least they havent lost their humor.All in all i would have prefered the old game with a new campaign instead of a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• new game.Storyline all in all (with troll and being noobish) = 5hours			"

												If you have played Magicka 1 before, you are going to be dissapointed about some things, like steam and ice not being separate elements. If you have never played Magicka befor, go get this game ASAP. This is like comparing Dark Souls 1 and 2. Magicka 1 is superior in many aspects, and is overall superior, yet Magicka 2 brings many refreshing mechanics and element combinations with some different results. It also has the artifact system, which increases replayability. This is actually my first review ever, so I don't really know if I was convincing or not, but this game is great and doesn't deserve all the negative reviews.EDIT: Alright, with the new update all the issues I had with the game have been corrected. The ONLY thing I dislike about the new update is the effect of projectiles charged with arcane/death. Instead of the normal effects of red and black (which are cool as hell) it's just a red light, similar to the one in Magicka 1. But it's just a detail, I recommend this game to anyone as it is now.

GRAPHICSLook gorgeous and have more feel fluid than magicka 1 (we don't need beastly PC)MULTIPLAYERnow other player can join even the game in the middle of a level, but i rarely find other player host the game.i'am not sure if multiplayer need to be in the same area (such as asia, etc).INOVATIONThere not much something new in the game, cuz from magicka 1 mostly the game have same mechanics (i just find 1 different combination from magicka 1 it's a poison) but combination magicks still amaze me, it looks awesome. of course we want many different combination magick making the game more fun.Staff have no active skill, make us feel normal using staff, cuz usually legendary like staff have special power.Enemy variety is so low, it feels like we are against troll half the game.CHARACTERWe now can choose our own robe (with different skin), staff, and weapon. design our character make it look cool and of course we can make strategy using benefit we get from our robe, staff, and weapon.BALANCEEnemies become a bit stronger and have improved AI, we now have a quickslot for magick (having longer cooldown than manually casting it). Death spell feel like to strong, almost all the level can beaten by using death magic alone.			"

												I recommend this game, but not very strongly. It's a magicka game, but it plays little like the first one. Something about the controls makes it feel off and I can't put my finger on how to fix it. Another major difference is that this is hordes of enemies, all the time. I don't know if the number of enemies scales off of how many peopke you have but with 3 people it was impossible to stay alive for more than a minute. There is lots of the same mini-boss at times, along with constant hordes of enemies. Also there is much less veriety in the weapons available to be picked up, where as in magicka 1 almost every weapon that wasn't bigger than you were was able to be picked up. Overall it has the humor of the original, but not close to the level of gameplay, and that fact is going to couteract the humor, extremely funny as it is.			"

												(Beware, drunken review)GENERAL BITS AND RANDOM THOUGHTS:Look I'll put it bluntly. If you liked magicka 1 you'll like 2. If you are simply hanging on spell ""balance"" it will never exist, just like in the first game. Balance is a finicky thing, and the game is not fun because the spells are balanced, it's fun because of the writing and the co-op and the the cheesy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•you can pull. If you are up for more of the same that made magicka 1 fun, but with many improvements, it's all here. The silly memes, the silly puns, the overpowered spellcasting that you use to cheese bosses with, the overkill stuff that you can pull on your friends for the lulz. The BOOM headshot kills. The killing yourself because you pressed the wrong button. All here.A few bits I must point out. The graphics are... different, better to be honest, the game looks a lot more fleshed out graphics and  world wise than the first ever was. Also, the gameplay tweaks for returning players feel like godsends (casting and moving especially). They also changed some stuff, like how shields work and the wards... for me all good changes, the game directs you to be more cerebral on your spell casting. Spam is still there but a lot harder to pull and you need to change it acording to what you are fighting. The skill ceiling is raised. Still made it good to play by newer players. Pretty impressive.Controls are mostly the same,‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on the controller and excellent on the keyboard. It may be just me on this one actually, but I never""clicked"" with the gamepad controls. I've played with people that do, don't take my word on that one, try both if you can.The boss fights are mostly the same cluster‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s of everything in the level you played before. Not a bad thing, it's just how the bosses play. I quite like that there seems to be more ""mini"" bosses.That's about it. If you are a returning player, and liked the first one.

But to master it takes time. No issue there.THE OPTIONS:Nothing missing here that I can tell. Runs well on win 7 and 10. Runs well on both machines I tried and if you tweak the settings will run on lower end machines no prob. 60 fps solid on my rig, Never seen a crash either. And even on low it will look decent. You can go up to silly resolutions and such. Jolly good stuff. Optimized for pc like most Paradox games. Runs like a dream.DLC and such:Alright I'm not a fan of DLC to be totally honest. But I understand Paradox needs to make their money (to make Magicka 3 ofc), and they are decent devs, they DO deserve it.

												hmm i like the game very much(still havent beat the last boss because it kept crashing) so the pros are-many secrets and refrences to other games/movies-you can customize your charecter(like what weapon he uses and what staff etc)-you can finally move while channeling-levels have many paths andi havent even explored them all(yet)-still has the classic feature that allows you just to blow up every thing you see from innocent villagers to orc warleaders and so forthcons-if you ever played diablo 3 you might know how this feels like, in some levels(or in parts of them) you will find the enemies really annoyng and you have to kite them like in diablo if you go too high on difficulty you will just have to run and cast a spell and run againyeh im bad at looking at the bad partsso this is my opinion of the game it runs well sometimes might crash repeatetly but often between levels or at the start of them. some of the old combos that were in magicka do diffrent stuff now like the ice spikes (water aand frost) you had to charge a shot and it fired icy darts well in this one it rapid fires them. have not played multiplayer that much for me to say anything about it.now the big question: buy it or to not to buy itbuy it its really worth it			"

												People shouldn't compare this strictly to the Magicka 1 because Magicka 2 has new mechanics like casting spells while moving. This plays very nice with gamepads and I'm very excited that it is possible to play Magicka 2 hotseat with multiple gamepads.If you're thinking of buying this game you should be comfortable to play with gamepad. Keyboard controls are very sticky!So far this game looks very promising and I might say I prefer Magicka 2 over Magicka 1.			"

												It's 2015 and yet this game doesn't allow you to remap your keys.  The only thing I learned in High School that I use every day (aside from algebra) is typing.  I keep my hands on the home keys.  As such, when learning typing, I had to break the habit of using WASD.  I use a very odd combination, so not being able to remap keys is a huge negative for me.  Plus, as I said, there is no excuse for a PC game not to have this 'feature' in 2015.  It's inexcusable.			"

												Let me first say that I just beat this game and it took rougly four hours. The overall difficulty was scaled WAY down from the last game, but really-- Magicka 1 was balls hard at certain times. I started playing AFTER they gave us back steam and ice magick, so I had no troubles there. A few spell combos worked very differently, such as rock/ice shields not exploding with arcane/lightning (really made me sad, because QRQRASE was the bomb diggity(Literally)). The dialogue was funny, story intriguing (though quite short). I got barely any of the secrets done, so theres a lot more to do. Still would recommend.			"

The most disappointing sequel to a game I've ever playedSpellsLet's start with the thing that makes Magicka, Magicka. Spells. Well, I hope you enjoyed the steam and ice elements, because they're gone! Yep, you can no longer combine fire and water to form steam, or water and frost to form ice as individual elements. I mean, you can still create them, but instead of displaying as a steam, or an ice icon within the element chain, they don't change. They remain as the elements that would usually combine to form those elements. Meaning it takes up more than one slot within the chain, and rendering both elements pretty much useless.FeedbackFeedback? Feeling of force? What's that? Magicka 2 hasn't got a clue apparently! Remember in Magicka when you could charge up a hefty fireball and you would just know it was going to be crazy powerful? It doesn't feel the same way! You don't get any recoil from casting powerful spells. It's pretty crazy how something so seemingly minor can have a massive impact, but it really doesn't feel anywhere near as good as Magicka.BalanceEnemies feel incredibly imbalanced, and spells don't really seem to have any effect or difference in damage whatsoever. I've seen many a battle where I would die, over and over and over again, and it's certainly not fun, in fact, it almost feels as if they made the enemies tougher to compensate for the lack of content. Unfortunately for them, the length of time it takes to complete a game does not necessarily mean that it has more content!ResponsivenessInput lag and intentional delays are common as well. Usually it ends up like this: ""Oh, I thought I added that element to the chain, apparently not. Oh there it is."", or: ""Okay I'm going to cast revive now -- oh wait I can't it's on a global cooldown from that other spell I just cast"". Magicka was never about hotkeys, it was always about how quickly you could remember the order of spells and chain the correct elements together, there was never a need for any kind of spell delay. I guess it's okay when there are only a few enemies on the screen, provided you actually manage to get a decent framerate, but it simply isn't as responsive as Magicka, making it rather difficult to fight off the imbalanced hordes of enemies that the game happens to constantly throw at you.They also might as well retexture the ground to ice, because that's what it feels like I'm walking on... Admittedly, this only occurs when you point and click on the ground, and I mean while it is great fun to watch them elegantly slide to the waypoint while you spin your mouse around to make them pirouette, but seriously? I've ended up skating into water whilst casting spells at least once every level, where it permits me to, at least.GraphicsThe textures, the spells, the UI, everything looks horrendous. Spell effects, like beams and fireballs aren't anywhere near as sparkly as they once were in Magicka. Despite this, I can't even get above 30 fps, I'm actually getting lows of 15 fps on low. Taking into account that I can run GTA V on medium with ~60 fps, I'm not quite sure how they've managed to produce a game, where the visuals are worse than the original, and that runs slower than GTA V!UIThe UI looks clunky as hell too. I can't really explain it, but it somehow manages to confuse me more than it does to aid me. I'm not sure if it's the font or the colours they've used on the spell bar, but I almost have to force myself to understand what the heck is actually going on, where as in Magicka, I could just look at the spell bar and know what I'm doing without feeling confused or doubt.There's also this new little frame-thing next to the spell bar, it displays a picture of your wizard and also flashes a low fidelity image behind it when you're affected by a particular element, such as frost or fire. I've found that this is more of a hindrance when playing in co-op as I end up seeing someone else's wizard picture being affected by an element. This then ends up in me suddenly pouring water on myself to put out a fire that was never there in the first place! Now you might say that's me being stupid, but there's more to it. It's all to do with the fact that if you're not the host, you're not the first wizard in the line of co-op players. Yes, in the heat of a battle it's pretty easy to forget that you're the second wizard, and that the second spell bar and picture is yours, not the first, and that you're not really on fire at all!ConclusionCombine that all together within the final boss fight, and there you have it, an imbalanced end game that is made more difficult by input lag, intentional delays, and the clunky, confusing UI. Which is then made worse by having you repeat the same thing 5 times, and then getting to do it all over again once you die! Possibly the worst boss fight I've ever had the misfortune of playing in my life!tl;dr Rubbish.			"

												Magicka 1 all over again,in a bad wayI preordered Magicka 2 as I was certain that Paradox made a lot progress during the long development of Magicka 1 and would not make the same mistakes it did back then. I was, however, very wrong. The game is horribly optimized, sluggish, unresponsive, buggy, and on top of everything they changed the well known controls from Magicka 1 for no apparent reason. The spell casting system is almost the same as Magicka 1 but brought down to the boring level of Magicka ""Wizard Wars"".This are my specs, and I am SIMPLY UNABLE to play this game normally for now, and God knows that I played a lot of badly optimized games:- Intel Core i7-4710HQ 2.5 GHz- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M- 16 GB RAM- Win 8.1Should run like a dream, runs like a nightmare, despite my sincere efforts to optimize it.Do not buy this game until they make some major patch.

												Now I am a little biased as I love the Magicka franchise as a whole. But non the less I will bring up what I like and dislike about the game.Pros:‚Ä¢ It is a great multiplayer game to play with a couple of friends.‚Ä¢ Innovative spell casting, using 8 elements.‚Ä¢ Much less glitches then Magicka 1.‚Ä¢ Vlad is in fact not a vampire.‚Ä¢ Good humor.‚Ä¢ Lots of easter eggs, if you don't mind exploring the map.‚Ä¢ Not to hard, yet not to easy.Cons:‚Ä¢ Sometimes it does not save items you find. I don't know if this is done on purpose for some items or if it is an error.‚Ä¢ A couple of minor glitches, nothing that brakes the game.‚Ä¢ I feel the story was a little short. Then again I hard core played the game for a day... Soo... ‚Ä¢ I have not fond as many magicks as there where in magicka 1.‚Ä¢ I dislike quick cast for magicks but that is more a personal thing.All in all I would recommend this game, especially if you like laid back games with overly high skill caps.

Not. any. more. Now to get steam you just have fire and water and then cast it ""yay steam"" you cant add a conflicting element. It shortens the amount of spells you can have.

												While the new controls took me a bit to get used to coming from the first game, still a fun game with all the quirky nerd-humor of the first.  There are some spell changes that are a bit irksome (the lack of steam deathbeam comes readily to mind), but most of these come across as a means to tone down certain fairly overpowered spell combinations; nerfing them wouldve been preferable but it is by no means game breaking.

												Yes, they changed a few things, and yes, you're not as powerful, but overall, this game is great.We'll start off with some new things I really enjoy about the game:     -The new customizable robe system     -The fact that you can pick your weapon and staff for when you spawn     -The easy use of the focus-based magick systemThese new features help add to a more costumizable system that is much more enjoyable than the simplistic system of the first game. I really enjoy the way which you must unlock new robes and skins for those robes, as it allows for you to ""show off"" to your friends your skills in prior adventures, rather than the amount of money you're willing to spend, like the first game had it. The new focus magick system is enjoyable for its convenience more than anything, though I do wish it was any four magicks rather than the ""tiered"" system they currently use.Some problems I've had:     -The game is still quite buggy, (earth spells will charge without casting, I take damge from my own death spells while I have a ful death ward active, the disruptor magick won't block lok's beam sometimes, etc) but we can assume they will fix that     -The game is extremely hard without friends (I have entered full rage far too many times, and have beaten everything on bananas difficulty except the final fight against Lok, which I haven't been able to beat on any difficulty)     -The final boss fight is insanely hard, and truly unbeatable without teammatesMost of these problems lend themselves into the category of the sillyness of the game, though, which is truly its defining feature. The fact that I am playing the campaign on solo is the main problem I have with this game, but truly that is not the way the game was meant to be played. I would wholeheartedly recommend this game, but I highly suggest you get some friends to play it with and all get the game, otherwise you will have a mind-crackingly furious time! "

												In the Immortal words of Angry Joe ""You done ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed it Up""I know alot of people will ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and moan about the things i'm not recomending this game for, but in the end this is my review and in all honesty they have broken the game for me.The ""dumbing down"" of the Spell system has to be my biggest annoyance, AS some one who loved playing with friends and getting over zelous with spells like Black Hole, or Napalm. Then watching the ensuing Chaos, It gave me and my friends hours of endless hilarity. This is not a thing of the past. All spells have cooldown's even after you have found them in the world to ""Free cast"" Granted the Cooldown is less but still this has ruined the ""fun"" aspect for me.And i know i know, alot of people will say ""Its for Balancing, it was op in M1"" But honestly, Whot he ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• cares when your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•about on COOP mode. Balance changes are for Multiplayer content not For a Singleplayer or Coop Games. Following the Nerf times for charging Rock Based attacks, and AoE sizes being nerf to the size of a small coin The spell system jsut seems to be so...Limited, coming from a game where it was so Free.Again, if you see this as childish annoyances i dont really care, these changes have ruined the best part of this game for me, the COOP aspect. I honestly hope they removed these changes or at least Change them to a mulitplayer only thing. Untill then, Back to Magicka One for me, and i suggest you do the same if you agree with what im saying here.Worron			"

												This looks like the prototype of Magicka 1 that they decided not to use. It feels like we're back peddling with many of the features present (or not present) in Magicka 2. The only thing I'm happy that they changed about 2 is that you have quick-cast spells. That's it. Multibeam support is nice, but kinda expected as an update, rather than worth a whole new game. It makes me wonder why they didn't just use the same engine, add the quick cast and multibeam, and create a new storyline. It feels more like what one would have expected from Magicka 1.Look, they took away you're ability to naturally push things with ""wind"" (no elements queued), they made charging stone take 2-3 times longer. Swinging the sword feels clumsy. Combining spells like fire and water, and water and cold, no longer fuse to produce a new element, so no more 5+ elemental casting. lighting + any element = different colored lightning that doesn't seem to do anything special. The graphics feel more downgraded and less visually delightful as Magicka 1. The loading screens provide helpful tips, just like every other game, ever, opposed to silly imagery (it feels like they're just conforming to whatever is popular, instead of being cute and unique.) Their comedy feels really dried up, just like the story. And for now, the early release of this game looks more like a fan-made project, rather than one produced by the company itself. It lost a lot of it's unique flare, and now it's just the same old thing, but with major cuts in the features. I definitely would not recommend supporting them with this game. Wizard Wars felt WAY more polished and loved than this game. They just seem to have exhausted all their good ideas. And this is all coming from someone who had TONS of fun playing the original game.Guys, I know developers usually care about their games, but this one doesn't look like you care anymore...			"

												Initially, I was super-hyped for the release of this game. I bought the deluxe edition for ¬£18.99 thinking that it will be very cost-efficient (enough main story gameplay time and bonus features). However, I completed a whole run-through of the entire main campaign with one other friend of mine, and we completed it all in 4 hours.Pros:Better graphicsBinding unique magicks to the 1,2,3 and 4 keys.You can respawn with found chosen items without losing them all the timeYou can sort of customize gameplay with unlockablesMoving while channeling/charging/holding spellsMany great refences and easter eggs and all are implemented well and in a humorous manor.Cons:Nowhere near enough gameplay time as I had expectedNot too sure about this one - but I don't remember coming across a pvp arena like in the first Magicka, but there was the gamemode of monster waves.Cold + water don't form ice, and so this takes up space in the queue for your magicks, just like how fire and water don't create steam as you cast spells. This greatly limits your own customised spells, as you can no longer do ice-shards with lightning effects as the water would cancel it out.Movement controls take a bit of getting used to (Click to walk to selected spot)Earth armour got nerfed? It doesn't seem as at all effective as it was in the first Magicka, as then it was basically extra health for sacrificing mobility.Too many waves of enemies during campains. This made it so that you were always surrounded, and with the removal of the teleport magick to be replaced with emergency teleport (VERY SHORT distance random tp), you can't get away from the enemies to charge an AOE such as earth and fire. This also stumps the players when you are barely managing to survive, so as you die while being crowded by crabs, goblins etc, you get revived amongst the group of them. This is worse than spawn killing on most games as they have removed the second of invulnerability to the player upon spawning. "

												Delightful game. I've never played the first one, so no comparisons with that from me. Apparently there was some grumbling over certain spell combos (water + fire = steam) not working in M2, but that's been fixed, and a new combo for poison was added to boot. The graphics are on the very pretty side of cartoony, and the whole game is clearly tongue-in-cheek. The humor didn't always have me slapping my knees, but it's very charming, from the pervasive nods to pop culture   (""A massive cold front is coming,"" says John Frost) to the option of giving your character a voice set called ""Arnold"" that sounds a lot like Will Sasso spoofing Schwarzenegger on Mad TV, and, last but certainly not least, the hilarious gibberish spoken by the NPCs. It sounds a lot more spirited than Simlish, and I'm ashamed to admit that I briefly thought it was Swedish.The main draw here is obviously the clever and addictive experimenting with sheer endless combinations of various elements, which you can then unleash on your enemies (and on yourself, for better or for worse) in a number of different ways: as good old-fashioned rays and sprays, branching charges, weapon enchantments, area blasts, mines, and more. Want a fiery death ray that arcs to several foes at once, like lightning? You got it. If the game has a drawback, it's that it's pretty damn hard, at least in solo mode. Magicka 2 was intended as a multiplayer experience, of course, and although the single player difficulty has been dialed down a bit in recent patches, later enemies come in such overwhelming numbers, to say nothing of certain bosses, that even the most adroit keyboard wizard will be hard put to survive without some assistance. Fortunately, it's easy to call in other aspiring mages. And even though they can do each other as much harm as the swarming monsters (friendly fire is always on), frustration is kept at bay through the sheer zaniness of the chaotic battles. It's a rather unique game, and comes at a very decent price, too‚Äîdefinitely a winner in my book.			"

												this is just a worse version of the first game. ignoring all the performance issues people are having (im not having many of those lucky enough)1.) I don't like how they removed ice and steam from the game. now steam + lightning is impossible since the lightning cancels with the water of the steam. this means way fewer spell combos!2.) It seems like you have lower HP and shields don't do as much making it hard to fight more than 5 enemies simultaneously.3.) Any rock spells take forever to charge often resulting in you hitting yourself if you add fire or cold4.) Any lightning spells have no range5.) there are just fewer spell combinations in general.6.) so far the magicks seem to have much lower power also. i mean push..... really?!7.) the battlefields are much smaller giving you less room to move aroundoverall they removed way more from the original game than they added and the stuff they removed was very important. to me it didn't seem like they learned what made the first game fun			"

I can understand encouraging multi-player interactions and gameplay, but you don't need to make it near impossible to play without it.

												Ok things changed for the better, still half way...Now these are the main points that i hate:-the enemys make the game unbalanced for single player, which brings me to the last point-magic, with lots of reason (if you like wizzard wars magic you are fine but for a magicka player who hated wizzard wars spellcasting) these are the main reason:-the spells with more different element are less powerfull than the simple ones (one element)-you CAN WALK TROUGH SHIELDS, why?-armors are weak, increadibly so-protection auras with multi element are useless, completely-magicks hotkeys are not necessary bad but are completely useless since you can do them with elements without cooldown (for me a least is faster to press ""w+a+space"" than ""4"", and for longer spells is still useless, in magicka the SEDQFS i could cast it five times in 1 second and i got good with training, thats why i got stronger not macros)-cooldowns on magicks without hotkey a second or so (doesn't seem much but it's still annoing)-and there is little other things, but these are the main.Now the good things.-more magicka story (the story at least feels like a sequel, not the best but good)-the single element aura (ESSSS for example) can absorb the element for healing-graphicsNow the changes that improved the game (that for some reason we had to wait to get):-the priority of lighting over arcane/life has returned (all hail to the lightning beam)-steam and ice are back (but without the lightning water trick, if you know what i mean)-and the new poison element (S+W), it works the same as ice and steam, so we have the 3rd water element-so now we have all the magic back, with more than before (now this is a sequel, with MORE magic than the first)Still some damage balnce issues but a lot better than before.I personally still prefer the first but now this is a good game, finally.Still missing PvP cause wizzard wars is no more......

												I find this game great!The storyline is just as crazy, awesome and full of hints to other games, films or series, as the first magicka game.They also balanced the elements (maybe with the help of wizard wars) very well compared to magicka 1 qresa or qfass.Also th inverntion of a difficulty system and stuff is in my opinion just awsome..

												Awesome, engaging, and chaotic. Magicka 2 shines with its expansive and versatile spell casting system and depth of skill one can achieve within it. It is welcoming to newcomers; most basic spells are effective enough to get the job done and deliver a very awarding experience, but also allows for those who want to poke in farther to dive in, experiment, die, learn, die again and receive the full bag of fun Magicka 2 has to offer, especially if you bring friends along. For users of the original, recent updates have returned the ""controled chaos"" that the first Magicka brought to us, with a bit of rebalancing to allow for a more interesting experience, whether cooking mobs in powerful storms, whacking bosses with a super-charged mushroom, or launching creeps (or friends) sky-high with a blasting wave. As in previous titles, the game does suffer from various bugs (though anything game-breaking has since been patched), as well as having repetitive moments once the initial campaign is completed, but still offers hours of awesome spellcasting and friendship-crushing moments for a rather low price. All-in-all, Magicka 2 serves as an underrated and excellent game that's a must-have for those who, with their soon-to-be ex-friends, seek a one-of-a-kind spellcasting adventure. 9/10			"

												I read a lot of bad reviews about Magicka 2 how is it bad cuz they removed some of the spell combinations and how the staff have no longer special abilities you can use and so on and on. I will tell you i have Magicka 1 and i enjoyed it playing so i was eagerly waiting for Magicka 2 to come out. And i must say my gaming experience in Magicka 2 it's ALL POSITIVE!!!!!! :D i just liked how the game is even more funny and joking about different stuff and all the artifacts and staffs which now give you increased boost rather than usable actives are awesome :Di'll give it 11/10Now that they changed the joining system on multiplayer and the new spell options are quite impressive and even more fun its a complete must have if your into wizards more than you should.

												If you liked the first game then i think you will also like this game. if you did'nt like the first game then something is wrong with you, consider seeing a doctor... make that a witch doctor just to be safe. i was a little worried because i read some unflatering reviews about how the spell system was much worse than the original, although that issue has been resolved. my love of the first game made me buying magicka 2 a sure thing regardless of the reviews, and i'm so glad that i did. The story is a joke, literally, but sometimes i just want a fun game thats not slowed down by story. the humor is everywhere in this game, easter eggs are around every corner, and killing your friends is unavoidable(as well as fun). Buy this game it's great! Local co-op, just sayin!			"

												This is Just as fun as the first game, if you havnt played the first well you dont need to but you will miss out certain jokes. I started playing Magicka 2 after all the updates so once the spells and controls were revised to match the first, So its great fun to play now WITH FRIENDS, this is very hard to play solo so much harder than Magicka 1. Downside is that the Story is around 8-9hrs with 2 players Id say which really isnt good, the first was about 10-11 with 3 players I think. Lots of reviews complain on the amount of comedy the sequel has, why? the Magicka series parodies everything from TV series' to all games ever made. It is good fun JUST NOT LONG ENOUGH!!Buy it when its on sale, the DLC is ok, the challenges and arenas only add about an extra 2 hrs of nuance really. Dont bother with the robes unless really cheap as you actually unlock quite a few as you go through the story unlike Magicka 1.			"

												I have had more fun with this game than anything I have played for a long time.  I personally like games that are difficult and require trial and error to complete, and this game delivers.  I enjoy this game 10x more solo than with other people, and actually got the most enjoyment when going through the game imposing rules on myself to make things more difficult.  Complete the game on bananas difficulty without using any of the op staffs and robes you acquire along the way, only equip the standard basic robes and staff with no bonuses.  Do not use any of the hot keys for magicks, only type them manually, and do not use the revive spell ever to give yourself additional lives at a checkpoint.  People complaining that the game is ""unplayable solo"" clearly are not grasping the full concept of the spell system and have clearly done no experimentation with different spell combinations.  Playing with more than one person makes the game so easy it takes away from any form of challenge. My only complaint is that it seems like the devs got lazy towards the end of the game because the final 3-4 chapters are incredibly easy compared to some of the earlier chapters.   I felt disappointed with the final chapters recycling previous enemies and offering no new challenging scenarios.Overall a great and interesting combat system that becomes a bit too easy once you get used to the system and get upgraded staffs and robes.

												I'm giving this game a chance to be loved by the community and this is why I'm writting a Recommended Review.Personally, I do NOT recommend to players that tried out the other magicka game. This game is thought up more for new people, spells have been watered down more, no more Water+Cold and Fire+Water in a single spellstack, and also there is a lack of strategy here. Of course, in Magicka 1 you were overpowered and by using your spells effectively you could destroy enemies that had protection against other kinds of elements. Now every combination with Death/Arcane element seems to do the trick on almost every enemy. The Good parts in this game is that they finally made the multiplayer more stable, and that's actually enjoyable. It's not too fun in singleplayer, you need somebody to laugh with and sometimes be frustrated you killed eachother by crossing life and death beams. I preordered the game, I can say the ORCHESTRAL SOUNDTRACK is worth the extra money for the DLC, it's very well done.Bad parts as I said. Its a watered down game. Oh let's not forget about Key Bindings. I mean really you shouldn't have released a game with non-bindable keys, what are you? EA for quick money grab?I really had a high expectation with this game, I'm very dissapointed. But as I said, i'm giving this a chance! Newbies should enjoy it as a quick and fun game. Really great for people who never tried spellcasting action. Not worth the full price though... Just wait for a Discount. Every discount better than 25% I guess. Hopefully, the devs will change this game in better. I expect that, don't ruin it devs!			"

												Previous, currently invalid review.Piece of crap.Idiotic solution of switching fullscreen/windowed mode on F-keys makes it close to unplayable.Developers: you owe me a new keyboard to as a replacement to one I broke in half in a heat of the battle due to your dubious design decision.Such ""wonderful"" decisions may lead to heart attacks, you know.+Polar update: reconstructed keyboard from smoldering pile of keyboard corpse parts, removed first four F-buttons and completed the game.The game in question is a strong successor to first one. Same type of humor, more refined magic system, and a little icing of self-references on the top. Overally fine, albeit feels quite short. It's not an issue, though, for this game is supposed to be walked through multiple times.			"

												I'm actually very disappointed. Magicka 1 was amazing, I loved the physics, how the elements worked, how risk vs reward certain elements were in situations. Now this, this is just Wizard Wars in a campaign version, and personally I much rather the original concept, it just doesn't feel right, feels very slow, spells feel weak, and the use of auto casted spells is just eugh. Personally I wouldn't recommend this if you loved original Magicka. "

												A fun party co-opish game (you'll see what I mean by that later) that will get you killed by laughter!This is a perfect co-op game to play with friends but if you want serious stuff this isn't it. It's so un-serious it could be with all it's humour, pop culture references (swedish too) and with friendly fire on at all times you WILL be killing your teammates no matter intended or not. Therefore co-opish 'cause all of the team killing. The fenomenal idea to have eight elements to combine in all sorts of spell combinations is what makes this game stand out (and with it's humour accompanying). If you feel you're done with the campaign there is a challenge mode so there is plenty to do in it.This was all positive stuff so get on cons!Those who has played the first Magicka I think will be dissapointed with the new quick slot system for magicks. This takes away the fun and difficulty to remember element combinations and actually pulling them off rather than just pressing a single button to call a 5 five element combination of magick. Another thing I'm personally irritated about is the camera distance. It's too far away and for me it's hard too see items and picking them up.But in general this game is great and I would really recommend it to you, especially with friends if not just only with them!

												After beating the game, i had to change my mind.I'm a big fan of the Magicka series, i played 60+ hours of Magicka. This one did not disappoint me.I'm gonna make a quick rating about every peice that makes this game into what i think it is: - Singleplayer Campaign: 9/10Good. Of course it's impossible to beat without knowing that you can revive your fairy, witch i did not. - Gameplay 8/10There was LOTS of changes from Magicka 1 to this one. I'm of with the strafing, it's kinda neat, but one of the things that  bug me is that i can't combine steam with lightning, (trust me, that's all i did in the first game) and cooldowns really makes the game annoying,  MAGICKA IS ALL ABOUT SPAMMING, THERE IS NO REASON FOR COOLDOWNS!  - Soundtrack 10/10I always loved magicka's music, and my opinions about it will never change. The soundtrack is amazing, better than the first one. - Graphics 9/10The graphics are nice, they are a lot enhaced, comparing to the first game. - Humor 11/10Just like the first game, it's hilarious.Final rating: 9,4/10For someone who really loves the series this game is great. <3			"

												An extremely fun, buggy mess to enjoy and sometimes rage about with friends. Started playing today the magicks are fun, messing around with stuff is, the magicka feeling is there :) Good thing! Bad thing: In terms of difficulty they seem to have treated it like a dlc ... or we are completely incompetent. Meaning if you havent played all the dlcs for the first one and the last time you played magicka1 was some years ago, you will rage a lot some of the early fights seemed kind of brutal and not well paced at all ... lets talk about stepping up the difficulty. We had portions where we just raged ... HARD because honestly it requires quick fingers and muscle memory aswell as knowledge which you (probably) wont have time to gain if you start from zero and are suddenly overwhelmed by waves of enemys. Also bugs!!! we clipped through walls into areas where we shouldnt have been, the resolution likes to reset itself to 800x600 when launching the game, dont count on the game detecting your usb headset (which you probably want to use in a coop based game) and being able to use it from scratch, expect the one or other complete freeze (forcing windows restart as i didnt know another way to end the mess that was going on, looping music, my desktop blocked, constant vibrating conroller) and the one or other more or less amusing happenings which certainly were not intended by the devs (in so far as bugs arent a feature).also the menu features a brilliant xbox360 overlay no matter if you use a controller or not (i use one but it still enrages me... its plain lazy),I feel they shouldve used less of their budget on marketing gags and more on revisiting the actual game because yeah there are flaws, not quite as bad as the first one but very annoying none the less. If you loved magicka however dont let this distract you from the fact that it is FUN! You will get your dose of magicka, no worries, however bugs included. Good game yeah but feels like its in beta stage. A slight recommend IF you have  played the first one, loved it and are willing to accept the flaws i just listed.  "

												Okay, to start off just let me say: The game is GREAT, but there are many things that take away from the over-all experience.Magicka 1 was a great game with it's quirks, and the game devs seemed to fix to a few of the biggest ones, but ended up making some NEW ones that were not present in the first game.Pros:-The game looks absolutely gorgeous. From the models, to the scenery, I think it was well designed.-The improvement upon the beams from the first game makes the game infinitely better.-The ability to select your staves and weapons before the chapters is top notch, because losing that good staff was always a hassle in the other game.-The lightning looks much better in this game.-BEING ABLE TO MOVE WHILE CASTING SPELLS.-Being able to unlock robes.-Controller-friendly controls.-Very good sense of humor.Cons:-Charging times for rock-based spells.-Water/fire and water/cold do not mix to create a single-slot element anymore.-The chapters are short.-""Push"" is a spell now, and not a neutral ability when casting nothing.-Robe colors are unlocks.-Challenge mode is really difficult. (Granted, I'm very bad and it's called ""challenge mode"" for a reason, but literally dying within the first 5 seconds of the game is a bit ridiculous.)Overall, I would recommend this game because it's a lot of fun to play with a few of your buds, and even by yourself.Though the game has it's little quirks, it's still pretty well done.Now let's just hope they don't come out with 50 DLC packs like they did with the first game.

												I don't get why this game got so many bad reviews. The game is awesome! I read some people complain about steam or ice elements. I don't know how that worked before the patch as I got the game recently but the major differences I noticed are:New element ""poison"" combining Q+S.You can move while casting!You can put magicks in a hotbar and cast them with the press of a button.Magicks can also be casted manually with a smaller cooldown.The barrier element (E) doesn't stop physical projectiles anymore.Using barrier + element doesn't make you insta-immune anymore. Instead there are 4 levels of protection ranging from resistance to damage absorption. As of the moment I write this, robes aren't OP. Thet can be either cosmetic or a balanced mix of buff and debuff.Enemies have element weaknesses and/or resistance as well as players using some robes.The game adds multiple difficulty levels, play on BANANAS setting for Dark Souls like experience.Conclusion: game is way more balanced for PvP and the campaing with difficulty settings is more challenging for players that take Magicka way too seriously. Sure, it takes some getting used to the new mechanics.			"

												Magicka 2 is a lot like Magicka in some ways, and very different in others.  The main difference is that in Magicka 2, you can move while casting (and you are slowed less by conjure weight), so a good number of fights are about casting spells quickly while constantly running around.The writing is about as funny as the first game, with a number of subtitle jokes and a handful of callbacks sprinkled throughout what is mostly original jokes.  The plot also bears a second playthrough; while I got most of the ""between the lines"" story my first time, I noticed little details on my next playthrough.  Not because it's insanely convoluted with time travel like the first game, but because they're subtle little details that are only noteworthy on the second go-round.Overall, I like the game a lot, though it took me some time to get used to the idea that it's very like Magicka, but not Magicka.  I found an outfit that suits me real well and I'm working my way through Hard Mode and Bananas Mode, enjoying every minute!			"

												This game is so hilarious with friends. The spell combinations keep me coming back for more, although after completing the main mission I feel like there's not much to do except re-complete it under a high difficulty with different robe and staff combinations. Still, it was a good 20 hours of fun. Gameplay consists of mashing the speed spell while reviving your teammates (who are the only ones doing any actual work) and praying that whatever abomination is chasing you doesn't finish you off.

												Quick Summary: Basically the same game as Magicka 1, but with improved graphics, new magicks, and a new story. I found the game to be more difficult to complete than the first as well, particularly since the enemies have more varied weaknesses/resistances this time around. I liked the first game, so I enjoyed the second one as well.You play a nameless wizard on a quest to save a ‚Äúchosen‚Äù child with a grand destiny, under the supervision of Vlad the not-vampire from the first game. Along the way you‚Äôll encounter a huge variety of pop culture references and humor, just like the first game, as well as some powerful new enemies. In the first game, you could get through almost the whole campaign relying on arcane mines and steam+lightning beams, but this time around, you‚Äôll need to switch up your spell casting or you‚Äôll get stomped by enemies resisting/absorbing your spells. Of course, multi-player co-op is again available and you can (should) play through the campaign with your friends. For people who‚Äôve played Magicka 1, here are the main differences:Magicks can now be quick-cast by pressing preset cast buttons (1-4). You no longer need to memorize long elemental combos to case awesome magicks. However, magicks now have a cooldown time. The cooldown is lower if you type in the elemental combo rather than use the quick cast, but you still can‚Äôt flood the screen with the good stuff.A lot of the basic spell combos have been changed. (No more EARS mines, now it‚Äôs a steam wall). The Healing mines from the first game (EW) detonate much slower and are less powerful so don‚Äôt rely on them to save you. You also can‚Äôt use arcane mines to blast people off cliffs as easily.You now ‚Äúunlock‚Äù gear such as robes (with bonuses and negatives), weapons, and staves by completing campaign levels and finding secrets. I suppose unlocking items is better than needing to buy DLC.No more ‚Äòcheckpoints‚Äô for resurrection. Your familiar sacrifices itself to resurrect you when you die, and you can immediately cast Revive to bring it back to life. This means you can die as much as you want, as long as you cast revive fast enough. For people who haven‚Äôt played Magicka 1:You control your wizard with the mouse in isometric view (like Diablo or Torchlight) and cast spells by combining elements with the QWER and ASDF keys. Each key is an element (for example Q is water) and by creating elemental combinations you cast spells (SFA = death+fire+lightning = fiery lightning beam). The order of elements doesn‚Äôt matter as long as certain ‚Äúopposites‚Äù aren‚Äôt in there. For example lightning will cancel water. You can also cast ‚Äúmagicks‚Äù which are powerful spells with unique effects using preset elemental combinations (also use the space bar to cast instead of mouse buttons). For example life+lightning casts Revive, which can resurrect your dead ally (or familiar). Some of the magicks from the first game have been nerfed (lightning bolt), but some of the new magicks are great for single player (lightning birds!). Pros:+Has the good parts of the first game. Fun story, nice graphics, co-op gameplay, and a lot of humor+More people are playing this online than Magicka 1, so you can pretty easily find someone to play with, at least on normal difficulty.+So far, you don‚Äôt miss out on anything by not owning a ton of DLC. The first game had like a dozen different DLC to purchase.+A lot of the things you unlock during the campaign are ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù which are basically just small modifications to game difficulty. For example enemy damage +10% or speed -10%. This allows you to create some unusual difficulty customizations. Cons:-The game‚Äôs achievements have a lot of ‚Äúgrinds.‚Äù For example, kill 10,000 enemies or die 1000 times. It would take 100 years to get some of those unless you ‚Äòboost.‚Äô There are also a number of very difficult ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù or ‚Äútrials‚Äù with achievements. If you generally only play a game until you finish the campaign, resign yourself to having about 30% achievement completion for Magicka 2.-Despite not looking that much prettier than the first game, Magicka 2 has noticeably higher system requirements. I also encountered this weird bug where the game will reset the resolution every time I start it. It only takes a minute to set the resolution again, but it‚Äôs annoying. Overall, Magicka 2 is a great game that is better with friends. If you take it slow, you can probably beat the highest difficulty by yourself, but what‚Äôs the fun in that.  "

												The graphics are a notable upgrade from the first magicka, and I liked the additions of new elements, and the ability to walk while casting certain spells. If you want, you can join another player online, without knowing them at all, or waiting and hoping a stranger helps you. Other than that, it is essentially the same as the first Magicka, which is also good, because Magicka was an absolutely brilliant game. the only complaint I have about this one is that the story mode is rather short, fairly easy, and other than the final boss, not really anything special. Overall, I would say that this game is a step up from something that was already beautiful. 10/10, would play again			"

The spells are fantastic together, new formulas and ways to blend them. The enemies are unique and the setups for fighting them are quite varied.We found some amazing combonations - some that seemed so powerful we felt like we had just beat the game.Then we would fight a horde that challenged that idea - only to move onto the next challenge.Lots of fun teamwork, great additions to the game with the movement and quick spells menu.Wonderful graphics and wow the load times are crazy fast. Also notably improved sound.Get some friends together - this game is awesome. "

												This game gets more negative reviewes than I personally think it deservers and most seem to boil down to 'it's different/worse than the first', which is fair enough but makes it seem much worse than it is. I like the first game and I like this game as well. It still has cool spellcasting, fast paced action, laugh-out-loud humor, varied enviroments to work around and a ton of secrets to find. The controller support is better which is appriciated by my wrists. If you absoutley adore the first one than maybe this isn't for you, but let's face it, you've probably already bought it. If you liked it well enough, or haven't tried any before, then you shouldn't get discouraged by the negative reviews and give it a try.			"

												The game itself is amazing. The graphics are awesome, the new spell combos are awesome. I love the jokes and references that the devs put in. The story is fun, well integrated, but the end seemed a little anti-climactic. It took me about 4-5 hours to finish it so it could have been a bit longer in my opinion. I'm looking forward to new DLCs, provided they aren't too expensive.Rated 7/10Edit: While the spells are balanced, the problem is that Fire-Death beam will get you through the entire game, except one or two bosses. The game could use more diversity in the way that different monsters would have resistance to different elements, therefore players would have to find the weakness and abuse it. (Arcane and Fire work against most monsters). It should also force players to use different types of attacks, instead of only beams and lightnings. (Like bombs, rocks, melee, etc.)			"

 Magicka 2 doesn't live up to the hype. It surpasses it. I bought Magicka 2 for 4.99 USD when it was on sale, and, I'll admit, I was riding the hype train. While it was installing however, I realised that I hadn't read any reviews for it, or watched any gameplay videos. I'd just gone out an bought it. What an idiot. I booted up the game, preparing for a mediocre game. It was amazing. Even the menu screen is well done. Rather than a still picture or a looping video, this was a 3D overview of the realm of Midgard, complete with a comicly oversized ferris wheel and undersized mountains. As you mouse over the different options in challenge mode, the background changes to suit this. Going to battle Orcs in the Highlands? The camera pans over to them. Planning on fighting goblins in the castle of Aldratraz? The ruins rebuild themselves. Although little touches like these make no difference to the gameplay, they make the game feel more... fleshed out. The summoning and casting of spells is awkward at first, but it soon becomes natural, and their's nothing more satisfying than you and your friend combining a life and a death beam to create a miniture black hole. Couple this with great background music and the ability to play multiplayer on one PC (If you have a controller), and you've got yourself, in my opinion, a perfect game. Gameplay: Kill yourself (Over and over) A defining part of the Magicka franchise is the ability to create your own spells, resulting in a playstyle perfect for you. Here's a good example. Before I fight, I always selfcast Sheild-Stone-Stone-Stone-Stone, which gives my wizard a suit of rock armour. Next, I move so the enemies are JUST visible on the edge of the screen. Then, I summon Water-Cold-Death-Death-Death, and hold right-mouse, which charges up the attack. After a couple of seconds I let go, firing 3-5 shards of ice, infused with death magic. Then, depending on the situation, I either cast Cold-Water-Cold-Water-Death and right-mouse charge, which does the same as the previous spell, except it shoots 7-9 shards that do less damage. In all honesty, it's like a shotgun. If their are too many enemies, I summon Lightning-Death-Fire-Death-Lightning, and Shift-middlemouse cast, which sends lightning bolts in all directions, which do extra damage (Death element at work) and light the enemies on fire. Music: Your ears with thank you I can't even begin to describe how good this music is. Just listen to preveiws of it on iTunes  here [itunes.apple.com].Thanks for reading this reveiw!			"

												I'am going to remake this review after my first impression. It was that Magicka 2 was badly designed and was hard to a point that isnt fun or allowed tactics. There are some points we should know, I should have, before playing.- Magicka is made for co-op, the way enemies are so fast, and you so slow, how they corner you etc, its all thought for co-op.- Since I was not, and wont play in co-op, another important thing to know. Revive spell isnt useless in solo. When you die, and you will, as long as you have your familiar alive, you rez, so keep reviving your pet.- You can and should cast while moving. Not sure the first allowed this.This already makes the game MUCH more manageable! Knowing this I couldnt keep a bad review because there is a way to play it. Its not so fun as the first, its kinda repetitive but there is a way to manage all the enemies spam. If you add a stone shield, another thing the first didnt require, you'll play this easy. And the core is the same as the first, a fun game.			"

												It's a fun game, except for a lot of broken mechanics (like the swarming AI, the fact that some spells are outright broken - skeleton spawn, heal mines, death mines) that means you don't even use half the spells in the game if you run solo. And don't get me started on the last boss. Just because of that one fight, I'm not recommending this game. It isn't fun. It isn't interesting. It's just buggy and ill-thought-out, and it ruins an otherwise interesting fingercramp. If you have some friends playing, it might make for a few laughs. Unless you're looking for a challenge without mates. This will give it to you.			"

												TLDR:This game is pretty much the same as the first Magicka, but with some tweaks that make playing the game a lot more fluid.  I would say, mechanically, the game is better in every way save two:- Can't pick up weapons and staves dropped by enemies- Can't cast magicks as quickly as you input themMechanics aside, the game itself is really not better than the first Magicka in any way.- Story is shorter and less interesting- Enemies lack variety- Bosses are easy- Humor isn't very humorous- Fights lack chaos (and opportunity to kill your friends)- Spells feel balanced and boringMORE DETAILS:You can no longer pick up every weapon dropped by your slaughtered enemies.  Instead, the game has specific staff and weapon unlocks that you must discover as you play the game.  I feel this removes a big amount of variety that the first game had to offer, but the drawback is somewhat alleviated by the fact that you can choose your equipped weapon and staff from among those you unlock. This means you don't lose that awesome weapon you picked up from a boss a few levels back if you die, which is a great improvement over the first game.The second mechanical drawback, which I absolutely hate, is that you can no longer cast magicks as quickly as you can input the elements.  My favorite magick to cast was Spike Quake: [s][s][d][s][s][space].  I can type that key combination very quickly, but, unlike the first Magicka, Magicka 2 forces you to wait a few seconds between casting, which is dumb.  This forces you to stand around and take damage while you wait for the game to let you cast your spells.Magicka 2 seems to have gone for polish and balance over the first Magicka.  The polish is nice, but the balance just removes most of the aspects that made the first Magicka so enjoyable.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who has played the first Magicka and all the DLC and still wants more, or to anyone who hasn't played the first Magicka but likes the game's concept of casting spells and accidentally (or intentionally) killing your friends.  If you've played the first Magicka and have already had your fill of excitement, then you can probably skip this game.			"

												So, I hear you would like to possibly be an over powered wizard whose power is determined by skill and creativity (check), I also hear that you would like to play the main campaign with friends and ""accidentally"" kill them (check). You guys want a bunch of refrences to many many things (check). If you want a satirical adventure of laughter and accidental deaths you have come to the right place of MAGICKA 2: LEARN TO SPELL AGAIN!!! But to break it down for those of you who want the pros and cons of this game here they are,PROS-Great gameplay, the spell system is unique, unlike any other magical game I have ever played-Fun to play with friends, me and my friends needed to actually stop because we were laughing to hard at the things we did-Bunch of jokes-Modifiers you can unlock to make things more interesting-Its beeping awesomeCONS-Unlike magicka 1, fire and water dont combine to make steam in your spell queue so you can make a steam, lightning storm anymore, samething with ice-There are only 9 levels instead of the old 12			"

												MAGICKA 2,I don't really know why the people hate this game so much. I've completed the 1st part (and had so much fun playing local co-op) so far and the 2nd just amazed me.+The graphics are exellent+There are a lot of different monsters, bosses, artifacts spells and equipment (robes and staffs)+Slowly gets boring+You need a lot of time to unlock all the content and pass all the challenges+You can blow up your friends+The controllers are easier to useBut...-The community is often rude and kicks you out of the game, instead of telling you, you should go-SOMETIMES is buggy-It is hard to complete a chapter (level) alone-Local multiplayer works only with the Microsoft controller, so if you don't have it, you can play with your friends only by Internet-The steam and ice elements can't be summoned anymore (by connecting fire and water or frost and water)I recommend Magicka 2, I have a great time still playing this game. It is worth every money (but you can also buy it on sale :D).			"

												Plenty of review with in-depth details. The short version thus:- Some minor irritations in the game engine, mostly with over-eager camera cut-scenes leaving team-mates outside the screen (good  luck getting back without dying!!!)(-) Perhaps not quite as good as the original, but mostly I think that's nostalgia speaking.(+) Simplified controls are less versatile for die-hard PC-gamers, but make sooooo much sense playing on a big screen, with friends, hence....+ Blast of a game to play with friends, on a big screen, while having drinks and snacks and putting each other on fire... That last part in-game... duh!+ Good price for the quality of the game. It may not be perfect, but it's got charm, laughs, challenges and for the price they ask, all of that in abundance.+ Streams well using Moonlight (Using Ouya with Ouya controllers, for those who don't know: Android based console)+ Should tide me and my friends over until Trine 3 gets full release?Sure, this is based on only 4.5 hours of playing the game, but that's times 3 people playing it? ;)			"

												I waited long for magicka 2 to be released. but i wish i did not bought it..I do NOT recommend this game to Previous Magicka 1 Gamers!!### Pro's: ###- Graphics looks WAY better!- The new weapon enchant system. I like them, they look nice and feel solid. Enough said.- Game loads EXTREMLY Fast on my pc. (like within 2 seconds is a game Created, Loaded and Joined)- ### Con's: ###- Spells do NOT Combine any more. Like the ""Super Steam Beam Cannon"" does not work any more. (wich is QFASSS)Q and F (water and fire) does not make steam anymore.. Instead, They made the combo still 2 elements but if you cast it, it is a Steam Spray.. so, compared to Magicka 1; Steam spray was 1 Spell slot. now in Magicka 2, its 2: still Fire and Water.. (i hope i'm clear on this one.. xD)- I cant get online for some reason.. (and yes i made an Account) - The magick cooldowns.- Steam and ice don't combine. - Fire and Water Do combine, but does not make 1 slot Steam.. (like i already said) - Sliding movement looks like im Playing on some kinds of Ice Skating simulator.. its annoying as F*CK.  - AOE size reduced drastically. like... Wow... X(- Projectile spell cast times. It really takes AGES to charge up any heavy projectile to actually hit some one..Conclusion:I wish i did not bought this game.			"

												I honestly does not understand why anyone would point the thumb down. The game is immersive, VERY funny (at least for me who is Norwegian and understand half of the words spoken in the game), very complex magic-use and not a type of game where people would be frustrated or angry for getting killed if in multiplayer- because you CAN be resurrected instantly by your teammates.* Singleplayer is just as hard as it will get when playing a 2 team multiplayer, and the difficulty will rise the more players who join. * The game can be adjusted in difficulty by adding artifacts that the player can collect troughout his/her journey. * The game also have a great variety of weapons, magic-combinations, robes and staffs,- everyone with different stats for the player.* Funny easter eggs all over (Game of Thrones, WoW, Meme references, Stonehenge, etc)I'm not really a magic-lover of any sort, but after 5 minutes with Magicka 2, that had to change. Buy it. Play it. Love it.			"

												This Game does need some work, but overall, if you are into Magic (Magick?), You can have a great time. Multiplayer works flawlessly, and the pop-culture references are pretty great (Found John ""Frost"" in a mini Snow Fort).Game is harder than Magicka 1, without a doubt, but (In my opinion) the controls feel better, and player things like Custom Adventure and Player Robes/Gear are diverse and great.There are some bugs and glitches about, and the Story Mode is shorter than Magicka 1's story, But nothing so bad that it will break your game (Except bouncing up and down on a Frozen Lake, which really annoyed me.)Though, In Magicka 2, the core concept of being a Wizard is still there, and you feel like you are immortal, and can destroy everything (Until you die. And die again. and again, and again, and again....)As I said, This game does need work, but overall, I enjoy it alot. Though this game is not for everyone, you should give it a try sometime, and be sure to bring Friends/Meat Shields.Oh. and final note: There is a strong lack of Vampires in this game, which I feel should be there. Oh well.			"

												First Magicka game was great. This one, at least at this point, isn't.First, it's not well optimized. My PC isn't a good one, but I could play Magicka without much problem and it looked pretty fancy. Here, things look... well, not as fancy. And it lags.  I can go on and on with the topic 'Not as fancy', but let's skip it.And there's the control. Movement feels slippery, ASF gives you SAF, and some controls are different from the first one(Which is not necessarily 'wrong', but it's kinda awkward).Jokes are still great, though.So, Conclusion: Not recommended for Magicka 1 lovers. Perhaps I should go play Magicka DLCs instead.			"

However for those who have played the first, be warned that I hear of a lot of complaints that the game has essenitally been dumbed down, and basically consolized... lot's of the people I have played with who had the first say they still prefer it over this, so if you really loved the first one, do some research on whats in/not in this game. one last note, this game doesnt have lobbies (yet, maybe one day) so if you dont have friends who already have the game, finding people to play with can be difficult.

												Magicka 2 is a fun, yet different successor of the previous game. To play the campaign was enjoyable yet disappointing compared to the original Magicka, which had some enexpected twists and turns and had a much more fleshed out world. The references gets a little bit old, and I expected much more from the story. The gameplay is quite slower and easier, which I dislike. The spell system has been reworked for the worse, with far fewer viable spells and only one good AOE spell, you only can do when you have a teammate, which would be OK concept if there were more than 1 of such spells. But the artifact system is great but could have been made more interesting, here I am comparing it with ""The Bastion"" which has a much similar system where you pray to ""gods"" that grants gold/xp bonuses to you but makes the enemies stronger in some specific way, or you weaker. But overall it was an enjoyable game, it does everything better than the original except story and gameplay. It does not however entice me with its lack of replayability, despite the artifact system.			"

												Guys. Did we forget the release of Magicka 1 already? There were a few bugs here and there, but they were fixed pretty quickly. (Crash to Desktop lol.)This gets a positive review from me, simply because you can obviously see the improvements.Is it a problem we can't rebind keys? Duh. Are they going to fix it? Duh again. (Probably.)As for dumbing down... eh. It's not THAT dumbed down. You can still do insane combos like IceShieldDeathDeathDeath (woo for exploding ice blockades!) And really, the super steam-beam (you know what I'm talking about) was broken and made things a little easy.The quick bar isn't necessary. but allows for babies first combo to work. Not everyone wants to be a try hard and spend a few hours learning some combos to look fancy. However if you learn to use the magic manually, you can spam just like the good ol' days. (I still need more zombies!) With about a 1 second cooldown.To those of you booing them for making the sequel and the small problems saying they ""disrespected the fans and made it for the people coming from wizard wars!"", I don't see the problem. It's not like it was bad. Give it time, friends. Noones perfect, but they can improve. Give good criticism and feedback, not whining and complaints.- A Wizard. "

												I'm giving this a upvote, 'cause the game is good HOWEVER KEEP READING!It does feel way too much more like Wizard Wars and not like Magicka 1.How? Keys have been simplified and some other complexed, you no longer can use the Push by just holding shift now it's actual spell.There's a Quick Cast thing, which is not essentially bad but kinda removes the challenge of keeping in your mind all the spells. Note: You can still cast those spells without using the quick cast, also using haste on quick cast while wet is possible, but using it without quick cast isn't possible when wet, (possible bug)Cooldown: Quick Cast has cooldown but can be decreased or shortened at least by my staff. And also it feels harder to spam normal spells.Teleport: No longer teleports you where you want, its a random teleport *sad*.Normal Yellow Shield: the self was always quite weak and never used being it so short. Now the aoe version of it and the wall version of it is the same thing, weak and allows you and other players to pass, this was a really disapointment as we as a team use the shield to cover up then some would teleport out to deal with the problems and that was team work.Healing: Seems to be quite weaker.There's a new thing that casts the spell onto your sword and then you can use it, it's interesting but due to forcing you to first cast it on sword and only then throwing away it's not much of an in-time cast and it's annoying.Coming from magicka 1 and it will feel like a slightly different for the bad side and the good side, but some changes that were probably to ""balance"" kinda made it crappier.Coming from any other game it's an amazing game that is tons of fun-Coming From Wizard Wars (without playing magicka 1) the game rocks and it's so much better. So yeah overall the game is fun as hell, however some of the changes i'm not really fan of, never played this or the first one with the controller, so i cannot provide feedback on that.But yeah, i also think that some of the features feel wizard war-ish which is too simplified.

I do miss the more fluid gameplay of 1 but it was so difficult that I enjoyed it less where I felt 2 really got the difficulty down better.

												If you're like me and you loved how Wizard Wars looked and played, then you'll enjoy this game. I've wanted Paradox to base their Magicka game with the style that Wizard Wars brought. Magicka 2 definitely reflects it pretty well.My only quarrel with this game is that it's short. It's meant to be replayed, however, because there are difficulty settings for each of the 9 chapters. Notice that my quarrel with this game isn't the ""dumbed down"" spell casting. Admittedly, at first I thought it was very casualized, but then I started thinking about the first game, and how I only EVER used the one OP spell combo (FQASA). There wasn't ever really any reason to not use it, save for a couple of enemies using a lightning ward. Magicka 2 had me experiment with the elements again, and it was very enjoyable.			"

												Magicka 2 is a Comedy, Action, Adventure Co-op game and, I don't know why the reviews are at mixed. The game is fantastic, and a great prequeal to Magicka.In Magicka 2, you need to save a prophesized child, Lok, from the Orks. To do that, you must find and use a spell that not even Lok can defeat, to weaken her, so that you can take her safely, so that the Orks don't get her first. It is a really great game, and the Co-op is good as well. For anyone who has played Sanctum 2, Magicka 2's Co-op is similar to Sanctum 2's. You can make a public, friends only, or private server. A public server means that anyone, anywhere can join, which can be helpful. The other two modes are self explanitory. The spell system is similar to Magicka's. But, the weapon system is different, for each staff and melee weapon you find, will be saved to your inventory at the main menu. Same thing with robes.Overall, this is a really fun game, and I was shocked to see it at mixed reviews. However, I can see why people didn't really like this game. It does, yes, feel more like a prequeal to Magicka: Wizard Wars than to the first Magicka. However, I do recommend this game to everybody, because, despite the reviews, this is a really good game.

												A few things I love about this game:-Concept is simple-Skill level is player dependent, not gear dependent-jokes are super funny-ways to kill your friend is awesomeI love the magic system. There are lots of combination, which makes the execution highly dependent on the skill of the player himself. Can you think of which magic to use in this intense moment? Can you execute the magic? I love how the enemies are immune/resist/absorb certain spells, so that although I have been doing the same spell for the first couple chapters in normal mode, I now have to switch 1 element, but it's so hard because the SDFFF is so in my mind...when I need to switch to SDRRR.I play this game with my wife and she isn't a gamer. We have a total blast! Wife needs help because goblins are after her? No problem, one fire bomb and kill them all....along with her. Need a rez? Sorry I am wet so I die along with you! Super fun, super fluid, super awesome. I read that the game at launch had lots of issues so lots of people gave it a bad review. I tried it myself I would give it a 10/10, music, graphics, story, jokes, combat system, are all perfect to my taste. The best is the local coop/online coop that it allows me to play with my wife and my friends and we laughed like crazy the whole time! Super highly recommended for small parties!			"

												There's not really much I can say that others already haven't, positive or negative.So speaking purely from opinion, I personally enjoyed playing through Magicka 2, possibly more than the first game. The movement system and being able to cast while moving took some getting used to, but it works great. They balanced the spells in comparison to the first game, so you can't use Steam/Lightning beams anymore (Lightning cancels out the water in the steam), and even if you could, some enemies are resistant to, immune to, or they absorb the elements used in some combinations. Magicks have been reduced down to a few, more potentially useful offensive spells instead of having a lot of AoE spells that you probably never actually used. I mean, why bother with Blizzard or Time Warp when it's easier to Raise Dead, teleport across the room, and hit something with a rock? You also can't hide behind Shields anymore. Whether you think it's good or bad, Shields have been balanced to only block beams, but any other attack, as well as enemies, will pass right through them.There is some bad, though. While the game is more polished, it still has it's fair share of bugs and glitches. For example, a few times I've went to launch a Rock but it doesn't respond. This left me in a state that still acted as if there were elements waiting for use until I tried to cast a separate spell, and unfortunately this caused the rock to launch at that point instead (and sometimes they were exsplosive).The only summoning Magick I've found isn't as useful as Raise Dead or Summon Elemental, only summoning some fairly weak skeletons that every strong enemy and boss can just tear through. Maybe this was part of balancing, but the Magick in question is only really good for brief distractions.But my experience was overall positive. At least when playing with someone else. I've been playing Hard Mode solo, and it's a long, hard slog. I played normal mode with my brother and it was great, but not having anyone else playing on Hard Mode is a pain.Like I said, this is all personal opinion. I don't know how you might feel about it. Maybe if you're not sure you could wait for it to go on sale at some point. But I reccomend giving it a fair shot at some point!UPDATESome changes were made to the game recently.They reworked the element combination system to be like the original game, so we get our Steam Lightning beams back! They also introduced a new element combination: Water and Death creates Poison. You can modify the movement controls too so that you can move the way you did in the first Magicka. Shields still only block beams and nothing else (besides other shields) though.I think these changes make it much more worth it, personally.			"

												Sadly but Magicka 2 is worse than Magicka 1, I will be comparing Magicka 2 to the original Magicka.So to start things off I will talk about the spell casting system : Magicka 1 : -combine whatever you want a deal massive damage and have lot's of fun killing everything-you need to remember magicks -Vlad is not a vampireMagicka 2 :-limited combinations, less dmg = less fun but makes the game harder and more challenging-you don't have to remember all the combinations for magicks-Vlad is absolutely not a vampireGameplay :Magicka 1 : -you can solo, have fun throwing around stuff etc.-funny situations and easter eggs-epic language in-game, that is mixed with a few of the worlds languages-Vlad is not a vampireMagicka 2 : -soloing is too hard-less funny situations and less cool easter eggs-language in-game stays-Vlad is FOR SURE not a vampireGraphicsMagicka 1 : -everything looks ok-Vlad is NOT a freaking vampireMagicka 2 : -graphics are improved and look better-Vlad is a ManpireSummary : comparing Magicka 1 to Magicka 2 I think Magicka 1 was beter but this one is also ok just less ""cool"" in a way. Play Magicka 1 after Magicka 2 if you didn't play it yet.If you disagree it's alright, it's my personal opinion.			"

												First time playing any Magicka game, already nearly 10 hours of enjoyment out of it whilst playing solo + with friends and so much more to do, it's awesome. So many easter eggs/references, extremely funny, lovely graphics and a good little story. So much replay-ability, which I love. Good fair amount of achievements, some not as easy as others. Basically a slightly more complex stick shooter, but with mage using all the elements, which you can mix and match. I personally have been using a controller to play and it works very well. Although upon reading I know most people prefer to use the keyboard to learn/cast certain spells.I have bought all the dlc, so I still have all the trials and extra challenges to complete yet. I have also since bought a copy of the original game to try out once I have finished with #2 =D  "

(after some patches that is)The game doesn't deserve the mixed rating it has on steam. Its better than when it launched. The devs have done so much to improve it, including re introducing element combining from the first game, and even giving us a brand new element!

It has been fun to play with about 8 hours invested so far in both solo, co-op and network play. There are a few small things that I liked better in the original but there are some new things in magicka 2 that make up for it. One of the best new features is Linux support. If you like one, go ahead and grab this one too.			"

												Magicka 2 is a Comedy, Action, Adventure Co-op game and, I don't know why the reviews are at mixed. The game is fantastic, and a great prequeal to Magicka.In Magicka 2, you need to save a prophesized child, Lok, from the Orks. To do that, you must find and use a spell that not even Lok can defeat, to weaken her, so that you can take her safely, so that the Orks don't get her first. It is a really great game, and the Co-op is good as well. For anyone who has played Sanctum 2, Magicka 2's Co-op is similar to Sanctum 2's. You can make a public, friends only, or private server. A public server means that anyone, anywhere can join, which can be helpful. The other two modes are self explanitory. The spell system is similar to Magicka's. But, the weapon system is different, for each staff and melee weapon you find, will be saved to your inventory at the main menu. Same thing with robes.Overall, this is a really fun game, and I was shocked to see it at mixed reviews. However, I can see why people didn't really like this game. It does, yes, feel more like a prequeal to Magicka: Wizard Wars than to the first Magicka. However, I do recommend this game to everybody, because, despite the reviews, this is a really good game.

												Totally worth a play if you already own it and have not managed to get to it yet. Although I recommend this game on its own to new players or players with co-op buddies, It fails to hold up to what a good sequel should be on all levels except gameplay.Magicka 2 is the sequel to the much loved Magicka (This was sort of obvious). Although Magicka 2 has significantly improved gameplay mechanics over the first game, it feels as though its heart and soul has been partially removed in the process. Magicka is all about wizards and spells and the wacky world they inhabit. While the spell casting is better than ever with the inclusion of a hot bar for quick casting of complicated spells and significant improvements to overall movement / control, the story / plot / writing is significantly worse than the original. The original game while being almost unbearably buggy and in a constant state of not quite fixed was super fun, incredibly challenging and had amazing writing, funny and memorable moments everywhere. The original had references to movies, characters, games, everything and was constantly trying to be funny. Magicka 2 isnt... it is not bad, and it isnt un-funny it just doesnt even remotely compare to the first experience (which may be part of the reason you are considering buying this game).The game is also sadly too easy and too short. While the first Magicka was challenging and almost impossible to beat in some situations, Magicka 2 manages to be easily completable solo and takes almost no time at all to do so. The game is built upon replayability though so I guess they expect you to constantly replay the same campaign... however with aforementioned lack of the charm that kept me coming back for more of the first game, I sadly do not see the chances of that being high. Now with all that negativity in comparison to the first game done, I want to stress that the game is enjoyable and fun and should be purchased if you plan on playing it with friends. Solo mode however is not very fun and the writing and enemy variety doesnt justify multiple playthroughs even with unlockables.Totally worth a play if you already own it and have not managed to get to it yet. Although I recommend this game on its own to new players or players with co-op buddies, It fails to hold up to what a good sequel should be on all levels except gameplay. "

												Magicka 2 is not quite as strong as its predecessor, but it is a Magicka game nonetheless. 	Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first. (-) The innovative charm has worn off a tad and the over-hype didn't help.(-) The game doesn't have as much content as the first one.(-) Balancing the spell strength was something that many players resented, since a lot of the fun in Magicka resulted from having a spell system, too powerfull to handle,that few people knew how to use. Players were their own worst threat, which was funny. However, once people figured out the most effective spells, players turned out to be just overpowered. (+) Since most Magicka 2 players are veterans, it was a logical decision to balance the difficulty and keep the game interesting.	Despite these shortcomings, the distinct Magicka-ness is still there. What Magicka was always good at, was juggling elements (pun intended) that make the game feel childish, yet adventurous and epic at the same time. (+) A unique game mechanic that allowed for both jovial and explosive experiments as well as serious and challenging gameplay.(+) Additional functions, such as the 4 instant-spell-slots, and spell reactions, like the poison element, the automatic spell prisms and the beam annihilation (especially this one).(+) Another epic story, filled with the shenanigans, fitting for this universe.(+) A unique final wizard battle, with a clever mechanic, that extended beyond ‚Äúshoot it dead‚Äú (an improvement from the trivial ‚ÄúCorporealize‚Äú concept, already present in the first game).In conclusion, not the novelty the first game presented, but a solid sequel for any Magicka enthusiast.

												Look guys, it's still Magicka and you still get to accidentally kill all your friends. You can also cast magicks without the long focus cooldown if you know the element combination. This time the game also doesn't crash that much.Complaints:NOT ENOUGH MAGICKS. Magicka 1 had like 30+. This game barely has 15. Most of them are pretty underwhelming as well. e.g the Thunderbolt does like 800 dmg. It's literally better to cast AOE with the elements used for the thunderbolt, because that does 1200+ dmg... in an aoe. Even if I use the element combination to cast the magick, it still has a 3 second reload cooldown. Always. Look devs, with the 1st Magicka you proved that the game can be hard even without cooldowns and therefor cooldowns are ultimately a bad mechanic that just remove the fun from the game. In Magicka 1 you could go crazy with the magicks and still die. Console controller UI. C'mon, all of us here use a keyboard and mouse. Ice is OP. Ice walls are as durable as earth walls AND refelct lasers, like the pure Shield walls. Ice walls with Death element don't explode anymore. The QREASA combination from your sword is pathetically weak, because the ice doesn't explode anymore. The Ice was often used offensively in Magicka 1. Now it's the ultimate protection, leaving earth and shield walls useless compared to to Ice. You can't stack the pure Shield walls on other walls. Casting the Shield wall where and Earth wall is will replace it, not stack on it. Highround advantage is too big. Enemy on highground can drop down projectiles on you, even if you are behind a wall. The walls should be a lot higher, OR allow us to aim lasers and stuff on highground. I like what they did to the pure Ice shard, continuously firing them is cool, but I don't like how they removed the DQRQRQRS ""Morning Star"" combo. I liked my spikey balls :( This time, if you combine Ice with earth, it will fire the ice shards quickly as you charge up force, like pure Ice does in the 1st Magicka. No fall damage from Water explosions. Water balls and water walls were often used to knock around the enemy. Pure AOE casting is not big enough. In the 1st Magicka a 5x Water AOE cast almost covered the entire screen and was good for getting light enemies off of you. Now not only the AOE is reduced, but the force of the knockback as well. The Push Magick doesn't quite replace this, because it only works in 1 direction, not all around you.On the bright side, I like what they did to the movement and the emphasis on the ""Don't cross the beams"" combos.

												Magicka 2 differs slightly from Magicka 1. That is to be expected. But overall it is a better experience.+ Graphics better.+ Gameplay smoother.+ Unlocks (skins, staves, swords, artifacts)+ Difficulty settingsThe only downside is that you can't choose who you want to join in a game. You can only choose 'Join game', butit doesn't show a list of available games/lobbies etc. And another thing that is kinda lame is that you see your friends elements at the bottom of the screen and it sort of blocks the view and you no longer see the combination under their character. Those are the only two things that I believe are negative.8/10.			"

												Magicka 2: When you don't know what you fell about it after the 1st gameAs for me, first part of this game was something special, you know. All that things with friends killing, spells learning, ""Not a vampire"" jokes and so on made this game some kind of atmospheric for me, made me fall in love with it. And after all, ""Magicka 2"" announcment, you scream out loud ""OH GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT"", but i can't get one thing, why it was released? And my first claim is an awful spell control, u know, really awful! Absouluetly. -Spell while you moving isn't comfortable-""1234"" panel is one of the worst thing i've ever seen -You can't cast a lot of great spells from magicka one -And the last one. It's bad, just, uhmmm, really bad. 2nd claim. Story.  For me that part of the game had never been so important, but it was kind of funny. You could just relax and walk through the adventures, then you could listen to Vlad stories cause he was the big part of the game, now i kinda feeling he isn't. And yup, I'm really disappointed cause of it. Big fat minus again. And in the end there will be the graphics part. AND I KNOW. Nobody really cares about graphics in magicka, but now i don't like it dunno why. Maybe cause of all these parts in total, maybe cause it doesn't suit for the game. PROS NOW: -Now u can open robes and customize your wizzard -It's still Magicka even if it's not good enough-NostalgiaI will recommend it cause it's magicka.Well, if you like first part, u, probably, won't mind to play it, even if it's a way worst.

												Look guys, it's still Magicka and you still get to accidentally kill all your friends. You can also cast magicks without the long focus cooldown if you know the element combination. This time the game also doesn't crash that much.Complaints:NOT ENOUGH MAGICKS. Magicka 1 had like 30+. This game barely has 15. Most of them are pretty underwhelming as well. e.g the Thunderbolt does like 800 dmg. It's literally better to cast AOE with the elements used for the thunderbolt, because that does 1200+ dmg... in an aoe. Even if I use the element combination to cast the magick, it still has a 3 second reload cooldown. Always. Look devs, with the 1st Magicka you proved that the game can be hard even without cooldowns and therefor cooldowns are ultimately a bad mechanic that just remove the fun from the game. In Magicka 1 you could go crazy with the magicks and still die. Console controller UI. C'mon, all of us here use a keyboard and mouse. Ice is OP. Ice walls are as durable as earth walls AND refelct lasers, like the pure Shield walls. Ice walls with Death element don't explode anymore. The QREASA combination from your sword is pathetically weak, because the ice doesn't explode anymore. The Ice was often used offensively in Magicka 1. Now it's the ultimate protection, leaving earth and shield walls useless compared to to Ice. You can't stack the pure Shield walls on other walls. Casting the Shield wall where and Earth wall is will replace it, not stack on it. Highround advantage is too big. Enemy on highground can drop down projectiles on you, even if you are behind a wall. The walls should be a lot higher, OR allow us to aim lasers and stuff on highground. I like what they did to the pure Ice shard, continuously firing them is cool, but I don't like how they removed the DQRQRQRS ""Morning Star"" combo. I liked my spikey balls :( This time, if you combine Ice with earth, it will fire the ice shards quickly as you charge up force, like pure Ice does in the 1st Magicka. No fall damage from Water explosions. Water balls and water walls were often used to knock around the enemy. Pure AOE casting is not big enough. In the 1st Magicka a 5x Water AOE cast almost covered the entire screen and was good for getting light enemies off of you. Now not only the AOE is reduced, but the force of the knockback as well. The Push Magick doesn't quite replace this, because it only works in 1 direction, not all around you.On the bright side, I like what they did to the movement and the emphasis on the ""Don't cross the beams"" combos.

												I got this for me and my friend thinking it would be better than the first. It's not. This game doesn't use steamworks and connecting to the paradox servers proved extraordinarily difficult, and inconsistant once you managed to connect. Moving around is very floating and awkward compared to the first and (IMO) the game looks worse overall than the first. If you want a fun game to play with your friends, get the first game instead. First one is cheaper and uses steamworks which makes connecting with friends a hell of a lot easier.			"

												Although I believe magicka 2 is a fun and challenging game on its own (especially with friends) it seems to fall a little flat compared to Magicka 1. The pros-Better graphics, shiny, optimized -Multiplayer is smooth, no crashes, disconnects bugs -Hotbar for quickcasting magicks you don't want to memorize-Casting spells on the move-an Inventory like system that allows you to choose weapons/robesHowever, I believe the game is getting quite a few negative reviews because it just lacks the content of the first game. The main issue for me personally was this artificial skill ceiling created by cooldown on your magicks. In the first game you could play for hours and hours and constantly be getting better and more skilled, able to chain complex magicks extremely fast. In Magicka 2... Usually you are capped out at casting no more than 2 at a time, the reason is there is a 2 secondish cooldown on any magicks you manually cast and that includes ALL of your magicks, and as far as i know, there isn't a way to turn that off. You could say this is a good thing, it creates more challenging play, critical thinking, and balance. However... all those are ruined by the introduction of Steam... Steam is incredibly overpowered and there are hardly any enemies resistant to it in the campaign. I played through hard in a few hours with a buddy and all we had to do was spam steam/lightning/arcane to win. Now i'm not talking slightly overpowered... this is coming from someone who has spent hundreds of hours in magicka 2, my buddy who had only played a few hours, was literally better than me because he chose to spam the steam spells and i was trying out magicks and throwing out a variety. There is also less content, no multiplayer arena battles, the challenges are the same a bit lackluster, lack of maps, less magicks that are more (balanced) as in nothing too complex and overpowering.  Overall Coming from someone who spent over 100 hours in magicka 1, i would give the game a 6/10  It is a fun game itself but pales in comparison to the content and mastery achieved by the first game.

												This review will make more sence if you played magicka 1If you liked magicka 1 you probably will like this. It continues with the magicka humor and adds a couple new things like artifacts, unlockable staves and robes etc. They changed the way spellcasting works, regarding the elements steam and ice, which may not be a bad thing as it makes the player try new elements. However, they also changed the controls from the origional so that shift and middle-mouse button  is area of effect and middle-mouse button alone is still self casting. It,s happened SO many times to me that i would press shift and middle-mouse button but for some reason it wasn't registered and I kill myself. I dont know if this happens to anyone else, however...OH, and having at least one friend to play the game with is advisable as it is more fun :-)			"

I honestly cant answer that right now, need to stop laughing first! Extremely fun game, especially to play with friends, but if i should hold it up against the first game? I would say that Magicka 1 had alot more fun gameplay, but was lagging in replayability, where Magicka 2 offers more replayability, but less content. But id personally give it a few months and wait for all the crazy DLC's that Magicka franchise is known for ;)			"

												Is this game stupid? Without a doubt. Does this game have bugs? Ofcause it does. Is this game challenging? Id say so. And last but not least; Is this game fun to play? I honestly cant answer that right now, need to stop laughing first! Extremely fun game, especially to play with friends, but if i should hold it up against the first game? I would say that Magicka 1 had alot more fun gameplay, but was lagging in replayability, where Magicka 2 offers more replayability, but less content. But id personally give it a few months and wait for all the crazy DLC's that Magicka franchise is known for ;)			"

												After hearing about one of my favourite games getting a sequel, I could not have been more thrilled. Its such a shame that many issues from the original game were not only carried over but amplified in this one. I am not going to lie, from playing the game for over an hour I can tell how much the fact that the game was developed with the PS4 in mind affected the game. The Good:-I know that graphics don't make a game by the cartoony artstyle of the first game was not only fully captured and encanced in this sequel. The game uses some great new effects that make the world feel more vibrant and lively.-The controls have been refined. The game does not feel as loose as the first one. It is easier to control your character and cast spells with the new UI that makes it easier to navigate your spells.-Unlike the first game, Magicka 2 uses progression to unlock new types of robes and weapons. This might be seen as a negative however it might decrease the amounr of DLC released in the future and makes the stages more challenging for the player.-The ""Artifact System"". This new system allows you to customise your difficulty by using artifacts which can create an experience right for you.-The Hotkey spells. Unlike in Magicka, this time around you can bind spells to hotkeys which allows for their faster cast rate. It is different and I find it a great addition as it speeds up the gameplay. I do see how this change can be a detraction from the experience.While Magicka 2 imrpoves several gameplay elements, I am affraid outside of game you will not have much luck. This game had been clearly designed with the PS4 in mind and therefore, the matchmaking is reduced to creating a game or joining a random one. The game lacks any sort of proper server making or Steam integration which does not work well with the lack of voice communication in the game. Unlike the first game, in here the difficulty spikes at a faster rate creating a really harsh experience for lone players in the game. To add insult to injury, the community currently in the game is nothing but atrocious, I had people join my game just to try to kill me so they could play alone, or people trying to kill me to get me out of the game. The lack of voice communication makes it almost impossible to teamwork with strangers and the community does not help. This issue was already present in the first game, with the ingame matchmaking being pretty poor however, this game makes it dozens of times worse by removing lobbies or servers. Therefore, I would say that if you have at least 1 but prefferably 3 friends to play with, get this game! You will surely enjoy it in one way or another. If its because of the humour, the spell systems or the challenge. However, if you are looking at this game as something to play alone or as a game to find new friends in, stay away from it and try the other 2 games in the series. I hope you find this helpful and contact me if you'd need someone to play with.			"

												As many other then me already pointed out, I never thought I would give a Magicka game a bad review. Of course we had the Wizard wars, which really wasn't for me, but not an actual ""bad game"". I think we all wanted A magicka similiar to the first one, unfortunately we didn't.For me it was a certain features from magica 1 that I really enjoyed and loved, features which made the game to one of the best I've ever played. But it feels like the company took all those fun features and threw it down the well. First, the movement system...Sigh...Theoretically the system is good. But when it comes to gameplay, not that much. It feels like you are floating over the map instead of moving, it's very easy to go further then you wanted. I think the movement system from magica 1 is perfect for the game. And it would have worked a lot better in Magica 2, much better then the new system. I can understand that the new system alows the player for a more ""tactical"" gameplay because you can move towards one direction while facing the other and aiming you spells. It's not that great in action.The second and the absolutely worst change according to me is the magic system...I love the feature in the first game where you had to combine elements to create spells. Sure you can still use the elements to cast the spells, you don't have to use 1-4. But it feels like the creators just tried to throw something at the fans from the first game, because this system is not what old magicka fans wants. We're told that if we use the elements to combine our spells there won't be any cooldowns...Yet i find a 2-3 seconds window before i can use the teleport spell, even when I'm combining the elements. So I don't really know why the game tells you there won't be any cooldowns when there clearly are. And Why would you ever implement cooldowns? It just seems like the badest idea the developers could possibly imagine. Games today are so obsessed with cooldowns. Why limit the player? because of balance? I personally believe that cooldowns ruin gameplay, sure when it comes to MMOs where server lag is a big part I can understand why they implement such a system. But when they do it to a 4 player coop game....? just WTF.In Magica 1 I felt like a powerfull wizard whith unlimited power who could just spew out spell after spell after spell and slay my enemies after desired fashion. In this game I feel more like a weak apprentice who can't do‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•for damage. I wanted to complete the game but I just couldn't, I didn't enjoy it at all. I got to the beginning of chapter 3, so I don't know which spells that will be presented to the player later in the game. But when the system is fundamentally flawed, I don't even want to know. Something I found very odd in this game is that my sword seemed like a more effective damage dealer then just my basic elements....I think that's very very weird for a game that portrays a wizard, a game which is all about magic. I could take about the flaws of magica 2 for hours, but I'll end with the item system. In magica 1 what ""items"" you had didn't really matter, it was all about the magic. Something I thought was very cool because of most games today is super obsessed with the idea that the item makes the character, not his abilities. That's one part of what made Magicka 1 so great in the first way. So why the obsession with ""gear"" in this game? I can just say I'm really disapointed in this game, and on the developers. I know they try to make good games, I just can't understand why they'd remove the fun part of the game...I hope next game is better! (but just don't make another magicka game, I'll never buy one of those again) "

												I saw that the reviews were getting better since the initial release so I decided to give it a try. While I'm happy that the AI's difficulty has been upped since the first game, I abhor the spell cooldown system. A huge part of my enjoyment while playing the first magicka was spamming overpowered spells after having memorised each and every one of them. With Magicka 2, you can no longer do that. Other than that, the game has been really entertaining for me so far, the storyline, humor, even better than the first game. Would probably be more fun once I play this multiplayer.Edited (After completing campaign on normal difficulty, attempting some trials and challenges on normal and hard difficulties and collecting all magicks):It seems that the idea of having a cool down for spells is actually for balancing purposes. After getting used to the controls, I feel like normal mode is easy as long as you calmly analyse the enemies' elemental resistance and cast the appropriate elements countering them. It is no doubt more difficult than the first Magicka so take some time to learn the elemental and spell interaction mechanics. Moving around is much more important as shield spells are no longer as strong as they used to be. Ultimately, I think this is actually better than the first Magicka although I still find myself soloing most things since many people will immediately kick you from their game without even letting you show your abilities to work as a team without blowing them up to bits in every battle. Verdict: Get this game, especially if you have good friends who can play with you. Seriously, like 9/10 rating, for its price this is one of the most enjoyable games I've had in a long time.			"

												In my opinion, Magicka 2 is almost as good as the first one. Only thing that I dislike is how action packed it is. (hear me out)In Magicka 1, you were able to relax and take it slow, but now there's tons of enemies. It would have been cool if Paradox made the enemies stronger but fewer. I miss all the peaceful Magicka 1 moments.			"

												As a person who never played Magicka, but only played wizard wars, I would recommend this game. All these bad reviews about Magicka 2 is not like the original is completely countered by the fact that I never played it. The point I am getting to is, if you played the original Magicka, then don't buy this game. All you will do is complain about your spells not working. But if you haven't played Magicka, then buy this game. It is worth your money.			"

												Forgetting my issues with the mechanics, the gameplay itself seems to be largely lacking in many respects. So far I've run through all the levels with the same tactic as it's been the only one to work for me, but at the my current boss fight it seems that all the difficulty and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ttery has been rolled into one. I would much rather have had a fun game that prompts me to think outside of a box instead of one that rewards me for finding the easy road and then slaps me on the wrist later on when this method is suddenly thrown out the window. Overall I had much more fun playing Magicka 1 and I would have rather just bought and played through that again.			"

												This game is one step forward, two steps back, it goes back to wizard wars, a simplified version of magicka where creativity is restricted, unlike the original magicka, you can no longer get the ice crystal or steam as an actual icon, which is inhibiting  what you can do with the game itself.In all honesty, just buy magicka 1, it will save you money and time, and will be a whole lot more worth it.

												I'm neither Yes or No when it comes to rating this game. This is only because they game JUST came out. However currently the game is on my negative list. Here's why...Me and my friend were so hyped up to get Magicka 2. We thought about more spells, more fun, and overall a better experience. When the game came out we already started to notice so minor flaws before even starting the prologue.- For one, the game forces you to use an account to play with each other. I don't like people forcing things on me...- Another thing is, as always with every game, it is normal for a gamer to configure his settings; am I right? I was able to easily lower the graphics to my laptops standards. Everything seems great so far! Well what are we waiting for, let's start! SOOOO, as soon as we get in, we try to heal are selves with the scroll click. It don't work. Normally, I would have no problem HOWEVER, a chain reaction starts to roll in, so stick with me here.- I press pause to configure my settings. I can't even configure them when paused... :'(- Here's where it gets worse, there are absolutely no key bindings, so here me and my friend are, sitting down trying to figure out an alternative method. (P.S if any body know one please Steam message me). - We give up.- Now I know what your thinking. THE GAME JUST CAME OUT!!!!!!!JIJ!IJ ifajijfi rabble rabble rabble!!! I understand this COMPLETELY. But, why release the FULL version, if you know there gonna be bugs and errors? Why not put the game in early development or BETA? Perhaps it is me that doesn't understand. Don't fear however, as there are MANY positive things about to back me up, but not enough atm to change my negative opinion. Get the gist?- I love the integration of having 5 elements at a time, it definitely adds on to the fact of having more spells. This make me happy.- The graphics and smoothness have GREATLY improved!- Story seems to be great so far!So there you go folks! In my straight up deep opinion, I believe you should wait a month or so when they improve the game before you buy it, as you will have the horrible feeling of not being able to play what was thought to be a great game at the moment, in the palm of your very hands. (and by that I mean Steam library lul).			"

This. Is. Not. Magicka. One.This is Magicka 2, with fresh engine developed for M:WW, so there are ""similarities"".There are Oh So Many reviews about how bad it is for not being Magicka 1, so Ill write a positive one.1. Controls: Little sloppy, true. Still, you can learn to use it and they offer a whole new set of possibilities, like casting while still running in completely different direction - saved me more than once. You are a little to slow compared to monsters, you need to use spells if you want distance and in many fights you have nowhere to run2. Steam and Ice: Electric Wall Of Death was most OP spell in the game, seconded by Spray / Ray Of Electric Steam. So they removed it, and suddenly you need to USE MORE THAN TWO COMBINATIONS AND EXPLOIT ENEMY WEAKNESS! How horrible and casual! Yeah, game is harder - but it is supposed to be hard and took time to master! Orcs too fast? Slow them down, put a barrier, wear armor. Spam < Tactic ( < Tactical Spam Review).They could menage it differently tbh, morphing steam/ice into fire/cold after adding lightning. Now they are useful, but hard to combine.3. Magicks: If you want to spam thunderbolt, go play Zeus in Dota or something like that. This is again step for balance and equality. Not between controllers and keyboards, but against custom macros in some keyboards. Not fun when one can bind 10k dmg to one key. You can still use them rather fast as combinations, its like 1.5s cd, and little cast time.Humor is still there, little different but present.Camera is fine, and arena lock forces other tactics than running.Overall, game is very enjoyable, even in single. If you have spare money it is a good buy.			"

												Feels very unfinished, Solo is no fun at all.The amount of enemies has been increased and you can get swarmed easy but the amount of damage you put out feels reduced. They change how elements fit together now so instead of putting Fire+Water= Steam and getting a new icon and being able to change it up a bit. The change to the combinations of the elements stays separate and now you cancel it out. A lot of the fun spells like (steam+arcane+lightning x3) are no longer a thing.There is a cool down on comb spells like hast, it's minor but when you have a small health bar and the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•is charging at you constantly it kills it. Personally I am not happy with this buy at all, I would rather play the old magicka then this one.Sad to say it but I feel like i wasted my money.			"

												In comparison to it's former, the game is a bit more lackluster than the previous. It's as if they took a table, tore a leg off of it, and covered it in paint. Sure, it looks different. But it's still similar to the original. There needs to be some more content than what there is now. Magicka has tons, and I mean TONS of items without DLC. Magicka 2 has very few in comparison, especially if you include all of their respective DLCs. As of right now, Magicka is much more worth it than this one, especially with the huge discounts. Now, I wouldn't write a review if I didn't play this game more. I have it on my PS4, and even if the controller brings a different experience in terms of control, the general feel is still there. By no means am I saying ""Hey, don't get this game because it's terrible."" It isn't, it's pretty alright. Now, to bring up few things that I felt were a bit jarring at first; The adjustments to shield channeling. As well as the poison element. I can get both of them, and they're both great! It's just that I tended to use water arcane attacks while a friend would use cold or lightning-based ones, which would result in a rather horrifying combo. TL;DR Just get Magicka 1, until more things are added onto this one.			"

												CRUSHING DISAPOINTMENTThis feels like a knock off product or a spin off licensed game.Less spell varietySlower pacingBoring levelsSimplified gameplayForced ""wacky"" comedyClear Console focusThe almost traditional bugsThis title doesn't have the same frenetic flow and hilarious (often disastrous) antics. You move, charge spells and heal slower, combined with the new ""click once"" movement the gameplay feels unresponsive and tiring.The removal of combined elements limits spell options and cuts down on experimentation, no longer will you res your friends just to kill them all over again with a new combination you just thought of.Weaker impacts from spells and the inability to decimate enemies with the ease of Magicka feel like a denial of what made the first game so memorable. Spells were not balanced in the original game and that was half the fun, obliterating half the screen with your latest creation or an accidental botched spell. This attempt to balance the game as if it were a competitive title just goes against the entertainment of the original. Maps are even more linier than the original game and often dotted with pitfalls and terrain to limit movement even further. This creates false challenge from holes in the level you couldn't see, to being hemmed in with enemies upon respawn with no brief invulnerability.There's a definate push for more DLC opportunities. The original was flooded with DLC too, but now weapons, robes and even just colour options are part of an account bound loadout. I may be cynical here, but I believe this is so they can sell more individual gear and equipment.The game is cluttered with console changes, quick cast spells that are easier for a controller, constant button prompts, and a UI designed for party play in a living room rather than over the net. With the slower pace and change in movement controls to favour a thumbstick, I keep feeling I'm playing a lazy port of the PS4 game.I regret my purchase of this game.			"

												Well I'm recommending it. I‚Äôd say wait for a sale though. There are some good things about it and some not so good things right now.The Good:Its Magicka! Despite all the changes it still retains the feeling of the first game.Its fun with friends and its a great ‚Äúcouch and tv‚Äù game.The gamepad controls are a vast improvement over Magicka 1.Magic shortcuts are convenient. Just 4 of them and they have a cooldown. I think it keeps things balanced well enough.Streaming works better.Multiplayer works without crashing.The Bad:They dumbed down the spells a bit (biggest gripe). This is ok for the most part. I don‚Äôt miss fire and water combining into a steam element for example. However, there still needs to be a way to cast every single spell from the first game and there just isn‚Äôt. This game is labeled ‚Äú2‚Äù meaning it should build on the first game and give players MORE, not TAKE AWAY features and say its just as good. I want Vortex and Meteors back! If not those, then I want some equally powerful visually dazzling spell combos. The new preformed magick system is awesome in my opinion but should be customizable. You should be able to write in your own combos as you discover them. There should also be more like 50 Magicks like there were in the first game as opposed to the 10 or so you can choose from now‚Ä¶There needs to be a proper server list. I want to see which games I can join, how many players, public/private, etc. I would also like to be able to join a level at the beginning rather than jumping in right at the last 10 seconds of a boss.Needs more levels. There are only 9! Thats ridiculous in my opinion. I got through the whole campaign solo in about 4 hours. I understand that there will likely be expansions but there should have been more at launch.Needs more to do. There is a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù mode but the arenas from the first game seem to be gone. I want to set up a custom match between 1-4 wizards and have us duke it out without waves of enemies appearing. There also needs to be more arena maps to accommodate this.Should have more players. I like the 4 player thing. Its nice. But I want more. I was kind of expecting M2 to have at least a few massive maps and you could play with 16 players (4 teams of 4) at a time.Verdict:Ok so I wrote more bad than good. I still recommend this game. Its just fun. Its dorky and if this is your style of humor you‚Äôll have a good time with it.			"

												Played it with friends.Found the duck staff.They are waiting for me to return to the game, but I decided I had to write a review.The game is pretty fun, too. Just look if you can try it out before you buy it, so you won't be disappointed afterwards, because you didn't get what you expected.			"

												In comparison to it's former, the game is a bit more lackluster than the previous. It's as if they took a table, tore a leg off of it, and covered it in paint. Sure, it looks different. But it's still similar to the original. There needs to be some more content than what there is now. Magicka has tons, and I mean TONS of items without DLC. Magicka 2 has very few in comparison, especially if you include all of their respective DLCs. As of right now, Magicka is much more worth it than this one, especially with the huge discounts. Now, I wouldn't write a review if I didn't play this game more. I have it on my PS4, and even if the controller brings a different experience in terms of control, the general feel is still there. By no means am I saying ""Hey, don't get this game because it's terrible."" It isn't, it's pretty alright. Now, to bring up few things that I felt were a bit jarring at first; The adjustments to shield channeling. As well as the poison element. I can get both of them, and they're both great! It's just that I tended to use water arcane attacks while a friend would use cold or lightning-based ones, which would result in a rather horrifying combo. TL;DR Just get Magicka 1, until more things are added onto this one.			"

												If you loved magicka 1 you will love magicka 2. Same awesome humour and playstyle that you will recognize from the first game mixed with some approvements.One of the new awesome thinks is that you can now have your magicks on a actionbar so they are easier to use, this I love cause I didnt use the magicks very much in Magicka cause it was a bit complicated. At the smae time you dont have to cause you can still use the keycombination if you like. Best if both worlds so to speak. Another function I like is that the weapons you pick up can be found in the main menu and you can equip whatever standard weapon you like to your character.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the first game (41 hours). From it's root to his core, this game was brilliant. A lots of humor, simple but enjoyable gameplay, etc. Magicka 2 tries to revive all thoses feelings and the result is a complete faillure. First of all the developpers wanted to counter the spam of spells incounter in the first game. Now, it feels slow and boring. Also the way of moving is different from the first game and it feels like sh*t. Unprecise, unresponsive... In one hour of playing time, I die a lot because of the lack of precision in the mouvement.The engine is way more polish than the first game but the lack of options or widescreen display is unexusable. Magicka 2 adds nothing to the franchise except a taste of ""d√©j√†-vu"" and a feeling a getting bored after one hour of playing. Vald should have stay a f****** vampire and not suck off the entire magic of the second one.Such a waste...			"

												This game has been falsely accused for being too ""casual"".I'll tell you all the truth right now:Today I saw guys who were telling everyone to not buy this game because it's bad but actually they've played this game only for couple of minutes and were stuck on chapter 1 at normal difficulty level cause they were terrible noobs and I assume you that most of all the negative reviews are written by noobs like these.Either they are stuck on chapter 1 because their hands grow from their backs or they've decided to jump on a ""bandwagon of hate"". Some of those noobs who've played the game only for 20 minutes even dare to say that the game has only 4 magicks...So, don't be tricked by those reviews and even if some will say that people who give positive reviews are just ""fanboys who defend game developers"" don't believe them cause I'm not trying to ""white-knight"" anybody here.I'm just telling truth and if that's not enough for you to believe that me or someone else whose opinion is similar to mine is telling truth about this game just check my or their profiles and you'll see that they've played it for more time than any of those haters did.----------------------------------------------------------Now some review about the game itself:Most of the people are complaining about removal of overpowered magicks. What they actually want to say is that ""it's bad to kill enemies using tactics, thinking, escaping, defending"" and they'd rather just use some overpowered magicks on enemies for it to be ""1 second job"".Judge for yourself what's better but as I think it's better to have real fun thinking than just watching enemies die in a seconds.People say ""those hotkeys were made for stupid PS users"". Those hotkeys got recharge time and that's what people are mostly complaining about. Actually those recharges can be easily bypassed if you'll activate magicks manually.Example: Pressing 3 to use thunderhead will take 3 seconds to recharge with basic set. But if you'll do FFSAA this'll make it activate right after it was fully conjured so everytime you use thunderhead with FFSAA you can just do FFSAA again and there'll be no recharge time and still you'll get that magick activated.People say ""game is non-beatable on bananas alone"". Actually I completed game on bananas alone and even if that's hard it's still manageable because familiars that revive you can be revived too, if you'll not run like mad but watch your step and try to deal with enemy groups one by one you'll get your success.Only thing that I don't like about this game is that it doesn't have much of a content. Sure there'll be more downloadable content and updates later but for now it's not much.			"

												I loved the orginal Magicka, lots of fun, could be difficult at times, but that added to the depth for me.  When I heard about this one I thought awesome!  I liked the idea of spells while I moved and even more spells!  The problem is it's so easy to get overwhelmed by enemies.Regardless of if you're taking them seriously if you get slightly cornered once it's over.  Very little due to skill, just chance, and you running in endless circles hoping not to be killed by tiny little threats.  Combined with the sluggishness I can't bear to play it.Pushed through quite a few chapters then had to give it up.  Also, the oftentimes rand resistances in enemies, and lack of your own through the shield spell makes you get hung up even more often.			"

												Let me say from the start that I have close to 100 hours in Magicka 1. I LOVED the game, it was fun with or without friends to play with. Let me also say that in the original Magicka, I played the game at a time when playing the game was always buggy and near on impossible and therefore the majority of that play time was solo.In Magicka 2, playing solo is just frustrating. The game doesn't scale whatsoever and plays the same (same number of enemies, same damage etc...) no matter how many people are in your party. This makes the game immensely difficult to play alone. You find yourself consistently dying and then to avoid death, you have to spam the same abilities over and over again and play a very defensive game which is not the way the game is intended to be played. Some particularly irksome points are:- The fact that abilities are now on cooldown - In Magicka 1, I loved to be able to spam ASF to use haste, it helped to create a better style of play where I was able to run to an area with no enemies, cast some spells and kill some dudes. In Magicka 2 this isn't possible, you're always backed into a corner with nowhere to run. The enemies are too fast and without added people to revive you, you will be constantly having to restart.- The fact that teleport is random - This seriously annoyed me. Teleport in the first game was given to the played fairly late in the story. It was a complete game changer! Here, teleport is given to you in the second level and it almost feels worthless using it because you could be teleported right into the path of an enemy and then be unable to teleport away because the spell is on cooldown?!- Your game is set to invite people as default - Magicka 2 creates an open game without really telling you. You therefore have to manually set the game to private in order to guarantee that you can play alone or only with people you invite to the game. - Frost and water no longer combine to make ice and fire and water no longer combine to make steam. They all just fill up the spell bar and this makes for fewer combinations!- Lightning and Death combine to make a lightning based attack rather than a beam based attack (different from the first game) not really sure why they did this, it seems to make little sense and allows doesn't allow for powerful mega death beams containing lightning, fire and death.- Ultimately, the game feels like it was made for PS4 and then they released on PC as an afterthought.This game is hugely disappointing to me as I truly am a huge fan of the first game. I will continue to play through the game but I doubt I will be collecting everything and finding all the achievements as I did in the first game. The humour is still there and the voice acting still great, but Magicka is all about the gameplay, feeling like a powerful wizard and crushing your enemies with amazing spell combinations. For me, Magicka 2 didn't encapsulate this for me and as a result has left me wanting to return to Magicka 1.TL;DR:Not as good as the first Magicka, go pick up the first game and all the DLC for half the price of this game and play that instead.

												Pre-ordered this game an hour before release. DAMN YOU IMPULSE BUYING!!!!!!!!!Unfortunately all of the negative reviews are true. The console cancer has spread and affected this game on top of the usual shoddy coding and gameplay issues which were expected.From the forced Paradox login which doesn't even allow to copy and paste your password, to in game windows which do not disappear, to randomly getting stuck on screen, to music getting bugged and start playing on top of itself, to being unable to switch the controller off while in game, to non working achievements page - this game makes all of the mistakes first Magica did and feels bugged, unpolished, lacking in details and attention.You'd think that after dozens of dlcs, hundreds of patches the last game received the developers would be more thorough and attentive but alas - its just as bad as it was years ago with the first game. It's even more mind boggling since Magica 2 was developed by another game studio. Did everyone stop testing games before release? Is this real life?Personally i don't care that you can't combine spells in a que now. In previous Magica players either used random spells and didn't bother with finding ""perfect"" combinations or used 2-3 overpowered spells on macros. At least i did. And it wasn't fun. Variety and ability to use different builds is what makes the game fun. If i wanted to use strictly one build, one set of items and one set of spells id be playing Diablo 3. Which i am playing but that's besides the point. The point is - balance and variety trumps overpowered overused spell combinations. Now if only this game had the balance and variety... i mean cmon - that rock takes like 5-7 seconds to charge now wtf?What i do care the most about this game are bugs and controls. Yes you can use the controller now. I've tried it for 45 seconds and im never using it again, so let me switch it off and change the controls in game, kplsthxbye. No i am not going to edit some txt file, try harder. I SAID TRY HARDER! Also fix characters getting stuck and freak out for no apparent reason. Also fix music. And achievements. Then we will talk. Meanwhile im down-voting. Good day sir's. I SAID GOOD DAY!			"

												Preliminary review:Avoid this game, for now at least.If you lose internet connection, you can`t play. Not even single player mode. Also once lost, you don`t see any options etc, you have to Alt F4 the game & start over. This is appalling & should of been spotted before release. They`ve found the problem, but now we have to wait for the fix which will be Soon‚Ñ¢There are some things missing that every game should have, the main one being:Keybinds; you can`t change these without using external software (Thank the Vizards I use Logitech mouse software...).It is floaty. Unlike Magicka (& Wizard Wars) it seems like you`re just floating about or on ice, you also can`t stop yourself from moving with a key, like could in the past.Cooldowns on spells: I`ve no idea why this was added, but it`s terribad & than some. Even when you ""get used"" to this, there are times when the spells still refuse to work.Settings; It starts the game/intro, before you can ever get to settings to change audio (which was on LOUD!! & gfx on a lower res then defaulte. In game, you can`t change any of these, you have to quit to main menu, alter them & start over. I assume it also means in party, all players`ll get kicked just so you can change the settings(?).Cloud saves: I don`t use cloud on steam because it WILL feck up saves at times, but Magicka2 also uses it`s own cloud & there`s no option to turn this off.Character: You can only name your char` once. Whilst not overly bad, what if you have kids/wife etc & they want to play on their own char`? Welp, they can`t :(Display of Controller & keybinds, especially during the tutorial, clutters the screen. It should detect what you`re using & only display those.Speech bubbles/UI hints are huge & can block the combat, a transparency setting here may help.Erm...Pro`s:If you got the deluxe pre-order, some of the robes/weapons are reeeeeally nice, especially as you get these in Magicka Wizard Wars too.Paradox do seem to have taken note of some of these on the forums, so hopefully it`ll get sorted....Soon‚Ñ¢			"

Work in Progress(Since i haven't finished the campaign)So since i pre-ordered the game i've been hyping since it would come out :D!!Overall opinions!I think this game is the best and funniest game of all time! It gives you a very fun gameplay,The characters and jokes are simply hilarious! The weapons and combats are very good coded WE HAVE SHORTCUTS PEOPLE! The graphics are simply beautiful! <3Story is perfect!The comedy is still dominating.And this is what i think of the game so far!First of all the story and the gameplay is very well done! I mean wow....This game sets the bar pretty high up, the comedy in the game is still as good if not better then in the first one, sometimes with even a couple of surprises. The characters are very well made, detailed and with funny voices. Remember when you entered the game and the weapons sometimes disappeared including the staff, the ones you had before you left? Now that has been solved! The ''remake'' of the character choosing with colours and stuff are much better now then before, the fact that you can now choose the staff and weapon of your choice before you enter the game is brilliant (including voice changes)!The combat level is really great, the idea of having shortcuts as in the MMO/RPG games is very useful and great to have right now. It makes the combats much more faster and smoother. Since it is a littlebit more difficult to survive it is very good to have a shortcut because you don't always have the time to do the combo. The combat itself is very well made. It isn't to nerfed and it isn't to op. I think it was a good idea to remove the (for those who doesn't know) combo what i think was pretty OP, when you combined steam with electricity you got a pretty damn good beam and made major damage	, the problem with that combo was that once you learned it, you almost never changed to any other magic combos in combat. By removing this you're going to want to take a more strategic approach to this game compared to Magicka 1.It has everything you asked for, the spell books which you find is very obvious, (Unless there is more spells added then before which is hidden???) The graphics are so cool that it made my brain explode, everything is so beautiful, well designed. Now the shield got nerfed which i personally think is good because you can't stand there forever and boost it up, BUT!! You take much more damage now from small creatures then before which makes it a challenge to defeat the monsters, now goblins and orcs aren't the problems. The problem is that when you find for example a larger mob meanwhile there comes a lot of orcs and other creatures it makes it a littlebit hard to survive, but once again you need to think more now to try defeating the monsters. I haven't got far in the story but so far it's really good and i don't find any problems!So i still love the game and hope it will be just better and better, Brb, time to play some Magicka 2 <3			"

												I liked Magicka 2. Was it shorter than Magicka 1? Yes. Was it less fun? No. Me and my girlfriend appreciated the new control scheme, even though it took a few flaming rocks to the head to get used to it :) We played with logitech controllers and it was a much better experience than Magicka 1. Here's what I liked:- Same awesome friend killing, enemy slaying coop. - Nicer graphics- Better control scheme for controllers- Harder difficulty (Magicka 1 was pretty easy)- More enemies- Enemies were though out better so you need to make a strategy about how to kill them- Jokes and references still aboundHere's what was off:- High difficulty playing alone. I tried. It didn't work out so well :) All of the enemies quickly surround you and then you die. Then you get revived back in the mob. And then die :)- Not as long as the Magicka 1- Difficult to find unlockables. Went through the first level a few times and couldn't find more than half of the secrets.But all in all, when your girlfriend tries to heal you and instead casts a death bomb at you and you both die laughing, it's worth every penny.

												the first thing youll notice about this game is that its insanely short when compared to the first magicka and all you really get are updated graphics and more balanced spells a disappointment when i see that the difficulty has skyrocketed as the game has been balanced with multiplayer in mind so going solo ends up just being a big ""YOU DIED"" screen magicka 2 is great for the price it offers but just compared to what was before it just seems subpar magicks (specialty spells like tele-port and rain) are very very lacking as theres only a hand full where as in the first one there were 22 spells at your disposal and dlc gave 8 more whereas magicka 2 gives you 11 magicks to work with by the end of the game sure theres challenges and harder story difficulties but the game just seems lacking next to its older wizard im certain they went the way of evolve but rather than tell people ""theres gonna be a TON of dlc in the future"" theyre gonna just wait till you figure it out on your own get ready for that 8 dollar map (not map pack just Map as in single map)i still like the game despite its numerous flaws and hope for another wizard based game in the future			"

												I'm guessing all the people who put negative reviews haven't played Magicka: Wizard Wars.I also looked at their time played, none of them have played the game as long as I have.Let me tackle the first issue that I saw, the spellcasting. I'm gonna be honest, the first game's spellcasting was seriously flawed. Go start up your Magicka 1 and use ONLY steam, lightning, and arcane(now called death. Way more fitting to be honest). I bet you can beat the entire game using only that combo. This game is meant for you to try others. With that broken combo out of the way, I feel that I can happily use other spells knowing the game is balanced.Another issue I saw was logging in. If you played Magicka: Wizard Wars, then you DO NOT have to create an additional account. This game was MEANT for the people coming from Magicka: Wizard Wars. The controls are the same and the spellcasting is the same with 2 more spell slots.Someone also said there is ""No free will with magicks"" which they are horribly mistaken. There are actually TWO ways to use magicks. One way is the quick bar. The quick bar allows you to quickly use magicks without having to put in the elements. By using the quick bar, however, you are struck with a cooldown for that magick.... ONLY for the quick bar. BUT, if you manually enter in the magick, like the old game, you are NOT struck with a cooldown. I have confirmed this with many magicks.Rebinding keys... I technically don't have a say in this since I adapt to any default keys in any game. To be honest, others should, too. But I hear rebinding keys are in the works. No doubt that they will release a Magick that is related to it. *cough* Crash to Desktop *cough*This game is truly a great game. My favorite moment so far was when me and a goblin with a flamethrower were going at it. I was just spraying him with frost and he was spraying fire. At first I was about to win, then the thing freaking smacked me in the face with his flamethrower. 10/10 will spray again.EDIT:I will add one more point. This game has a lot more mobility than in the other game. I can now move around while using spells. Way better.EDIT 2:There actually is a cooldown by manually entering the magick in. But it is hardly noticeable as it is about 1-2 seconds and it is still significantly faster than using the quick bar.EDIT 3:I hope people know that this game comes after Wizard Wars in the timeline. It's only logical to think that it would be like Wizard Wars. I mean, in the trailer, the Arcane was the same exact thing as the Arcane in wizard wars.			"

												I started playing this game after the patch with my two nieces 7 and 10 years old. For me it's a better version of the original magicka. Visually it looks better, all the spells are there with the addition of poison, it's much easier to create spells with the controller, the fact that you can fast cast spells helps a lot. Highly recommended fun co-op game.			"

												I'm going to be as fair as I can. Do I recommend this game? Yes. It's an unique, adventure game that is a lot of fun with friends and the devs increased the replay value a little by adding multiple levels of difficulty to the  adventure  this time.But I have to be honest on my feelings towards this sequel that I was looking forward to for quite some time. At the time of writing this review I have about 20hrs in game and almost 700 hrs in the prequel. I was clearly an avid Magicka player but I felt this sequel fell short of what made the original game ""magical"" (pun intended). Lets start with the spell casting. I miss the freedom and creativity of casting a multitude of varying spells at will to defeat my surrounding enemies in the prequel. Where as in the sequel I feel limited, weaker and as if I'm spamming the same spells because not much else works. Also the Magicks are no where near as impressive as in the original.The challenge mode is another example of ""better in the prequel"" and the missing VS mode is a disappointment and if Magicka: Wizard Wars is supposed to fill that void then... no thanks. I already had my fill on the sequel and not sure how much more time I'll spend on it. I understand that this game was developed for the PS4 as well. Not sure if the changes were to make the game more controller friendly or if the devs wanted to manipulate how players played their game. In comparison this Magicka has lost it's touch.----Bottom Line----Magicka 2 is a cool little game on it's own. But with it's prequel standing behind, it's easily overshadowed. Some may agree that Magicka 2 would make more sense as the prequel and the original it's sequel. If you never played any Magicka game before I recommend this one because the online presence in the first game is almost non existent at this point.			"

												Never played the first Magicka, but came straight in to Magicka 2.  The spell creation/casting mechanic is pretty much unlike any I've ever played before, and I love it!  Four-player co-op with friends is hugely entertaining; our tendency to kill each other is mostly due to finding exciting new combinations of spells to lay waste to everything around us... other wizards just happen to be frequenly in the way!

												It has mixed reviews for a reason. While the first game was good, this game is almost completely identical! I wouldn't pay anything for this, because the changes to the game are so minor, it ammounts to little more than a small handful of gameplay tweaks, and a new campaign. I would expect this much content to be a completely free update, and this honestly feels like I've just been swindled. In addition, the gameplay get MUCH more difficult very early into the game, likely because of the addition of spellcasting while moving. The developers seem to have overestimated how much of a difference this change makes to the gameplay, and coping with the increased diffifulty is very frustrating. The only thing I can consider an upside of this game is that it looks slightly more modern (still not comparable to almost any titles from 2015), and the multiplayer system is ever so slightly convoluted, although it does occasionally place you into mulitplayer without warning. In addition, I would steer clear of buying this if you have a mac, because several versions of OSX have a game breaking bug in which all key presses are recieved twice by the game, making it completely impossible to log into the game (a required step). Overall, the game feels extremely limited in terms of the value of the changes, to the point that playing this game feels similar to replaying the original. I would NOT recommend buying this game, unless you spent hundreds of hours on the original, and a new campaigne is worth this much money to you.			"

												Alright. lets put the cards on the table here:I would not recommend this game. I mean it is okay, but If you wanna play this game for the Magicka feeling, stick with the first game.As everyone says the Character movements are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and the keybindings suck.. You cannot cast spells in mid air and at one point in the game I got stuck because the objective kinda blended a bit too much in with the background. (Might have been me being stupid but still felt like it could have given some hints)Those are ofc just technical issues, but here's my real problem with this game.This isn't the Magicka I remember. This is just a cheap knockoff of Wizard Wars, and personally I didn't get the Magicka feel from Wizard Wars. I mean Magicka was full of secrets, references, Easter eggs and stupid puns and‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•This game has barely any of those things, and those things were the stuff that made Magicka so special.I mean of course you have to have a story to follow, but in Magicka I felt the developers kinda just took the story so unseriously through out the game which was hilarious. They still stuck with the lore but it had this comedy feeling too it which for me made the game perfect.But for Magicka 2, what the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• happened?! This game is more serious than Call of Duty's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing singleplayer campaign missions. There is barely any joking around and most of the references/easter eggs in the game was hard to understand wasn't really funny. To be honest I have to say I kinda got a bit bored playing this game, because it did not feel like Magicka at all. I mean your god damn trailers were hilarious! Game of Thrones parody, the Vlad's interview and the Karaoke singalong is how Magicka is supposed to be, not like this. The lore is just too serious and heavy.To be honest with you guys, you should stick to making trailers for games and not the actual game itself.I will be honest and say that aside from horrible keybinding and the fact that you can't cast spells in mid air, the spellcasting is okay. The game itself is okay too, but it's far from what made Magicka so special.Sorry to say but this kinda disappointed me.			"

												I know a lot of people are losing their minds over the switch from Magicka's movement controls to the Wizard Wars style movement, but I'm enjoying the game. The story is still Magicka and the game plays as such. Chaos reigns supreme as always, and it's a joy to murder your friends repeatedly. If anything, the move-while-you-cast controls make things MORE chaotic because my friends are idiots.But, I have two complaints:1. No key rebinds.2. You can't toggle move-while-you-cast off. I know a ton of people want that, and honestly I don't see why it's *not* an option.			"

												I give a thumb up because this game is worth the $15 you have to pay for it. Magicka 2 *is* a very good game, but it requires an update because in current's state, it's very hard to play and enjoy.Finishing the campaign in solo is awfully difficult and frustrating : The monsters keep blocking you with earth-spells and there is nothing more annoying than to see your movements limited by a badly though gameplay. All the spells have been heavily weakened. Throwing a huge rock to explode frozen monsters is so difficult you won't be able to do it unless really lucky. The shield is worthless, it doesn't block the monsters anymore. And rock barriers won't hold more than one or two seconds, useless.Your life is much lower than before, and everytime you are hit, your inputs are reset and frozen for two seconds. Winning in solo is basically : Never get hit, never get stuck, or you are dead. The game has been though to be multiplayer, nothing else.On the bright side, the fun is still there, voice acting is amazing, graphics are very nice, and animations are close to perfection.			"

												They took the Wizard Wars game mechanics, allowed 2 more elements per combo, made a new campaign and left the rest as is. You can't combine elements such as fire and water to make the steam element, however, you can still make steam. This is true for ice as well. This removes a great deal of the combination possibilities from the first game. Furthermore, the changes to how arcane (now death) and life interacts with lightning has removed the, IMO, cool shock beams.SUMMARY:If you, like me, hated the changes made to the Magicka series in Wizard Wars, stay far away from this game.If you found the changes to be superior, buy this, since this is Wizard Wars in single player mode.

Magicka 2: Learn to Feel Disappointment Again(for the record, ""disappointment again"" is not referring to Magicka as a disappointment. I'm more taking a stab at all sequels to great games suck)It pains me to give Magicka 2 a negative review considering I absolutely loved the hell out of the first one! This game wasn't all bad, as there are some pretty great improvements from the original Magicka but unfortunately the few bad things in this game outweigh the good for me.First, we'll talk about the good:Improved controls: I don't even know where to begin here. In Magicka, the controls were fairly simple, if not a tad janky but they worked nonetheless. In Magicka 2, they've definitely worked on the system. Now you can walk and cast, movement is much smoother, more responsive, and accurate.Better netcode:Pieces has opted to use Paradox's game service in Magicka 2 instead of Steamworks like they did in Magicka but it has drastically improved the netcode. Desynchronization is very seldom an issue anymore, if ever. Latency has been bumped down majorly, positions of enemies and objects are more accurate.Better optimizations (plus physics!):Performance seems to have increased tenfold in Magicka 2, as Magicka had its performance issues. Plus physics has been drastically improved. Physics-enabled items no longer jump around and twitch violently, force isn't as ridiculous as it was in Magicka (but then again it was the janky physics in Magicka that kind of was part of the entertainment for me)Sadly, here's the bad:The story:I was not impressed, especially with all the promises made on their trailers and announcements. I, much like a lot of the Magicka fanbase, fell for a lot of the promises the developers made for Magicka 2. I figured there was going to be a long (or at least moderately long) story, similar to Magicka in terms of length. Instead what we got was a fairly short, bland, and full of humor forced upon you.Game service:In the sequel, Pieces has opted to use Paradox's online service instead of Steamworks in the name of what I assume was netcode. While this wasn't a particularly BAD choice, Paradox's service is just a hassle, I had an extremely difficult time signing up for it at first and after much research and grinding teeth, I finally got it to work. I tried the game recently and I can't even log in anymore, for whatever reason. It just won't take. Weakness system:I'm not particularly fond of the weakness system in Magicka 2. In most cases, it really would only take a couple seconds longer to kill an enemy with normal magicks compared if you were using its weakness against it. Sure, while you could argue that sometimes a couple seconds could make all the difference, in this game the ""sometimes"" is really the case. Except it's more seldom.Mutators or ""artifacts"":This is another system I'm not particularly fond of. The mutators or ""artifacts"" didn't really have anything that spiced up the gameplay in an interesting way for me. It just felt boring or annoying.Magicka 2 was a game I overhyped the hell out of once I heard it was announced. It was a sequel I hoped and prayed for once I beat Magicka and finally my prayers were heard. I followed news religiously, watched their trailers (I love their musical trailer with Vlad even to this day. I'm listening to it right now), I screamed in absolute joy as the release date neared.Finally Magicka 2 was released. Like a giddy child on Christmas day, I launched Magicka 2; excited out of my mind as Steam installed the prerequisites. The game launches, intro videos play, then we get to the menus, asking me to sign up for a Paradox service. I was slightly confused as to why they would swap to their own service instead of using Steamworks like Magicka, as it was certainly convenient. Though I pretty much came to the conclusion it was because of netcode. Right off the bat I'm having to fight the account creation to create my account with repeated failures, cutting into the time I could be using to actually play the game when my brother seemingly got it to work without difficulty.After some research, teeth grinding, and anger, I finally got my account set up and ready to play. My brother and I join each other and the adventure begins finally! Without spoilers, we played the game for about two hours before we beat the campaign. Sure, there was stumbling at first as we attempted to get the hang of the new movement and casting system (which was a huge improvement over Magicka) but once we got the hang of it we breezed through the game.The campaign its self was fairly interesting, though once we got over our excitement we could see it was rather boring; the world felt extremely linear, ""puzzles"" were overly simple or lacked entirely, the humor was foisted upon you instead of discovering it like in Magicka and thus lost its charm. Creativity was not encouraged in the slightest because even enemies with weaknesses could be killed almost as easily without using their weakness so there was little point to the weakness system.It was heartbreaking to play a second time. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it, get more robes, mutators, or to even try the arenas. I was already done trying to find some redemptive property of the game to justify what the game lacked so much that the first one had. Part of me wants a Magicka 3 in hopes that they'll carry over the good they've done to the game and correct the wrong but part of me hopes that they never touch the idea of Magicka 3.While the game was a disappointment for me, that's not to say that others can't enjoy it. If you enjoy it, by all means please do! I looked at the reviews before I wrote this and it seems some opinions are changing with a recent spell rebalance but that doesn't fix a majority of issues I have with the game.(how do I end reviews?)I will link my favorite trailer when Magicka 2 was in development. While I was disappointed with the game, I am not at all disappointed in this kareoke singalong trailer with Vlad

												I wanted to love you magicka2 but you didn't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in' work with me here.Seriously this game is short as balls and lacks most of what made the first one special, All the weapons, robes and staves are just  different combinations of numbers and while you can cast all your magicks from combos not one is as fun as the old ones, there's no interaction between the elements, no unexpected suprises, no game breaking, no nothin'!Don't bother, just get drunk and play Magicka 1 with some friends.

												I don't get why people are hating on Magicka 2, just because it is not the same as its predecessor. I do not know much about Magicka, but still I was hyped for Magicka 2 and I must say it lived up to the hype. The game is funny and the story is brilliant. It connects the story of the first game and also a bit about wizard wars. I definitely reccomend it.			"

												If you tried playing Magicka but hated the experience because of the inane level design, and show-stopping bugs... well, this is the same game sans the bugs. It offers nothing new, if you don't count the hot bar for some frequently-used spells. The story is pretty much non-existent, as the balance of the campaign.Do not attempt to play Magicka 2 alone. The single-player playthrough is a torture thanks to frequent difficulty spikes which are insane enough to wipe out even a party of 2-3 players. And don't get me started on the final boss... After you're done with it, you'll want to find the person who designed this crappy fight which relies on the game's weird understanding of Newtonian physics.Pathetic attempts at humor, short, utterly forgettable campaign, weak replayability (unless you want to replay the same levels with different rules), no PvP modes for obvious reasons... Once again, Magicka squanders its potential.			"

												What a huge dissapointment. It looks terrible, worse than the original. It offers the same gameplay as the original, with the addition of a few extra magics. Even though I could only bear it for a few minutes. I don't understand why they didn't just make another story line expansion for the original.			"

												Played a lot of Magicka, the first. Loved every bit of it, even though none of my friends felt the same or would join me in it. That being said, of course my review is going to have a bias in that direction, after all they tried hard to advertise this game to appeal to the loyal fans.And they did a pretty good job, minus a few things.One of the things I was very surprised but pleased by was the fact that enemies felt like they finally had more comprehensive weaknesses to certain magicks, such as those crab ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s being weak to steam (which was not an element of its own when I last played the game), and so forth.The gameplay feels alright, but too easy at times and too stressful at others.My main complaint is at the length of the game, though. It seems Paradox is going the popular route following most major devs and focusing more on the MP side of things, which was not the way to go with this game. The campaign was good, I guess, but when I got to the final battle (before I knew it was the final one) I was so excited for the first actual boss fight that would be a challenge, fully expecting the game to pull the kind of 180 on me that the first one did about halfway through by having you  sent to the underworld. Alas, the moment never came, for when I struck down the obvious antagonist of the game, the credits rolled and I was left with a deep unsatisfaction, almost resentment, at the brievity of the experience. Paradox pulled a 180 on me, alright, but then pulled another 180 to form a 360, and I went exactly where I expected but hoped not to be.Overall I would rate it about a 6/10, which is around the positive feedback percentage given to the game by reviews anyhow.Also the arena mode felt a little more possible to play and the maps are great, but again, nobody to play with gives a very limited experience with the game.

												Blowing up your friends and enemies alike was never easier as it is in Magicka 2. Despite there are almost no changes to the Magicka and still using almost the same jokes all over again; it is still enjoyable.The only real difference I did spot was that you got a quick access bar for your spells like ""Fiery Death for your friends"" and ""Reassemble the ashes of incinerated friends"" aka resurrect.Additionally, here's a tip for anyone who is about to play this game:If you cross, for example, a Lifebeam with a Deathbeam it'll create an implosion at the intersection after a few seconds. This also works with beams combined with other elements as long as the elements are opposite to each other.			"

												Magicka 2 is a game about wizards, plain and simpleIt features many different enemies and situations. It has a easy-to-learn/hard-to-master spell casting format where you can mix and match elements as you please to create all sorts of different effects, from making a flaming rock barrier around yourself, to throwning an explosive boulder at a hundred miles an hour, and blessing a sword with frost that slows and hurts, or even a beam that will poison and heal you at the same time.I know it says I have like no time in the game at the moment, but i've played for hours on PS4, and I just wish I had a controllerMy only grevance with the game is the control style for PCIts left click to move and the middle mouse/right mouse button for spells and your sword, I would prefer that the mouse would point you in a direction and you could use WASD to move.Also obligitorymade death and fire spell with massive blast radius for the final hit of a bossaccidentally applied to selfdied11/10 would rage at myself, then repeat boss fight again			"

												It has mixed reviews for a reason. While the first game was good, this game is almost completely identical! I wouldn't pay anything for this, because the changes to the game are so minor, it ammounts to little more than a small handful of gameplay tweaks, and a new campaign. I would expect this much content to be a completely free update, and this honestly feels like I've just been swindled. In addition, the gameplay get MUCH more difficult very early into the game, likely because of the addition of spellcasting while moving. The developers seem to have overestimated how much of a difference this change makes to the gameplay, and coping with the increased diffifulty is very frustrating. The only thing I can consider an upside of this game is that it looks slightly more modern (still not comparable to almost any titles from 2015), and the multiplayer system is ever so slightly convoluted, although it does occasionally place you into mulitplayer without warning. In addition, I would steer clear of buying this if you have a mac, because several versions of OSX have a game breaking bug in which all key presses are recieved twice by the game, making it completely impossible to log into the game (a required step). Overall, the game feels extremely limited in terms of the value of the changes, to the point that playing this game feels similar to replaying the original. I would NOT recommend buying this game, unless you spent hundreds of hours on the original, and a new campaigne is worth this much money to you.			"

												Overview: Magicka requires practice and skill. You have 8 different elements you have to use, and thus 8 different keys, those being qwerasdf. You have to learn where they are and how to use them in combat. Which can be difficult, and those who can't incredibly well might find it challanging to get good at the game. If you can't type 50WPM+, don't get this. If you type 100+WPM, this is going to be freaking amazing for you.Pros: It's unique, and inspires creativity. You can also be creative.It's funny, if you like the kind of humor in it.Great game to play with friends. Unless your friends can't tell when to stop killing you.Cons: Those friends I just talked about? They don't know when to stop killin ya.It requires being able to use a keyboard properly.Campaign is a little on the short side.			"

												First problem, the main game is four and a half hours long for the whole campaign.Second problem, Magic is simplified to an absolutely monkey degree, spells have cooldown, some of the best combos have been removed entirerly (where are my safe mines?) The Combo magics seem REALLY limited and tame compared to the first game where you could call down an ungoddly hell storm for a full five minutes by spamming meteor, where as in two you can drop a dragon blast every few seconds regardless of how fast you combo your spells.Main issue? The game is simple, and seems a helluva lot less volitle than the first game. Features and spells have been stripped down to what feels like an alpha build of the first game rather than a sequel I could not be the only one expecting to go above, beyond, over, around and through the original in terms of helarity and reduculesness.Oh, and the jokes seem really REALLY forced in this one aswell. Try again paradox, only this time add to the first game, not take away from it. Try adding new elements to play with, you gave us a cut scene full of what lok and supposedly summon, give us some of those. Add more spells so that you have a legitimate book full to read, and for the love of god remove cooldowns.Easy? no. What we expected? Yes. I cant be the only one			"

												Alright. lets put the cards on the table here:I would not recommend this game. I mean it is okay, but If you wanna play this game for the Magicka feeling, stick with the first game.As everyone says the Character movements are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and the keybindings suck.. You cannot cast spells in mid air and at one point in the game I got stuck because the objective kinda blended a bit too much in with the background. (Might have been me being stupid but still felt like it could have given some hints)Those are ofc just technical issues, but here's my real problem with this game.This isn't the Magicka I remember. This is just a cheap knockoff of Wizard Wars, and personally I didn't get the Magicka feel from Wizard Wars. I mean Magicka was full of secrets, references, Easter eggs and stupid puns and‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•This game has barely any of those things, and those things were the stuff that made Magicka so special.I mean of course you have to have a story to follow, but in Magicka I felt the developers kinda just took the story so unseriously through out the game which was hilarious. They still stuck with the lore but it had this comedy feeling too it which for me made the game perfect.But for Magicka 2, what the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• happened?! This game is more serious than Call of Duty's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing singleplayer campaign missions. There is barely any joking around and most of the references/easter eggs in the game was hard to understand wasn't really funny. To be honest I have to say I kinda got a bit bored playing this game, because it did not feel like Magicka at all. I mean your god damn trailers were hilarious! Game of Thrones parody, the Vlad's interview and the Karaoke singalong is how Magicka is supposed to be, not like this. The lore is just too serious and heavy.To be honest with you guys, you should stick to making trailers for games and not the actual game itself.I will be honest and say that aside from horrible keybinding and the fact that you can't cast spells in mid air, the spellcasting is okay. The game itself is okay too, but it's far from what made Magicka so special.Sorry to say but this kinda disappointed me.			"

												Magicka 2... my biggest disappointment ever!Even ubisoft delivers more complete games than this garbage, ill point out some things which makes this so disappointing1. No control rebindings.. yeaaaah -.-' - i looked for it, and was utterly surprised to see that this basic feature which should be in ALL games, is non-existent in magicka 2^ FIX THIS, Are you trying to leave pc gaming? or what am i missing...2. Dont fix something that aint broke... DONT ADOPT THIS WIZARD WARS CONTROL SYSTEM - I get how the wizard wars can benefit some ways from having this control system.. balance etc. but please dont put that wonky feeling into your co-op game^ Give us back the old controls! If we had a ""controls"" menu we could probably change it to be like the first one we all remember(this is the more ranted part)3. Why the heck would you dumb down the spell casting system!  - The first magicka allowed a total of 10 spells into one cast, due to the blending mechanic. It felt powerful, and you could create some really interesting combos... im GOING TO SAY THIS AGAIN, it is NOT a freaking multiplayer only game which needs this dumbed down cast system. If i want to feel like the best damn spell casting wizard, i need some more options, it felt like you tried to make it possible for 5 year olds to understand spell casting. DONT ADOPT FEATURES FROM THAT WIZARD WARS GAMEi dont need anymore points to make myself clear... you get the pictureConclusion:Get the first magicka if you havn't played it yet, and wait for an insane sale on this game.This entire game smells like the attempt of reaching console platforms by smoothing=(removing) out some stuff that made the pc spell casters so superiorBiggest disappointment so far - 2015			"

												Just look at all those reviews crying about not being able to oneshot any enemy in the game with the good old steam-beam (in Magicka 1 you LITERALLY steamrolled the enemies, if you weren't using Lightning Bolt all the time which has a similar damage output but with more gibs).The game got harder. What's the problem? You need to learn which enemies are vulnerable to which elements? Oh, boo hoo, that's so difficult. For all those idiots who didn't get it until now: The point of the game IS dying. It even has achievements for it! MULTIPLE ONES! So if you really got through the entire campaign without dying once  you're either the best wizard Midgard has ever seen, or you don't exist, simple as that.So, now for the actual review:Magicka 2 plays in the same world as Magicka 1 and Wizard Wars, but after most of the wizards got killed in said wars. Your goal is to save a child which has inherited the power which got released during the Wizard Wars from an unknown danger. Magicka 1 players will probably already know what that danger is, huh. That's it. But you're not playing Magicka for the story.You're playing Magicka for the massive amount of spell combinations, for the exploding enemies, for the silly dialogs, for the references to games/movies/TV-series, for the fun you have while killing your friends just to revive them again. So, does Magicka 2 have that? Yes, it does. Is it better than in Magicka 1? Maybe not, but it's atleast just as good. And don't forget: This game just got released 2 days ago. The developers will most likely change something about it.So, to finish my review - do I recommend the game? Yes, I god-damn do. It might not be the best game ever created, but it still is a blast, just like Magicka 1.			"

												Learned about this game from accidently seeing it on a random YouTube channel that popped up while it was auto-changing. Downloaded it because it was cheap and told my friend to get it as well.We opened the game and didn't stop until we beat it on NORMAL difficulty and I absolutely can't wait to play through it again. Going back through my stats it seems that I've only unlocked a tiny fraction of what is possible to unlock in the game (weapons, robes, modifiers, etc.) and it got me even more excited. If you're looking for a great coop game you can play with a couple of friends, look no further.			"

												OH YEEEESHH!! I loved Magicka, can't wait for magicka 2!!!---> After 5 minutes of play, i noticed the stone charge up takes ages. Well okay, if it was OP, it should be changed, but then i noticed if i don't fully charge, the projectile flies practically nowhere. That got me bit upset.Then i noticed the elements which merged does not do that anymore. You can still produce steam by using water and fire, but they stay as 2 separate elements in your line. Okay, again OP things got nerfed, but same time they put away some less OP fun stuff.Soon i tried to do lightning beam. Oops, now lightning takes the priority over arcane (death), and instead i got an arcane lightning. That's crappyThen the quickslots came in. At that point i was stunned how ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• thing was added to the game. I have allways thought that being good at magicka requires you to memorize some magicks and use them fast, now you gotta just push a button. Fortunately though, the buttonpress does have a CD, but unfortunately the CD is also with just using elements to do the spell, fortunately shorter than the buttonpress tho. Then i noticed the push. That spell sucks‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• It has no range whatsoever, and hardly pushes anything away.Also the movement feels slippery, and for some reason the keybinds have been changed since the original. That would be fine, but you can't change the binds. That seems like an intentional game flaw to me.TLDR: Very little improvement to compensate lots of things done wrong			"

												Magicka (the first one) was recommended to me recently based on enjoying Castle Crashers. I enjoyed it immensely: the spell combination system is fun, the invented language is brilliant and funny, and overall it's a great game. The follow-up (this one) is somewhat of a disappointment. In summary, it seems like the developers made a sincere effort to address some of the weaknesses of the first game, the primary one being that once you figured out the most powerful spell combinations, it was a little too easy.Unfortunately, this effort seems to have focused mainly on the kind of frustrating pseudo-difficulty that basically consists of being overwhelmed by numbers and speed of enemies. For example, I frequently died almost immediately after being resurrected by my Familar; unlike the first game, there's no period of invulnerability after resurrection. I'm sure someone will have a way around this, but it's meant as a representative example, not the sum total of my complaints. The bottom line is that if you play this game, be prepared to spend a lot more time boiling with frustration after you die without a chance to react.Pros- Better graphics- More challenging- Artifacts allow custom difficulty- Changing Arcane to Death and adding the particular related effects was a good idea- Having the Magicks in their own control bar and automatically gained as you advance is, overall, better than the first gameCons- Shields over-nerfed. The problem is you spend an inordinate amount of time running around just trying to get position so you can fight back. Enemies are as fast as you and are often either unaffected by or can block Frost slowing effects. Some people might like this, but I just found it aggravating.- Controls changed; takes quite a bit of getting used to and I don't see the benefit. In particular, making the center mouse button involved in both self-cast and AoE cast causes an awful lot of inadvertent self-casting of harmful spells.- Doesn't seem like as much effort was put into the language in this one, which was a big part of my enjoyment of the first one.- Not enough levels in the Adventure; even with all the difficulties mentioned, I finished the game in 12 hours, and to be honest even the customizability doesn't make me want to play the same levels again.Overall, it's a decent game on its own, and I think it's going in the right direction in terms of addressing the issues mentioned. But the fun / challenge balance needs to be fine tuned and it needs to be longer.			"

												In my shameful sequal category on steam along with Dark Souls II. First one was hella fun and this one is more like a way to kill time with your friends (you wont after you play this). We usually spend at least 3-4 times longer in a zone than was intended and the main things you can hear are ""hey let me do a damage check"" or ""SERIOUSLY GUYS CAN WE MOVE ON"". Our playthroughs typically demonstrate Game of Thrones level politics and betrayal and usually end up with us all killing each other a lot. I often wonder if Magicka is a giant social experiment to see what happens when a human has elemental powers and the ability to revive his friends, in most cases the answer would probably be global ahiniliation and rebirth. I dont seem to hold the venom towards this game as others in the comments but I guess I also have‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•taste in games. I personally enjoy the game albeit not nearly as much as I did the first one, but I wouldnt say this game is a waste of time and/or money. Especially if you pick it up on sale. They do cater to people who spend money (I preorderd it and got some OP starting equip) and if you buy the DLC's you will be more overpowered than everyone else.			"

												if you like wizard wars and hate the smooth control scheme and effectiveness and fun of magicka 1, buy this. But if you arent a fan of unfaithful reboots of games using recycled engines from a less then savory spin-off, by all means avoid this game and go back to magicka 1.ill remove or change this review if the devs decide to care about the fans, but im assuming a major control and engine reboot *cough* water and fire in spellbar becomes steam and water and ice becomes an ice element*cough*; until that point ill probably play the story with the sad realization that what used to be my favorite game is now a bitter reminder of what could have been.It somehow tragically reminds me of Banjo Kazooie but with a shorter wait for the nuts and bolts to roll in, if not wait forever for duke nukem forever to have it fall on its face as what could have been...

												First thing's first, the game is REALLY SHORT.I played the first Magicka and it was great, Magicka 2 is great too however I wish they wouldn't change the spells as much as they did, some things are different and some are the same.I beat this game in 6 hours with a friend, to me it's WAY shorter than magicka one.The game is great I only recommend buying it if it's 5$ or less.EDIT: my gameplay time is 22 hours because I left it on for 16 hours by mistale last night.

												A more balanced Magicka. Honestly not getting the criticism for this game - the new controls allow for moving while casting, and makes it so that you don't have to focus on moving too much. The new spell balance feels a LOT nicer, and it's not just ""spam one combo to win"" like Magicka 1. And the fact that spells don't combine into single-slot new elements now seems mostly for balance than anything - which is nice.Plus, the new features just add to the experience. 1-2-3-4 Magick casting is great for having newer players get used to the game, while they never removed regular Magick casting (and casting them regularly has less cooldown, anyway!) -- so you can still reactively press W-A-SPACE and A-S-F-SPACE for your revive and haste spells, respectively - while assigning your 1-2-3-4 keys to Magicks you don't quite remember the combo for yet. (I never could remember the combo for Conflagration / Dragon Strike, for instance!)And likewise, the game is a lot more balanced now. The spellcasting is more focused on casting against the weakness of your enemy now instead of just overpowering them with a single spell combo. The difficulty also seems to be ramped up a bit now - enemies tend to swarm a LOT more. You'll want a friend to play with - although playing alone isn't impossible anymore, thanks to the new Familiar companions. Once you get revived (at the cost of your familiar), you can easily just revive your Familiar back again with a quick W-A-SPACE. Just make sure you're not in enemy fire first. ;D			"

												Ok first of all: I adore Magicka 1 and i had some hours of fun (not many though) with Wizard Wars but Magicka 2 is something i was afraid of. It's not all bad but as many details as they improved as many details ever so slightly they have ruined. I remember being surprised by the fact that the color of the Rock armor changed in magicka 1 based on it's strength...well this beatutiful little detail is no more...and the absolute doomray ""qfqfasa"" was as op as freezing the enemy and throwing a rock at them....they fixed the rock part. which i don't like but can accept. but i don't like that the possibility of connecting fire and water to create steam is dumbed down to both stays as fire and water but it creates steam. Not a big change but takes a slot more and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s up a lot of spells. I think they tried to balance magicka2 for the PvP part...which i WOULD be fine with if it wasn't for Magicka 2 to be mainly a PvE game and it was part of the fun of the game to be able to basically oneshot everything...The sheer stupidity of some mechanics was the best part of magicka 1Pro:+Story +moving while casting+stable multiplayer+some small details (lasering on an icd enemy reflects etc.)+humor/eastereggs+soundtrack (despite everything else  love the soundtrack :D)Con:-Casting system dumbed down-shortcuts take out a lot of chaos (which was basically the fun of the game) by basically putting the chances to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up spells to 0-too short-slick controls-interface (to console-ish for an originally PC game)(-buggy but i'm sure they will at least patch that :P)To conclude: If you have some friends to play it with and you have played Magicka 1....you CAN buy it you might be able to squeeze some fun out of it but if you haven't played Magicka 1 or don't have friends.....buy magicka 1. You'll have more fun with it......I hate to say that but i am VERY disappointed by this game and it is hard to disappoint me since i generally never expect something good.....			"

Instead now you have a ton of ""BUFF X NERF Z"" and nothing else. There is a quarter of the amount of spells in the game as the original.

												Learned about this game from accidently seeing it on a random YouTube channel that popped up while it was auto-changing. Downloaded it because it was cheap and told my friend to get it as well.We opened the game and didn't stop until we beat it on NORMAL difficulty and I absolutely can't wait to play through it again. Going back through my stats it seems that I've only unlocked a tiny fraction of what is possible to unlock in the game (weapons, robes, modifiers, etc.) and it got me even more excited. If you're looking for a great coop game you can play with a couple of friends, look no further.			"

												OH YEEEESHH!! I loved Magicka, can't wait for magicka 2!!!---> After 5 minutes of play, i noticed the stone charge up takes ages. Well okay, if it was OP, it should be changed, but then i noticed if i don't fully charge, the projectile flies practically nowhere. That got me bit upset.Then i noticed the elements which merged does not do that anymore. You can still produce steam by using water and fire, but they stay as 2 separate elements in your line. Okay, again OP things got nerfed, but same time they put away some less OP fun stuff.Soon i tried to do lightning beam. Oops, now lightning takes the priority over arcane (death), and instead i got an arcane lightning. That's crappyThen the quickslots came in. At that point i was stunned how ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• thing was added to the game. I have allways thought that being good at magicka requires you to memorize some magicks and use them fast, now you gotta just push a button. Fortunately though, the buttonpress does have a CD, but unfortunately the CD is also with just using elements to do the spell, fortunately shorter than the buttonpress tho. Then i noticed the push. That spell sucks‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• It has no range whatsoever, and hardly pushes anything away.Also the movement feels slippery, and for some reason the keybinds have been changed since the original. That would be fine, but you can't change the binds. That seems like an intentional game flaw to me.TLDR: Very little improvement to compensate lots of things done wrong			"

												It's a sequel, not another expansion. On top it's also by an entirely different development studio than the first, and by the third (fourth if you count the mobile game) studio to work on the series. Therefore it obviously plays differently in many ways past the basic concept, compared to any previous iteration in the series.However, one thing it has done the same so far as the first game, is the rocky start, seemingly completely void of any practical thought or testing put into some parts during development.For example, when you start the game for the first time, it starts in 1280x720, and puts you right into the prologue/tutorial chapter. Wouldn't be a big issue, if the options menu wasn't only available from the main menu of the game. Supposedly (can't confirm as I did the prologue as it was), exiting the game into main menu before completing the tutorial also locks you out of the main game, and requires editing config files or reinstalling the game, to have the game run for the ""first time"" again.On launch the game was also missing all forms of control settings. As of right now it's only added in the form of including keybindings in the config file to edit. The hastily written guide on how to edit it is missing a lot of details, and has some info plain wrong.Magicka 2 keeps in various balance changes and limitations made for the PvP spin-off Wizard Wars, which were sensible for a PvP-only game, but hardly so for a regular PvE game. Especially in a series where the draw came from the freedom of doing anything and everything exactly as fast and accurately as you could hit your keyboard keys. There's a post in the community discussions which explains a lot better than I can, how the game was simplified and rebalanced compared to 1The newly introduced cooldown system makes the selection of various staves you acquire during the game rather useless. In chapter 2 you find the Jester staff, which majorly reduces magick cooldowns. Additionally it increases the effectiveness of the shield element, used for both crucial survivability as shields and resistances, and damage, in the form of mines and elemental walls.The game is very much designed around multiplayer, and when playing solo, not only will it be brutal at parts, you will straight up miss on content, as there are some secrets that require multiple people to open. Fortunately the game does seem to point these out when found, so you don't waste your time trying for too long.In all, it takes getting used to, if coming from the first game, but it's not unplayable. However right now I'd still recommend waiting for the upcoming patches being put out based on community feedback. Then look again.			"

												If you tried playing Magicka but hated the experience because of the inane level design, and show-stopping bugs... well, this is the same game sans the bugs. It offers nothing new, if you don't count the hot bar for some frequently-used spells. The story is pretty much non-existent, as the balance of the campaign.Do not attempt to play Magicka 2 alone. The single-player playthrough is a torture thanks to frequent difficulty spikes which are insane enough to wipe out even a party of 2-3 players. And don't get me started on the final boss... After you're done with it, you'll want to find the person who designed this crappy fight which relies on the game's weird understanding of Newtonian physics.Pathetic attempts at humor, short, utterly forgettable campaign, weak replayability (unless you want to replay the same levels with different rules), no PvP modes for obvious reasons... Once again, Magicka squanders its potential.			"

												I will start right off the by saying this is not like the original Magicka. Some things have changed but there not as bad as most of these reviews make them out to be. I hate to see so much hate on this game just because its not like the original.     I consider it to be just as fun as the original, but this one is much harder they have increased the difficulty alot! There are alot more enemy types in this game compared to the first so using the right spell combo is a must. You cant just spam a spell thinking your going to win. There is more strategy involved this time.    So if your looking for the same Magicka this game is not it. This game is harder and more strategic than the original.Here are some of the changed mechanics-You can move while casing a spells-shields deteriorate over time-You cant setup magic elements when air born-Enemies have more abilities and are harder to deal with (Solo)-added quick spell bar so casting magic is easy (which i find breaks the main mechanic of the game and should have the option to be turned off!)-all Spells have cool downs which i find to be unfair in some cases, they need to be reajusted time wise.Its still the same Magicka i played for 70+Hrs,but it much harder. So if you enjoyed the original then i can recommend this sequel. You just might feel disappointed that paradox interactive messed with perfectly good mechanics and tailored them to better suit a gamepad. which i find to be a major flaw!			"

												As a great fan of the first Magicka, I have to say this game is totally different. It is based mostly on the Wizard Wars experience (a poor choice from the developers).The most disappointing aspect is that the movements look clumsy and slow. The charging time of the spells is sooooo long that you will end up not using certain strategies at all (I'm looking at you ice shards).The game is designed to be played in co-op, but it's surprising how frustrating can get playing solo.It's just like the developers are telling you ""What da f*** are you doing alone? Go get some friends or get lost"". As a positive note, a much needed rebalancing of some OP combinations has been made, even if some elements are just under powered now (Lightning, Fire, Steam).You don't feel that great inner satisfaction emblematic of the first game,  when you set off your elemental fury against your enemies....Some combinations look very unsatisfactory and you will end up using them very rarely.I'm simply devastating my keyboard casting spells that end up being ""meh"". I understand that you need to learn making complex strategies, but you would expect a full powered Fire elemental attack at point blank to deal much more damage than silly strings...I managed to make my way alone through the game until the final boss, but a beginner would definitely not achieve the same results.....   I'm not a fan of the Magick's instant-casting-button, but at least they made it rewarding for people who put effort into remembering the combinations, so is a friendly tool for beginners or an emergency button.In conclusion, the game is still enjoyable and funny (but SHORT), but you'd better wait until they make some changes or make sure you have some friends to play with, as this game is a total single-players  hater.

												What a huge dissapointment. It looks terrible, worse than the original. It offers the same gameplay as the original, with the addition of a few extra magics. Even though I could only bear it for a few minutes. I don't understand why they didn't just make another story line expansion for the original.			"

												The game is still fun it has its differences from Magicka 1. What got me the most was the keybindings were so different and the you can move while casting. They added an update so you can change your keybinds so thats not a problem anymore and now I am starting to master moving while casting so its pretty fun.One things I miss is you cant combine some spells like you use too but thats not to terrible i.e. fire and water turn to a single steam icon which is not the case anymore. However all the elements are still there. Overall I love this game and would recommend. Its not as easy as it use to be you have to stay on the move all the time :D			"

												This game was a gigantic letdown to the first game.Boring gameplay, way too easy bossfights, honestly I just wanted to get through the game as quickly as possible and finish it cus I was just annoyed with it.The fact that the playthrough was like 3 hours on a casual level shows how low effort was put into this, there was almost nothing that caught my eye with this game and it felt like a empty shell of the first game.The cooldown on casting major spells are the most annoying thing you will encounter playing through this game, waiting for casting spells and you can't really juke around because of it, makes it just that much more frustrating.I loved the first game, gameplay, the story, the lighthearted jokes, the enviroment and everything else it had to offer, secrets, spells etc. Playing the game solo was hard, but still hella fun and at the same time, rewarding for your persistence. Sure you had your way of cheesing certain bosses and could consider making it too easy, but that was also part of the charm. I assume the cooldown in this second game was put in so you couldn't cheese as much, but at the same time that is what made a good magicka player good, casting long spells required quick fingers and memory, I remember playing with friends and we all tried to quickly cast spells and alot of times people would ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up and blow everyone up, giving everyone a good laugh.But this game? Felt like it was a prototype of the first game. Would I recommend this? Absolutely not, buy the first one and don't bother with the second.			"

												tl;dr This isn't Magicka 1, but it doesn't stray too far from the formula. Fun, but very difficult solo, so best enjoyed with a friend or three. :) Also, I correct some misinformation below that is being spread in the negative reviews.The first Magicka is one of my all-time favorite games. The concept of pulling together elements in different combinations to create and unleash a wizard's fury upon his or her enemies is still brilliant, and retained for Magicka 2. Before going further, there are a couple bits of misinformation that are being propagated in some of the negative reviews for Magicka 2:1) The devs have implemented a hotbar system for the casting of the powerful 'magicks' with a single key press. However, this is ENTIRELY optional. The player still retains the ability to manually cast magicks by keying in the elements and hitting the space bar. In fact, the new implementation just gives different players the choice of how to use magicks--they can either use a single key press and suffer through the cooldown timer, or they can use the old manual method WHICH HAS NO COOLDOWN. I cast Haste all the time using the manual method and don't have to worry about the cooldown at all.2) Another common complaint in the comments is that the player now has to use a click to move system to control their wizard. Similar to #1 above, this is half-true. Yes, players can click to move their wizard (which allows for firing behind you while on the move), or they can use the classic method of moving their wizard which is click and drag, guiding the wizard along a path. Again, the choice is up to the player.The humor is a little hit and miss, and the devs may have overdone it a bit (I don't need a joke in every line of dialogue). Still funny, but maybe a bit much.So, is it fun? Yes...but maybe not solo. Solo, it has fun moments, but it is also way more difficult. I had to replay the first boss seven or eight times before I came up with a strategy for defeating it. On the other hand, the very fact that I had to think about a strategy and then execute it was exciting...but still probably more taxing than it needed to be. For best results, play with friends. :D "

Posted: May 28, 2015
												I got this game expecting it to be terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised.One of the things that worried me the most was that they were changing the magick system; I thought that because magicks are so critical to gameplay, having a cooldown or being limited in the number of magicks would change everything too much, but you actually have all magicks available at once, the hotbar is only there to aid in quickcasting certain things, this way you can cast resurrection while wet etc.  Secondly, the cooldown is actually very low, especially if you do the magick the old fashioned way.  The hotbar cooldowns are independent of the normal input cooldown, so you can use the two in tandem to let off magicks really quickly.  I understand how the cooldowns can be seen as a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• but keep in mind that you get very powerful magicks from the start, so if you could spam like you could in Magicka 1, the game would be too easy.Another thing that can be upsetting is the fact that steam and ice are not separate elements anymore, but this is honestly for the better, as the old steam-and-lightning-ray from the original Magicka made the game way too easy.  In Magicka 2 you actually have to be adaptive in how you play and use different spells to take down different enemies.As a result, the game is much harder than the first, but I think this is honestly a good thing.  They send more varied enemies at you so you have to selectively shield yourself from different elements and you absolutely have to make use of your ability to walk an cast at the same time in order to survive.The new system of robes and staves is also good because there aren't any overpowered robes like the cyber robe from the first game.I actually think that despite some of my favorite things being missing, this game is actually better than the first one.  The tagline ""Learn to Spell, Again"" is very accurate, as this game plays completely different from the first.  One of my only complaints with the game is the number of meme jokes they put in the game.  They retained their good comedy from the first one, but they added way too many pop-culture references in between.			"

However at the moment I am afraid it's not worth your money on PC. Slowdown, bugs, and especially lack of ingame options to rebind your keys totally kill the experience. The game doesn't even show up on my steam profile. Never have I seen such a major glitch that the game is invisible to Steam itself meaning no achievements or trading cards.As for the game itself. I recommend you get Magicka 1 instead. It's the better game even without DLC. Already played Magicka 1 to death, and just really desperate for more Magicka? Then you might want this. Just be aware it's a pain in the butt to play single player this time around since they have nerfed almost everything you have but kept enemies fast, numerous, and lethal.			"

												Unfortunately, Magicka 2 is not Magicka 1. It feels different in every way I can quantify. Essentially they changed every aspect of the game just enough that if you just finished the first game you can't pick this one up even get through the first hour with any sort of competence.This is the stuff that irked me the most. I'm listing it out here because I wish I had this list before I bought it.(1) Spell combining has been partially redesigned (2) Casting controls have been changed and you can't change them back (no remapping options) (3) The shield walls only last about 3 seconds, so you can't actually use them as, you know, walls (same goes for the regular shields... you can't manually regenerate them anymore). (4) Personal shields functionality is different as well(5) The special spells (Teleport, Revive, Haste, etc) all function on a cooldown system now, making the game a lot less fast paced (A whole lot less). You often find yourself just running back and forth from a swarm or boss while your teammate kills them instead of actually engaging with enemies. (6) Special spells redone - Teleport now only teleports you backward, not toward the mouse. Revive spawns you at full health, taking away the challenge and fast pace if fights... etc(6) The game is all set pieces now instead of freeroam. You go from section to section and fight ""encounters"" of enemies, and the game locks you to that location until you kill them off. (7) YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN ACCOUNT WITH THEM TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER - Just obnoxious... everyone alive knows this is just obnoxious...So, having just re-beaten the first game and jumped into this one, I wouldn't recommend buying it if you want a continuation of the first game. Everything about it is simplified, combat is slowed down, and the fighting mechanics are too dissimilar from the first game. It's like they tried to change the genre.The game BY ITSELF isn't a bad game... but as a sequel to M2, I would rather have just bought the DLC to M1 and kept playing that.			"

												Good game and an excellent followup to Magicka 1. People are just upset that their BS combos that could carry them throughout the entire game without any skill required don't work anymore. I find myself using much more spell variety in this one, even using mines, which I never used in the first game. The only downside I could find in the new system is the fact that shields are almost pointless on their own, but otherwise, I enjoy it.			"

												After only playing a few hours, I can tell this game can never replace the first Magicka. It's a very different beast, and not in a good way. Pieces attempted to put together a more challenging experience, however, the result is ultimately a more tedious and less exciting one. This is compounded by the recycling of the design of spells, spell types, and spellcasting from Wizard Wars. During the conversion, much of the character that these things previously possessed was lost. There is enjoyment to be had in Magicka 2, but so far, it's hardly what I was looking forward to.I cannot recommend Magicka 2 in this state and I will not write a fairer review, so long as the wizardry of Magicka 2 remains as is, at the time of this review. Looks like I won't be writing a ""fairer"" review. It's very clear to me that, since the game is in Paradox's hands, nothing that matters will be improved or revised. The elements will always be shallow. Simple spells will always be the best. Spell metrics will always be dull. Melee will always be clunky. Many spelltypes will always be half broken. Most importantly, wizards will always be a shadow of their former, Magicka 1 glory.			"

												Well, that was a complete disappointment. I love Magicka 1, played it for nearly 100 hours and earned over 90% of the achievements. Ever since it was announced I was really looking forward to a suitable successor to this great game so naturally I pre-ordered it. Bad idea.Some weeks ago when we were able to try out the first level I was shocked. The gameplay felt rough, the graphics worse than in the first game, the level design sloppy and the overall experience highly unsatisfying. I hoped it would get better with the full release of the game.How wrong I was. Basically the same game as in the sneak-peak only worse. Why should I make an ADDITIONAL account for playing online? NOWHERE does it state that was necessary. (although I can't even get as far as creating one as I am one of the many people to find it unable to get any connection to the paradox servers)One of the first games I pre-ordered and I doubt I'll do that again soon. I hope steam will grant a refund seeing as that's pretty much malicious deception.

Sure, I don't get why the devs felt obliged to support gamepads, but since they did, I understand why they had to alter the controls a little. People will get used to it sooner or later. Plus, a lot of bad reviews were posted after only a brief time spent in the game (same with my review), so a whole bunch of people don't know if Magicka 2 still has something up its sleeves.Bottomline:I find it very entertaining.

												Not nearly as funny as the original Magicka even in coop, no feeling of power just spamming, NOT Arrowhead --> wrapped in the decent engine of Wizard Wars.Another attempt to milk a brand by the publisher and I fell for it. I hope you don't!			"

												The difficulty in singleplayer is frustrating and way too random.Sometimes you respawn surrounded, the teleport spell sends you in the wrong direction, and you get slaughtered, nothing you can do about it.Often, you get thrown out of the world. This prevents you from hanging on to any interesting weapon for more than 1 minute.Some enemies have weaknesses, but there isn't time to observe them when you're constantly running trying to stay alive. After getting killed 20 times by the same enemy, you'll know their weakness, but by that time it's not really fun anymore.This is nowhere near as fun as Magicka 1 was. The spells that I liked the most were severely nerfed. I can't anymore use the spell combinations that allowed me to quickly freeze large groups of enemies from a distance, because the area of effects of spells was greatly reduced, and the time to charge ""stone"" projectile spells for long range has become way to long to be useable.And frozen enemies aren't vulnerable to arcane beams anymore... they reflect it instead.Some spells have been added, lots of spells have been removed. ( steam and ice can't be combined with lightning anymore )Last but not least, there are severe bugs. In a boss fight, I got completely paralized, floating in mid-air, unable to do anything, and the boss couldn't kill me either. Only option was to quit the game.			"

												As an aside I'm surprised this game has so many negative reviews. Honestly, Magicka 2 so far has been a great experience so far, though I am only up to the third chapter. This game continues on with the humor and chaos from the first game and even in single-player I haven't felt a death was unfair or unwarranted, even on the Hard difficulty. That said, I haven't played the hardest difficulty (Bananas) yet. That said, you will probably end up dying a lot if playing by yourself, as the enemies are tougher in this game.The only part about this game that I disliked is the fact that Steam and Ice are no longer their own elements, since the game is built on the same engine as Wizard Wars. However in my mind this is a small price to pay for a release that, so far, is no where near as riddled with bugs.While I have only unlocked a small number of them so far, the new artifacts system allows you to customise your gameplay experience. I foresee myself replaying Magicka 2 more than the first game because of this.TL;DR Magicka 2 is a great successor to an already great game. While it lacks a few things from the first game, the new additions more than make up for the losses.			"

												Boo freakin' hoo.  So a couple combinations are gone.  The first magicka is for players with god complexes, and this one is more leveled out.  The game isn't hard to solo once you figure out that the revive spell gives you a chance to resurrect multiple times.  You can keep fighting as long as you use revive before dying twice in a row.  The cooldowns on your spells are optional, and only trigger if you use the shortcut rather than entering the entire spell combination.  The only thing they need to get worked out is a button-mapping option and I will be happy.Fun game.			"

												Magicka 2 would have been a master piece if it weren't decided to slap in the ""Magicka Wizard Wars"" combat system which is centered around competitive..magick....casting...play????Magicka was fun with and sometimes even without friends because of it's unique spell casting system. It didn't use a skill slot system or press so and so button to do so and so spell. It was more of learn your spells and do some cool combinations you learn throughout ;))))Which is fun! It's something that let me have fun even if my friends weren't around to play the game. Having friends play with you just significantly made it a much more amazing experience as well as a unique and oddly fun team killing short-venture since for a lot of the time you don't get very far when doing that.It's fun to play games that think you're smart enough to know how to combine keys on your keyboard to generate spells and abilities rather than to just press one button and be done with it.Magicka Wizard Wars I guess gets a pass for making the system a press a button and your good system, but then it's more for the competitive scene... for whoever likes to.... competitive... moba magicka????I mean it makes sense to want to only want to focus on what the opponents are doing rather than what keys you have to press for a spell and since these are actual people and not somewhat mindless goblins.Although Magicka 2 is more or less in that center of mindless goblin fighting and teamkilling action. Except it wants to be Wizard Wars... it doesn't have to be, it really doesn't even have to be an expanded Magicka the original it literally can be just Magicka with more stuff and a different adventure, but it's not. It's Wizard Wars Singleplayer. That's not really Magicka in sense, it's just a typical top down game at that point... Where did the Magicka go? Oh we still got spells. It's just... we're using Wizard Wa- It's not good, Magicka was genius. Expanded on something good not moba gameplay for singleplayer.Magicka is amazing, especially for new people and especially for new people with friends who haven't played before. It's an incredible adventure please try it.Magicka Wizard Wars is a moba with a boring spell system. If you like mobas then yeah go ahead.Magicak 2 is Wizard Wars if they tried to make singleplayer. Is not good :((((			"

												This game is s*it.It's like nerfed version of magicka 1.Here are things that pis*es me off when I play magicka 2:-I must create an account at paradox,not big deal but for what?-I can only have one single fu*king nickname and can't change it.Annoying,in magicka 1 you can change your nickname as long as you want.-If enemy is frozen and you want to kill it with your death frozen laser because you casted on enemy before to frozen him you simple CAN'T!! Your death laser just rebound from frozen enemy!!!! Like WTF!? It should kill it,mechanics are changed.-You can't cast eletric death laser,frozen eletric death laser,fire death laser...YOU JUST CAN'T!!! IT KILLS FUN!! IN MAGICKA 1 YOU CAN CAST IT!!-You can't make steam element,which is sad but you can make it by water+fire but there is no steam element same as blizzard element THERE ARE NOT HERE!!!-You can't heal instantly like in magicka 1,you just wait with healing element on you to heal and you can't cast any other spells.-You can't load shields!!!!! YOU CAN'T LOAD SHIELDS!!! YOU CAN'T LOAD SHIELDS!!! IN MAGICKA 1 YOU CAN LOAD IT!!! ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING RIDICOLOUS SH*T!!!!-Bar of a spells,for what?I ask for what?If you want make it go ahead and make it in magicka 1,now we play sequel so it's step back for novice players.-Cooldown for situational spells,for ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing what? TO KILL FUN!?-Casting spells are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• crap,you can't cast it like in magicka 1.If you want to cast it instantly by pressing sword cast you can't instantly you need to click twice,for no reason.One for cast on sword and second to release from sword,like WTF?-Loading of a stone spell are much longer+if enemy hit you you are interrupted casting stone,stone is no longer such powerful like in magicka 1.It was funny spell to smash tons of enemies,now it's piece of crap.-You can't go to arena and smash some enemies just for fun,because enemies are fu*king amazing and can kill you easy.-Bombers are the biggest bi*ches in this game,they just throw a single bomb and you are fu*ked because you fly around,and throwing back it's really hard,you need to cast spell pushing it back but in magicka 1 you have something like just simple push by pressing right mouse button and you died by bomb in magicka 1 by yours fault not op'enes of bombs.-Range of explosion from death laser are pretty insane+it's deal tons of damage if you detonate it near you.It's just nearly kills you and you need to heal and healing it's fu*ked from above as you can read.-You can heal when you have stone armor with is nice,but you can by damaged if you have armor.SRSLY!? ENEMY CAN HIT ME THROUGH THE ARMOR?!?! IN MAGICKA 1 I CAN HAVE ARMOR AND NO ONE CAN DEAL ME A SINGLE DAMAGE BUT I STILL DIE BY STUPID REASONS WITH WAS FUN!!!-You need to unlock every single pattern for every robe,with is stupid.Only achievement kids will like it.In magicka 1 you had every pattern of color to every robe unlocked on start.-You can't see what's your weapon do like it's increase range,more powerful spells of ice or death.You can't see it what's your staff do,same as sword.In magicka 1 yes you can do this,in magicka 2 you can't.-The last nail to the coffin was a thing that if you want to play multi-player you can do it but only on ADVENTURE MODE!! YOU MUST HAVE FRIENDS WHO HAVE MAGICKA 2 TO PLAY WITH YOU AGAINST HORDES ON ARENA,YOU CAN'T SIMPLE JOIN RANDOM PEOPLE ON ARENA BUT YOU CAN DO IT ON ADVENTURE MODE,LIKE WTF IS THIS‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•?!?-THERE IS NO LIST OF SERVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TL;DRThis game is just crap and nerfed version of magicka 1.It not gives even single hapiness.I bought pre-order hoping it will be fun not a piece of crap.Not worth price at all.I just hate this game,I loved magicka 1 even it have 10,000 dlc's,but I bought every single one and I'm happy with magicka 1.Go ahead and play magicka 1 and not waste money on this sh*tty sequel.Rate 2/10 kappa.

												If you liked Magicka, you'll probably like Magicka 2. It's really more of the same stuff at its core, and all of the changes are for the better (rest in rip, QFQFASA) and for the balancing of the game. The only big issue is the lacking ability to change keybinding, but the basic controls aren't egregious enough for this to be too big of an issue.			"

												If you don't intend to play this through purely in multiplayer using a gamepad, steer clear of it completely. Being a huge fan of the original Magicka with over 90 hours logged I had a certain expectation of quality. I have almost completed the game though I can tell that the changes made to the combat really ruined what made the original such a unique title. The new casting system is reliant on a gamepad and has cut out a huge amount of spell combinations. Magicka 2's casting system just seems really plain compared to the original, from what I gather they wanted to balance out the casting system by removing overpowered spells to make it more focused around identifying the weaknesses of particular enemies, though now the combat feels incredibly slow paced and boring. As of writing this I'm 2/3 through the game, the story mode is significantly shorter. Thankfully the writing still maintains the quality it had in Magicka and the graphics have been updated, but the pacing of the game is just disappointing overall, the world detail has declined too, there are a lot less hidden areas. I hope that the DLCs improve the game though I seriously doubt they will change its core mechanics which they have really gutted.			"

												dAHnt ewe juant 2 bai teh gahm? .... wait.. sorry... I had to learn to spell again...Anyway, Magicka 2 is pretty much a continuation to macika1. Graphics are upped a notch, the interface is streamlined a bit, and it generally has the goodness that made me like the previous game. Further, they made it so single-player is a bit more sane with the addition of a fairy that revives you once if you die, when beforehand single-player made it obvious it was meant for multiplay. That said, there are few other series that make you feel like you're an all-powerful wizard than the Magicka series, and is a must top-down action game with it's own unique feel. If you haven't played the magicka series before, they button layout will be a far cry from what you're used to, but once you get used to it, you'll find it's that way for a reason, and it's great.If you HAVE played the magicka series before, 2 has a slightly different button control system than the previous (similar, but the differences will throw you). Definately go through the beginner levels and read the instructions to help you re-adapt. Yes, they're different, but they're better.			"

												Magicka 2 is a great add on to the Magicka series. It annoys me that so many people are‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•off cause a few things are different from the first one.It felt just like the first one. A few seconds in I was laughing my‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•off as my friend and I cast tons of new and silly spells, finding out tons of ways to combine spells in combat. Or ways we could just kill each otherThe added tons of great things. Like the new hotbar for easy spell casting, buffing up swords so you can actually use them in fights, and tons of cool secrets/puzzles. Plus there is the challenge mode with added new settings for it. The only thing for me, cause I love to get the most out of my buy, is the story is only 6-7 hours long. A good price for 15$, but it did feel a bit fast. Seriously though, please try out this game if you are thinking about getting it, it is worth every cent. The only bad thing about this is all the salty people who can't learn how to have fun and adapt  to a new play style.			"

												If this is your first entrance into the franchise then I doubt you will be as disapointed as myself and many other fans of the series are of this addition. It is not a bad game by any means, but it is certainly not a sequel which does justice to the original. It has taken everything great about the original and just made it a little bit worse in almost all areas, which as a whole makes the game just seem like a bland cash in.So youre probably asking what made the original so special? Magicka was a combination of a very innovative spellcasting system mixed with a very funny referential adventure spanning a mystical world. The combat can be broken into two systems; Spells and Magicks. Spells are what you get by combining up to 5 of 8 different elements; for example Fire and Water makes steam, while Fire Water and Arcane makes a beam imbued with steam. Earth and Fire creates a flaming rock projectile that explodes in a raging inferno. Perhaps you need a patch up? Drop an Earth and Life boulder on your head to heal yourself. Magicks are what we would traditionally think of as spells, they are things you unlock in the game to cast incredibly powerful spells with unique effects. Arcane Lightning and Fire will allow you to run incredibly quickly. Cold and Shield allows you to slow down time to a crawl, giving you the ability to weave around incoming projectiles. The fun comes from how many combinations of Magicks and Spells there are. The original had over 20 unique magicks, ranging from creating a wall of fire to summoning death himself to kill your enemies. Spells could technically hold up to 10 elements when you factored in Fire and Water combining to fill a single slot out of your 5. This allowed for amazing spell combinations such as the fabled Steam-Steam-Arcane-Lightning-Lightning spell. It was incredibly powerful because you could shoot someone with steam thereby wetting them and making them more vulnerable to lightning all in one spell. Normally you would need to cast water, and then cast a lightning spell afterwards. It was overpowered in the base game, but DLC addons created enemies which were literally immune to this spell and created the need for ever adjusting to the resistances of new enemies. Magicka 2 removed all of the fun from both of these systems. There are something like 10 magicks in the entire game, only one of which is very exciting; a spelled called dragons breath which you get in the second level and is so strong you will use it for the entire game. The rest of the spells are bland; a stone that heals in an aoe, a speed spell from original, the ability to summon a few enemies, and a few others which i never used besides the first time i tried them because they were so uninteresting. The original game gave you ability to go invisible and then charm enemies to fight for you. This game also removed the ability for elements to combine, an attempt to remove some of the clunkyness from the original. So yes, you no longer get the overpowered beams of before, but they were only overpowered because of poor balancing in the base game. The DLC's proved that proper balancing made overpower spells impossible.Somebody else below stated it perfectly, Magicka 1 would have made a fantastic sequel to this game, but instead we are left with something which feels like a large step backwards in the franchise. I could go on for ages about how much worse this game is than the original, but if you haven't played Magicka 1 then none of these points will matter. Just play the first game, it is a cheaper and better experience. Then if you want more Magicka play the DLC as they are all fantastic experiences. Only after that should you play this game, and even then I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless it is on sale for $5-$10. "

												After completing the game, I can say that I am fully satisfied with my purchase. It made me rage, it made me laugh, it made me feel powerful. I would and will play this game again. This game, in it's current state, may or may not be stepback from Magicka 1. It really all depends on your ability to learn how to play it. They say ""Learn to Spell Again"" but it's more like ""Learn to Play Again"".TL;DR: This game is like a child with an I.Q. of 400 but doesn't want to fully exploit it (maybe half of it). It's a lot of wasted potential, but there is still time to recover. Hopefully, Paradox will see that this newborn child (which at the time of this review only has 10 to 48 hours) has some problems and needs a helping hand. If you can get past the differences between this game and what you wish was in the game, you'll actually enjoy it. I know I did.Cons :   I don't like the movement mechanic, but I do like that you can heal yourself while keeping a steady walking pace. The camera is locked during most battle sections and it's not even funny. I really don't like the Quick-magick bar thing at the bottom left, but that might be just me. Only one save game, you can't have multiple characters. You cannot access the options menu while in-game, only at the main menu.Pros :  The story seems promising. You can finally cast while moving and keep moving. You are still slowed down by the number of elements you are currently ""holding"". The loading tips don't automatically close. This could be very good for some new players or anyone who forgets how to do something. You just have to be lucky and have that loading tip instead of another one. It's fun. And it's even more fun with friends. You can play the entire story with four friends. The developers went for something different and you aren't as overpowered as last time, which makes for a new experience, like if the magic of the land had weakened. The artifact system is great for replayability and allows for customization of your playthrough. It has a nice humour. Character customization outside of the game: your account has an ""inventory"". BEAM GWAFIXZ""This game keeps on getting better as you get better and as you progress through it. You'll learn how to use the movements properly and you'll find new combos that work in multiple situations.""You want to know why I think that? Read further, but please be aware thatSPOILERS MAY FOLLOW. IF YOU HAVE ANY INTENT ON BUYING THE GAME (which you shouldn't have just yet), PLEASE DO NOT READ REVIEW.I start the game, listen to Vlad and his ... overly exagerated accent (worst than in Magicka 1). I go through the ruins and enjoy the tutorial, walk through what used to be outside the castle and past the dummy. I'm quite happy now and I like the new graphics. The spells look good and they make you feel powerful with the new effects. I feel like my 27,99$ CAN for the Deluxe Edition were well spent.I'm at my first battle. I try my forever favorite combo (the 'Thunder Bolt' combo from Magicka 1): QFASA. I know there is a new spell system with the Quickbar thingny, but I know I haven't learned the 'Thunder Bolt' spell yet. I thus try to cast it as a beam, but to my great dismay, I find that it doesn't work as intended. The concept of opposites already existed in Magicka 1 (Earth + Lightning = NULL), but now it's even stronger. Yes, Water + Fire = Steam, but Water + Lightning = NULL as well. In my mind, I see all the combos that fly away.Skip ahead a couple of encounters with goblins and crabs, the two major enemies at this point. I liked Magicka 1 for the feeling of being overpowered it gave you. You knew you could do some massive damage, but being overwhelmed was a big problem. That's where you used the shield and the AoE spells. Now, the shield cannot be recharged. That basically removes the possibility to take in the amount of enemies and make a strategy. Your shield will run out before you can even realize your protected.Skip ahead a couple of battles again. You fight a ""miniboss"" of some kind. Even disappointed as I was, I was hyped for the battle, knowing it would be a challenge. I've had relatively no problems up to this point with the enemies, but I know it's early game, which is why it was easy. The boss is big in size and has an army of minions, ready to attack you. I try to escape their attacks to plan my moves since my AoEs doesn't do as much damage as I'd like. The camera is locked and I cannot avoid them for quite long. The map is covered in water and I'm slowed down. I die. I respawn within the circle that the minions had formed around my dead body. I die again.Fantastic! I've beaten this thing and it was kinda fun, except when I died for no reason. But wait... I haven't died for no reason, the game just glitched and I don't see the particle effects! I know that you can see if your on fire, wet or dead at the bottom left of your screen, but I don't look at that. I know the combos and elements by heart so I don't have to look back down. I see neither my attacks or current status on my character... disappointing, but it won't stop me from playing the game. I might just restart the game, but I'm lazy and I can just look at the bottom left, really.Whats this? Dialog?! And another big dude?!! Is this... Yes! A real boss battle! This guy is strong. I didn't know what to do at first so I just ran around in circles, but the guy has all sorts of tricks. And it's not just one dude, there's another! I die. Alright, I know what to do now, let's go! I'm half-way there, but I die again! I'll spare you the details of the fight, to avoid both boredom and spoilers, but I win. I have absolutely no complaints about this battle, other than the ones that affect the whole game (like the spell-casting system). It is well executed, balanced and the dialog before the battle has a nice touch of humour.After the first boss comes a puzzle. It isn't too hard to solve, but you have to fight at the same time, which is actually pretty fun. You have to time your attacks, take some chances if you want to finish it faster. The enemies aren't hard to kill a single bit, but so are you. If you ignore them, you'll simply die. They keep respawning until you complete the puzzle. This would've been a horrible decision by the level designers had the enemy not been a huge threat. It is just enough so that you can't simply plow through the puzzle.The next room p*ssed me off. It is uselessly dangerous and you will die at least once. If not, kudos to you! You will face another ""miniboss"" and a couple of monsters. Basically, your biggest weakness: a ton of monsters that aren't vulnerable to every element. I like what they went for, but I think the number of enemies you have to face at the same time while in this room is a bit over-the-top and could've been lowered.The room keeps doing and there are more enemies. Another ""miniboss"" and more enemies. You get used to it, but it just makes it more fun since you die less. There are more bits and pieces of dialog here and there and they all have some sort of humour in them. I'm pretty sure I heard ""bootyflap"" somewhere in the fake language they use.This is the end of my review. If the need be, I will expand it as I am way past this point now. This game keeps on getting better as you get better and as you progress through it. You'll learn how to use the movements properly and you'll find new combos that work in multiple situations.EDIT : Updating this review because I want the steam badge. kthxbye			"

												If this is your first entrance into the franchise then I doubt you will be as disapointed as myself and many other fans of the series are of this addition. It is not a bad game by any means, but it is certainly not a sequel which does justice to the original. It has taken everything great about the original and just made it a little bit worse in almost all areas, which as a whole makes the game just seem like a bland cash in.So youre probably asking what made the original so special? Magicka was a combination of a very innovative spellcasting system mixed with a very funny referential adventure spanning a mystical world. The combat can be broken into two systems; Spells and Magicks. Spells are what you get by combining up to 5 of 8 different elements; for example Fire and Water makes steam, while Fire Water and Arcane makes a beam imbued with steam. Earth and Fire creates a flaming rock projectile that explodes in a raging inferno. Perhaps you need a patch up? Drop an Earth and Life boulder on your head to heal yourself. Magicks are what we would traditionally think of as spells, they are things you unlock in the game to cast incredibly powerful spells with unique effects. Arcane Lightning and Fire will allow you to run incredibly quickly. Cold and Shield allows you to slow down time to a crawl, giving you the ability to weave around incoming projectiles. The fun comes from how many combinations of Magicks and Spells there are. The original had over 20 unique magicks, ranging from creating a wall of fire to summoning death himself to kill your enemies. Spells could technically hold up to 10 elements when you factored in Fire and Water combining to fill a single slot out of your 5. This allowed for amazing spell combinations such as the fabled Steam-Steam-Arcane-Lightning-Lightning spell. It was incredibly powerful because you could shoot someone with steam thereby wetting them and making them more vulnerable to lightning all in one spell. Normally you would need to cast water, and then cast a lightning spell afterwards. It was overpowered in the base game, but DLC addons created enemies which were literally immune to this spell and created the need for ever adjusting to the resistances of new enemies. Magicka 2 removed all of the fun from both of these systems. There are something like 10 magicks in the entire game, only one of which is very exciting; a spelled called dragons breath which you get in the second level and is so strong you will use it for the entire game. The rest of the spells are bland; a stone that heals in an aoe, a speed spell from original, the ability to summon a few enemies, and a few others which i never used besides the first time i tried them because they were so uninteresting. The original game gave you ability to go invisible and then charm enemies to fight for you. This game also removed the ability for elements to combine, an attempt to remove some of the clunkyness from the original. So yes, you no longer get the overpowered beams of before, but they were only overpowered because of poor balancing in the base game. The DLC's proved that proper balancing made overpower spells impossible.Somebody else below stated it perfectly, Magicka 1 would have made a fantastic sequel to this game, but instead we are left with something which feels like a large step backwards in the franchise. I could go on for ages about how much worse this game is than the original, but if you haven't played Magicka 1 then none of these points will matter. Just play the first game, it is a cheaper and better experience. Then if you want more Magicka play the DLC as they are all fantastic experiences. Only after that should you play this game, and even then I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless it is on sale for $5-$10. "

												Magicka 2 is a great add on to the Magicka series. It annoys me that so many people are‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•off cause a few things are different from the first one.It felt just like the first one. A few seconds in I was laughing my‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•off as my friend and I cast tons of new and silly spells, finding out tons of ways to combine spells in combat. Or ways we could just kill each otherThe added tons of great things. Like the new hotbar for easy spell casting, buffing up swords so you can actually use them in fights, and tons of cool secrets/puzzles. Plus there is the challenge mode with added new settings for it. The only thing for me, cause I love to get the most out of my buy, is the story is only 6-7 hours long. A good price for 15$, but it did feel a bit fast. Seriously though, please try out this game if you are thinking about getting it, it is worth every cent. The only bad thing about this is all the salty people who can't learn how to have fun and adapt  to a new play style.			"

												Initially people were dissapointed about the changes they made from the first game. The negative reviews from back then is why I think the game still has ""mixed"" reviews. But since Paradox is awesome they undid the changes and have been improving the game! They even added a new element!It's a bit more balanced and refined than the first game and therefore provides more of a challenge.			"

												Magicka 2 gives me very mixed feelings. I love the new maps, new monsters and what not. But what really gets to me is how hard it has gotten to play. By that i mean, there are so many less spells i can cast. They're all the same just with different elements, unlike in magicka one where there were very flexible spells. I also am confused as to why when I cast water and Ice they don't merge, or when i put fire and water. It takes up more space and i can't cast as effectively(or powerfully)			"

												Magicka 2 is what you get when you try to create a game that was based on MOBAWhen magicka came out sure it was buggy but it offered unique slaughter house of friends and enemies with ridiculous amount of damage.After a while we seen Magicka Wizard Wars that for sake of balancing didnt have it . While understandable from MOBA point of view to reduce the damage you do , i doesnt make sense in hereIn Magicka you could through understanding of Elements rules Create really Powerfull spells Like Arcane electric Pillars of Ice or very Powerfull steam lasers and because battles were quite chaotic Powerfull shields to protect you (mostly from yourself and your Friends)Here you will find none of that , elements are the nerfed versions of themselfs from Wizard Wars while enemies still swarm you like they did in Magicka (but now you have no real way of quickly dispaching them) Weapons and Staffs feels the same and are just bonuses to your elements like they were in Wizard WarsThe worst offender are probably the ""Game changing Artefacts"" while most are just some game rebalances that i couldnt care less for. There is also an issue of using them , when i first obtained with my friend few of them we obviously wanted to try them out , but when we set them an window popped out that said that while we use them we cannot unlock anything (because the game now runs on custom rules)Well if i need to say something good about it , Humour is still nice and graphics are better , but for me its not enough to redeem this rather mediocore game.I just hope for list of patches that will try to make this game fun again until then better avoid Magicka 2.

A sad story of a ragequitting gamer...I have gone through several emotional stages by spending my time with that horrendous creation. First, I got really angry about simplified mechanics, devious controls and so on and so on... You can read everything about it here, in the negative comment section. But that was only the top of the iceberg. Then, I got used to it and found this game playable and even somehow enjoyable. Indeed, it has its own charm, nice story and good part of humor. So I continued playing it... until...Until I met the last boss. That's where everything started. I should admit that I am not a pro gamer but a game on normal difficulty should be playable for such gaming handicapped people as me. At least after several tries. Am I right? Not to spoiler but the problem was not in me dying every time but me stuck in an infinite loop of failing same algorithm to beat that boss. I failed mostly because the game is simply unforgiving for players in a singleplayer mode. Are you standing in a wrong place? Start everything all over again, honey. Timed badly and casted spell a bit late? Well, that's you problem, sweetheart, repeat everything. And like that over and over and over again for whole damn hour. Maybe two. Of course I ragequit. After my anger-pressure-o-meter showed stable values I decided to try my luck in a multiplayer. Good god, a team of four wizzards won after 30 minutes of mad button smashing. You may think that the story ends here? Guess what, you are wrong. To unlock nearly half of stuff in this game you have to pass it at higher difficulties and complete challenges. So relentless me decided to try out one of the challenges. First one, I forgot to mention for those of you who completed it and now laughing your bums off while reading this review which precipitously becomes a tragic story. It was hard. It is still hard because I didn't manage to pass it. For several hours I was trying different tactics to get to final stage 20 through colossal waves of enemies of every type. And I was not prepared to see what I did saw. Karog from Hel. An enormously big devil-like-A-hole with gigantic reaching everywhere hammer which resists fire and death damage and, furthermore,  quickly heals. Three of them, to be exact. And some firethrowing dudes from hell, just to be sure that I leave this ragging comment here. Well, I resisted them with fire shield for quite a time but I made a terrible unforgiving mistake and fire damage shield did not save me from several tons of hammer steel landing right on my head. I hoped that I could still win it by resurrecting myself and getting back into battle. But the game had opposite opinion. 'Let's spawn him right in that fiery crowd with flamethrowers and massive hammers, because losing is FUN¬©' that's what it thought. And me, fully unprepared, got literally burned to a crisp, smashed down and god now what else in a split second with even not a chance of casting resurrection spell. And I sat there. And I gazed at the screen with my empty eyes. And the letters on the screen carved deeply into my heart: ""Repeat? Round 1 of 20"".TL:DR For those of you, folks, who doesn't like reading: Save your nerves. Go and buy Dark Souls.			"

												I rather enjoyed the first Magicka game and when I heard that a Magicka 2 was in the works, I was pretty excited! Upon release, I was both satisfied and disappointed by the game:Pros:+ Many more Easter eggs+ Updated visual effects*+ Artifact system allows for customizable gameplay+ Can still kill fellow wizards+ Balanced around multi-player - no longer ridiculously easy with more than one player* while the particles effects on the spells are updated, there are only minute differences in character modelsCons:- Focus system takes away some of the gimmick in knowing and applying spell combinations to cast Magicks- Unbelievably short story-mode- Inability to merge elements (e.g. fire and water into steam) into a single element- Balanced around multi-player - difficult to play alone- Player control feels clunky- Conjuring spells are not very responsive, although it is more responsive than it was in the first MagickaOverall, while I enjoyed the game, I wouldn't recommend this game over its elder brother. While future DLC may help this skeleton of a game, I had hoped that the game itself would have had a little more flesh to it.			"

												From what I can see this game has taken a wrong turn. 'Magicka 2' seems to be more like 'Magicka: Wizard War', and less like 'Magicka'. Magicka 2 has gone really far away from their roots with 'Magicka' almost seems like they're going in the opposite direction. I really enjoyed the first game because of how difficult the game was with having to know your strong spells by heart. That was the most challenging part about that game and what gave it a unique feel. But now in this new game you can hot key the spells, or you can manually cast them. But there is no variety any more, just a little handful of spells. 'Magicka 2' took me ~6 hours to complete and 148 death. The first time through it was fun, but a left a stale taste. Bottom line is i'm not happy how the game turned out. Its more like Magicka: Wizard Wars and less like Magicka. I would not recommend Magicka 2 if you enjoyed the first game. If you just played Magicka: Wizard Wars, you might enjoy Magicka 2. (Its a more simple minded Magicka)			"

												I had initial doubts, since I played the Magicka 2 Prerelease. A lot about the spell system has changed - which I viewed as a bad thing (since it wasn't the same as Magicka 1). However, if you learn to overlook that it's a different game, it gets quite fun. It's a tonne more challenging than Magicka 1, and this game left me needing breaks from the levels, even when I had 3 other people with me. But, I like the challenge.It also encourages you to use more creative spells than Magicka 1, such as more earth spells (which was largely overlooked in the previous game). I found myself using a 4x fire ward (in order to gain health from fire) and then rapidly doing fire+earth and casting it on myself. This way I just made flaming rocks fall near me to kill my enemies.I very much recommend this game. It is definitely worth 15 dollars. It's also way less buggy than Magicka 1, and feels more refined. Though... I still like Magicka 1 more.Thumbs up from me!EDIT:I recommend this a lot more now that a lot of Magicka 1's features were added in. And at $6? This is a steal. Very highly recommend.			"

												As someone who's played dozens of hours of the first Magicka game without really delving into Wizard Wars before playing this, I actually recommend Magicka 2 overall.Spiritually, I find it to be much the same as the original magicka, even if at times the puns and things seemed to be laid a little thick. But then I realize that some players might not be as thorough as I trying to find all the fun stuff that magicka throws in there for us. I LOVED the feeling of going through the world and going ""OH! This is where this happened in the first game!"" It really made the game world feel like a static, solid thing and not just a backdrop for all the magical foolery this game is known for. Some of the secrets I've found in this game were really clever and some of them, honestly, I never would have found if it weren't for a misfired spell or six. I also loved some of the puzzles, and really hope they make some kinda puzzle map or something later down the road.But when it actually comes to the gameplay, as someone who wasn't familiar at all with Wizard Wars there was definitely a learning curve involved trying to ""learn to spell again"". The changes to steam and ice most notably screwed me up until I found spells and a playstyle that suited me. Pairing steam/ice with lightning is no longer a thing, but I think that in light of the other changes in the game it's actually a good thing to not have ""one-hit wonder"" type spells that are entirely self-sufficient. It's no longer a case of one-shot or get one-shot type combat, in most circumstances you'll have reaction time to save yourself and adapt to your circumstances. A few of the controls changed, which made it hard for me to rely on my muscle memory from Magicka, but it wasn't anything a bit of practice couldn't fix. Selfies were involved. But I hear they're going to allow remappable keys in the near future which is great, even if it's not a big deal for me personally.Defensive magic and movement recieved a huge overhaul in Magicka 2 from Magicka and, imo, the sooner you master how to cast while moving the better off you'll be, as spells no longer encumber you NEAR as much as they used to, it's barely noticeable in normal play. But with the changes to solid-based defense spells (ice/stone walls and armors) you'll find that these spells more situational by comparison than in the first Magicka, given that they now have a duration based on magnitude and no longer protect you as completely as they used to. For non-solid based defense spells (fire, lightning, cold, etc.) they made them into scaling resistance based on magnitude that scales from resistance to immunity to full on absorption. These wards, as they're called in game, are an excellent reason why I think the changes to steam/ice are a good thing, because in a co-op setting it makes people choose from fewer elements (less slots, opposites) which makes it easier to defend against or even benefit from friendly fire, arguably one of the most frustrating aspects in the old game because the spells were so powerful you usually got instantly killed from multi-element assault.Further, when it comes to personalization and choice within the game, I think the changes to the robe/weapon choices were monumental. When I played co-op I HATED finally finding the tesla staff in the campaign, dying and being almost guaranteed to lose it forever because combat would blow everything everywhere/cliffs involved. But now, you find something in the world and you unlock it permanently to be used whenever you want in something of a loadout system that can be accessed from the main menu of the game, so that if you die you spawn with it in hand, ready to rock. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing awesome. But more over is that these choices of wardrobe actually have a huge impact on your playstyle, much more so than before, imo. They grant great power, but limit your ability to perform with other elements, which I think is a thoughtful twist that I personally like. It makes me problem solve on the fly and see how far I can take one or two main elements.The only thing that's gotten me any kind of irritation is the somewhat buggy co-op. It's not often, but there are times when I get randomly dropped from a game with my friend sitting a room over from me while we're in menu setting up a game. I'm not sure what the root cause is, but it's not happened when we're actually in-game, thankfully. I'm not sure what the deal is with unlocks either, as some of them, no matter how many times we brought an item with us to the end of a level, just wouldn't unlock, so I presume they're barred by difficulty? In the event they're not, though, I find it highly irritating.I also found the story, while interesting, to be somewhat shorter than what I had anticipated. Maybe it just felt shorter because I tore into it like a kid at Christmas, but it felt like...it was missing an element of epicness that the first one had somehow. Most of the time in the story I was just going ""WTF vlad"", because some of the things he did (no spoilers) simply didn't make sense to me. I hope they'll do another ""other side of the coin"" type deal to expand on that.All in all I know this game will keep me busy for a while and I recommend it to anyone willing to give it a try.			"

												Hi,I have played the main campaign on normal so far, alone though, because my friends dont bought the game (yet). I really like the story line and I have to say I like the game in general too. People may hate on it because 'it's not as good as Magicka 1', but this is another game, it isn't supposed to be all the same. I have played Magicka 1 and I loved that game too. Personally I think Paradox did a good job on trying to improve the game, while keeping the same(ish) ambiance as in Magicka 1 (all the references and the silly humor :3 ). Some things I didn't like: It seemed like my wizard was outside of my screen sometimes, like the gamescreen was actually larger than my laptop window, which was a little annoying. Futhermore, I couldn't walk back in some areas, while there was no loading screen. This really bothered me, because I was like, well, I check out this area first and then go overthere, and then enemies appeared and after slaying them I could not return to the other part T_T. I Also heard people complaining about the controls, but I haven't played Magicka 1 in a while so this was no issue for me. Beside these things, I'd recommend this game to anyone that liked Magicka 1, but don't go in thinking this is Magicka 1 with just some upgraded graphics, because you'll probably be disappointed.For alttabbers: alt tab is working fine, no crashes :)NOTE: I haven't played online yet so I don't know how laggy it will be, but they probably fixed that too. (Magicka 1 was kind of laggy for me sometimes).			"

												This game is what Sanctum 2 was to Sanctum 1.I, for one, welcome the fact that the complicated and interesting spellcasting system is gone. The game feels more relaxed now, no more of that ecstatic feeling of absolute power, the power rivaling that of ancient gods, all at your fingertips. Who needs that anyway? Who needs fluid and visceral combat when you can have quick magicka slots?The only downside is that this time around, the game runs more or less stable. But, if you're not dissuaded by this little thing, I suggest you go and buy it right now. "

												Don't listen to the people who say it's ""Too easy"" or that there's ""not enough content."" There are difficulty settings, UNLIKE the first magicka, which allow for more advanced customization of play, and as for content, Magicka had tons of DLC, whereas Magicka 2 just came out, and hasn't yet had the opportunity to add more content. It's a great game, with tons of replayability and hidden treats, and is definitely worth the price.			"

												Despite its shortcomings (Many were mentioned by others already, such as the ice + water and water + fire combos taking up two slots, lack of key binding options, etc), Magicka 2 still lived up to my general expectations of a ""Magicka"" game - More silliness, spell shenanigans, and secrets to discover, along with a stable release.

												I'll start with the genuine gripes: No rebindable keys is a bummer, as is the separate account (although it's not a separate program, like uPlay), and the mouse movement copying Wizard Wars rather than the original Magicka is pretty lame. At least they could allow an option to turn that off. This is one of those games that works better with a controller. It sucks they didn't give more love to the KB/M crowd. With a controller, everything clicks. The movement and casting is great. The spells come up quickly. The hot bar is easily accessed. That's how I've been playing and that's how I recommend you play. If that's not an option for you, by preference or not having a controller, I'm not sure what to say. Email Paradox and ask for better mouse support is the best I can do. :/They've definitely changed the spell system around, and yes, it does more closely resemble the MOBA version rather than the original, but I've liked the changes. The thing that killed the original for me was that there was one spell (steamx2, lightningx2, arcane) that would pretty much kill anything immediately. As long as you were using the right shield for the situation, you were golden with just that one thing. And that's BORING! In the first couple of chapters, I've been forced to experiment with several kinds of spells with each enemy, searching for their weaknesses. It's far more interesting to be required to know your enemy and react accordingly than to just mindlessly spam a single spell. Several of the negative reviews I read suggested that some enemies are practically invulnerable. And they are...except for their weakness. The same enemy you can blast fire-arcane beams at all day while they laugh and pick their teeth might go down immediately when hit with an AoE water attack. Experiment not only with element combinations, but types of casting. There's something that'll take whatever enemy is giving you trouble down. The spell system is not as ridiculously deep as before, since several elements don't combine in the same way, but I don't really miss it. Having a huge array of spells I never use since the steam-lightning-arcane beam will kill everything is inferior to having fewer combinations but the need for all of them. I have fewer spells to use, but I'm actually using more kinds of spells than before. I'm forced to adapt to my enemies, and that's a good change--something I really wanted to see, actually.Speaking of spamming, I miss it too. Nothing like a few quick ice-arcane-rock balls to ruin any enemy's day. It's impossible to spam most spells, and that's not great. It's compensated for by allowing movement while casting and spells generally lasting longer than in the original. You'll probably have other gripes as you play, and I'm not going to give the asinine ""It's only $15! What did you expect?"" excuse. I imagine you expected to get a functional game as free of bugs and frustration as possible. And that's...mostly what you'll find here. They will patch out as many of the problems as they can (and agree are actually problems), but even on the first evening of release, it worked near flawlessly for me in single player. I say ""Go for it!"". If it's on sale and anything about it sounds appealing, snap it up. For every frustration or bug there will be 20 moments you'll be smiling. :D			"

												Magicka 2 is a sub par game that is still quite funny, but the decisions made by the developers and lack of progression from the first game to the sequel let it down.The first Magicka was probably my favourite co-op game, the art style was fun, the spells were awesome, and the overall design of the levels felt really good with a mix of rpg style dungeon locations, to lakes and forest. But i'm here to talk about Magicka 2. The game feels backwards instead of something brand new, almost like the original magicka would be more fitting as the sequel, sure not because of story, but for little experience things and obvious mechanics that were present in the first game, but missing in the second game is why people get frustrated by this game.Firstly, you cant change controls and are locked to their default, which might not be the best for you, i am left handed so it is quite awkward to use the default control scheme, the problem with this, is that you were able to change controls in the original magicka game no problem, and in wizard wars, so it's a bit strange that they didn't include this for the sequel, in 2015. It is really strange and makes no sense, they then later responded by adding a config, but the config text document, doesnt allow you to use all keyboard controls to change, but only a specific amount.A huge turn-off, the magick system is different, and seems to follow some of the rules to wizard wars, but with the same 5 elements, i don't like this, why not build upon the first games system, with the unique spells you could use to keep things just like magicka, and leave the other systems for the different games, it feels like a downgrade, some of elements on screen are placed quite strangely too.The actual game though is ok, i'm not going to say its fun, but its not, not enjoyable atleast, and i'm sure with the DLC they can improve and make this game twice as good.ProsCo-op is goodChallenges are challengingGood art styleConsNo customising controlsSpellcasting system is not goodWards are weakFloaty gameplayUI elements placingStoryThe game is ok, it's not worth the full price though 7.99 like magicka 1 is ok rather than 10.99the developers must have been really lazy, but it can always improve with updates and DLC, thats actually worth it, and not just the same broken game for more cash.If i knew the game would be this bad i would have never preordered it, i guess i got put into a trap by how good M1 and MWW are.

												8/10Pros:-Artifacts-Good Story-FUN FUN FUN-Non-Vampire Vlad-Robes/Staves/Weapons are fine-Challenges-There's no OP Spell, so you have to find new spells what is the core of the game.-Magick system (i used both at the same time)Contra:-No PvP mode-Slow casting-Sometimes the game doesn't get the Element or it get it but in an other order (Like ASF was SAF or SF)-You can't do the lemonball-You can't cast magicks/spells midair (So Emergency Teleport is almost useless)-There's no Falling Damage-Sometimes its almost impossible to kill a mob-Rock physic is terrible. I died a lot of times, just because it bounced back at me.Overall the game was fun to play, searching spells was too. Sometimes i just spammed the same mines to kill something and it took so long. When you play like this is a standalone magicka-like game then it can be funny and challenging. I hope they'll fix these ""bugs""TL;DR Fun if you play this game like this is only a Magicka-like game not a Magicka sequel.			"

Transcript Below!Story:I won't spoil anything however, it's not a story designed to immerse you but, rather to act as a crutch for the bombardment of jokes squeezed in around every corner. This is not a bad thing, necessarily - much like ambitious adult entertainment, I doubt anyone is in it for the storyline but without it, the experience would feel a little lacking.Visuals:With fancy new particle effects, rounded edges and more cowbell, the graphical fidelity is significantly improved over that in Magicka 1. However, It is worth mentioning that the GUI in the menu and in-game is more intrusive and not nearly as charming. Once you get into the game, it isn't something that causes a major issue. Occasionally though, I would find myself setting off hot-keyed spells unintentionally as my mouse cursor travelled over to the icons in all the chaos. It feels as though the GUI in Magicka 2 belongs in an early developer version rather than in the final release of the game.Mechanics/Gameplay:Like in the first game, you use QWERASDF to control various elements and combine them to create powerful spells. The difference though is that Magicka 2 allows you to hotkey different unique spells to keys: 1,2,3 and 4. More buttons normally complicate gameplay but this actually makes it easier to control your more powerful spells, resulting in a lot less frustration.Throughout the game, you will encounter different creatures and most of them have weaknesses and strengths, forcing you to not use the same spells over and over. Figuring out if an enemy is too hot for its shirt or if all it takes is a little knock to the head with a rock is very rewarding and stands as one of the pinnacle selling points of the game. Where the game falls behind Magicka 1 though, is the lack of varied landscapes and creatures - sure, there is variation but it felt like I was fighting the same monsters over and over - more so than in the first game.Another thing to mention is that: there was a part in the game where my partner and I got stuck, fighting wave after wave after wave. Only after about 10 minutes did we figure out that there was a puzzle to be solved. Call me stupid but, the game hadn't really given us this kind of task before and so it is bad design to leave us to figure it out through sheer luck.Bugs:My companion and I experienced a few minor bugs, but nothing game breaking. I encountered a crash at the start of the story; however neither of us experienced any others throughout.  During the co-operative segments, my partner experienced some issues with the cut scenes freezing up, missing out on a large portion of the dialogue. All-in-all, the game is far less buggy than the first game was on release and it is just as fun and challenging.Verdict: 8/10In conclusion, the game felt repetitive during some segments; however the overall experience was enjoyable with a well-polished combat system and an entertaining narrative. It does play very similarly to the first game, with some minor design changes. I f you enjoyed the first game you should certainly enjoy Magicka 2. Overall I am giving Magicka 2 an eight out of ten.

												When you glance at first, there is a big difference between Magicka and its sequel. Ice and Steam are no longer their own element. Quick bind keys for Magicks, making memorization pointless. Lightning has precedence over arcane (which is now death) meaning no lightning lasers or‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•mines. Also, no giga ice swords. But, all of these actually made the game insanely easy. Spamming mines in a corner and teleporting with a premade sword made it quite easy. With cooldowns and comboing and proper elemental usage taking importance over strong spells, I feel like its improved a bit.			"

												The game takes five hours to beat, not a lot of playtime but what was there was definitely worthwhile.The movement system, for the first ten minutes of the game feels foreign and clunky. Post-tutorial, this feels much more natural and even a massive improvement on the original Magicka.The zany humour we've come to expect and love is still there. In fact, however short the game is, the ending and elements leading up to it are great.I'm eager to see what DLC packs Paradox will be releasing for this solid and entertaining base experience, as they would naturally influence my final 'score' or 'opinion' of the game.

You can even start a flame thrower, and then start moving. The part in the beginning of the first Magicka, where you have to stop to cast Freeze, because the first didn't cover? Now you don't have to stop. Much better. But you can hold if you want to, even if that is one of the things that annoyed me the most from the first game.-Elements don't combine on the bar, but still do when cast, you can still shotgun ice, just not ice + thunder, because the water is still there. This also means some of the combos from the old one are gone, but this freshens things up, forcing you to rethink your spells, and not go with the same old ones.-The quickcasting. Yes, some of the Magicks (Haste and random teleport), have a one click key, with a cooldown, called focus, on the 1-4 keys. But, this is only for quickcasting of that Magick. If you combine the elements, and press space, it doesn't cost focus, and it doesn't have to be on the quick cast bar either. It's simply for quick casting of some spells. They are grouped. '1' has a force blast option (You can't cast without elements any longer, sadly, this is true), but can be switched with Random Teleport. Neither of those could be put on the other quickcasting. The focus cooldown is also only if use the quickcast, instead of doing it old school style.-Staffs and robes and swords are now all selectable, instead of having to choose a set, like in the original, and they unlock as you get them in game.Edit/Also, it's an online account for online play. You can play without an account for local play, and can play without more accounts on the same computer, using different controllers.And the controls for the controller are much better than they were in the original. So much better.But no rebinding options, it seems, makes me a sad panda.Overall, I think they did a lot of good things. The bad stuff, is the story, so far, which seems like it won't be anything new, but I could be wrong. But if you want to play this with friends, in coop or pvp, it doesn't matter about the story. (To clarify, the story is new, it's not a remake, but it seems to be simply another dig at various existing tropes, which can get a little bit tiresome)			"

												To me personally i would rather they just technically copy magicka 1 but improve on those net connection and graphic , with new story ofcourse. To me this isnt the magicka anymore , whats with the cool down timers ? and those defectless shield ? and that push spells - rightclick in magicka 1)i love magicka because its fun to play like spamming spells like lighting just to strike a friend or foe but now its not fun anymore.  would i recommend this game ?  No , go play magicka 1 (glad steam have refunding system now)			"

												I think the Magicka games are truly amazing!!!  I played the first Magicka a short while ago with a friend, and couldn't get away from it!  I loved the humor that they have and just the silly mechanics!  I have been waiting a long while for this game to come out.  I can easily say, that this second game is just as good, even better.  The multiplayer system is incredible (Dropping in and out) and the artifacts are pretty funny to use.  Of course, there are going to be a ton of bugs, but they can't find them if people can't report them.  The bugs that are still there are small, like the mouse moving to the middle of the screen.  Even if the game wasn't completely ready to be released, I think it was good that it was (For all of the ""to heart Magicka fans"" like me and for bugs).  Paradox will, for sure, fix all of these in a matter of time.  I definitely recommend this game, mainly to people who have friends to play with (and argue with :P).  I also recommend this to everybody else.			"

Also i think the quickspell for stuff like haste is really handy and if you wanna spam you still can by using the elements then there is no cooldown.Good points:-good graphics-Fun story so far-already some funny eater eggs-harder gameplaybad points:-getting used to the new spell system can take some playtime- nothing more from me actuallyscore:8/10 so far "

												Magicka 2 is Magicka 1 but with a fresher coat of paint and a tweaked engine under the hood, it may not have the charm of its predecessor, but it runs a bit better and is more responsive. Disappointingly, the game's many enemy encounters do not feel as memorable as the first. Which leads to my biggest gripe with this sequel.Where this game truly pales in comparison to its predecessor is its Soundtrack. Almost every level in Magicka 1 was accompanied by an Orchestral Masterpiece that helped make every enemy encounter FEEL like an epic Tolkien fantasy battle interspersed with images of your friends fending off hordes with a weenie on a stick and/or dying horribly. The Background Music in this game is instantly forgettable save for the few encounters where a remixed ""Dunka Dunka"" is playing from a radio ingame.The new artifact gameplay changes have definite potential, though I have not yet tried all of them, I hope the strictly cosmetic artifacts (Sitcom Audience being my favorite, where an unseen audience laughs at you when you die) wont prevent you from unlocking things.In regards to humor, this game lacks the comedic stings of the original by resorting to in large part awful old memes and Game of Thrones references. But these are easily missed and ignored.All in all Magicka 2 is an OK sequel, it isnt completely disappointing like sequels are in general, and unfortunately, the spellcasting system is not as complex as in the first, the OP spells of old are replaced by the Shield tactic of spamming rock+ice/fire/arcane while equipping a shield of the same element.

												As a fan of the first magicka, I can't recomend this game. It's shorter, has less magicks, less weapons, less elements and less combinations of those elements. They've also made the game much harder - which isn't necesarily a bad thing, but the way they've done it just encourages ragequiting. Sheild spells and elemnet immunities are almost entierly removed from the game, and most enemies now 1-shot a player. This makes single player very difficult, and makes multiplayer far less strategic. There used to be multiple team members casting diffiernt buffs and healing. Now you just choose who's the distraction to run at the enemy, die, and get revived while a few friends hang back and shoot things.Pros: Music is great, as it was in the first game. Writting is on point too. Classic magicka humor will have you cracking up.Overall, it feels like a beta test of the first Magicka before they realized what good gameplay was and how awesome a truly dynamic spell system is and decided to add those. Except it's 4 years after the original... Is this what passes for a sequel these days?3/10 Might be worth 1-2 dollars on a steam sale some day.I think for the current price you could get the original + all DLC (which are very good) and have about 5x more gamplay, 3x the replayablity, and 2x more fun.

												Magicka 2 is Magicka 1 but with a fresher coat of paint and a tweaked engine under the hood, it may not have the charm of its predecessor, but it runs a bit better and is more responsive. Disappointingly, the game's many enemy encounters do not feel as memorable as the first. Which leads to my biggest gripe with this sequel.Where this game truly pales in comparison to its predecessor is its Soundtrack. Almost every level in Magicka 1 was accompanied by an Orchestral Masterpiece that helped make every enemy encounter FEEL like an epic Tolkien fantasy battle interspersed with images of your friends fending off hordes with a weenie on a stick and/or dying horribly. The Background Music in this game is instantly forgettable save for the few encounters where a remixed ""Dunka Dunka"" is playing from a radio ingame.The new artifact gameplay changes have definite potential, though I have not yet tried all of them, I hope the strictly cosmetic artifacts (Sitcom Audience being my favorite, where an unseen audience laughs at you when you die) wont prevent you from unlocking things.In regards to humor, this game lacks the comedic stings of the original by resorting to in large part awful old memes and Game of Thrones references. But these are easily missed and ignored.All in all Magicka 2 is an OK sequel, it isnt completely disappointing like sequels are in general, and unfortunately, the spellcasting system is not as complex as in the first, the OP spells of old are replaced by the Shield tactic of spamming rock+ice/fire/arcane while equipping a shield of the same element. There is definite room for improvement, which we may see down the line in ...*groan* DLC. Then again i had a lot of fun with Dungeons and Daemons from magicka 1 so we'll see.			"

												This game is basically Magicka 1 with none of the fun. It's one thing to have mobs come after you, but it's something else completely when 99% of my game time was spent desperately spamming heal because the game designers couldn't figure out that this wasn't a Serious Sam game.			"

												The first Magicka was awesome, even though I only played it single-player. In this game, it felt like it was designed more for the cooperative multiplayer than the single player - it seemed a lot more difficult than the first one and, despite being much prettier, I didn't have anywhere near as much fun. I'm sure it's awesome in multiplayer, but next time I want to play Magicka I'll play the original rather than this.			"

												At it's core, it's still Magicka. It still has the amazing spell-casting mechanic, the frantic combat complete with accidentally killing friends. There have been some changes to how a few things work, but they're fairly minor and easy to get used to. I'd say if you enjoyed the first Magicka, this one offers more of that.			"

												I don't want to hate this game, I really don't. But Paradox forgot something immensly important when making this game, the magic..... Not the litteral kind, I mean the Disney magix and whinsey that the first game gave off... And before you say anything, NO I don't mean clone the first game, I mean take what it gave and improve, not forget HALF of what made is special.Also, fair warning, this is long. But if you are considering buying this game, I at least recommend you skim this. You have been warned.I'm not going to go into the controls, art, and basic spells, those are fine. Alot of people are iffy on them, but I have no gripes with them. Also, A+ on the added Poison element.What I do hate is the basic items you get. The abilety to make your own loadout with your own robes is cool, I like it. But the proble is they are not special anymore. What most of them do is buff/weaken certain spells, or change movement speed. Most of the robes did that in 1, true, but what I'm really talking about here are the staves. There are NO stave secondarys here, they all just buff/weaken. What about the rogue staff that allowed you to use smokebombs? The Scythe that spead poison? The Freedom Staff with grenades? GANDOLF'S STAFF OF LIGHT!!! They COMPLETELY changed how you played with new abiletys, but ushually at some price. If we had THOSE staves on the loadout screen, that would be AMAZING!!! But we have instead is the Skull stave.... It makes life spells suck, but you death better... Yay?But hey! We have GAME CHANGING ARTIFA- what is this? An item that makes the game black and white? Giving enemys more HP? Why? I got more game changes from starting the game as Dr. Doom than this. How about something WORTH getting? Like a goblet that turns you undead ghost that heals from death, but is hurt by life. That would be a load of fun when playing with freinds, trying to heal you but accidentally killing you instead. Or maybe a bomb bag that makes you Kamakazi the SECOND fire touches you? Some fun stuff like that! And each player could have their own artifact, making the battlefeild MAYHEM!!!Also, Magicks suck now. All those weird spells you could cast after entering a spell code with good and bad effects? Most of them are gone. Black Hole, the most deadly one, is created by crossing life and death. Most conflicts can now be ended by just doing that over, and over again. It made SENSE it was the last Magick! Now it's a joke! And you get Magicks NOT from well hidden tomes, but from playing the story mode. Instead of a code, you just click a button. You CAN enter the code... But why? Spells like Conflagerate were super fun to use because it was a bit tricky to use, but when you got it working, you felt satified! You murdered ALL those imps by imputing the spell correctly! Now you just hit a button... Is conflag even in this game?.... NO! Cause that was fun! We now have a dragon strike, while better, is alot less fun. You hit a button, and there's fire. Good job, now get back to work. Raisde dead was tricky, and you only got a few zombies, but if you could keep your steak up, you felt like a real necromancer! Summoning armys of zombies to fight!... Now you got a bunch of skeletons you can't spam... Cute.But the biggest tragety of all is the lack of secrets. In Magicka 1, secret stuff was EVERYWHERE! Like the sword that 1 hit K.O'd one of the final bosses! Or the Sword of Masters hidden beside a creek you would not think to check! I wasted SO much time in Magicka 2 trying to find secrets that did not exsist! Does this lake go anywhere? No. This one? no. This cave? No, this one- Oh hey..... A camo skin....... Neat. And where this is a secret, it's SO OBVIOUS, and the pay out is another staff that does‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•all. Gimmie a reward! Like a staff of Invisabilety! Or something that spits poison! Or the abilety to Charm! ANYTHING WORTH GETTING!!!!!Also, the Melee is broken, yeah. I keep swinging at an imp, and my blade constantly goes through him like Elsa's hair. Not that Melee is even worth doing. No weapon is THAT neat. It either does more damage, or a little bit of death, or a little bit of.... Life WHAT..... WHY DO WE HAVE SO MANY LIFE MELEES!?!? ARE YOU JOKING!?!? I'm nitpicking, onward. There isn't even any sidearms, like the pistol that one of the original wizards had, or the M18, the Throwing records, the insta-freeze swords! Magicka is about being broken! Cause even if you are god, YOU WILL STILL DIE!!! So much stuff is thrown at you in these games you NEED those powerful weapons to kill the enemy. Magic is not your ONLY tool!I haven't even gotten to how much less exciting this game's story is, or some of the other flaws. But I hope you see where the problem is. It's just shallow. It's the diffenece between Mario Party 5 and Mario Party 10. They got rid the biggest fun factor for something easier. And no fake difficuly can hide that. Alone, this game is fine, but when your a sequel, you HAVE something to compaire to! And by god, this is not cutting it for Magicka, one of the best bloody games I've playedParadox, I'm dissapointed, but I'm not giving up on you. Magicka 1 and it's expanchions was incredable, even if the netcode sucked for a while. Take what made Magicka 1 great, and build up. And take some of the things that worked in Magicka 2, and again, build up. This was a flop, but I'm certain you can move on, and make something even better with what you learned from this. God's speed.			"

												Magicka 2 is a simple concept with a fun story, great characters. Its querky and enjoyable with refrences jokes and secrets everywhere! All kinds of cool things to find to customize your wizard. But oh no! its dangerus out there you could get killed!Dont wory! just plug in a controller and play with up to 4 freinds and have great fun, after you stop killing each other, Geez... guys theres an arena mode for that. Then once youve completed the story. Play it again. but look for secrets in places you would never have checked, then play waves or trials or challenges or get the special challenge pack dlc if you love it that much. All in all magicka 2 is everything you could hope for in a game like this. ""fun""			"

												A real challange!!!!!A game about magic, spells against goblins and other creaturesIt's pretty hard if you're playin this alone in the standard normal mode, wich mean that on hard difficulty it's almost impossibile to beat. I've played few hours on local co-op and it's still pretty difficult. I suggest that if you're going to play this on hard difficulty join a party or create one online or in local co-op, otherwise you'll be ragin' 80% of the time. Besides the challange (wich for me it's a good point for the game itself cause games nowdays tend to be too easy) it's pure fun, you can even try differnt combination between different spelssto find what fits more against the enemies we ecounter.

												As a fan of the Magicka series, I really enjoyed Magicka 2. I know at one point Magicka 2 went through a big change in the way spells and controls work, that being said I feel like if you were a fan of Magicka 1 then you would like the way Magicka 2 plays now. a few complaints I have seen involve the length of the game, Magicka 2 seems to be shorter, but with that being said I think I enjoy Magicka 2 Multiplayer enough that it doesn't bother me as much as it could.  I myself cant really find any big negatives to Magicka 2, I think any Magicka fans, or just cans of co op games should give Magicka 2 a look.			"

												I would pay double price/triple for playing AC unity instead of playing with this for free. Normal difficulty is hard as hell. Map creator creativity was zero. Boss after boss. Zero hack and slash. And the most annoying things are the screen locks during boss fights.Not recommended!			"

												This game is a huge disapointment. After all the hype building with the comical trailers and pre-order rewards, I was expecting the next big adventure for the Magicka series. Instead, what I got was a short, shallow and frustrating Magicka game that fails to understand what made the first game such a blast to play. Magicka 2 lacks content, magicks and even spell combinations from the 1st game and it doesn't replace it with much else. There is less of everything in Magicka 2 which wouldn't be a big deal if what was there was any good. However, it's biggest flaw is just how unfun this game is. Some of your basic defenses have been dramatically weakened and your health decreased causing you to die within 1-3 seconds of being spawned in the more difficult areas if you are not lightning fast with your wards. You will die over and over again and barely achieve much during your short lives. To make matters worse, arcane (death) deals the best damage now but is crippled by causing huge explosions when an enemy is killed with it and that explosion can deal great damage to you and your allies. Often killing them which gets really annoying. They ramped up friendly fire to the extreme here.Now the game being harder isn't necessarily a bad thing conceptually, it's more of a problem due to how they increased the difficulty. The new difficulty modes aren't any fun to play at all. All they do is give enemies more health, the players less, and allow enemies to regenerate health, as well as other adjustments. Anyway there are plenty of other reviews that go into more depth within the game's mechanics but I think you get the jist of it here. Ultimatelly I cannot recommend this game. It is much less fun than Magicka 1 and if you are a new comer to the series, just go play Magicka 1. If you are returning from Magicka 1, this game is most likely going to disapoint you more than anything else. If that's the case, lower your expectations and perhaps buy the game on sale and approach it as DLC to the first game and then maybe you'll find a tiny amount of entertainment here.			"

												Seriously, this game is a shame. Just one thing to understand that the developers do not care about players : this game requires to combine elements to cast spells. For this, you should press the right buttons in the right order... And they have not implemented the ability to change the buttons spells... This option was the most important of all and was present on the first game, but no, they have not put. Do not buy this game, the developers do not care about the players.			"

												Fast paced pretty action adventure!  Lot of fun!  Very funny, the Va... Narrator is a hoot!Cool game mechanic!  Combine 8 elements up to 5 times to cast a spell up to 4 ways.  That's 4*(8^5+...+8^1) = 149792 possibilites.  Nearly a quarter of those hurt/kill you.  Also, many of them are fairly similar since order doesn't always matter.  However, some of those are super spells that do something extra cool.  This game can be challenging if you're solo and don't gear up.Controls: ABXY - ElementsL1+(ABXY) - Other 4 ElementsL2 - Area CastR1 - Self CastR2 - Sword CastRStick - Directional Cast (also aim)LStick - MoveSpecial spells need to be unlocked first!Haste - Lightning + Death + Fire + Sword CastNote: You can move and cast!Other comments: Magicka 2 has a much better controller scheme than the first game (which seems better with a keyboard).  For some reason 2 broke after a steam update and wouldn't sync with my offline mode unlocks.  Haven't played it enough to catch back up, but super annoying to go through all of that again.  My setup is super jenky, so probably not terribly fair to blame Paradox.			"

												POST UPDATES REVIEW:I'm........shocked at how Paradox North managed to pull this together.Every single problem encountered at launch has been fixed.The inclusion of the new poison element is awesome, to boot.TL;DR: Don't read the original review. Buy Magicka 2. Enjoy it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Magicka (The Original) is a GREAT, AMAZING GAME. BUY IT. Magicka 2 is a *good* game. As in, not AS good as the original, but still good, kind of? Think Diablo II and Diablo 3.I never thought I'd give a Magicka game a bad recommendation, but.......*sigh*TL;DR: Buy Magicka (the original). If you have it, buy Magicka 2 when it's on sale and you have nothing else to do.Magicka 2 feels like 50 steps forward, and 55 steps back.Magicka (the original) is one of my favorite games of all time.Nothing comes close to it.Magicka: Wizard Wars got me incredibly excited......until I realized that they dumbed it down to bare-bones as far as the magic system is concerned.Magicka 2 was like a dream come true. A sequel to one of my favorite games? Of course I'm happy!Unnnntiiillll...... I realized they made it more similar to Wizard Wars than the original....The controls feel floaty and slippery like in Wizard Wars, and the controls have completely changed since the original, and the lack of rebindable keys makes this worse.Additonal Info/Edit:I feel like more detail is required here, I'll admit I kind of jumped the gun when I fired off this review, but I meant what I said.The spell system has changed drastically since the original. Which is not inherently bad. However, things changing caused them to lose value. The earth element is basically useless now, seeing as charging a huge boulder takes WAY too long. This causes interesting combinations like the ""Ice Ball of Death"" from Magicka 1 almost impossible to pull off. I however, really LIKE that lightning doesn't become a beam when mixed with arcane/death. THAT opens up possiblities that I may not have even discovered yet. Also, the Shield element: There is basically no reason to use it on its own. Shield doesn't block ANYTHING other than elemental attacks? That's a HUGE change from the original that takes away from the chaos that made the original good.The fact that steam and ice elements do not combine IN the spell queue is a significant change. One that can be adapted to, if it weren't for the fact that those types of damage are impossible to stack against creatures that are weak to it. For example, Steam damage is very effective against the lobster/crab things. However, in any given spell, you can only have a MAXIMUM of 2 Steam elements in queue, leaving very little room for customization.In addition, the change that makes frozen entities NOT weak to physical damage is honestly pretty lame. I really miss that from the first game. My friends and I loved to tag-team bosses with one of us freezing him, and the rest unleashing huge boulders to shatter them into pieces. A strategy that is now impossible due to the change listed as well as earth element spells being incredibly slow and lackluster.The quickbar concept SOUNDS like a really good idea, and I'll admit I thought it was a great idea, however I quickly realized that being able to spam magicks with a single button click on a cooldown system really took the fun out of the Magicks themselves. I quickly become aware that I was able to spam-cast dragon strike and haste using a staff that regenerated focus very quickly. I knew how to cast Summon Elemental and Summon Death by memory in the original, and that allowed me to do some crazy things that made me FEEL like a wizard. You actually had to try to do stuff like that quickly.The controls being similar to Wizard Wars is a VERY minor flaw, all things considered, I would happily adapt and shut up about it if the original gameplay of Magicka was kept intact. It, however, was NOT kept intact in Magicka 2.ALSO: Including a MULTIPLAYER-ONLY PUZZLE?! Really? I mean, I know its a ""co-op"" game, but FORCING it is just a bad decision. I don't have ""friends"".			"

												This game isn't worth its money. If you want to play it you might better play Magicka (1) or (for an experience of competetiveness) Magicka Wizard Wars.Pros:- It's funny when you slaugther your enemies.- Its spell-mechanics are interesting and it's fun to be capable of immediately knowing the combination you need to destroy an enemy.Cons:- It's story is boring.- It's in-built jokes are low.- A short game (here about 5h... Don't regard the number of hours I played, I'm just slow.) you can play in a large variety is still the same game, just easier or more difficult. (You know, like changing a color-scheme of a picture doesn't change the contrast.)- Sometimes there are too many creatures.- Often it's possible to attack enemies that won't notice your attack.- There are many bugs in the endboss-fight that frustrate.- There are fewer items than in Magicka (1).Please note that I played this game on a pc. The experience of playing Magicka 2 on a console may differ.			"

												Sadly enough this game encourages and is higly suggested that you play with friends. Well unlike most people I have very few to little friends who share the same interest as me, I am unable to play with friends as they don't have the game and the servers are either a lot of people who are late game. Therefore unless you have some friends and want to embark on an epic quest you can buy this game and have a lot of fun I expected. But still it is encouraged that they all bought the game and they all are at the same point.			"

												I picked up this game after getting Magicka and really enjoying it with my friends.It didn't take long for it to become apparent that this game was significantly worse than the original. The game has lost all it's tactical play, spells have boiled down to using one tactic on each kind of enemy. The control scheme for gamepads is much easier to use, I find myself being able to cast almost as quickly as with a keyboard, but the implementation of auto-casting spells like haste just seems pointless; the only purpose I can think of for it would be to allow newer players to cast bigger spells more easily, but that should come about organically throught the campaigns difficulty curve (which was woefully up and down in Magicka 2). In the original Magicka, you played a powerful wizard with a myriad of options for each encounter, whereas in Magicka 2 you feel like a glass cannon, and an incredibly pathetic one at that. In an effort to make the gameplay faster and more compelling, the new developer has destroyed what made the original such a success.Although it is true that the updated graphics have much more fidelity, the enemies have lost their personality, and the spells look more generic compared to the previous game, so aesthetically the game is much worse off, so I can't even recommend this game from a visual perspective.tl,dr: New developer took everything that made the first game great and flushed it down the toilet.If you liked Magicka in any way then do not buy this game.

												All of the fun of the original with some improvements, especially for anyone using an XBox-style controller.  It plays great for co-op, and my child and I play it nightly (she's under 6).  The various game modes and DLC are all worth it, and co-op, especially local, same-screen, is awesome, as is the ability (should you desire) for others to join your active game.  We made a lot of progress on the Single Player game (which unlocks new ""Magicks"") with the help of a lot of other gamers out there, which was a nice change.			"

												POST UPDATES REVIEW:I'm........shocked at how Paradox North managed to pull this together.Every single problem encountered at launch has been fixed.The inclusion of the new poison element is awesome, to boot.TL;DR: Don't read the original review. Buy Magicka 2. Enjoy it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Magicka (The Original) is a GREAT, AMAZING GAME. BUY IT. Magicka 2 is a *good* game. As in, not AS good as the original, but still good, kind of? Think Diablo II and Diablo 3.I never thought I'd give a Magicka game a bad recommendation, but.......*sigh*TL;DR: Buy Magicka (the original). If you have it, buy Magicka 2 when it's on sale and you have nothing else to do.Magicka 2 feels like 50 steps forward, and 55 steps back.Magicka (the original) is one of my favorite games of all time.Nothing comes close to it.Magicka: Wizard Wars got me incredibly excited......until I realized that they dumbed it down to bare-bones as far as the magic system is concerned.Magicka 2 was like a dream come true. A sequel to one of my favorite games? Of course I'm happy!Unnnntiiillll...... I realized they made it more similar to Wizard Wars than the original....The controls feel floaty and slippery like in Wizard Wars, and the controls have completely changed since the original, and the lack of rebindable keys makes this worse.Additonal Info/Edit:I feel like more detail is required here, I'll admit I kind of jumped the gun when I fired off this review, but I meant what I said.The spell system has changed drastically since the original. Which is not inherently bad. However, things changing caused them to lose value. The earth element is basically useless now, seeing as charging a huge boulder takes WAY too long. This causes interesting combinations like the ""Ice Ball of Death"" from Magicka 1 almost impossible to pull off. I however, really LIKE that lightning doesn't become a beam when mixed with arcane/death. THAT opens up possiblities that I may not have even discovered yet. Also, the Shield element: There is basically no reason to use it on its own. Shield doesn't block ANYTHING other than elemental attacks? That's a HUGE change from the original that takes away from the chaos that made the original good.The fact that steam and ice elements do not combine IN the spell queue is a significant change. One that can be adapted to, if it weren't for the fact that those types of damage are impossible to stack against creatures that are weak to it. For example, Steam damage is very effective against the lobster/crab things. However, in any given spell, you can only have a MAXIMUM of 2 Steam elements in queue, leaving very little room for customization.In addition, the change that makes frozen entities NOT weak to physical damage is honestly pretty lame. I really miss that from the first game. My friends and I loved to tag-team bosses with one of us freezing him, and the rest unleashing huge boulders to shatter them into pieces. A strategy that is now impossible due to the change listed as well as earth element spells being incredibly slow and lackluster.The quickbar concept SOUNDS like a really good idea, and I'll admit I thought it was a great idea, however I quickly realized that being able to spam magicks with a single button click on a cooldown system really took the fun out of the Magicks themselves. I quickly become aware that I was able to spam-cast dragon strike and haste using a staff that regenerated focus very quickly. I knew how to cast Summon Elemental and Summon Death by memory in the original, and that allowed me to do some crazy things that made me FEEL like a wizard. You actually had to try to do stuff like that quickly.The controls being similar to Wizard Wars is a VERY minor flaw, all things considered, I would happily adapt and shut up about it if the original gameplay of Magicka was kept intact. It, however, was NOT kept intact in Magicka 2.ALSO: Including a MULTIPLAYER-ONLY PUZZLE?! Really? I mean, I know its a ""co-op"" game, but FORCING it is just a bad decision. I don't have ""friends"".			"

 Why is this game is worth playing? Many of you who see all the negative reviews on review section, might wonder if this game is really worth playing? Well to say the least, this game runs really well compared to original magicka even the multiplayer. However there is the lack of steam/ice elements but they can still be used to some degree. The lack of steam/ice causes the game to have less spells than original. The new magick slots are a nice add to the game play and offer you a change to quickly cast same magick twice, since original method of casting them is still viable. Speaking of game play they balanced the spell system by ton which causes the player having to think how to deal with enemies rather than simply mashing buttons and calling it a day. Items and robes add a new layer of strategy to the game and affect how you will want to use your spells and what you will put in your magick slots. Humor is still apparent in game and still gives a good laugh here and there. New controls also enable you moving and casting same time, it takes time to get used to, but it's way more useful than the old system. Good Stuff   Runs really well, not bugs  Game play is challenging and fun  Humor still gives you laughs  co-op is easier and not buggy also local co-op  Balanced spell system makes strategies more important  Interesting story Bad Stuff   Less spells than original  Connection issues, (caused probably by steam)  Always on DRM, Can't play single player if steam is having issues  Balanced spell system favors simple spells, and not complex ones.  Game play can be too hard as solo, and system still needs balancingOverall i'd rate this game 9/10 despite its flaws, and for 15‚Ç¨ or your regional equivalent, it's a pretty good deal if you ask me.

												Long story short : Magicka 1 was better.Casting while walking is a nice option,so are these skill ""shortcuts"".But cooldowns ? Seriously ? The added cooldowns to abilities.What made magicka fun was the ability to spam spells.If you were in a sticky situation you could spam A-S-A to get away.But in Magicka 2,you can cast it like once in 2 seconds.I'm dissapointed in thatStory was awfully short.I had near to no-fun while playing with my friend.Story made no sense.Artifacts are strange as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.Whose idea was that to implement them ?And they added little to no new spells.It gets boring after a few hours.Only thing that are better in this game are easter eggs and collectibles.You'll find lots of easter eggs in the story mode.While collectibles add somewhat ""replayability"".AND THEY REMOVED CRASH TO DESKTOPWHY THE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• WOULD YOU REMOVE THATTHAT'S A HUGE NEGATIVE			"

												It was a good Story.Easter Eggs make me laugh so much.Equipment system is good you pick your robe,staff and weapon before the game.System  changed like magicka wizard wars it feels a little bit slower than magicka 1 and you cannot mix water and fire to steam element. (They are not count as 1 you can still cast steam with water + fire)and we cannot do that amazing QRQRAS (Lightning/Arcane Tower) Because of this :PMe and my friend finnish the main storyline around 5 hours(we did a bit fast run)There is lots of challanges and trials so game time is longer than that.Magicka players gonna like it. If you only play the magicka wizard wars you gonna like it more.It feels good to kill your friends again (by ""mistake"") and discover the combinations you can do with them.(anti element void)Its still a good game. Purchase , play  and give a review here so its might be give some ideas to developers.			"

												this game was made by completely different devs than magicka 1. I beat the story mode in under 5 hours using 1 spell fire death ray (not 100%). This games story was way shorter than the first Magicka and sucked so much. when the game ended i was just siting there like ""That's it huh?"". i enjoyed the first Magicka and most of its DLC and was hoping this would be a nice sequel but its not and worst of all i fear like they just made this so they could make a ton of DLC for it. All this being said it does have a few upsides that the last game didn't. The menus are alot nicer and more user friendly and playing multi-player is so much easier and if you get disconnected you can just join back in where in the last game it was a huge hassle. all in i wouldn't really recommend it cause if you want it for the story the story was garbage and if you want it for the combat and game play the combat and game play sucked.

												Honestly? Even with all of it's Flaws I enjoy this game. Pros:‚Ä¢The Comedy is still there‚Ä¢The Spell casting is enjoyable, I do enjoy the Hot bar Magicks and being able to cast them manually. Good choice‚Ä¢Moving and casting: This is immensely helpful and fun.‚Ä¢Goofy Story: While it's not as silly and fun as the First game's it's still rather fun and enjoyable.‚Ä¢Great Controller support: People claim this game is dumbed down for controller though I find it more fun to play with a    controller due to more precise movement.‚Ä¢Working Multiplayer!: Finally! We can play Magicka without lagging like a truck.Cons:-Difficulty: This game can get hard, Insanely hard. While it lessens in difficulty with friends SP seems a tad bit unfair at times.-No Steam/Ice Icons: I understand why they did this, It's to prevent the making of the super OP Spells. Though at times I wish it was still there-Less Secrets? The first game was practically swarming with secret areas, Books you could find, and so on. This is one is lacking in secret areas.-Short? At times it feels like the game is a tad bit shorter though Magicka 1 only had 12 chapters itself..-Missing unlock?: This is a big one that /everyone/ has been going on about. There's an unlock in Chapter 5 that apparently is either bugged or impossible to find.How they could make this game better: One of the biggest things I know people would want is a Workshop, Allow us to make our own levels and the sort It'd add tons of replayability.The Occasional Free DLC that adds several levels and new things would probably appease people as well about the shortness of the game.

												Alright, I've played more of this game and changed my mind.This game is VERY frustrating.Yes, I have been playing by myself, I know most of the fun is by playing coop,still, the first Magicka was still very fun even if played by yourself.This one however is just frustrating.Enemies are way too fast, they just storm at you, you need to hit each with different spells and protect yourself with different wards for each of the 5 different types of enemies on screen.It is actually a huge mess.This game is just like wizard wars: A frustrating game where you have no time to breath and have to keep running and spamming all kinds of spells every second but will fail anyway even if you do so.Also, the controls suck, and I still haven't figured how the artifacts engine works, and you have a very little arsenal of magicks which turns the game boring.In the first game, you had a set number of magicks which would be acquired by finding the book or by completing a level. This one seems to give you specific magicks only on specific parts of the history, which is lame.			"

												I finished yesterday the adventure on banana difficulty, here are a few observation :1- With the right staff, the game is a breeze (except for the constant one shot kill)2- Robes' effects are negligible, too many things murders you instantly (goblin bombers, trolls)3- Armors are even more important, a good armor in the right situation can save you lots of problems.4- I haven't found any way to stop the green type of damage (even life absorb did nothing)Also, if you can't finish the game on solo in hard difficulty or even normal and complain that it is too hard, then I am sorry to tell you, but LEARN TO SPELL... As far as solo goes, you can swap robe quickly at each checkpoints (simply reach a checkpoint, quit, change your equips, then go back to adventure). If you are in a group, you only need one strong arcane user and one strong ice user to wreck the content. Arcane is strong against any living creature, so far, there is no real use of undead creatures, so arcane is strong against anyone except for fire mobs (somehow resists arcane ?). Since fire mobs are weak to ice, then just have a strong ice user. A healer might be a good idea, since many staves reduce life magic. Life + Arcane cross beam is useful too.All in all, the game is not difficult if you know how it works, you MUST move while casting. The keybinding just came up, a bit rudimentary, but I can live with it for now.Lastly, I found a single irritating bug, which is a problem with the Y axis (a beam going through an enemy because some derping on the Y axis), but if you using an AoE instead of a beam or a projectile, you'll be fine.

The next day, when I met with one of my buddys in TS wanting to play the game online, we noticed that it's IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY TOGETHER (except you create a paradox account)This information is NOT prominently provided in the Steam page. . .  excpet in the Reviews i read after noticing the problem and deep in the EULA where it was phrased as ""might be required"" not ""is absolutely required for Online Multiplayer mode""As I did not play the game for long after the Tutorial in Single player mode, I'm pondering the possibility to ask for a Refund (so far less then 2 h played on all 4 parts of the bundle..) - final decision after all 4 of our opinions were heared			"

												Easily the best example of ""sequals suck"" that i have seen.They wrecked the whole game ,the spellcasting system changed and it is nothing like before you cant do half the spells you did in the first game.The story is too short and my friend who bought the deluxe edition is so OP that i dont even want to play with him.the wands are not creative and the cutscenes are so boring and not funny.I am so dissappointed right now.I hate the fact that i wasted 24 TL's on this game.

If it wasnt different you couldnt justify spending another $16 to get a game thats the same as one you already have. Its different and thats OK. It will take getting used to.Magicka 2 is still has a very versatile spell casting system, its still hilarious, and it has better online support. I look forward to playing more of this game. "

												I am quite surprise there are such a large number of negative reviews in the first release day.But in my opinion, this is absolutely an improved version of Magicka.Improvements:1) More Challenging Enemies - You can easily beat the original Magicka by spamming 4~5 combinations of spells. In Magicka 2, you can't. You must learn to use different spells to encounter different enemies.2) Improved Mobility - You can cast spells while moving3) Customizable loadout - After you've discovered a new Weapon/Staff, you can bring it to your next game/life.4) Quick cast magick - Absolutely Great!! Manual cast is still there, with less cooldown than quick cast5) Easier to get heal - You can get heal even you are with stone/ice armor6) Improved gamepad control - Keybaord is still the best option for playing Magicka 2, but gamepad is also a good option for playing local co-op.Cons:1) Can't remap keybind (Dev is working on this)2) Staff active ability is removed3) Wards resistance effect is a bit too weak4) Rock projectiles take too long to charge its power and travel distanceOpinions/Questions:1) I don't think the removal of ice&steam elements is a huge drawback, you can still cast ice&steam with less input effort. However, It would be great if ice&steam spells can have more damage bonus.2) What is the use of life wards? Can't heal and have no poison resistance...3) instead of ice&steam wards, I think it is better to have WaterCold&WaterFire wards.			"

												I really liked the original magicka. But the changes in magicka 2 are not for me.I find the new movement system interesting. Being able to cast spells on the move makes you more mobile as a wizard. The problem is that the ranges of cone and AOE spells are decreased. Also the damage of al spells is decreased. As a result you feel weak in comparison to the first Magicka. I also do not like the new spell formula. I can understand why some people would like to cast spells with fewer amount of button clicks. I rely liked the old way. The most powerful spells demanded up to 10 clicks. With the new system you can‚Äôt cast spell with more than 5 basic elements. Fire and water do not become steam in one slot. It is the same with water and ice. A minor problem for me is that the game seems to have been made with consoles in mind. The new spell casting system would fit controllers better than mouse and keyboard. I really wanted to like this game. But sadly it was not to my liking. If anyone want more magicka, buy the DLC to the first game.			"

												Not the game it was Hyped up to be, and definitely in my opinion is a downgrade to Magicka one. Too bad im not allowed to refund the game cause i would in a heartbeat. The game feels like an Iphone app now. It feels like an arcade game. Its not immersive at all compared to Magicka 1, which actually made you feel like your in this wizard world and you where conjuring elements to create your own badass spells. There are LESS functions compared to Magicka 1, Less spell combinations, less spell effects for yours Sword, AOE, etc. Less animations for spells. For example, when you place a shield in Magicka 1 it was a glorious Curved dome shield that felt powerful and reflected beams and absorbed damage well. In Magicka 2 however, the shield you place is a completely flat rectangular yellow wall that pops into existence and feels like youre using a pizza box to protect yourself. Theres absolutely no immersion. The only pro this game has is the graphics are nice. But thats it. The gameplay is‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Im probably going to keep playing Magicka 1 as its atleast 10x better than this ""sequel"".			"

												This game is a lot like the first Magicka... but with better balance and working netcode.  The new netcode meets expectations - you can drop in and out freely with strangers and friends.  As for balance changes... no longer can you spam qfasa and expect to win - you have to adapt and use different spells on different enemies.  These balance changes made me frustrated at first, but I think honestly makes for a better game.  The only additional note is that the game is short - beatable in about 8 hours.  I'll go back through on hard and bananas, but it's not as long as I hoped.+ Working netcode+ Better balance- A bit short- Some balance changes take getting used to.			"

I loved the original, I am not bothered by the changes so far at all, just the frame lag.  Its hard to revive an ally when you can only hit one element per second to have it register.  I hope to hell they make an actual pc version of this, this is a travesty.  I will be playing it anyways hoping they hotfix this garbage code. You will be not having fun with your friends tonight in this game, perhaps tomorrow... if the company even cares.			"

												Unfortunately, Magicka 2 feels like it LOST content compared to the original Magicka. For instance, you can no longer mix certain elements like steam and lightning. Physics on rocks are weird. Spells in general lack the punch they once had. The shield element is pretty useless, at least by itself (enemies can pass through them now and it doesn't last nearly long enough.) Melee attacks are super clumsy and sometimes don't even connect when they should. Even the act of just moving your wizard feels strange and clumsy.And to top things off, they didn't add anything new, aside from artifacts and spell hotkeys (both admittedly good things). Magicka actually has more to it than Magicka 2. It's my feeling that cutting content without adding anything should preclude the right to put a ""2"" on a game. It feels like they tried to fix what wasn't broken,.. and broke it.So I'm not being entirely negative, it would still be an ok game if the original hadn't existed. And there's still the same charming wackiness. The problem rests entirely in the actual mechanics.			"

												Intolerable bugs and general lack of attention to detail.I usually use the mouse left-handed, so of course I tried to remap the keys.Problem 1: no ""left-handed"" default option, just manually remapping functions.Problem 2: it will only accept letter keys, not punctuation, so you can't reassign asdf to jkl; or kl;'Problem 3: no setting to reassign the spell hotkeys on 1234Problem 4: no way to simply change the left-shift modifier to right-shiftProblem 5: no key by key reset-to-default, only one that resets them allProblem 6: warning message on changing halt (default left-ctrl) to right-ctrl as if you assigned a modifier+click to a keystrokeProblem 7: if the mouse buttons are reversed at the OS level, you can't tell it to show reversed images in the tutorial and other instructionsThis isn't an early access or newly released game.  This is the first thing 10% of users will want to do, and it's a mess.  The reconfiguration for left-handed play that should be accomplished in one button press are impossible, but not obviously impossible, due to bizarre arbitrary restrictions.Of course, that's not the end of the problem:- Slow-startup with unskippable waiting to contact their network and pushing to sign up for their network, even when you just want to try the single-player mode.- Crashed during the tutorial for no apparent reason.- Pathing problems in the tutorial.- Died twice in the tutorial due to unresponsive controls.- List of options on main menu doesn't include Quit or Exit (instead they have an X floating off in space on the other side of the screen).Why would I put more time into this game?

												Magicka 1 and Magicka Wars are the real deal. This game is so bad that I will be short:- Render engine is not as fast as it should.- Funny quotes are not funny at all.- The story writer did a very bad job about immersing you into the experience. In fact the story is so bad that I don't remember anything while I still get every detail of what happened on Magicka 1.- Spells where diminished in power taking away that feeling of awesomeness wizardry.- Combat is just fine.- Bugs exist, and they were a real problem only the first month after release.- Characters depend much upon funny quotes. As the dialogue is not funny they were seriously affected even if they had potential.Given that the problematics of the game are rooted into the general gameplay mechanics there is not way I would recommend it in a future. The game cannot be fixed or improved because it's a game design issue.Sorry Paradox, you should have implemented the mobility of Wizard Wars, a compelling story and some funny lines. You failed in all that is required on a Single Player or Coop for Magicka. "

												where to start... well it was short.pros:-i liked the quick cast to a point, but it felt clunky.-liked being able to set my starting gear.-it was funny mostly.cons:-really short, i mean really. a friend and i took every opportunity to kill eachother and we still only took 6 hours.-i know i missed a lot of stuff but it surely felt like there was 1/2 or less of the items from the last game (even disreguarding the expansions)as a whole i feel let down. the puzzles were either really hidden, as in non discript terrain (remember in number one where there was special artwork made to hide every item, and when you found it you got a tingle because you felt like you were some kind of smart for finding it). i remember at one point we wound up just firehosing walls after finding an item in a log that looked exactly like all the rest. the jokes were not as good as the first one. i suppose if you're new to the series this probably wouldn't be considered a bad game. but it's always sad to see a premium first title and a rushed and self referencing second title. so i suppose, for those of you new to the series just go buy number one.

												This game is dull.  My friend and I got it to play together because it sounded like it could be fun; but we were very wrong.  The game, at first, seems alright.  The graphics are fine.  Nothing really stands out as being bad.  You go through a tutorial learning how the mechanics work.  Friendly fire is always a fun way to troll your friend (and boy do I like to troll my friend.) And the game is fun for the first couple of chapters.  But then it starts getting repetitive.  It's just you dealing with changing waves of monsters.  Over and over again.  You don't level up.  Your magic doesn't improve.  You don't find better loot.  (I mean, you do find new weapons/robes/staffs but they're not necesarilly stronger; they just may fit your play style better.) So My friend and I played one night together.  It was fun.  We played the next night together and it was still fun at first but by the end of that play session, we were bored of the game.  Only a few hours into the game.  The gameplay just isn't unique enough to be fun as is.  It's essentially ""spray magic elements"" at waves of enemies. You can get more advanced with your attacks.  You can put shields on yourself.  You can apply magic to you sword.  There are different combinations of magic you can cast and it can but fun to mess around with.  But it's all temporary.  It gets very tiring of having to recast the same magic over and over again.  There is a hot bar for quick access to some spells, but there should really be a customizable hotbar for your personal combos you like to make.  And to be fair, the lousy gameplay would be fine if it at least had a good story.  But it's not a good story.  It tries to be funny but fails.  It's filled with small references to everything but in a way that's just not funny.  More just random than anything.  By the end of our 2nd play session, we were just skipping the dialogue because it was absolutely pointless and a waste of time.So.  Boring gameplay. Dull story.  Terrible jokes.  (and not even the good kind that are still kinda funny like Dad jokes.  just really bad jokes.)  Would not reccomend.			"

												Compared to the first instance of Magicka, Magicka 2 is very disappointing.  While graphics are nice, the gameplay is horrible.For once, controls are more difficult to handle (e.g. once clicked on where to go, it follows through there until clicked elsewhere), which much easier leads to running into enemies or other obstacles as the controls are more indirect.On the other side, and that is the most annoying part, you get into situations where you are locked into a section of a level unable to escape and get uninterruptedly swarmed by enemies while simultaneously having to trigger something in order to leave the area.  This is very frustrating and makes the game impossible to achieve, at least when playing alone.  Not sure, if there are greater odds surviving such menaces with 3-4 players, but the game offers single player mode as well and it should be achievable without resorting to extreme keyboard and mouse-wrecking.  It is meant to be a game afterall.I do not mind challenges, but they should be achievable through normal means.  If required to frequently go through extremes, the game loses appeal and misses its goal.There is a reason games are considered entertainment material.  It should be enjoyable even for the average player.  Putting up impossible odds is sacrificing the game to become work.  For anyone looking for work, I would recommend the nearest work agency.  They will give you work where you even will earn money.ConclusionIf you enjoyed playing Magicka (the first game), do not waste your time and money on this game and stick to the original title.  Much more fun that way.			"

If you're coming from wizard wars this is a major let down.  Would have given a good review if they had added in warfare & deathmatch:(			"

												This game is not as awesome as Magicka 1, it's focused more heavily on countering damage types, and tends to be more action based, whereas in the first game you just had fun destroying everything in your way, while giving an occasional thought about different elements. This game also doesn't allow split screen unless you have some ex-boks controller, which I don't have, and is fairly punishing if you play alone.I recomennd you to buy the first game instead of this one.

												I liked magicka 2. It's a fun game. But if you played part 1, I wouldn't recommend playing part 2 unless you really liked the first game. Magicka 2 is basically just Magicka 1 with new levels.Pro'sUse a lot of different elementsVery unique gameplayFun to play with 1 or 2 playersHillarious accents and half-fake languages on NPC dialogueCon'sDoesn't bring anything new to the table compared to part 1; it's just new levelsThe hard mode isn't more challenging, mobs just have more HP/dmg output so they take longer to dieBecomes one big mess due to friendly fire with 3 or more playersCamera focus is terrible in multiplayer with 3 or more players, causing you to ""walk off screen"" and die a lotNew weapons you find througout the game aren't valuable at all; they look cool and then you quickly replace them with something usefulMagicka as a game series is a blast to play. It's unique system makes it a must-try-at-least-once kind of game. But once that lost it's shine, there's really nothing much more to it. The element magic is too complex to implement in another game, but in my opinion too shallow for a game to be built around it and even make a second game around it.			"

												So far the game lacks the promise that made the first Magicka such a success. The story line seems weaker this time but this is not what made me regret the $$$ i spent. All the stages have a repetitive pattern where you walk around calmly enjoying the landscape and laughing at the clever jokes on signs when suddenly all hell breaks loose and you have to fight past many enemies to get to the next stage where you do the exact same thing. Only thing that changes is the number of enemies and the possibility of adding a boss or 2 among them. The game is extremely difficult and somehow controls are a little laggy. You certainly do not have the time to combine spells and enjoy fights so you stick to the fire-arcane beamy things which are efficient 85% of the time (depending on your ability to guide them correctly because of the bad controls). This of course takes a lot out of the fun of combining elements. Bugs are also there as usual .... i found myself constantly dying from falling in an invisible hole. I also kept dying when some foes pushed me beyond the screen, I think there is a lot of room to improve but so far everything seems poor.			"

												This is the biggest disappointment since Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts. And at least that was a good game in its own right. This is just terrible.I was so excited. And it gradually dawned on me that the game had been completely gutted and dumbed down, to the point that it's essentially just running in a circle while an endless wave of crabs is spammed at you, hitting SSSSS shift+MMB (AoE death) over and over and over, healing when appropriate.  The game just has not been made with the same love that the first one was, There are hardly any weapons laying around.  The element system has been horribly maimed, no more QFQFQFAS or anything like that, like, if you want to electrosteambeam, you just can't.Wanna alt tab out for a second? Too bad, it'll mess up the graphics most of the time when you return.  The aiming is way off, your mouse'll be over somethings feet, and it'll be firing the beam way above it. Or you'll be telling them to walk to there, and instead they'll walk off the edge.I am disgusted at the utter lack of quality in this game. Magicka 1 was incredible. There were so many secrets, the levels didn't feel at all repetitive, the story was engaging, this poor excuse for a sequel is nowhere near worthy. I should definitely have checked the reviews before buying this. I trusted Paradox, that wont be happening again. They let a different studio develop this one, instead of being developed by Arrowhead Game Studios, the title was developed by Pieces Interactive.Pieces Interactive, as in they take important pieces of your beloved titles and chuck them in the bin because they can't be bothered.With a bit of work, they could bring it up to par, doing things like adding proper element mixing, fixing the controls, adding a LOT more secrets, adding a LOT more weapons laying around or pickupable around the worlds, and just generally caring about the game they made.Pieces Interactive, F*** ***.Magicka 2 is a waste of money.

												Put simply, it's Magicka if Magicka wasn't Magicka.The form is recognisable, many of the design elements familiar, but so much of the charm, pacing, OTT-fun and even narrative of the first game seems completely absent. It's not frantic, it's not intuitive, it's not hilarious. It's sluggish and balanced with no semblance of character and cheap references that go on too long or seem too random. Playing through this with friends, I was recording, and the first laugh we had was 49 minutes in. 49 minutes of play without a single giggle, in a Magicka game, where the first time the player uses their powers they should die horribly and unexpectedly. It seems like every little alteration to the game was made by chopping out or simplifying one of the things that gave the first game its unique character and it really, really shows. This is a smooth, balanced game, devoid of joy or absurdity and too invested in keeping itself streamlined to immerse you for more than a few seconds at a time (unfortunately, I'm not exaggerating there).It's ok, sure. Perhaps not to everyone's tastes, but definitely worth ¬£11. It's just not a good Magicka sequel, and if you enjoyed the first one at all, you will almost certainly be heartbroken by this. I wish I could use a weaker word, but honestly, it's 100% appropriate.Defining moment so far was hearing the Magicka end-of-level tune for the first time amid all the new tracks, and the first words on our Skype call were ""you have not earned the right to that music"".

												As a player of the first Magicka, with local coop in focus, I am really glad that they simplified the game and the controls to be suitable for gamepads as well.I know hardcore fans of the 1st game will argue that there is less variation in spells, but I totally see the developers intention to make a more accessible game, to make it more appealing to a casual audience (including me).I don't really understand the bad reviews, here are a few points:- less spell combinations? sure, but in exchange, the learning curve is not that steep- short campaign for some? sure, but there are challenge maps, trials, and a lot of DLC to come! If you are an early adopter, you should wait for these instead of complaining!- the graphics are a lot more crispier than in the first game, that's a huge + for me, it is really 60 FPS, and you don't even have to own a power plant- the humour is great, friendly fire is always funAs one commenter on the forums said:""Nevertheless it's still a decent game and people who haven't played the original Magicka won't notice any of these issues.""Absolutely true, don't be afraid to play, give this one a chance, it's only 15 EUR for full price.

Posted: May 31, 2015
												THIS IS NOT THE MAGICKA I FOUGHT DAEMONS FORHere's a trillion reasons why this game sucks.THE SPELLSThe spell system has been lobotomized - there are now no efficient ways of killing anything and the skill cap is barely half an inch off the ground. The whole point of getting good in Magicka was knowing good spells, improvisation and casting fast enough to heat the keyboard to thermonuclear levels. There is no fast casting now, everything is charged or channeled, even the damned mines have to lie there for a while before they are of any use. There are no good spells because every spell is equally pathetically weak now. There is no flexibility because no matter what you cast it just works the same, that is barely even works.Projectiles suck because you have to charge them for eternity to actually hurt anything.Charging mines suck because nobody ever used them as actual mines anyway.Fire sucks because everything regenerates and anything but focused fire does jack sh*t.Freezing sucks because frozen things are now stupidly hard to kill. Especially in singleplayer it's just unusable.Steam sucks because its only purpose was to boost lightning.Not being able to extinguish oneself while having water immunity sucks.Lightning sucks because it can't be added to beams. Arcanized lightnings have no sense, it's just adding plain, boring damage to a spell which already is all about damage. The whole point of adding arcane to lightning was increasing the range.THE ENEMIESThe enemies suck too. They shifted from crowds of cannon fodder to being the freaking Terminator. The goblins in Magicka 1 were not there to be a threat, but to be bombarded with fireballs and run around screaming in a kinaesthetically pleasing way. The trolls, orcs, beholders, mages and all the rest - they were the real enemy. Now not only the trolls, but also the regular soldiers, the goblins and even the damned peasants are made of kevlar. You're no longer a powerful wizard, you're an idiot in a bathrobe throwing colorful lights at things.The enemies are also really boring, you fight the same generic dudes in pointlessly fancy armor and glowing weapons 90% of the time. The other 10% is bugs. Magicka 1 had orcs, daemons, dwarves, bugs, undead and several tricky monsters too. There are no cool bosses either. Where is the Reaper, the Fafnir, the Jormungandr of this game? Only the final boss is actually interesting.Everybody has elemental attacks too. I get this was supposed to make the game more challenging, but instead it's just annoying because it DECREASES THE CONTROL THE PLAYER HAS OVER THEIR WIZARD. 90% of the time you're trying not to be burning, wet, chilled, on the ground or in the air just for a freaking second instead of ACTUALLY FIGHTING. There is no way to defend from the bombardment of annoying crowd control attacks, because the shields and armors barely block anything now, the walls are weak and the auras only really protect from one element.Except from the disruptor magick, which blocks casting, in a game built entirely around casting, and so just pointlessly stretches the fight.Enemies have way too much health too, killing them is just slow and tedious, especially and lower difficulties. Adding a weakness to one element fixes nothing because it rewards using the same one or two spells over and over again.THE GEARThe eqipment sucks. Magicka 1 had a helload of weapons which were mainly here just for sh*ts and giggles. Most of them were useless and that's why obtaining a strong weapon felt like an achievement. Now every weapon is close to useless because of the balance this game never needed. The robes suck as well. Magicka 1 had robes for everyone - some were there just for the looks (if you wanted to look sleek without any side effects), others could change the game completely. Magicka 2 robes just shuffle around some resistances and that's it. They're also not as varied and crazy as Magicka 1 robes.The magicks suck. They can't be cast in quick succession anymore, further reducing the reward from memorizing and learning to cast quickly while also slowing the game down. There's too few of them too. Magicka 1 allowed to completely change the playstyle just by using some magicks one normally doesn't.THE CONTROLSThe ""click to go"" movement sucks, it feels unresponsive and more like Diablo than the top down shooter Magicka is supposed to be. It's also annoying when you automatically send your wizard into a crowd of enemies just because you put the cursor on them to aim better.The menu sucks, it's not ergonomic at all on PC.NON-GAMEPLAY THINGSThe humor sucks because there barely is any in the latter half of the game.Even the world sucks. Gicka 1's Midgard was a simple and full of cliches old enough not to be annoying anymore. It had barbaric orcs, sneaky goblins, evil warlocks and ugly demons. It was simultaneously a parody and a pastiche of classical fantasy from before WoW.Gicka 2's Midgard is made of modern cliches, with all of its generic not-scifi-at-all magitek, overdesigned scenery and characters (which were there since TOSotC, also by the new developer) and the SUPER RAD ORIGINAL fantasy race in the form of Vanir. The Vanir suck especially hard, the game is just busy pretending they are really cool. I bet someone in the plot department likes them waaaaaaay too much.Arcane being called death sucks. Everybody now uses death magic, the good guys, the bad guys, the morally ambiguous guys. Death also seems to act as the generic magical energy for some reason. The new death spells are supposed to sound ghastly, which is way less satisfying than the PEW PEW PEW of arcane. And there is no more artificial vs natural contrast of arcane vs life, which was way more interesting than just life and death.And why do all the soldiers have female voices? Is this some kind of a logic defying matriarchy?And why is Khan a freaking woman? It's not even a joke. It's just a huge, buff, fat orc who gets called warlady because f*ck this game i quit.I probably forgot about some things.			"

												It's the same ham-fisted approach to balancing that made Diablo 3 one of the shortest-lived online RPGs.Games shouldn't be designed like this. It never works when the player is balanced; it's only fun when the game is balanced around an OP player.They've removed steam and ice elements, which means that for each kind of projectile, there are only two-three combos to make. It's ridiculously watered-down. There's nothing to learn. You can hardly even kill yourself in this game.Completely misses the mark; doesn't understand what made the original game so much fun.			"

												I'll say now, I‚Äôm glad I paid the $25 for the deluxe even though it‚Äôs not released yet. I played through all of the Sneak Peak on the highest difficulty (Banana), got all the unlockables (so far), and I cannot wait for more. ""Killing your friends? You‚Äôre doing it right!"" was the moto for the first game, this one is much more 'team-based' for the harder modes (which isn‚Äôt a bad thing!) It allows you to enjoy your first time around just doing whatever, whether it be killing your friends, to healing or helping the minions and then killing your friends.. The next few times through (I‚Äôve found) that you look for the unlockables... then kill your friends. And as you increase the difficulty it becomes more and more team based and you actually need to think about the correct answer to solving a puzzle. The first Magicka game set the bar high for the ones to come (MWW and this) and so far I‚Äôm liking M2 so much it‚Äôs going to break my rating scale... But, this game did have 2 down sides when playing it... The first on being, at Banana Mode you need to work WITH friends (and if you've caught on you'll know I don‚Äôt have the best of times doing that) the second being that the replayability factor is a little low for me... After beating it on each difficulty and unlocking all the unlocks, and even beating challenge mode with friends its really only replayable if you haven‚Äôt beat it... (Ignoring than that singular factor I‚Äôd give this game 9001/10 but seeing how much it really means to have that replayability (and believe me the comedic part of the game almost won me over and looked past the replayability..) I‚Äôm going to rate it at 9/10 because of the replayability, but there is so much good comedy and features I almost want to look past the replayability.. Really... But hey, that‚Äôs just my theory, a GAME... oh wait.. If you get the game than Im sure you'll love it!			"

												Pain gives this game an eh/10. All the technical aspects of the game have worked fine for me with the exception of alt+tab crashing it. the story line is also nice, it made me laugh a few times, but it wasnt bad. But game play wise, it just doesn't feel as fun as it should be. Spell casting should be the most fun part of this game, but tbh it feels clunky, dumbed down and the spells themselves dont feel like they have much weight behind them, specifically charge spells and the earth element.  Most of the time while actually using the earth element i found myself not being sure if the charge was done before i got fire it. Which brings me to another point, charge times for spells are ridiculously long. This also goes for the AOE spells, as even fully powered up the area they affect doesn't grow, it just stays the same and does a little bit more damage than a smaller spell would have. The only magick that has a decent AOE range is lightning, but thats just because it jumps from target to target. Ice and water combo spells also felt pretty useless for most of the game, as when you freeze an enemy, you cant damage them, making it feel like a waste of time to use. On a more positive note, healing is REALLY useful now, as you can move and heal yourself at the same time.  And a personal gripe, the lightning beam and the push from the first game are gone and it makes me sad. Also with the charge push element being gone and being made into a spell, getting large groups of enemys away from you is MUCH harder, if not near impossible without the use of water aoe, as the knockdown from the earth element aoe isnt as strong as it once was, and is pretty much useless. Also the Artifacts are a bit of a letdown. They dont really change much about the game aside from making it harder or changing how the faeries work. TL;DR: FEELS LIKE THEY TRIED TO MAKE A DIABLO STYLE GAME FROM A MOBA AND DIDNT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DIFFERENCES			"

Not sure about the Magicka system yet, but I guess it's just a case of getting used to it.The control system for spells is different, but to be honest, I think it is more intuitive and alot more accurate than the old system, I used to find I would sometimes pick the wrong element in the first game, but this is easier to get what you want. I play with an Xbox controller by the way. I would reccomend a gamepad of some description for this game though.			"

												Magicka was a great game(besides unable to beat the final boss at first, as the game kept crashing) and so far Magicka 2 its going to be as fun, but limited. Things I like, the Magicka quick bar, customization of your Wizard, Wizard comedy, secret 'rooms' and the new movement mechanic. Things I don't like is that the old precedence of elements is no more, I use to Use Rasa (cold+lightning+Arcane) alot and shout it out every time, disturbing my neighbors in process. It use to be that any spray typed element (including steam and lightning) was used with Arcane/Life (and without earth or shield) it would create a beam effect spell, now rasa has a lightning effect, sort of destroyed my signature move. Another thing i don't like about the  new spell mechanic is that when you are making steam, fire and water don't collapse into one icon, and really limits  the number of spells you can do. You can't do Lightning and steam/ice anymore, i think the longest spell in magicka was 10 elements (if u did steam or ice 5 times) now in magicka 2 at most its 5 of anything and if we tried to emulate the 10 element limit from previously at most you could only make 2 steams and one other element that isnt lightning/cold. The last thing is that dry casting no longer pushes, i know they have created the push Magicka to replace it and its on your quickbar, but there's a time limit between uses, probably to make it unspammable although before u had to charge it up for it to be any bit effective.(although now i think about it still may knock enemies down), but the absence of it feels like a phantom limb, or a gun without bullets, and missing the option of still throwing the gun at someone. I still haven't tested if you can recharge shields still, but i would think so. Its still a good game and I'll just have find a new signature move(or complain long enough for them to bring back the old system), and maybe get over the lack of spam pushing people or the ability to do so, but the limited spells you can do is dangerously close in becoming a nail in the coffin ;p I don't know if that choice was from Wizard wars to balance PVP, but Magicka 2 isn't sole PVP and old system should be brought back, although i can find a way to explain it in story, that magick as well the wizards have faltered from the times of Magicka, but it still feels like a copout. I still think the new additions of quickbar for magicks and the ability to move and cast as well as the others things i mentioned that i like are good additions to the game, and somewhat negate the minor negatives. I still expect and sense a great story and humor to come so i will give Magicka 28/10 - the spell system just knocked this down for me, and I thought it was just part of the Sneak peak demo and would have changed by releaseWell back to playing for me "

												A sequel should add to the experience, not take away. There are so many things that Magicka 2 lacks compared to the first one which makes it not very enjoyable to someone who loved the craziness of Magicka. The changes in Magicka 2 seem to be appealing to a people who are use to MOBAs or more casual gameplay. I've found three main things that makes Magicka 2 feel this way to me: Cooldowns, Non-combining elements, and Streamlined feel. I'm sure I'm missing some things, but these are the main issues I had with Magicka 2.Cooldowns: Remember spamming Conflageration to deal massive damage to crowds? How about raising an army of zombies and elemental guardians? With Cooldowns on the spells, these can no longer happen. This makes the game artificially more difficult rather than naturally. In Magicka 1, learning how to execute spells quickly and accurately allowed you to be much more successful while feeling like a true wizard. Cooldowns and having a hotbar for instantly casting them takes away from the challenge of memorizing spells so you can cast the right spell as quick as possible. I think ifthe developer made it so you could have up to 7 elements on your hotbar, it would allow for a lot more interesting element combinations as setting up for some really strong spells for those who are capable of executing them. Non-Combining Elements: WIth elements like frost/water or fire/water not becoming ice or steam in the casting bar not only makes spells shorter and simpler, it can be confusing for new players to the series. When casting a spell that requires making steam, having a visual icon show up when the right elements combine lets the player know they have it set up. When casting complex spells, that icon also helps to show you you've cast the elements in the right order. It was an unnecessary change that really impacts the gameplay.Streamlined Feel: They made this game feel sort of like an RPG with the addition of a progression system.The progression system lets players unlock items like robes and weapons as they play. It lets players unlock more items without paying money. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, in fact it's one of the things I like about Magicka 2. My issue is with what they took out of the customization along with how the menus feel. Something seemed off about it when I first saw the menu, and it reminded me of games some critics review which are actually ports. After a while I realized it reminded me heavily of a mobile port due to the giant buttons and fonts.I was a little worried, but I continued on to the single player anyway. My favorite part of Magicka was the variety of robes and colors for them, and I was excited to see how Magicka 2 did the customization. When I got to the wizard customizer, at first it looked great, but then I clicked on the colors. There are only around 6 different colors to choose from compared to the great number in Magicka 1. They also won't let you change your name once you've picked one for your wizard. (Oh well I guess). The lack of robes and weapons I could understand since it just came out. It's not all terrible. The movement system is a little more dynamic now since you can move and cast spells at the same time. The progression system is nice as well. There's just so many other things that make the sequel feel lacking compared to the first. It's a shame a great classic has such a lacking sequel.			"

												---Addendum---It's been a while since I've played Magicka 2 last...and I've played it less than thirty hours...I guess I lost interest in Magicka 2 really fast. That caught me by surprise.As it turns out, I had applauded Magicka 2 for making experimental spellcasting more enticing by removing power-combos, but in reality experimental spellcasting had actually been made less viable in Magicka 2 than it was in Magicka. Enemies are simply too aggressive; they descend on players too fast to make anything but the most efficient and effective spell combos have sufficient impact. This is especially true on anything higher than normal difficulty, when enemy health regeneration comes into effect -- they're either killed instantly or recover as the next spell is prepared.Perhaps even more greviously, enemy variety is simply poor. A grand majority of the enemies you'll fight will be the same type you fight for the entire level. On top of that, enemy types are also recycled over several levels. Enemies are tiresome to face instead of exciting, and that's never a good sign for a game.Combine those two together, and the game becomes a chore after one, maybe two playthroughs.Maybe DLC is worth it, but...I'm changing my recommendation.---Original Review---This game gets mixed reviews for good reason. It is, in general, a very good game, but the changes made going into Magicka 2 ended up cannibalizing some of the things that made the original Magicka so unique and popular in the first place.For veterans of Magicka, there's two big differences between the first game and Magicka 2: Magicka 2 is faster paced, and balanced. Enemies move faster, close in from more angles, and tank more damage. Magicks have a cooldown (yes, even when using the elemental combination instead of the new quick-cast), and the power spells from Magicka don't have the oompf they had anymore. In return, we, the wizards, are also made far more mobile -- we can move while sustaining spells, and none of the magicks lock us in place for several seconds. The days of sitting in one spot and spamming awesome magicks like Lightning Bolt stay in the first Magicka.To some people -- myself included -- this was actually a very good development. I really, really liked the spellcasting mechanics from Magicka, and I liked calling up different elements and experimenting with combinations. However, I found it discouraging that certain combinations (steam + steam + arcane + lightning + lightning) were clearly overpowered and could sweep through the entire game. The new balance in Magicka 2 makes most all spell combos powerful in one area, but near-useless in others. It rewards players who experiment frequently -- I like that.However, the Ying-to-the-Yang here is that, a lot of the charm of Magicka was how absurdly powerful we were as wizards. Enemies did piddling damage, and died quicker and in greater numbers than we did; there were few points in the game, aside from boss battles, where AI enemies were legitimate threats. Rather, Magicka was balanced around how spells didn't discriminate between caster and target, and killing ourselves was just as easy. Heck, that was the biggest defining feature of Magicka -- the biggest threat is ourselves and our friends. That's gone; in Magicka 2, enemies don't just die helplessly in waves anymore. They're dangerous from the early chapters, and will kill us just as easily as ourselves. Some people might enjoy the extra challenge, but I'm sure as many people enjoyed the juxtaposition between ourselves and the mostly-harmless world of Magicka.Also, yes, Magicka 2 isn't nearly as funny as the original. The land of Midgard in Magicka 2 lacks any of the special details that Magicka so lovingly put in -- tongue-in-cheek humor is replaced by straight-faced presentation, and subtle nods to pop-culture are replaced with blatant ""Hay i maed a jok e"" attempts at references. Top that off with how the balanced spell system prevents those crazy, outlandish moments that only a backfiring uber-spell (or a bug) can provide. The humor in Magicka 2 took a definite hit, and unlike the spell balance, there wasn't really a trade-off -- it's just lesser.Another thing of worthwhile note, is that currently (Late November 2015), the number and range of effects from robes, staves, and weapons is minimal. This might change later with DLC, but right now, all the special stat effects are at tame, safe levels.In the end, then, Magicka 2 comes down to the spellcasting mechanic. If you liked its potential in Magicka, you'll probably love the work done to expand spellcasting in Magicka 2. If it was rather the laugh-out-loud moments that kept you playing Magicka, either through the satirical humor or the variety of absurd baubles and booms...I would wager that, yes, you will end up being disappointed.Myself, I do enjoy Magicka 2. Even in single-player, I found Magicka's unique spellcasting system too much fun, and the enhanced balance in Magicka 2 gives me even more reason to play around with it some more.			"

												I WOULD recommend this game... But not for $15.This game feels like a $5 game instead. Here are some pros and cons from my perspective:+ PROS:+ Very fun in multiplayer (Friendly fire adds to the fun)+ Great spell combos and chaos+ Effects that look like eye candy+ Hard to master but fun to play- CONS:- VERY VERY VERY short story. (7 to 10 MAX hours to complete)- Once you're done with the story, you can either join someone else with their story playthrough or download DLCsMy main concern was the story. It's too short... I was definetly loving this game for $11 (on‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• but then... I finished the campaign and immediatly felt a sort of remorse. ""I spend $11 on this?? That's it??"".I felt a bit robbed because, now that I've finished the game in 9 hours... I have nothing to do.TL;DRVery fun game.Very very short story.Don't recommend for $15.If it's for $5, pick it up.			"

												My review so far: (Single Player)the Spell Combination from Magicka 1 often did not work:-   Water+Fire is NOT Steam, -   Water+Snow is NOT ICE)-   Electricity + Arcane (which is now called different - Death or something) is NOT a Beam that provides Electricity Damage, its simply a ""red"" Electricity ""Storm""The Health is drastically lowered.The Enemies deal more damage (on NORMAL Difficulty)The Enemies are more fasterThe Healing spell heals a to small Amount of Life-    1time: 17 Lifepoints - just about 5x 94 Points. All thought sometimes 300 - i still don't get this...??-    so the Most Times i run and heal myself instead of Casting a Spell on the EnemiesThe game Interface is way too big, and is placed sub-optimal -    I often click on the Interface, instead of a place on the World, and - also because of the other things - i die really often.-    (Please place it in the Corner instead of the place is it now and make it 20-30% smaller !!!! - i play on 2560x1440)The  ""Shield + Rock"" Spell combination that provided protection from Physical Damage is just Weak.... You need to make the Earth 4 times combined with the Shield to be secure for some ""seconds""Maybe it gets easier over time and i will change my mind, but for now i regret i bought the game. Its just 2 frustrating. @ this point, i cannot reccomend the game to the others. Sry.The Positive things....The World looks more detailed, and there are more variations of enemies.			"

												Enjoying it so far :)Some of the spells being changed is annoying, but not game breaking, just means you have to come up with some new ways to kill your pals erm, I mean enemies. Not sure about the Magicka system yet, but I guess it's just a case of getting used to it.The control system for spells is different, but to be honest, I think it is more intuitive and alot more accurate than the old system, I used to find I would sometimes pick the wrong element in the first game, but this is easier to get what you want. I play with an Xbox controller by the way. I would reccomend a gamepad of some description for this game though.			"

												Magicka was a great game(besides unable to beat the final boss at first, as the game kept crashing) and so far Magicka 2 its going to be as fun, but limited. Things I like, the Magicka quick bar, customization of your Wizard, Wizard comedy, secret 'rooms' and the new movement mechanic. Things I don't like is that the old precedence of elements is no more, I use to Use Rasa (cold+lightning+Arcane) alot and shout it out every time, disturbing my neighbors in process. It use to be that any spray typed element (including steam and lightning) was used with Arcane/Life (and without earth or shield) it would create a beam effect spell, now rasa has a lightning effect, sort of destroyed my signature move. Another thing i don't like about the  new spell mechanic is that when you are making steam, fire and water don't collapse into one icon, and really limits  the number of spells you can do. You can't do Lightning and steam/ice anymore, i think the longest spell in magicka was 10 elements (if u did steam or ice 5 times) now in magicka 2 at most its 5 of anything and if we tried to emulate the 10 element limit from previously at most you could only make 2 steams and one other element that isnt lightning/cold. The last thing is that dry casting no longer pushes, i know they have created the push Magicka to replace it and its on your quickbar, but there's a time limit between uses, probably to make it unspammable although before u had to charge it up for it to be any bit effective.(although now i think about it still may knock enemies down), but the absence of it feels like a phantom limb, or a gun without bullets, and missing the option of still throwing the gun at someone. I still haven't tested if you can recharge shields still, but i would think so. Its still a good game and I'll just have find a new signature move(or complain long enough for them to bring back the old system), and maybe get over the lack of spam pushing people or the ability to do so, but the limited spells you can do is dangerously close in becoming a nail in the coffin ;p I don't know if that choice was from Wizard wars to balance PVP, but Magicka 2 isn't sole PVP and old system should be brought back, although i can find a way to explain it in story, that magick as well the wizards have faltered from the times of Magicka, but it still feels like a copout. I still think the new additions of quickbar for magicks and the ability to move and cast as well as the others things i mentioned that i like are good additions to the game, and somewhat negate the minor negatives. I still expect and sense a great story and humor to come so i will give Magicka 28/10 - the spell system just knocked this down for me, and I thought it was just part of the Sneak peak demo and would have changed by releaseWell back to playing for me "

												Video Review and Impressions:


YouTube‚Ñ¢ Video: In My Humble Opinion... Magicka 2¬†

			Views: 615		

			The Commissar plays the highly anticipated sequel to Magicka... Magicka 2: Learn to Spell Again! Right off the bat, there is definitely a difference between this Magicka and the first one but that is...		

I loved the original Magicka and Wizard Wars was pretty good for a MOBA and they both had unique game styles in terms of spell casting and control. Although, WW felt like it dumbed down the spell variety considerably compared to the base game of Magicka. This game tries to simplify (I think) the gameplay from the first and it ends up feeling like a mix of Wizard Wars and Magicka's playstyles. There are definitely improvements, for example, the more responsive middle mouse button but it still doesn't feel better than the first game's controls. Oh and it sucks that you can't combine to make ICE anymore. It's cool that you can move while casting now which makes soloing the game easier but the movement can feel really floaty at times or that your character is sliding around on ice so again it doesn't feel as good as the original. It seems they tried waaay too hard to cater to the console crowd.However, despite these complaints. I believe the game stands up on it's own and is still a great game. Honestly, it feels a so different from the first one, it's hard to really compare it indefinitely to the original. The humor is still humorous, the story is still good, and there are plenty of outfits and unlockables to be found throughout the game... Seriously, I can't get over how much there is to find in the game... from one liners and pop culture references just as hilarious as you would expect and new weapons and staffs dot every single chapter I've played so far.  Another nice touch, is the Artwork for every cutscene and the improved graphics... not that the other games were ever lacking in that department. All in all, I definitely recommend this game and can already see how much fun it's going to be playing with friends. Now I've gonna go blow up some Yellow Wizards.			"

												I don't understand that negative comments.I think that the game is great.The game is full of fun and jokes. Plus the way your party suddenly dies, because of some crazy spell combo is just hilarious.Online works like a charm. I was expecting some technical errors/not working servers, but nothing of that happend. Just select chapter, click join and you get within 5 second into game with some other people. However I can't imagine playing it solo, it's pretty hard to solo. In party of 2 the fun really begins a when you play with 3 or 4 people, it's just great fun. No lags, no stutters, just great experience.The graphics looks great. Nice effects, beautiful and different zones. I don't know what are some talking about ""not optimalized"" and other nonsense, but with my i5 4460 and 750Ti I got the game nice and smooth 60fps all on best settings. There is a lot of replayability because of the artifacts and also there are ""challenge missions"". Yep, there is no option to change key bindings, however the binds are just OK and 99% of people won't have any problems with it. For that 15‚Ç¨, it's really nice price for a game like this.			"

												I played Magicka 1 and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it local co-op with my friends.Magicka 2 is not as bad as most reviews state it to be, I use a controller, so I have no say to those who uses keyboard and mouse, but the controller needs some time to get used to, which is what the prologue did for me, learnt all the new casting mechanics from the prologue. so, in short:Pros:+Graphics+More wizard gear variety including voice options+More stuff to unlock along the storyline+Players can enter and leave during game+Still humorous+Better casting mechanics for controller+detailed description of difficulty settingsCons:-Less magic variety, as you can't combine water+fire icons into steam icons, resulting less variety of combos-Slow charge time for full projectile speed (But you can just look at it as making it more challenging)Will be updated in the future when I have more time to play with my friends. For now, its much recommended, people are just too used to magicka 1 and could not adapt to the new style and mechanics of the game, get yourself a controller perhaps, and many problems might go away.

												I understand the game is being a bit of a let down to people, I've experience it myself first hand, but there is potentially room for improvement (should Paradox be kind enough). There are a few things, however, that stick out like a sore thumb.First: MovementThe mouse controls in the first game were fantastic and allowed the player to move about easier. They also felt really grounded and not like your trying to run on an ice skating rink. The new controls have a really mmo feel; you click and your character moves there. I guess some people might like that, but after playing the heck out of the first I can't work with that. I've died many time simply from walking into a spell due to my character finishing up their movement. This brings us to the next issue:Second: DifficultyMagicka 1 was hard. It was hard but still fun, kinda like how Dark Souls is punishing as heck, but still manages to lure people back again. Magicka 2 kinda pulls a cheap knife to the gut when your sitting drinking cocoa. It's not cool. The situation can go from 3 enemies to ""Oh Jesus my game is moving at two frames-per-second there are so many enemies"". This makes the single player kind of tedious, and for a game built around both single and multiplayer this is a really big drawback.Third: SpellsEverything is still there... kind of. Arcane is now called death. I guess that makes sense, takes away from the wizardy feel though, as we as the change of how some of the spells work; Arcane lightning is now a splash attack instead of a beam, and rocks now need unnaturally large amounts of charge to go nowhere. And now there's a quickcast feature that removes the fun(?) of memorizing spells and belting them out as fast as you could type.All in all, Paradox has essentially handed us Wizard Wars with a story mode. Most of us payed for Magicka the sequal, better graphics and new story edition, not mmo/moba wizard style. So if you have no want for something like what I've stated you might as well leave, but hey everyone else who wants to hop on the hope train we have plenty of seats open. I'm betting Paradox will see all these reviews and fix up some of the stuff vexing the fans, and make the game the masterpiece it was meant to be. That's why I'm going to go ahead and thumbs it up anyways. Yeah, Hope!P.S. Casting ice on water is broken and makes you bounce around like a trampoline, fix this please it makes some of the areas unexplorable.			"

												Controls are slightly different from magicka 1, should take you about 5 minutes to adjust and no longer notice it, you have the option of using the magick system from magicka 1 or from wizard wars or using a pleasant combination of both. the overpowered steam lightning combo is gone meaning you actually have options for what spells to cast instead of only that stupid death beam.almost all negative reviews are either based of incorrect information or people complaining they can't steam lightning any more. the game is good, slightly different from magicka 1 but if you enjoyed the first magicka, you should enjoy this one.other complaints are difficulty of single player, i have thus far encountered little to no difficulty up to and including the last boss. as mentioned before you just have to get it out of your head that you only need to use one spell.

												Magicka 2 is a very fun game, but still one I cannot recommend.  Why? Simply because Magicka 1 is so much better.I am not hating any of the design choices in Magicka 2, and I like the new graphics, new controls, new everything. The problem is that there is hardly anything really new. This feels more like a remake of Magicka 1 than a sequel. You use the same spells and face same enemies as you did in Magicka 1. Except that there was 2-3x more of everything in Magicka 1... The variation in stages is lacking in 2 too, you mostly see fantasy forests and few small fantasy towns, when in Magicka 1 you go through all kinds of environments and face all sort of bosses.Magicka 2 is also overly balanced imho. You dont need to think about wacky spell combinations, as pretty much everything does the same damage. You just use the basic spells and if enemy is immune to it, you use another basic spell instead. It doesnt encourage you to use harder combos like Magicka 1 did.Anyway, the game is fun, but besides graphics I would call this Magicka 1 and Magicka 1 should be called 2. "

												Worst controls EVER! Not only is casting a spell awkward, moving around is near impossible. I click for the guy to go straight and he falls into a bottomless pit on the left. The game crashes if too much happens on screen, and a lot of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•will happen on scree, so you'll have to restart the entire level all over. Then the enemies get the ability to grab you the second you revive and throw you OFF SCREEN WHERE YOU INSTANTLY DIE! I was willing to tolerate the horrible controls but when I have to restart the game, deal with ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t enemies, and dialog that can only be understood through subtitles wrapped up in a story that's basically a bad comedy just pisses me off.Save yourself from a headache and avoid this thing.

Then they made magicka wiazrd wars wich in my opinion was like ten steps back from the base game. You had less spell queue spots, lighting was completely different not bad but different. shields became relative useless on thier own... it just wast a good game. and this one right here follwed right in the foot steps of the idiot brother Magicka wizard wars.

												I dont like the fact that i cant change my name and it was very short and always crashes on me. If im spending $14.99 for a game and i cant even do something as simple as changing my name.. thats pretty sad and id rather play Magicka 1 cause this is very short and is really just an expansion of Magicka 1..  to put it simple, i didnt enjoy my experience at all			"

												Just finished Magicka 2 in 5 hours, if you are a fan of the original Magicka this is a must buy. However, this games mechanics are closer to Magicka Wizard Wars than Magicka 1 but i got the hang of it after awhile. Overall it does have its problems such as elements not adding up and the more enemies attacking you at once. The pros arrive in the story aspect where every game is linked together (which is not seen in most 'indie' games) making the story feel more real and more involving to the player. If you are a fan of Magicka 1 and didn't mind Wizard Wars get this game, trust me there was more similarities to Wizard Wars than Magicka 1; if you are thinking about buying this game make sure you have played Magicka 1 and atleast tried Wizard Wars to get a grip on the movement (for god sake its FREE). Magicka 2 gets: 9/10			"

												I understand this game is kinda getting yelled at by the magicka 2 veterans, and I played much of magicka 1 myself, but i really enjoy this game. Sure you cant combine spells to make 1 spell type anymore but i feel this game has a lot more of those magicks spells, with the whole haste and conjure rain stuff. After playing around an hour of this I still really enjoy this game and I'm sure this would be way more fun with friends. I'm still very sure people will enjoy this game. As settings wise, I didnt see anything wrong with the controls. I just really enjoy this game and don't let all the negative reviews fool you.			"

												This game is chaotic fun. The biggest issue is that it can be quite frustrating for some people due to friendly-fire/damage. When there are multiple players... they will kill each other numerous times.The game maker doesn't need to eliminate the friendly fire but instead... they need to add the option to disable friendly damage. With that disabled... they could still allow friendly effects like water to put out a fire, healing, etc.			"

Learn to Spell Again ? more like spam heal and arcane over and over till everything is dead, why do anything else they take out spells and abilitys from 1 and replaced it with nothing. Boss fights where boring if you can even call it that especally the last boss what a joke, i wanted a harder game then one but all i got was a dumbed down verison of 1 with half the content. i say only buy this game?

												Well i have just been playing it for 10 mins, been through the tutorial. I must say the game is awesome but, thus far some cons. Ofcourse ill explain some pros as well.Cons:- compared to the first one u can no longer combine certain elements, for example Q and R (water and snow) no longer become one spell Ice, instead they hold up 2 seperate spell slots.- As far as i seen now the tweaking of settings in gameplay is very limited. Walking now is click and walk to it, little like moba style games. So for those of u who have played magicka 1 know that this is a problem (at least it is for me) if you hold down the mouse to walk and you let go cuz u encounter something ur charachter will keep walking that direction.- Water and Electricity do no longer combine.- Some small sound bugs i encountered during the tutorial (for example healing ur self in spamming matter)Pros:-Awesome graphics-Great humor from the start-Costumizable charachters-Rocks do now bounce-Artificats to change how the game works in terms of difficulty thus making it fun to start over-Something different you can select then just the fairy as your companion.-Weapons, staffs and robes are unlockables which u can find throughout the game and unlocking them for you to equip any time.-Overall feel of the game despite the cons i written above is still pretty darn good.Gameplay (thusfar) 8/10Setting tweakability 2/10Music 9/10graphics 8/10 Would i recommend this game? Definitely, looks fun, feels fun and sounds fun. If you enjoyed the first i would definetily recommend you check this one out as well. **EDIT**retracting my last review.. finished the game just now with a buddy final verdict story 3/10 couldnt follow it properlygameplay 4/10 alot of spell combos have been impossible basicly forcing u to use SFSFS all the timeWould i recommend getting this game.. No... i would not**EDIT			"

												My first Impression:Bad PC-Port. Please more contribution to the PC version and less to the PS4 version.Not a bad game at all, but Magicka 1 was definetly better.IF you are new to Magicka, buy Magicka 1.IF you are an old Magicka player, stay at 1st game.Final review:+ Pro-Story-Vlad, no Vampire-Magicka Things like Easter Eggs-Graphics (unnecessary but still quite)- Contra-No Free use of Magicks-Gameplay (f.e. Fighting Slowdown compared to M1, because of Controller)-Port Problems (f.e. Navigation in Menus)-Character Equip Change Possibility before every new Chapter (old System worked better because it was more fun to play in fear of loosing your Sword, and so on)-PORT-Game's Main Platform should be PC and not PS4So, the game is a good game. But the gameplay due to PS4 Port is quite bad and it ruins the fun while playingGreetings from a disappointed ""Paradox Fanboy""			"

												Not many changes compared to the first Magicka. The whole gameplay follows the same formula: deal damage - die - resurrect. Rinse, repeat.The story is still very cheesy. The bosses are all identical. And most of the time you simply run around a small area and kill swarms of enemies the game throws at you. Deal damage - die - resurrect. Rinse, repeat. Some developers never learn from their mistakes... B-O-R-I-N-G!			"

												Hi guys,dont buy this if you have played Magicka 1. It is different, not good different, BAD different, the spell looks BAD, the styl of walking is BAD the style of game is bad. I have played only 10-15 minutes, and i need to refund, Magicka ''1'' is totally better, If you are deciding to buy Magicka ''1'' or Magicka 2, on 100% buy 1. I think Magicka 2 is not bad game, but 1 is totally better. "

												Anonymous Review 1 - *Blablabla Magicka 1's better than 2*Anonymous Review 2 - *Blablabla Magicka 2's better than 1*Look, if any reviewers feel targeted to those lines, you better to look what I would need to write for this game, okay?!I only played mostly 4 hours total, ALONE (no team party), in this game, so my experiences with others players is considered to be absent. Due to the lack of a few hours, I do write this review only about what I got with my experience only in this game and testing it. Are we agreed on that? Yes (I know people will say ""No"" there)? Then let's continue!Magicka 2 has its own similarities with Magicka 1: You play a wizards which you go in an adventure armes only with your staff, a melee weapon (usually) and, off course, your elemental spells.The spell mechanic got a change if we compare between the first and second game. I could even say quite a nerf too. For me, I really do think it was needed. Why? Because, with my whole experiences  with Magicka 1 with both Solo and Multiplayer modes, that 5 element casting (Ice (Frost/Water), Lightning, Arcane, Defense and Frost - For example) was, in sort, ultimatly destructive, overpower (i mean it there) and a royal friendly killer. It was so powerful to the point that if you barely touch those ice spikes, it means a certain Death to yourself too. I don't count about doing that to your friends either.Anyhow, with that nerf kinda fusion spell, us, the ancient players from Magicka 1, needed to see the new functionality with the spell system. Even if the title seems like a joke, ""Learn to Spell Again"", it litterally puts us to learn the new system, re-experiencing anew. Some players enjoyed it. Some others don't. For me, I liked it. It was a good thinking to check and learn new possibilities of spells, to be more effective while doing something less harmless to your friends! I think this is where the Paradox Team wanted us to do. I know when I played Magicka 1 back in time, I made one of my friend to rage quit the game fully because of those combinations. I think the nerf would simply to make that everyone needs to do something together to win. Isn't what Coop means, by the way when you do play this game?What about Solo then, if ask about it? Remember that sometimes, you need to go more on the defensive rather than the offensive. You can, with your spells, to go in an aggressive defense: Using harm spells to protect yourself. Make a barrier of rock or a wall of cloudy frost! Do something to try to stop your enemies (Crowd Control everyone?). That system puts us to think which kind of spell we need to cast and that is, for me, an improvement. We do get out of the 1-2-3 button combo build that it was in Magicka 1, in sort.Another thing I think it is an improvement is the equipements. At least we can equip our wizard with the stuff we unlock by playing the game. Quite balanced, you can make a wizard of your own thought: You can be a wizard that it is good with Arcane element but your Life element will be reduced for its effectiveness. They, the Paradox team, really don't want to see us becoming an overpower Rambo wizard (Yes we kill everythings on sight, but that's not what kind of Rambo I mean there). Then again, you need to play the game fully to get everything unlocked, even the support spells too. They are maybe less, but I am sure Magicka 2 will get more with the DLC like Magicka 1 did.The humor between 1 and 2? The difference? Still there!  Both new and old, we can't miss those ones. What could I say more? They bring me a smile when I find one!Bugs? I encountered some but not too fancy too. Like if I would not care about them seriously. Difficulty? Now we are talking! I would say yes about the difficulty to be increased if we compare between the two games. But for me, it really needed. I really do think the difficulty from what the other usually encounter is by the number of enemies coming at you, versus the nerf on the spells. This is where I want to point out that the Magicka 1 players, usually, must get out of this ""area of comfort"" of the OP spells and try to do something to experiment with.To be honest there, even myself I got surprise with the difficulty while playing solo. Yes, I died quite alot too. But each time I died, I tried a new combo to beat my enemies. It is by experimenting the elements that I discovered how to ""play"" with them. Just to give an example for one part in the game there: There is a watermill that you need to turn by using a water spell, but the enemies constantly spawns to go to kill you.  To counteract the enemies, I did created some walls of frost, lightning and arcane to slow them, damaging them. Even some creatures arrived from the water, so they got heavely damaged by the lightning whenever they entered in the wall. It did gave me time to use my water spell and also preparing another spell to finishing them off.It was challenging and fun, despite I got killed so many times. But I learned my stuff there.In the end, I do think Magicka 2 is a game that we are related to ""Death and Learn"" turn off, like previously the 1. But the first one was less present, I must say. So will I recommend this game? I will say ""Yes"", definitively. I would even suggest to buy the first one and see the difference between them. Either the first or second, Magicka is still Magicka: The serie is about Death, spells casting, laugh, anger and friendship killing.... mixing them to make two words to describe both games : ""Have Fun!""

												For full disclosure, I am a PC user and a long time Magicka 1 player though never played Wizard Wars.Below you will find stuff that I didn't like about this game. Why I am doing this in a positive review? because if you are fine with what is wrong with it then go ahead and buy the game, I am fine with what is wrong with it and I am immesnly enjoying the game/ 1. Cooperative adventure, I am the kind of guy who likes to do it by himself, the reason is that I take my time exploring the map and looking for hidden weapons, easter eggs, and mooses or uhh moosi? or whatever is the plural of moose is. When I am with other people that I don't know I kinda feel pressured to just keep up with them and rush through the level, which I don't like, and frankly the difficulty of this game and the spells (more on that later) don't really help the loners, is it possible to have a Wizard NPC whose sole purpose is to revive us and doesn't complain and threaten to kick you out when you take your time? 2. Movement, ugh i have played the game for 5 hours so far and I still can't get used to it, I don't know how to describe what I don't like about it, slippery maybe? it is like I am walking on ice all the time, I really don't like the ""fire on the move"" it doesn't feel right for PC users, it fits the PS4 guys perfectly but not us, it also makes the spells seem cheap and easy, like some kind of street ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that you can chug and forget and then move on. A wizard should stay put when firing a spell to properly give it respect and honor that it deserves. 3. Spell balance, I feel the earth (rock) element is useless now, it is very slow and you have to wait a while charging it before it becomes fast enough, and if you get hit (by an arrow for example from some silly goblin) it resets, plus combing it with shield to get an earth wall is no longer as useful as enemy learned (which I am not complaining about, just pointing it out) to simply walk around it (with larger enemies simply crushing it like it was made of butter), also the precedence change where electricity is ranked higher than Arcane, so an Arcane-Electricity combo splashes instead of beams towards the enemy really broke my heart, also the fact that water and fire/cold don't combine into a new icon isn't cool either, it robs you of spell diversity and powerful combos. And finally the quick cast, you should't shortcut a magicka into a number then simply press that number while forgetting how to perform the magick, a wizard should learn and memorize the combination for his magick 4. Teleport, do we get the classic teleport? or are we stuck with the Emergency Teleport only? I haven't progressed far in the game (because I keep crashing in Chapter 3) to really know.			"

 [EDITED]  I have never been so disappointed in a game.  Magicka 2 is a huge let down and that genuinely makes me sad. As I understand it, the game is based on Wizard Wars rather than the original Magicka. Why? You tell me, Paradox! What this means is that we get an extremely simplified version of the original spell-casting-system, which in return straight up REMOVES some of the fun combos you used to be able to do, rather than expanding the fun with more elements and combinations. To explain what I'm yappin' about I'll give you an example: In the first game you were able to combine arcane, ice, snow, lightning, steam and shields in order to create pillars of death and total destruction. However, in Magicka 2 you can't combine two elements in order to make a new one, e.g. water + fire = steam. Instead, if you want steam, you gotta have fire and water separate in you bar which also means that you can't add lightning since it will cancel out the water, etc. Also, you can't add additional fire/water in order to make a stream which contains BOTH steam and fire/water. Now you only get steam... This new logic applies to basically everything similar, meaning; electrifying arcane-icicles fueled by scolding steam are a big  NOPE . Instead of being able to combine different elements in order to perform an ability like you used to be able to do, they've replaced it with on-demand-quick-buttons (not the official term) which automatically cast your spells for you. This new and incredibly boring system also requires your spells to have cooldowns. In short, the days of ferociously spamming tornadoes and endless waves of pure inferno are over. (EDIT: My mistake, you are still able to spam abilities if you conjure them by combining elements, but I still think the quick-cast-thingy ruins the fun.)Before you go on about how unbalanced the original Magicka was: IT WAS THE WHOLE POINT. Being able to one-shot basically everything was not only hilarious but also perfectly fine, since you could easily kill yourself as well if you didn't know what you were doing.  ""When everyone's OP, no one's OP.""                                                                - MeTo be fair, the game has improved in some areas, like the graphics and... That's pretty much it actually. Sure, now there are artifacts and companions and all that mumbo-jumbo, but rather than improving the game they're dumbing it down even further. It's really hard to appreciate everything the game does right when it does SOOO much wrong in other aspects (I'm still talking about the new spell system). If they just would have kept the original system it actually would have been fine, but since they didn't... Yeah...I feel like I've completely wasted my money on what was supposed to be an amazing game. If you still wanna buy it, be my guest, you might like it. But if you love the original like I do you will without question be disappointed (but hey, I might be wrong).I rate Magicka 2  3/10 .What do you guys think?(VERY IMPORTANT EDIT: They fixed everything and the game is now pretty damn dank... Yaaay!)New Rating:  7,5/10  Whoop Whoop "

												Magicka 2 is a huge let down for fans of the first game for several reasons and the game is such a chore solo that it made me take a break after 2 hours (that AND the fact that the game lost connection to the server 3 times and froze on some weird ""Better hit ALT+F4"" screen).1) The movement is horrible. While the devs made it easier to move and prepare spells instead of the awful Finger Twister game from the first one; You now must go where you click ALWAYS. Aim with the mouse, judge distance on lightning spells with the mouse, walk right off a cliff with the mouse. Why the devs felt the need to add slippery ice mechanics ON TOP OF THIS I have no idea.2) The spells were weakened INCREDIBLY. You now need to play co-op in order to deal the same damage as the first game but the enemies have roughly the same health. One of the features I noticed first is that shields are no longer worth casting in any way, never again will your ""E"" key stand alone. You can't mash space to maintain (which is weird because that sounds like a HUGE co-op feature) and if you try to keep up a personal shield, you won't have time to cast anything else. Your spamming of spells is also gone. I prided myself on my ability to mash out a quick Lightning Bolt in Magicka but now, even without the awful ""focus regeneration"" on your quick-cast spells, each spell has a cool-down that serves to hamper players who have memorized casting spells quickly since you move slower when preparing a spell and there is no ""negate casting"" button.3) Quick-casting is a nice option but you cannot program your own spells. If I could set my ""1"" key to quick-cast a ward or full strength heal, this complaint wouldn't be on the list. The devs feel like they can tell you how to play the game they just handed and marketed as having all these cooky spell combinations (which you don't unlock quickly nor do the original interactions carry over; instead they dumbed down the game for controller support) by forcing certain spells into the ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", &""4"" keys and not even allowing you to rebind those to different numbers.4) After the devs go and dismiss DRMs in  this article: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-drm-sucks-according-to-magicka-developer-parad/1100-6420910/You later find out that if you disconnect from the Paradox servers, the game kicks you out.-EDIT-Most of the issues listed have been fixed and while I don't think the developers should be let off the hook for their poor decisions, I do think they deserve some credit for their responsiveness. I am once again finding myself enjoying and reccomemending this game and its additions.			"

												I initially gave this game a bad review for being too hard and encountering a few bugs. But after a patch or two and playing it a little longer the bugs seemed to of been resolved, but I also found the game to be too easy.Magicka 1 was much harder as it progressed, and this game seemed to of become easier. This won't be the same as Magicka 1, but I do like that the controllers are more user friendly. I just think the quick cast should be ditched and fights adjusted a little.Still a fun game and with that I recommend it.			"

Seemd console oriented and dumbed down compared to M1. But after picking it up again several several months later, i can say its a great game, and its even better with friends.100% recommend now.

												Second Review after the ""learn to spell again...again"" UpdateNooow it¬¥s really Magicka 2 =) Most of my loved combinations are back, it¬¥s still fun to try new ones. Like it!First Review:This should be Magicka 2? Magicka 1 was awesome, because you could and should combine elements (as Steam or Ice) to really powerfull combinations. Or Mines, boom!, the enemy flies away. Plus awesome Earth-armors with icey spikes.And now? No steam, just death+fire beams are really usefull, every other combination i tried just sucks, even armor/shield-spells. In M1, there were all kind of combination: useless, ok, and really powerfull. Now you have 100% useless, sometimes usefull, and fire-death-spamming.Random teleporting is a mess, you appear 2 meters away in the mob = death. You have basically no crowdcontrol, and this game zergrushes you with mobs! It¬¥s a really annoying try-and-error party if you play alone. And a 20 sec-freeze every 15 Minutes if i play the game.Graphics are better, and the 4 magick-shortcuts are a nice try. But i cast haste with my elements, never move your fingers away from the element-keys! The Story is slightly better than in part 1.I would buy it for 5‚Ç¨, but don¬¥t expect such a good game as Magicka 1! So yeah, Magicka 2. Please learn to spell again!			"

												The first Magicka was amazing, you were an overpowered wizard with infinite spell combinations. Everything I enjoyed about the first Magicka, aside from the comedy, is absent from this game.They worked to make the game more ""balanced"" which is not what the games are meant to be. They changed key elements and removed others limiting the user to what they can find in secrets. The game is significantly shorter than the original, a friend and I completed it in about 4 hours including cutscenes, which seems to be normal these days for a $15 game. This game isn't a sequel to Magicka, it's a spinoff game loosely based around its mechanics.			"

												Comparing to Magicka 1 and Wizard Wars:Main thing: Just played with a guy from australia with zero lag, all of the challenges, cheesing and spamming storms and sdfsf on screens full of enemies, zero lag.Besides that, a lot less bugs (of course they are still there), but only had to restart the game once, no desktop crashing.As a game for people that never played magicka, I guess I¬¥m not the best one to judge, but anyway magicka 1 is US$1 someplaces and Wizard wars is free, if you like the idea/style, you will probably like this one too.Lots of people complaining that it is different from magicka 1, well it is, but it makes it harder, and its not like that it gets impossible to cheese, its just with different spell combinations, no qfqfsas or qerasr for you, and (at least I didn¬¥t find) a qwer spam to heal you full health inconditionally, you will have to ""LEARN TO SPELL AGAIN"" ;)It does need to patch and let you queue spells and cast magicks while on midair, the falling asa and flying earth/elemental shield are needed, there are too many bugs that send you flying offscreen for a long time, and they don¬¥t seem very fixable.

												Though severely worse than the original, Magicka 2 still provides a solid co-op experience Pros:++very funny+good replayability+not expensiveCons:--much less content and creativity than in the original-spellcasting and magicks ruined thanks to Wizard Wars-irritating co-op lobby system -annoying voicesIf you haven't played the original, you better play that instead because this is inferior compared to it.The developers obviously were too busy making it funny to look at that they forgot to make it fun to play.Still, it's not all that horrible when you exclude the bad solution to hosting and all the wrong influence from Wizard Wars.I just hope that all the upcoming DLC will improve the overall situation, and that it won't be too expensive.6/10 mainly wasted potential, but there are some good moments.

												Lets start this off with factsI just beat the entire campaign in about 6 1/2 hours which i find ok for a 15‚Ç¨ game but it must be considered that i was REALLY taking my time with it so you might be able to beat it 5. the game itself wasnt very hard except for the brutal bossfight which (including the bosslevel) took me over 1 out of the 6 hours (im still thinking about wether it took me so long because it was hard or because it was poorly designed). the game looks beautiful and fresh compared to Magicka 1 and has an overall less messy UI. here's the deal though: all these salty people in the comments really arent lying. the game has made serious mistakes regarding the gameplay. they introduced a hotbar consisting of 4 slots which you can fill with the different magicks you learned over the course of the game to then be able to ""quickcast"" by clicking 1;2;3 or 4 on the keyboard to cast the spell. this has a cooldown though so you cant just smash the most powerfull spell over and over. you can still cast magicks by combining the right elements and then hitting spacebar but the problem is: even though the game boldly states that this way of casting magicks has NO COOLDOWN it often times has and you dont know when it will be off cooldown or whats keeping you from spellcasting because theres nothing there to tell you. this hotbar and spellcasting cooldown ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t is my biggest point of critique for this game but it doesnt stop there. second mistake: the magicks, which you know get rewarded at the end of a level instead of learning them from books, feel weak compared to just combining basic elements in many situations and there really arent many of them anyways... magicka 1 was filled to the brim with interesting spellcombos where for this one its quite the opposite. now there is a bigger focus point on loot and gear than on magicks which i find sad since i really couldnt give less of a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about what the staff im carying or the sword does but the magick has got to rock and it really really doesnt sadly. (btw i didnt find one gun in the game and i really kept my eyes open i mean not like i would criticize that one but i always found them quite funny). oh and who in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• designed some of these ""demon statue challenges"" and the bossfight? dont lock the screen in magicka i need a big playing fiel especially when the boss and his little minision fill half of it and my aoe spells take up the other half. Bossifight Spoiler aheaddont ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing let the enemy spawn a lightning golem and fire moths or whatever that is when i have to completely immune against both to be able to cast the immunity after i knocked the golem down if the right spot at the right time... and why can these flies reset my cooldown? oh and why does the golem get revived sometimes even though i ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing negated most of her revive and her power bubble popped already? when that happens you basically no way of knocking the bubble out the window before she gets it oh and DONT MAKE IT SO THAT THE BUBBLE BUNCES RIGHT IN HER FACE or at least give me a way to control the thing a little bit. and yes i get it the lore says she has new made up elements but i should be able to block them somehow or t its just a little cheap. tl;dr-less gear -gear you find stays unlocked for you character-customizeable character -worse game mechanics compared to magicka 1 (dumbed down)-singleplayer navi fairy that revives you-charging certain elements takes more time now compaired to magicka 1 which makes them suck-elements dont interact with each other in the spellqueue -nice graphics less buggs runs smoothely-magicks are‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•and feel‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•and there are like 10 different...-5-7 hours campaign-less eastereggs :'( -challenging/poorly designed bossfight (cant decice yet which one)-hillarious humor if youre just planing on buying it for the campaign its definitly not worth it but if you wanna play with friend maybe in different modi it might be. magicka 1 was better so pick that one up first if you haven already. jeez paradox people all we wanted was magicka 1 with a new netcode maybe a new story and a few new graphics. thats it. dont fix what just isnt broken :(			"

												IMO The first Magicka game was better, exept netcode, and an few more things. PROS : Graphics are REALLY NICE. Multiplayer seems better then before. CONS : I guess this is just me, but the movment controls bug me. Im too used to the first Magickas controls (movement). An bit laggy, but thats minor. (PS I can live with Ice and Steam not combing). All in all the game feels kinda stale. But for Magickas sake i will recommend it.			"

												In my opinion this game is a worthy sequel to the original magicka ,but not one that I or those that played M1 probably wanted in this game but it's a decent game.To me it wasn't as fun as the first magicka was or playing wizard wars.I think they should add an option,setting,or do something to make it more like the original magicka.The controls are really screwy though just takes some time to get used to the controls then it gets less challenging though you might fall off a cliff or drown again like me.The story is humorus just like M1 and is filled with other references.The levels aren't that hard with others but challenging as solo all except the final boss even and with others it took us more or less thirty minutes to win but I won't spoil it for you.Sometimes the combat gets really unbalenced because the mobs will crowd around you and keep killing you and your probably screwed if you don't have someone to revive you.I don't like that the  game forces you to move around and cast spells instead of standing still like M1.The coop games are buggy as a host and as a client my game has crashed for no reason ,but it hasn't happened very much to me.Some people say that they can't connect to the paradox servers and can't confirm if it is happening ,but it has happened to some people.CONCLUSION-If you liked wizard wars you will probably like this ,but if you have the first magicka then pursue it at your own peril.If you play solo i wouldn't recommend this but you can let people join your game if you don't mind.If your new to Magicka then try Magicka-wizard wars and learn about it then if you like it then this might be worth a try for you.

												Part of the appeal of Magicka 1 for me was how deadly and volatile it was to play when it first came out.  You could pretty much cast the advanced spells as fast as your fingers could rattle out the combos, and now cooldowns (can't let Magicka get too chaotic!) and quick slots (no need to flex the APM so much!  Also, cast Haste while wet) have taken the edge off that.  You were often one element and a second away from getting squished, and now you can respawn, press W, A then space over and over while you think of what to do next.  It's like a lot of the fun's been balanced out of it.The campaign is a lot duller and shorter than Magicka 1's too.  It's less mechanically inventive (less interesting fights and environmental interaction) and aesthetically imaginative (less visual variety).All that said, I enjoyed it enough to finish the campaign, but I only recommend this if you've wrung out Magicka already.

												Fantastic game, definitely worth playing, especially if one is a true fan of previous part. It lacks a bit of content when comparing to the original Magicka game, but is still fun to play, and provides a huge amount of joy. Contrary to the Magicka, one can move the wizard during the spellcasting, which is a great benefit, because the hordes of enemies are unforgiving. For me the biggest downside is fact, that it is rather impossible to solo the game (final boss was beyond my abilities), but still, Magicka 2 shows its best features when playing with friends, happily obliterating  enemies (and each other).

												This game is only slightly like the original. I can see they tried to make is more 'challenging', but in reality the only thing that makes is challenging is the lack of freedom the player has with the abilities themselves. Placing timers between casting the same spell, weakening shields so you're constantly spamming them just to stay alive, taking more damage from your own abilities, and making it so that elemental immunity requires 4 of one element+shield (Which effectively means you better pick one and take physical plus other elemental damage, or choose your poorly protective simple shield... in which you still take a considerable amount of health damage). In reality; the first game was fun because it was humorous, and had a sense of power for the player wherein you could spam spells as fast as your fingers could type them, and the enemies kept coming with different attributes, forcing creativity with a very intuitive and genius system. Taking away power from the player does not create a challenge, it creates frustration. I was very disappointed in this version of the game, and if I could I would ask for my money back. I plan to simply play expansions for the first one until I am done with them.			"

												Most of the issues I previously had with the game (you can read them below) have been adressed and the game is good now!It has been dumbed down immenselyI am a huge Magicka fan and it pains me to have to write a negative review of this game, but at this stage we need to shock the developers into listening.The issues of this game have been pointed out many times over in other reviews but I will summarize them once more. Dumbed down casting system - The developers didn't listen when people told them that making steam and ice not combine was a bad idea during the sneak peak. Sure some combos were op in Magicka 1, but they were complex spells that required many key presses to execute and of course they were optional. Yeah you might have gone through the entirety of Magicka 1 by spamming broken pillars of icy death, but then again how do you go through Magicka 2? You spam arcane rocks on your head or use arcane fire beams. A much worse substitute for the previously ""broken spells"" in my opinion. There are no elaborate combos worth doing in this one.Projectiles are no longer viable because it take a ridiculous amount of time to charge them up and cast them. No one uses them any more, because why the hell would they, after all this game wants you to only use arcane fire beams and area spam.Mines are no longer viable because they do too little damage and explode automatically.You can't turn lightning into a beam now lightning is not really good for anything but making EAASF storms for your enemies to pass through, which are not even really worth the effort since arcane fire beams and area are faster to cast and more versatile. If you thought going through the first game spamming super steam beam and lightning ice was bad, just wait till you go through this one casting nothing but arcane fire.The unnecessary global cooldown on magicks - I really don't understand why this was implemented, players with fast fingers should be rewarded for their skill, not be slowed down to the speed of someone with a controller. We are PC gamers we don't care about controller equality. I can understand the desire to remove spamming magicks that insta kill your enemies too fast, but making a global magick cooldown is not the correct fix to that, first of all there are no insta kill magicks in this one and second at least make the cooldown per magick only not global!People like to complain about the magicks hotbar, but I really think it's a good idea, you don't have to use it if you think it makes things too easy and it's there to help people who aren't that great at memorizing complex magick recipes, but the help should have ended there, the real problem is that they decided to stop rewarding players who made the effort of learning to fastcast magicks and thus they slammed the skill cap into the ground.  No active abilities on staves and other issues with them - This is just lazy, staves in this game simply nerf and buff elements, effectively making them less diverse and the fact that the skull staff and helviti staff are so powerful makes all the other ones useless. You can no longer choose a staff simply because you like how it looks, now you have to optimise for most damage, since you are generally underpowered (explained in my previous two points).Robes only shuffle around resistances - which if you are playing on bananas means absolutely nothing, so this leaves only one robe worth using which is wuxia because of it's speed buff, since that is the only stat that really helps with anything.There are too few boss fights - the first game had many memorable boss fights that were unique and fun. This one has only one - at the end of the game.You fly too much - It is annoying that the single most powerful enemy in this game is knockback, gl with those little bomber goblins while you are fighting the grenade launcher orcs. Oh and there is no way to reduce this effect significantly and you can't conjure elements in mid air. Most of your deaths in this game will be flying off the map.The skill cap bar is so low James Cameron needs to go under and pull it back up.Overall the game is challenging and fun, it has a good story, nice humor and is enjoyable to play, but it doesn‚Äôt reward skill or playstyle diversity. I had a lot of fun with it but some of the desition making behind a lot of the mechanics changes must have resembled this: 


YouTube‚Ñ¢ Video: South Park - American Economics¬†

			Views: 784,328		



 pretty closely. The sort of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù changes that were implemented are not really necessary in a singleplayer/co-op game where people can choose the way they play. I really hope some fixes get implemented pretty soon and I would more that happily give this game a thumbs up if things change. I don't really understand why they had to work so hard toward evening out keyboard and mouse vs controller by punishing keyboard and mouse players, the game isn‚Äôt even cross platform‚Ä¶ wtf? These sort of artificial nefs (inability to combine elements,cooldowns on magicks, lightning being useless) could have been optional, through artifacts. If you are one of those people who would justify the changes with ‚Äúyou are no longer overpowered‚Äù try the ESSSS DSSSS selfcast spam combo in Magicka 2.I think Magicka 2 should have been released as early access game, with large amounts of openmindedness and willingness to listen from the developer's side. I know that this is most likely paradoxes fault, even though I have a lot of respect for them as a publisher I think they forced this one out a little too fast for it's own good.If you ever fix these problems, a way to incentivise your players to play with these unholy nerfs would be to have artefact set achievements.I hope this review helped you make a more informed decision about your purchase and I really hope I have reason to change it to positive soon! Please listen to our cries developers!Oh and why on earth would you call arcane death? Just wondering.I love you Magicka but you need some tough love.			"

 [EDITED]  I have never been so disappointed in a game.  Magicka 2 is a huge let down and that genuinely makes me sad. As I understand it, the game is based on Wizard Wars rather than the original Magicka. Why? You tell me, Paradox! What this means is that we get an extremely simplified version of the original spell-casting-system, which in return straight up REMOVES some of the fun combos you used to be able to do, rather than expanding the fun with more elements and combinations. To explain what I'm yappin' about I'll give you an example: In the first game you were able to combine arcane, ice, snow, lightning, steam and shields in order to create pillars of death and total destruction. However, in Magicka 2 you can't combine two elements in order to make a new one, e.g. water + fire = steam. Instead, if you want steam, you gotta have fire and water separate in you bar which also means that you can't add lightning since it will cancel out the water, etc. Also, you can't add additional fire/water in order to make a stream which contains BOTH steam and fire/water. Now you only get steam... This new logic applies to basically everything similar, meaning; electrifying arcane-icicles fueled by scolding steam are a big  NOPE . Instead of being able to combine different elements in order to perform an ability like you used to be able to do, they've replaced it with on-demand-quick-buttons (not the official term) which automatically cast your spells for you. This new and incredibly boring system also requires your spells to have cooldowns. In short, the days of ferociously spamming tornadoes and endless waves of pure inferno are over. (EDIT: My mistake, you are still able to spam abilities if you conjure them by combining elements, but I still think the quick-cast-thingy ruins the fun.)Before you go on about how unbalanced the original Magicka was: IT WAS THE WHOLE POINT. Being able to one-shot basically everything was not only hilarious but also perfectly fine, since you could easily kill yourself as well if you didn't know what you were doing.  ""When everyone's OP, no one's OP.""                                                                - MeTo be fair, the game has improved in some areas, like the graphics and... That's pretty much it actually. Sure, now there are artifacts and companions and all that mumbo-jumbo, but rather than improving the game they're dumbing it down even further. It's really hard to appreciate everything the game does right when it does SOOO much wrong in other aspects (I'm still talking about the new spell system). If they just would have kept the original system it actually would have been fine, but since they didn't... Yeah...I feel like I've completely wasted my money on what was supposed to be an amazing game. If you still wanna buy it, be my guest, you might like it. But if you love the original like I do you will without question be disappointed (but hey, I might be wrong).I rate Magicka 2  3/10 .What do you guys think?(VERY IMPORTANT EDIT: They fixed everything and the game is now pretty damn dank... Yaaay!)New Rating:  7,5/10  Whoop Whoop "

												Magicka 2 is a huge let down for fans of the first game for several reasons and the game is such a chore solo that it made me take a break after 2 hours (that AND the fact that the game lost connection to the server 3 times and froze on some weird ""Better hit ALT+F4"" screen).1) The movement is horrible. While the devs made it easier to move and prepare spells instead of the awful Finger Twister game from the first one; You now must go where you click ALWAYS. Aim with the mouse, judge distance on lightning spells with the mouse, walk right off a cliff with the mouse. Why the devs felt the need to add slippery ice mechanics ON TOP OF THIS I have no idea.2) The spells were weakened INCREDIBLY. You now need to play co-op in order to deal the same damage as the first game but the enemies have roughly the same health. One of the features I noticed first is that shields are no longer worth casting in any way, never again will your ""E"" key stand alone. You can't mash space to maintain (which is weird because that sounds like a HUGE co-op feature) and if you try to keep up a personal shield, you won't have time to cast anything else. Your spamming of spells is also gone. I prided myself on my ability to mash out a quick Lightning Bolt in Magicka but now, even without the awful ""focus regeneration"" on your quick-cast spells, each spell has a cool-down that serves to hamper players who have memorized casting spells quickly since you move slower when preparing a spell and there is no ""negate casting"" button.3) Quick-casting is a nice option but you cannot program your own spells. If I could set my ""1"" key to quick-cast a ward or full strength heal, this complaint wouldn't be on the list. The devs feel like they can tell you how to play the game they just handed and marketed as having all these cooky spell combinations (which you don't unlock quickly nor do the original interactions carry over; instead they dumbed down the game for controller support) by forcing certain spells into the ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", &""4"" keys and not even allowing you to rebind those to different numbers.4) After the devs go and dismiss DRMs in  this article: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-drm-sucks-according-to-magicka-developer-parad/1100-6420910/You later find out that if you disconnect from the Paradox servers, the game kicks you out.-EDIT-Most of the issues listed have been fixed and while I don't think the developers should be let off the hook for their poor decisions, I do think they deserve some credit for their responsiveness. I am once again finding myself enjoying and reccomemending this game and its additions.			"

												Now, if you look at my time played, it is obvious that I have not played that much on this account anyway, I've been able to finish the campaign, but on a seperate account. Anyways! If you like the first game I would say, do not purchase this game. I found it boring, and they take out alot of the original features as far as I could tell, such as challenges, you got them the second you loaded the game now nope. Also there is the problem of no versus mode in the beginning, so for anyone that wanted to practice their spells out of the campaign then go into the campaign and start to cause havok on the people... you'll just have to practice on training dummies. Another thing is they took Vlad to far, the jokes concerning him in the original title were funny, but they get old in this one. The story also voids the lore of the dlc The Stars are Left which I found infuriating to say the least.If Arrowhead were to have been the team behind this project I think it would have been perfect but they are not, sadly I think less effort was put into this game than the original game. I would say don't buy it, the most you will do is play around with poison for 5 mins, and most of the original spell combos work in this game, something like qfqfasa is still one of the most effective spells out there. It's Magicka without the same writing, or thought. Save the 15 dollars, and if you are going to get it, get it when there is a sale. And even then... it still might not be worth it.			"

												Have to say when I played the first piece of this game I was hoocked, so naturaly when the second part came out i thought to myself how could they top that.Well they did it, the graphics of course and the multiplayer base frame make it a whole lot of fun to play with friends or perfect strangers.The new elements, spellwise are fun to experience and the feeling of making up your own spells as you go along is hellish fun. The story line is not too deep but that is simply part of the fun, specially when you have to deal with....you guessed the Infamous VLAD. The people who have played the first part will agree keeping him around was a wise decision.The handling of the game is well thought out, but still takes some getting used to. Specially when you are new, dont be surprised if you die a lot, sometimes even diying can be fun, and here they made it happen.To summon this up, if you want to play an online multiplayer game, and dont want to invest countless hours, this is the one to pick, but you can also conquer the game on your owne. You can start right of the bat.I hope you will enjoy this game just as much as I did.			"

The goodIt's the new Magicka! Having Magicka 1 behind it, Magicka 2 couldn't fail(at least, that is what I thought before).Graphics Graphics are vastly improved, everything is smoother.Humor and references Humor is good. It makes you laugh.Friendly fire Friendly fire is always activated and you can not disable it. Fantastic for losing friends(if you have friends that bought Magicka 2 and want to play it)The badSpell casting system is limited Here is why:* Lightning does not form a beam when combined with arcane => Ruins wet-run away-fire lightning + arcane from distance tactic* Shields only block elementary damage => No chaos on the screenMagick system is copied from Magicka: Wizard Wars You have 4 magicks available at the moment and the game encourages you to click their buttons in the quick bar to activate them. They also have a temporary cooldown. This is bypassed by equipping a staff that regenerates your mana quickly. You can manually enter element combination and activate magicks that way, but the whole magick system feels nerfed.The game forces you to play with friends Enemies are too hard to beat if you are playing solo, a single goblin hits you three times and you are dead. In some cases, you need to interact with some parts of the level and fight enemies at the same time. It's simply too hard to play alone. What if I don't have friends that want to play Magicka 2?Final wordsMagicka 2 is inferior to Magicka 1 in every way except graphics and stability.If you have not bought Magicka 2 yet, buy Magicka 1, beat it, than play Magicka: Wizard Wars. If you like it, buy Magicka 2. Otherwise, stay away from Magicka 2.			"

												Magicka 2 is a super fun game to play with friends, even the local co-op is great. The spell casting system is intuitive, and there are tons of different spell combinations; the possibilities are endless. The main story is kind of short, (I think it took about 8 hours for me to beat it, and that was with lots of lollygagging included) but it does have replay value, because there are tons of secrets to discover throughout the different levels. There are also lots of extra challenges to keep you entertained for hours. Overall it's a fun, aesthetically pleasing game, with a self aware and allusion based humour.			"

												Have to say when I played the first piece of this game I was hoocked, so naturaly when the second part came out i thought to myself how could they top that.Well they did it, the graphics of course and the multiplayer base frame make it a whole lot of fun to play with friends or perfect strangers.The new elements, spellwise are fun to experience and the feeling of making up your own spells as you go along is hellish fun. The story line is not too deep but that is simply part of the fun, specially when you have to deal with....you guessed the Infamous VLAD. The people who have played the first part will agree keeping him around was a wise decision.The handling of the game is well thought out, but still takes some getting used to. Specially when you are new, dont be surprised if you die a lot, sometimes even diying can be fun, and here they made it happen.To summon this up, if you want to play an online multiplayer game, and dont want to invest countless hours, this is the one to pick, but you can also conquer the game on your owne. You can start right of the bat.I hope you will enjoy this game just as much as I did.			"

												Realy entertaining game, especially when played with friends. Even getting angry at chaos, that you may find on screen, seems to be part of the fun. I do not recommend play it in single. Graphics is pretty, and sound effects and music are great. There is not much to tell about the story, cause you will skip cutscenes just to get to the next level and cast some spells.			"

												Magicka 2. You can see an unpleasant amount of negative reviews. And yes, they've got a great point. Magicka 2 feels like an expansion to Magicka. People compare these two a lot. And I mean A LOT. Yes, the campaign is fairly short and there are quite harder enemies.But, you mostly can't see them mentioning to use the new mechanics. The enemies are hard, yes, however if you use the new movement system to your advantage, they become much easier. It is hard to get used to, don't be mislead, but once you get the hang of it, you fly (not literally). People dislike the fact that now you can't SPAM. Yes, literally. You cannot spam the same op spell combo for the whole game. You have to differ your attacks. And people hate it. Enemies have elemental resistances which, in my opinion, is a great thing. You now have to use different combinations and A-S-S (lightning-death-death) or A-R-S-E (lightning-cold-death-shield) are not the way to go the whole campaign. And the thing about magicks having a global cooldown? Meh. I don't mind.In conclusion people got so used to Magicka, they cannot accept the new mechanics. And look at how much time most people that reviwed negatively have put in the game! Less than me! (and I don't have much) It is a matter of adaptation. If you adapt to this game, you will love it (especially if you are new to the Magicka ""franchise""). But if you can't adapt to this new thing, then you won't enjoy it. And you won't find out until you have bought the game (lols). I really recommend you adapt to this system. And if you do, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy the game :-)			"

												Most of the issues I previously had with the game (you can read them below) have been adressed and the game is good now!It has been dumbed down immenselyI am a huge Magicka fan and it pains me to have to write a negative review of this game, but at this stage we need to shock the developers into listening.The issues of this game have been pointed out many times over in other reviews but I will summarize them once more. Dumbed down casting system - The developers didn't listen when people told them that making steam and ice not combine was a bad idea during the sneak peak. Sure some combos were op in Magicka 1, but they were complex spells that required many key presses to execute and of course they were optional. Yeah you might have gone through the entirety of Magicka 1 by spamming broken pillars of icy death, but then again how do you go through Magicka 2? You spam arcane rocks on your head or use arcane fire beams. A much worse substitute for the previously ""broken spells"" in my opinion. There are no elaborate combos worth doing in this one.Projectiles are no longer viable because it take a ridiculous amount of time to charge them up and cast them. No one uses them any more, because why the hell would they, after all this game wants you to only use arcane fire beams and area spam.Mines are no longer viable because they do too little damage and explode automatically.You can't turn lightning into a beam now lightning is not really good for anything but making EAASF storms for your enemies to pass through, which are not even really worth the effort since arcane fire beams and area are faster to cast and more versatile. If you thought going through the first game spamming super steam beam and lightning ice was bad, just wait till you go through this one casting nothing but arcane fire.The unnecessary global cooldown on magicks - I really don't understand why this was implemented, players with fast fingers should be rewarded for their skill, not be slowed down to the speed of someone with a controller. We are PC gamers we don't care about controller equality. I can understand the desire to remove spamming magicks that insta kill your enemies too fast, but making a global magick cooldown is not the correct fix to that, first of all there are no insta kill magicks in this one and second at least make the cooldown per magick only not global!People like to complain about the magicks hotbar, but I really think it's a good idea, you don't have to use it if you think it makes things too easy and it's there to help people who aren't that great at memorizing complex magick recipes, but the help should have ended there, the real problem is that they decided to stop rewarding players who made the effort of learning to fastcast magicks and thus they slammed the skill cap into the ground.  No active abilities on staves and other issues with them - This is just lazy, staves in this game simply nerf and buff elements, effectively making them less diverse and the fact that the skull staff and helviti staff are so powerful makes all the other ones useless. You can no longer choose a staff simply because you like how it looks, now you have to optimise for most damage, since you are generally underpowered (explained in my previous two points).Robes only shuffle around resistances - which if you are playing on bananas means absolutely nothing, so this leaves only one robe worth using which is wuxia because of it's speed buff, since that is the only stat that really helps with anything.There are too few boss fights - the first game had many memorable boss fights that were unique and fun. This one has only one - at the end of the game.You fly too much - It is annoying that the single most powerful enemy in this game is knockback, gl with those little bomber goblins while you are fighting the grenade launcher orcs. Oh and there is no way to reduce this effect significantly and you can't conjure elements in mid air. Most of your deaths in this game will be flying off the map.The skill cap bar is so low James Cameron needs to go under and pull it back up.Overall the game is challenging and fun, it has a good story, nice humor and is enjoyable to play, but it doesn‚Äôt reward skill or playstyle diversity. I had a lot of fun with it but some of the desition making behind a lot of the mechanics changes must have resembled this:

 pretty closely. The sort of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù changes that were implemented are not really necessary in a singleplayer/co-op game where people can choose the way they play. I really hope some fixes get implemented pretty soon and I would more that happily give this game a thumbs up if things change. I don't really understand why they had to work so hard toward evening out keyboard and mouse vs controller by punishing keyboard and mouse players, the game isn‚Äôt even cross platform‚Ä¶ wtf? These sort of artificial nefs (inability to combine elements,cooldowns on magicks, lightning being useless) could have been optional, through artifacts. If you are one of those people who would justify the changes with ‚Äúyou are no longer overpowered‚Äù try the ESSSS DSSSS selfcast spam combo in Magicka 2.I think Magicka 2 should have been released as early access game, with large amounts of openmindedness and willingness to listen from the developer's side. I know that this is most likely paradoxes fault, even though I have a lot of respect for them as a publisher I think they forced this one out a little too fast for it's own good.If you ever fix these problems, a way to incentivise your players to play with these unholy nerfs would be to have artefact set achievements.I hope this review helped you make a more informed decision about your purchase and I really hope I have reason to change it to positive soon! Please listen to our cries developers!Oh and why on earth would you call arcane death? Just wondering.I love you Magicka but you need some tough love.			"

												- You can still kill your friends (and yourself) - It still has the same amusing Magicka humor - You can customize voices: Arnold  - You can unlock a lot of items and robesThank you Paradox for updating and fixxing the game since released!When the game was released:(fixed)  - Requires constant internet connection to Paradox Servers which have failed 4 times so far. When it fails, the game crashes.(fixed)  - Lightning + Arcane is no longer a beam; it now acts like lightning.(slightly fixed) - Permanent shields no longer exist no matter what elements you combine.(fixed)  - Water + Fire still creates steam, but it doesn't combine into one element so you can combine as many things in one spell.(fixed) - Same thing with Water + Frost = Ice.(fixed) - Rock projectiles take much longer to power up and even when fully powered still do not kill some enemies.(fixed) - Using a mouse and keyboard, the movement is difficult because the character moves all the way to the last place clicked.(fixed)  - Using a gamepad, aiming is very touchy so it is hard to keep a beam consistently on a target.

												A worthy successor of Magicka. As in the previous game, again there are some bugs and glitches which occur in multiplayer. However, it's still loads of fun to blast enemies and friends (by accident, of course) into oblivion. Hotkeys for a few pre-selected spells is a great idea, and don't ruin the game balance. Enemies are interesting and vary a lot. The game seems to be of a similar length to Magicka 1. The dialogs are fun, but who reads them in multiplayer, eh? The graphic style is very nice. A negative point is that you need to create a Paradox account in order to play the game in multiplayer. That's a shady tactic, please don't do that, Paradox.			"

												What happens on the screen mostly is something unspeakably awful: there is too much hardcore here, physics fails much compared to the first magicka. Some people whines devs casualed the game, but in my opinion they made it too hard to play - I was used to constantly use magickas before, such as lighting or teleport, now with automagickas ('press 4 for ressurect') I have to wait lot of seconds before using it again. Really, it's hard even on normal difficulty. Amount of enemies is too high, I can't even see my character, not to mention magicks I cast. What are they trying to accomplish here, compete with starcraft 2? On 9th level I still haven't lighting strike, pfft. One thing that is really improved - multiplayer system. Finally I can join anyone's game during the process, host can kick abusers / intruders, but otherwise game is a fail. Srsly, it's unplayable, if only magicka1 had the same multiplayer system I'd returned there and forgot about sequel as a nightmare.–¢–æ, —á—Ç–æ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ —ç–∫—Ä–∞–Ω–µ - —ç—Ç–æ –∫–∞–∫–æ–π-—Ç–æ –∞–±–∑–∞—Ü. –í—Ä–∞–≥–æ–≤ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ, –¥–æ—Ö–Ω—É—Ç –æ–Ω–∏ –¥–æ–ª–≥–æ –¥–∞–∂–µ –Ω–∞ –º–∏–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –º–∞–≥–∏–∫ –º–∞–ª–æ, –∏–∑-–∑–∞ ""–æ–∫–∞–∑—É–∞–ª–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è"" –º–µ–∂–¥—É –Ω–∏–º–∏ —Ç–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –¥–æ–ª–≥–∏–π –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ä—ã–≤. –ö –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä—É, –≤ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–π –º–∞–≥–∏–∫–µ —è –º–æ–≥ –∫–∞—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—É—Ç—å —Å –¥–µ—Å—è—Ç–æ–∫ –º–æ–ª–Ω–∏–π –ø–æ–¥—Ä—è–¥, –≤ –ø–≤–ø –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –æ—Ñ–∏–≥–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ–∫–º–±–æ, —Ç. –∫. —è –≤—ã—É—á–∏–ª –∫–æ–º–±–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –¥–ª—è –∫—É—á–∏ –ø–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –º–∞–≥–∏–π. –ö–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä —Å 9 —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è: —É–∑–∫–∏–π —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–æ–∫ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç—ã –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —Å–æ –≤—Å–µ—Ö —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω –ª–µ–∑—É—Ç –±–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∏, —É—á–∏—Ç—ã–≤–∞—è, —á—Ç–æ –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –≤—ã–ø–∏–ª–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Å–µ–∫—É–Ω–¥, –∞ –º–∞—Å—Å–æ–≤—ã—Ö –º–∞–≥–∏–π –Ω–µ—Ç, –≤—ã–ø–∏–ª–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å —ç—Ç–∏ —Ç–æ–ª–ø—ã —Å–ø–ª–æ—à–Ω–æ–µ ""—É–¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ"". –ü—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –∂–¥–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ–ª –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç—ã –¥–ª—è —Ä–µ—Å–ø–∞–≤–Ω–∞, –ø–æ–ª–º–∏–Ω—É—Ç—ã –∫–∞—Ä–ª! –ú–∞–≥–∏–∫–∞ –æ–Ω–ª–∞–π–Ω –Ω–µ –ø–æ—à–ª–∞ –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É —Å–µ—Ä–∏–∏. –ï–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ, —á—Ç–æ —Ä–∞–¥—É–µ—Ç - —ç—Ç–æ –º—É–ª—å—Ç–∏–ø–ª–µ–µ—Ä, –≤–æ—Ç –µ–≥–æ –±—ã –≤ –ø–µ—Ä–≤—É—é –º–∞–≥–∏–∫—É –∑–∞–ø–∏—Ö–Ω—É—Ç—å –∏ –≤—Ç–æ—Ä—É—é –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –≤—ã–∫–∏–¥—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å.

												Coming from player of first game of the series, a short word on how i feel about the game.It tried to continue both Magicka and the Wisard Wars, which were 2 completely different games as concepts. Result: most spells and magicks got reworked, for example, no more qerasr for me and key combination for teleport magicka is changed so it's not as easily spammable as in the first game. Furthermore, game introduced cooldowns on magickas, so here comes another limiter. But other than that, the spell system stayed almosth the same (or similar enough) and the fact that it can now actually be played in co-op seals the deal (also, overal movement got better(and gamepad controlls which actually make sense)).Story is.... Well, the style of jokes in this game compared to the first one is worse imo. Though it might be just that my sense of humor changed over... how much was that? over the time between those 2 games being released. The spoiler-ish part of the story rable:  it went too hard on my feelings. I feel real sympathy towards antagonist of our 4 heroes. And that's basically the reason I didn't touch the game since I completed most of the achievements. Would I recommend this game? It's alright. Not briliant, not as innovative as the first one, but certainly more polished, in some areas more that it should've been though.			"

												last year I played this after release with great anticipation expecting more ridiculous, overpowered spell fun with my friends and unfortunately this game fell leauges short of its predecessor. While admittedly some gameplay aspects from the previous title were improved upon such as permament gear for your player and movement while casting I have seen way too many problems to make this a worthwhile buy.First off, with the rebalance of spells from the first game what I have noticed is even on the easy preset this game is nigh unplayable on your own. the various spells we have come to memorize and love from the first installment have been nerfed to hell and back, leaving damage output to be paltry at best even when exploiting the ""weaknesses"" of certain enemies.Secondly, the protective spells from the first game have been rendered nearly useless. the Shift+E bubble sheild that many people have come to rely on to catch a quick breather from a fight is extremely fragile and cannot be bolstered by spamming space. Aside from this, multi resistance armor such as the FDSE combination favored in the first game have no use on the battlefeild, having near no protective properties left to it and the pure rock armor that seems to have replaced it is usually gone within 5 or so hits from your basic enemies, couple this with swarm tactics and an apparent increased damage output to the common enemy and you have spelled death for the player.I dearly hope that the complaints I have and those from other players are given consideration here, we all would hate to see what could have been a game that could have surpassed the original Magicka go the way of Leviathan: Warships, dropped like a hot brick.

												I love what they did on controller support. I wish they do it on Magicka 1. I think that was better. But meh this was fun. I'd say 5/10. If you don't own any Magicka, you can start with this. then play 1. :)I would NOT recommend this but I had some fun, like 6 hours of alone fun.			"

												Part of the appeal of Magicka 1 for me was how deadly and volatile it was to play when it first came out.  You could pretty much cast the advanced spells as fast as your fingers could rattle out the combos, and now cooldowns (can't let Magicka get too chaotic!) and quick slots (no need to flex the APM so much!  Also, cast Haste while wet) have taken the edge off that.  You were often one element and a second away from getting squished, and now you can respawn, press W, A then space over and over while you think of what to do next.  It's like a lot of the fun's been balanced out of it.The campaign is a lot duller and shorter than Magicka 1's too.  It's less mechanically inventive (less interesting fights and environmental interaction) and aesthetically imaginative (less visual variety).All that said, I enjoyed it enough to finish the campaign, but I only recommend this if you've wrung out Magicka already.

												I would like to play Magicka 2 with up to 3 friends, but it keeps disconnecting us for no real reason (or at least we cant figure it out). Otherwise this game is great. However it performs more like Magicka Wizard Wars than Magicka 1.			"

												After the wonderful time I had playing Magica 1, I sadly cannot endorse Magica 2. The pacing is way off. In 1 you could go gungho into the enemy or slow down and take it a baddy at a time. Magica 2 is a Fuster Cluck from the get go. I and a few friends played it and we spent most fo our time dead, asking for a rez because we hadn't realized we died or killed each other.It wound up being an excersize in frustration.Oh, yeah. And Vlad just would not shut the hell up.			"

												A nice break from handholding and forced gameplay mechanics. I love the fact the game lets you do stuff wrong.There was a time, games letting you experiment and do things wrong if you want to, was the norm. Not anymore.This is a welcome change. You can electrocute yourself or blow yourself up or you can even make a rock fall on your head.Love it.			"

												Longtime gamer here. I dont get all the negative reviews. I have been playing all kinds of games for over 20 years. And Magicka 2 is just beautiful in my opinion. Sure, there are probably too many cliches for some, and the campaign is really short, but STILL! Lets break this down...Pros:- great comedy- all kinds of references to e.g. Game of Thrones (John Frost.....)- addictive coop gameplay- feels like an infinite number of element combinations- awesome ""magicks"" that do all kinds of things- i love the multitude of different shields one can use- the scene with the goblin in the marble-space-prison... the drawings are just so pretty- the narration is gorgeous- Vlad. Tremendous.- The plotline is hilarious- lots of different staffs and melee weapons giving a fun twist like e.g. death apprentice robes let you heal yourself with arcane instead of lifeContra:- short campaign- clich√©s- familiars... i just dont like themIMHO the positives in this game just overweigh heavily. Great game. I love it. Playing it with my girlfriend. Some hours of fun guaranteed. I would love to see Magicka3.			"

												Coming from player of first game of the series, a short word on how i feel about the game.It tried to continue both Magicka and the Wisard Wars, which were 2 completely different games as concepts. Result: most spells and magicks got reworked, for example, no more qerasr for me and key combination for teleport magicka is changed so it's not as easily spammable as in the first game. Furthermore, game introduced cooldowns on magickas, so here comes another limiter. But other than that, the spell system stayed almosth the same (or similar enough) and the fact that it can now actually be played in co-op seals the deal (also, overal movement got better(and gamepad controlls which actually make sense)).Story is.... Well, the style of jokes in this game compared to the first one is worse imo. Though it might be just that my sense of humor changed over... how much was that? over the time between those 2 games being released. The spoiler-ish part of the story rable:  it went too hard on my feelings. I feel real sympathy towards antagonist of our 4 heroes. And that's basically the reason I didn't touch the game since I completed most of the achievements. Would I recommend this game? It's alright. Not briliant, not as innovative as the first one, but certainly more polished, in some areas more that it should've been though.			"

												Have to say when I played the first piece of this game I was hoocked, so naturaly when the second part came out i thought to myself how could they top that.Well they did it, the graphics of course and the multiplayer base frame make it a whole lot of fun to play with friends or perfect strangers.The new elements, spellwise are fun to experience and the feeling of making up your own spells as you go along is hellish fun. The story line is not too deep but that is simply part of the fun, specially when you have to deal with....you guessed the Infamous VLAD. The people who have played the first part will agree keeping him around was a wise decision.The handling of the game is well thought out, but still takes some getting used to. Specially when you are new, dont be surprised if you die a lot, sometimes even diying can be fun, and here they made it happen.To summon this up, if you want to play an online multiplayer game, and dont want to invest countless hours, this is the one to pick, but you can also conquer the game on your owne. You can start right of the bat.I hope you will enjoy this game just as much as I did.			"

												A great bloody game, however, if you wish for magick flingin' chaos, or just a game of wizards (and goblins, and orcs but not vampires) You should just buy the first one, better story, better spellin' and all around more fun. Oh and on a side note, put this on when you play either game:
