Price (regular): $29.99 ($39.99 for deluxe)Price (lowest): $7.49 (75% off)My overall rating: 9.5/10Easily one of my favorite games of all time.Value: 9/10Most other games this age are already down to $20, however the singleplayer is a lot longer than most other action/shooter games, making it well worth the price.Singleplayer: 10/10Amazing singleplayer. Capturing outposts is probably the best part. There are over 30 spread over the massive map. The main story has some pretty good action too. Plus there is hunting, racing, and assassination side missions and a lot of other things that are a lot of fun.Co-op: 5/10 (2-4 players)Co-op has some serious issues. When the match tries to launch it almost always crashes or freezes when loading. Due to this you wont be able to find players unless you are playing with friends. When it works it is decent but doesnt have the openness that makes far cry great. Update: co-op has been working better lately.Multiplayer: 6.5/10The multiplayer is actually pretty good, but a little generic. Doesn't have enough players to reach its full potential though.Content: 9.5/10Both the co-op and multiplayer are pretty basic, but the singleplayer makes up for it. You of course have the story and outposts, but there is also tons of ruins and caves to be explored for relics and loot, side missions, trials, races, dlc missions, and even knife throwing and poker.Length: 10/10An average playthrough of the singleplayer will take you roughly 30 hours, doing the main storyline capturing all the outposts and doing most of the side missions.Story: 8/10The story really tries to be great and in some ways it is but also is a little flat. You and your friends are having the time of your life until getting caught by slavers on a remote island. You escape and have to save your friends and liberate the natives from the pirates in the process.Gameplay: 10/10Very good, open gameplay. Most situations you can choose to attack however you like. Climb any mountain for a good vantage point with a sniper rifle, use stealth with a bow and using knife takedowns, attack head on with an lmg, or charge in with a truck with c4 planted on it.With freinds: 6/10The co-op and multiplayer are pretty fun with friends but doesnt have a lot of substance.Graphics: 9/10Good graphics, very good considering the scale of the game.Physics: 9.5/10Maybe not as smooth walking around a small area and shooting a few people as call of duty, but all in all the physics are a lot better than just about any other game. Driving really feels good. Good fire physics, you can light large areas of brush with a flamethrower.Performance: 9/10Works good for the most part. Can easily play it on max setting with my laptop, core i7 4810mq @ 2.80 GHz (turbo to 3.80 GHz) 12gbs ram and gtx870m 3gbs dedicated. Haven't had any notable issues or bugs.Sound: 8/10Sound is good but maybe a little rough here and there.Polished: 8/10Nothing majorly wrong with it but it does have the usual trees growing through rocks and animals spawning inside stuff.Atmosphere: 8.5/10The vast landscape gives you a good immersive feel but could be better if they didn't have so much of the same plants making it all feel the same.Objectives: 7/10Objectives are pretty basic. Pretty much go fight through these people and do (insert objective here). Some are a little more in depth.Clarity: 9/10No problems with knowing where to go or what to do. The story line is linear and very easy to follow.World: 9.5/10Unparalleled world. Massive world with large mountains, caves, ruins, shanty towns, vast foliage, ocean, and tons of wildlife to try and kill you. Although most of the landscape has the same trees and plants so a lot of it looks the same.Characters: 8/10The characters are interesting. The antagonists really make you want to kill them. All the characters are just a little thin but still good.UI: 6.5/10The menus are pretty poor. Pulling up your map is really slow. All other menus are in the escape menu which is pretty slow and not that great to navigate. Plus there's Uplay which is horrible.Controls: 9/10Mostly standard controls. Not my favorite layout but close enough I didn't feel the need to change anything.Freedom: 10/10As much freedom as you could ask for. You can ignor your current mission to go off capturing outpost, doing side mission, or just go for a nature hike.Influence: 2.5/10The story itself is very linear. Only choice in the game is the ending and what happens after.Settings: 9/10Four difficulty setting so good for most any skill level. Average control options.Character progression: 6/10Sometimes feels like they resticked what you can do at the beginning instead of allowing you to do more later on.Weapon selection: 9/10Has plenty of weapons. Handguns, SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns, LMGs, sniper rifles, launchers, explosives, and specials. Over 30 total, though some feel similar.Customization: 7/10Most weapons can be modded. Higher level guns can have up to 3 mods. Mods incude extended mags, silencers, and several types of sights, though most guns are limited on which mods are available. Almost all weapons can be painted.AI: 8.5/10For the most part the ai is fairly intelegent. Considering what they have to do in an open world unrelated to a story, it's very good. Though this causes a few quirks.Up to date: 9/10Only came out at the end of 2012 and there isn't any notable aging to the game. Not lacking anything that newer games might have.Replayability: 8.5/10The story doesnt give incentive replay it, but since you can whatever you like however you like, the rest of the game has a lot of replay value.Pace: 8.5/10For such a long game the balance between length and action is very good. You can go straight to the next mission, rush through a few outposts, or take your time doing everything at your own pace.Repetitiveness: 8/10If you were to just walk up with an assault rifle everytime it would probably get very repetitive, but change up your approach everytime and it won't be much at all.Realism: 8.5/10It has some good aspects and a few poor ones when it comes to how realistic it is. Even compared to other games the amount of people you are able to kill is a little ridiculous. It has some supernatural elements which isn't bad but they are a little lame and seem to be inspired by acid trips. Other than that it's actually got good physics and overall better than most games.DLC: 5/10The downloadable content is all pretty mediocre. A few independent short story missions that are okay, some co-op and multiplayer content, and a few other things that are all insignificant.Achievements: 6/1050 achievements but only on Uplay not Steam, and 6 are for co-op making them near impossible. The rest of the achievements are great. Good amount and some challenging but nothing too hard.Trading cards: N/ADoesn't have Steam badges/trading cards.Series improvement: 10/10Far Cry 2 was a good game, however has aged a lot and lacked in a few aspects. Far Cry 3 did a great job at improving and made a very well rounded, good performing game.Originality: 10/10Bottom line is that no other game is very much like Far Cry. Maybe slightly similar to games like Just Cause or some RPGs and it may have some Tomb Raider elements but not enough that its overall gameplay is at all the same as anything else.			"

												So, here's my final verdict for Far Cry 3. Well, I'm currently doing my fourth playthrough of the game (been doing every difficulty) And I still enjoy it just as much as when the first time I played it. I guess that tells you a little bit if the gameplay/story is good, if not, let me go deeper into it. Story: Without spoiling anything, I'm going to briefly tell you what the game is about. You're jason, some guy who was on a nice trip with his friends until everything went downhill. You find yourself caged with your brother on an island full of crazy pirates.Then you have Vaas, in my opinion one of the coolest villains ever in video game history. Actually, I'm not gonna tell you anything about him, why don't you just get the game and take a look yourself? Throughout the game, you become more powerful, powerful enough to decide you want to take down the people who run the Islands. Are you able to do so, though? You can only find out yourself. There are 2 different endings. Gameplay: Far Cry 3 offers a LOT. It's not your regular shooter, no, It's more like.. Hmm, It's quite hard to say really. On Rook Island, you can find plants, animals and useful gear to upgrade your Jason with. You do this by crafting either ammo pouches, medicine, or useful items that can make hunting a little easier. There's quite a lot of different weapons to find/buy, and they all seem to be pretty damn well done. I didn't find any guns that seem underpowered. A single playthrough of the game should take you well over 20 hours, maybe even 30, if you take your time to explore the amazing landscape and secrets the island has to offer. I don't want to go on too much, so I'm just gonna leave you guys to decide wether or not to get the game. Would I recommend it? YES. Absolutely YES. There's nothing you can go wrong with here. Oh, before I miss it, this game support MODS. If you want more of a challenge, try out Ziggy's Mod. It makes the game a lot more challenging by removing the hud, spotting and free weapons. My final verdict for Far Cry 3 is a 9/10. Only because it wasn't a perfect game, I still wish the multiplayer could be worked on a bit more, but the 9 goes to the singleplayer alone. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope you'll get your hands on this amazing game. :)			"

												Far Cry 3 is maybe one of those games that really would put anyone in the protagonist's feelings. It is an open world game that makes you think throughout any kind of missions such as stealth, dinamic or other ways of dominating outposts and the entire island. Unlike Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3 is more into the first game made from the Far Cry series, in the way that the action is based on a dangerous, hostile island and the protagonist has to make his way to get away from it. The storyline is as thrilling as it can be, stuck on a place you do not know, pirates, enemies, predators, all sorts of plants that you have to collect so you can survive, an insane journey. The main character has little battle and combat experience, so he has to learn how to survive from scratch, little supplies, he is going to be helped by many people who will soon become his buddies/friends. During the game, you have to gain the ""tatau"", which is their way of calling ""tattoos"". They are essential from the beginning of the game to the very end; they are the symbols of a whole, representing the skills you have to gain in order to finish Far Cry 3.One more interesting fact is introducing the bow. The protagonist can finally use the bow and customize it in the way the player wants to, paint it, use different arrows etc.Last but not least, there are lost loots, lost letters, relics, radio towers to activate (to free new guns) and other things that need you to be discovered, in the game, you can play games such as poker, throwing knives, car races, in order to gain or lose (in bad luck :/) money. I have played this game for more than 30 hours, and I can say i have not finished even half of it (the storyline is excellent). The missions, outposts, helping people in need, searching for artifacts and so on is just amazing for any of us to try.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is willing to try it :)Thank you for reading this review, I would also like to ask, my readers, to comment upon this review, whether good or bad, I would be more than pleased to know your pieces of advice. ^_^			"

												The sandbox world has just about everything you could ask for. The only thing I can think of that is missing is an actual volcano, otherwise the two islands that make up this game's playable area are everything you'd expect on a tropical island. The addition of wildlife in this game adds such an aspect of realism, I found myself stalking a tiger just to watch him take down a deer or goat. This addition also adds a new type of terror/suspense to the game. There is nothing like quickly trying to escape a firefight that you plundered into, running through the jungle and finally escaping your assailants, just to be mauled and pummeled by a tiger. While the resilience and toughness of some of the animals detracts from realism, it certainly adds to the anxiety. The firefights, especially towards the beginning are very intense. Until you unlock enough of the ""skills"" to boost your health bars and make body armor more effective, only a couple of bullets will drop you on the intermediate setting. However this is followed by most of the enemies being easily eliminated by a small string of fire to center mass. What is different for this game is the implementation of cover. While the system is a little rough around the edges, it does allow you to hide behind cover and then peek out and fire rounds off at hostiles.The challenge in this game comes mostly from the improved use of enemy AI. While they are still not brilliant, they do notice sounds and are spooked by finding their buddy lying dead on the ground. The enemy itself will work together to suppress and kill you, as well as take cover to hide from your fire. The confrontations with some of the islands predators is also challenging, as well as occasionally terrifying, though the idea of a shark attack bothers me anyways. The enemies are also specialized, making some of them quite difficult to kill and makes plotting strikes against enemy establishments require careful and thorough planning.The game overall is worth every penny just for the single player. The addition to weapon customizations and the improved system controls, should also make this an interesting and likely worthy multiplayer. This game has a few small quirks, and no one should expect a Shakespeare story, but you should expect hours of thrills and plenty of enjoyment.			"

IntroductionI am Tigerfrost. I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.How I Found Out About ""Far Cry 3""Well, where to start. To put it simply, I rented Far Cry 3 on the Ps3 a little while after it came out. After it's release, weeks went by, as I heard more and more about Far Cry 3. Nothing was spoiled, but I heard so many good things about it. At the time, I really didn't have the money, so I decided to rent the game, like I use to do back in the day.After picking up the game, I was able to play through about half of it, before needing to take it back. However, around Christmas, my parents got me Far Cry 3 on the Ps3 and I was able to finish my adventure.About six months after that, I saw the Deluxe Edition of Far Cry 3 on sale on Steam, and picked it up. Then things became really good. Unfair FIrst ImpressionsEvery game genre gets hate by some people. Mainly because of opinions, which is okay. There are genre' I don't like, and others I do. However, the main thing I see about Far Cry 3 in reviews that give it a low score is.....Uplay. Why, oh why must you give the GAME a bad score because it uses Uplay? I understand, it's annyoing at times, especially needing to run it through two different clients, but to give the game itself a bad score because it uses Uplay, is very unfair. I have never had any problems running Far Cry 3 through both Steam & Uplay. Basically, when it says someone is playing Far Cry 3 on Steam, they actually have their Uplay open, as the game itself doesn't need to be running to say you're actually in-game.Not to mention, Far Cry 3 has crafting in it, along with survival tactics. Someone went as far to report the game for being a Minecraft clone because of it. Review Of ""Far Cry 3""Far Cry 3 is an open world, first person shooter, survival type game. With a very in depth story. Good and memorable characters. Amazing world, and game mechanics. The game takes you in the shoes of ""Jason Brody"", a rich kid who takes a vaction to an island with a group of friends. Before having enough time to enjoy themselves, Jason and his friends find themselves captured by pirates ruled by ""Vass"". It's Jason's job to break out of the slave camp and get his friends back. Having never shot or killed anyone, it is up to you to learn how to take down your foe using a wide variety of weapons. Using drugs made off of plants from the jungle, and working alongside people like Denis. Can you make it happen?Far Cry 3 allows you to form your story. Everyone's playthrough will be different. The world of Far Cry 3. The world is massive. In my Just Cause 2 review, I talked about the world being massive, but mostly empty. Here, the world is not only massive, it isn't empty. Everywhere there is something to collect, capture, destroy, hide from, or DIE from. The world is split between two islands, which take part at different sections of the story. Each lush with plains, jungle's , a lot of killer animals, green, some more green, beautiful oceans and caves. Far Cry 3 is a graphically intense looking game. The views are just amazing. The world is populated by loot, like weapons, money, and relics. There are also deadly animals, like the Tiger, or Cassowary. Not only that, pirates, who only mean to kill you. Far Cry 3 does it nicely, where the whole game isn't out to kill you. The pirates will get into fights with the natives. Angry animals will attack civilians, and pirates. You could sit at a far, watching through the scope of a sniper rifle, as a Tiger slips through the enemy defense and takes down a group. Thrown about this world are these plants. These plants can be used to craft drugs to help you with many things. Like detecting animals, or increasing maximum health, etc. Along with crafting drugs, you can also craft other items. Like wallets to carry more money, weapon holsters to carry more weapons, or munitions pouch to carry more grenades. One thing that's strange about this is the fact that you must skin animals to craft these. However, for one thing you might need 2 Tiger skin, and the next, 1 Deer skin, see my problem with this?Scatered around the world are strongholds or ""outposts"" that are controlled by the pirates. You can take these down by killing all pirates on the inside. By capturing one of these strongholds, it makes the territory around you safe, and creates a fast travel system. Now, how you approach these strongholds to take them down is all up to you. You have full freedom to do what you want. You could run right in with heavy machine guns blazing it out. You sit from a far with a sniper rifle and pick them off. You could sneak in, perform takedowns and use a stealth recurve bow. Or you could lure an animal into the base. There are so many things you could do. To take down these strongholds, you need weapons, right? Worry no more. The weapons provided in Far Cry 3 consist of pistols, SMG's, Assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, HMG's, flare gun's, flame throwers, and way more.Now, while on a mission, though they provide a good story, you are restricted most of the time. Meaning you can't really approach the way you may want to. Alongside the main story, you of course have side missions. These are of two types, but work and are fun. The first of them being the Hunter missions. Where you take out an animal for various reasons. The second being the Wanted Dead missions, where it is your job to take down a baddie with your knife/machete. You also earn XP for getting kills and completing missions. XP will gain you skill points, which then lead to you choosing a skill you'd like. One problem with this system is, you don't have access to all the skills until you get futher into the story. As the skills move on, they get kind of more useless. However that's just my opinion.If there is really anything else I don't care about in this game, it's that the second half falls short of the first half. It doesn't really keep the hype going, it kind of dies down. Thoughts (Other)I'd like to post this here. Far Cry 3 is so far my most favorite single player experience of all time. The story was great, the gameplay was great. The soundtrack is amazing, and brings man tears. This was one of the best things I have ever played. Now a days, I use a hardcore mod. Mods are available for Far Cry 3 that can fix things, or make the game more realistic and hard. Now, obviously Far Cry 3 being my favorite, I cannot wait for the release of Far Cry 4 which only comes in a couple weeks. I cannot WAIT.Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Far Cry 3 is a great game that is well worth the time. For the story, the world, and the gameplay. Every piece of this game is full of greatness. You ability to do what you want beings a new level to video games. We need more, like this.Pro's:+Amazing story.+Great memorable characters.+Beautiful world that's full of life.+Great weapon mechanics.+Fantastic gameplay.+Big populated open world.Con's:-Second half of game falls a little short.-Multiplayer feels just slapped on.-Some of the crafting is strange.-Skill tree could use a little work.Overall Rating: About a 14/15 (Must Own!)Credits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.			"

												Far Cry 3 is one of those open-world games that actually makes you FEEL you'd WANT to explore the Rook Islands with its varied wild flora AND fauna (hostile or indifferent), as well as the various enemies (pirates or privateers) and with the Rakyat assisting at times. The story missions are quite a lot of fun, and if you level up properly none of them are very difficult (i.e. do the stealth kills and try to take down outposts undetected to get extra XP for the skills). You started out as a party guy Jason Brody, who can't do anything. Your brother Grant was the ex-Army, and somehow you ended up captured on this island held by pirates and right in the INTRO sequence your brother got killed and your mad dash to freedom ended up with you diving over a waterfall, but you lived, and you woke up in a village, and handed your first mission... and a wimply pistol... get up this tower on top of the hill, and activate it. From there on, you steadily progress from a wimpy adrenaline junky to a fearsome killing machine capable of mowing down squads of professional mercenaries with LMG or assault rifle, hit wings off a fly at 100 yards with a sniper rifle, blade dance with professional knife fighters, stealth kill like a ninja, as you liberate the Rook Islands from two megalomaniacs, Vaas, and his boss, Hoyt, while recovering your friends one by one. The islands are beautiful, and the animals behave independently of you. Goats and Buffalos and pigs and more wander the landscape, and predators like bears, leopards, even tigers wander the wild hunting them, and if you get in the way, you as well. In the ocean there are bull sharks and regular fish, and in the swamps there are crocodiles. Yes, it's a ton of fun exploring the place. There are small villages, pirate and merc outposts (that you can liberate... by killing everybody), unoccupied villages that were sites of atrocities, more radio towers you can deactivate, plus for the obssessive collectors, various artifacts to collect, such as 120 relics from the past cultures (including one from Chinese history!) letters from the Japanese WW2 occupation (plenty of bodies left around), memory cards left in outposts detailing the sordid narc industry links of Rook Island, as well as different animals and plants (they go in the survival handbook). There are also untold number of caves, underground passages, leading to totally unknown areas deep within the bowels of the island that makes you wonder if you're playing Tomb Raider. :D  Indeed, the radio towers and many other sequences do require a bit of jumping and climbing to accomplish. Even on the surface, there are random things happening. Friendly and enemy jeeps patrol the routes. Enemy soldiers will patrol, and sometimes, force march prisoners / slaves on the road. You may engage, or not as you see fit, but they are excellent source of XPs, as valid as any one. And animals do roam the island, as it is wild out there. There are plenty of side missions, some of which are handed out by locals, like ""help find my daughter, who ran away with boyfriend!""  in addition to the story missions. Furthermore, conquered outposts often have bounty missions (kill a pirate or a merc and his minions) as well as ""path of the hunter"" missions (hunt down X animals using provided weapons). (HINT: you only have to use the same CLASS of weapon, not the specific weapon. If they provide a regular .45ACP, bring your customized .44 Magnum or .50AE Desert Eagle)Ah, speaking of weapons... lots and lots of weapons. Pistols, sniper rifles, shotguns, assault rifiles, grenade launchers, light machine guns, special weapons (including recurve bow), and signature weapons. Some weapons can be customized with different type of sights, extended magazines, even a suppressor. And there are different paintjobs available too. Add the oddballs, like repair tool (welding torch), flamethrower, and even a flare gun... and things can get interesting indeed. Did I mention that many vehicles have mounted weapons, like a HMG that you can wield?  How you tackle mission (usually involving killing everybody at a certain place) is entirely up to you. Run and gun? Snipe and hide? Silent and deadly? Lure and ambush? It is all up to you. When you have the best sniper rifle (.50 cal with suppressor two-stage zoom scope) you can kill even a heavy with a single shot to the head from afar. There are also sometimes captured predators that you can ""liberate"" with a shot to the cage, thus letting it attack the enemies in the camp for you! Remember, bonus points if you were never detected (1500 xp instead of 500 xp). I have tried many open-world games before, from Far Cry 2 to Mercenaries 2, from GTA 3 (and sequels) to many others. Far Cry 3 stands above the rest because it is so well balanced. it doesn't unlock too many skills (some require you to unlock via story missions) at once, no matter how much XP you accumulated. it also doesn't unlock the 2nd island until well past 75% point. At each point you are reminded of the stakes you're playing with... the lives of your friends that may still be in pirate's hands, and each and every one will be scarred for life. The villians are psychopaths, but interesting psychopaths. And the other characters that you meet? They all have their own motivations, which may or may not match your own. Somehow, FC3 just struck the right balance between too ""scattered brained"", i.e. ""Too many choices! What do I do now?"" vs. ""where's the freedom? I am bored, I want to do something ELSE""...  And there are plenty of variety in the missions as well as outposts. On the hunt missions, you have to use the specified weapon class/type., which can be challenging, such as hunting tigers with a pistol, or bears with a shotgun. On the bounty missions, you are to kill the one or two ""leaders"" with your blade. The rest are up to you with no restrictions. Just keep in mind in late game there can be two leaders with a dozen minions around them, and killing them all can be a difficult endeavor, esp. if you can only knife the leaders. The skills you learn are divided into three categories: crane, shark, and spider, which of which has a different ""tree"". As mentioned before, they are unlocked by progressing in the story missions and can be learned by spending ""skill points"" which are earned by every few thousand XP. And they add a lot of fun abilities, such as chain takedowns, knife throw take down, grenade takedown, double take down, death from above, death from below, and so on. There are bazillion crates scattered on the island, each containing some artifacts and/or money. You can further loot the bodies (enemy or friendly) for more artifacts, many of which can be sold for $$$. If you have killed some fauna, you cna often skin them for making containers / slings for ammo, wallet, and so on, and it's the only way you can carry more weapons, more ammo, even more money. In fact, you can also craft herbal medicine from the plants you gathered (which are generically divided into ""colored leaves"", and you need X of Red and Y of yellow and so on. As you progress you'll learn other formulas, like animal repellant, hunting instinct (lets you see animals, even behind hills), as well as herbal medicine that just heals you, deep dive potion that lets you go below 60 meters deep, and more. All in all, Far Cry 3 is a ton of fun with variety of missions, side mission, as well as plenty of freeform encounter play. The story of growth and one man's journey from wimp to hero is the story of the player. And THAT ultimately, is why it's so much fun.			"

												Far cry 3's best moments are also some of my best moments in gaming, I'll leave my love for this game aside and try be fair evaluating it's aspects.First of all, you can feel the Far cry 2 engine here, similar animations and gunplay, but its definitley improved. Graphics are pretty, shaders could have been a little less saturated for a more realistic look, but its an art direction choice, still beautiful anyway! I found a few bugs, objects revealing geometry, shadows loading in a weird way and black textures appearing on roads whenever I was nearby, It breaks immersion but don't compromise the fun.Gameplay is fluid, animations are well made, guns feel powerful and there are plenty to choose from your loadout, you can craft boosts from herbs you harvest in the jungle, use a bow that add's a Hunter feel that we all love, and take a stealthy approach if that's your thing, that was something I wasn't sure it would work out well but It did, I finished the game using the knife and bow mostly.Performance is pretty fair, the game runs well if you have a good machine and still pretty even on medium specs, I played this with an GTS450 on medium and then maxed out with a 650ti Boost, running with 40fps most of the time.Story and characters are quite memorable, did I ever tell you the definition of good character design? you got it.After you finish the story you still have activities to complete, hunt & assassination missions, outposts to clear,  towers to climb and work your magic to unlock new weapons, it's a very rewarding game and it has lore on every item you acquire. I still have to try the co-op, if you're reading this maybe we should give it a try!? tl;dr+ Open world+ Memorable story and characters+ Gun customization and variety+ Stealth is an option + Replay value + Burning weed with Skrillex™- Minor graphic bugs sometimes- Requires Ubi-Launcher- DLC is Irrelevant and Skippable- Dead multiplayer			"

												Far Cry 3 is an excellent singleplayer game with a great free-roaming experience, a lot to do, memorable characters and a good and highly confusing storyline (At least, the first half of it.. it does fall off a little afterwards). Sadly there is not much in the sense of survival going on and sometimes it can become a bit of a grind, but the gameplay is a ton of fun. Although the co-op missions can be enjoyable, multiplayer is really not the reason you should be getting this. Instead, definitely get it for the amazing singleplayer. Full review:

												Warning: If you buy this game, you will have to download UPlay and make a Ubisoft account. Had I known this I would have never bought the game. The Ubisoft DRM is unreasonably strict. If you have an unstable internet connection (like myself), you will be yanking out your hair in frustration every time you try to save, access your skill tree, or craft an item since everything is halted to check your internet connection.The gameplay is solidThe models are highly detailed.The animations are fluidThe characters are interesting.The stealth gameplay is good.The game is pretty well optimized.This is an otherwise AMAZING game ruined by DRM.

												""Do you know the definition of insanity?""SummaryFar Cry 3 is the first game I ever completed 100%. I did all the side quests, I got all the relics and skills, I found all the letters, I got all the ink for my tatau, I crafted everything there was to craft, and I'd do it all again. Far Cry 3 is one of my favorite games of all time, it's story was enticing and made me question all the things I did by the end, it had strong gameplay that rewarded you for being a ghost but didn't punish you for going into a base guns blazing, it had a dynamic environment and you could just spend an hour doing but drive around and hunt and never get bored.

Exceptional open-world shooter with a dark twistFar Cry 3 was developed by Ubisoft Montréal & Shanghai and published late 2012 to great ciritcal acclaim. I played it only recently (early 2015), but even though some years old, this game feels like it was made recently. As the third installment in the famous Far Cry franchise, it continues upon the open-world orientated gameplay establised by Far Cry 2, while fixing almost all of the problems that game had and offering a feel and way of playing all of its own.The game makes one identify to a degree with Jason Brody, the playable protagonist who is taken captive together with his friends on a tropical island by a gang of pirates lead by someone called Vaas. The opening sequence of the game, from the initial cutscene with the rather vainly partying friends up to the first encounter with Vaas and the escape from his claws, stands out as a classic way of making clear what a game is all about. Vaas is a sinister character, as dark and evil as one could imagine, and more. His fascination with utter violence and the madness of the human mind offers some memorable gaming moments, that made me stare at my screen in utter disbelief and will stay with me for a long time.Jason Brody starts out as a rather unsure would-be-hero, who is shocked whenever he sees someone killed, and who is very reluctant to kill himself. But his encounter with the sheer evil of Vaas and his fellow criminals, gradually turns him into a killing machine, with only one goal: to free his friends, and ultimately seek revenge. The game cleverly underscores this development by offering some role-playing element: finishing missions or killing enemies grants experience points and levels you up so that you can acquire several abilities which help to overcome obstacles more easily. While the game is rather challenging during its first hours, with raising in level and acquiting more special abilities and better weapons it gets easier, which helps to get the idea of turning into a mean killing machine rather well.Apart from Jason Brody and Vaas, Far Cry 3 contains several interesting and even unique characters along with three ""factions"" spread out on two distinct islands. There are too many characters to mention them all, but standing out apart from Vaas is Citra, the priestess of the natives who introduces an almost palpable sexual, brooding tension into the game. One of the best parts of the game is the excellent voice-acting: every charachter, how odd or sinister, is made completely believable through his or her voice.The world itself is huge: longer journeys can take up to ten minutes, even by car, jeep or boat (of which there are several types). All in all, the story is not only gripping and very well told, it is combined with the freedom of an open world in a very convincing way. You can play this game in several different ways, the options being almost limitless. Following the main story is a valid possibility, but I found it more interesting to divert from this quite often, roaming around in the astoundingly beautiful world in order to capture an enemy outpost (either by force, stealth or cunning, the choice is once more yours!), gather some useful plants or just hunt for animals (who offer several rewards as well).Apart from the 38 missions in the main storyline, there are over two hundred (!!) side-missions, ranging from stealth kills to hunting specific animals with a specific weapon, trying one's driving skills in a race, climbing communication towers in order to reveal parts of the map or even playing some poker. The amount of gaming hours to be got in singleplayer alone runs into several dozens or more, comparable to a game in that other famous open-world franchise, Assassin's Creed. I tried the multiplayer as well, but the servers are almost empty by now, alone the rather bland co-op still offers some possibilities.Apart from the amazing game- and gunplay, the game is a prime example of state-of-the-art graphics and sound, excellently optimized and hardly showing that it was primarily aimed at consoles. It runs flawlessly on my 7-year old pc with a 2,66 Ghz cpu, 4 GB ram and a GeForce GTX 650 ti. All the expected options and tweaks for optimal performance are there, but it has to be said: the game does look much better on the highest settings (very high or ultra), so even if it costs you some fps, do try those. The one thing that could offset several players is the mandatory use of the ""infamous"" Uplay, a platform that gets huge criticism more often than not. However, for me Uplay just works fine, not only in this but in every other game I played on it. Granted, the achievements are a bit pointless since they don't show on Steam, but the possibility of unlocking extra content by gaining U-points in quite nice. Apart from that, the few dlc packets for the game are completely superfluous, but that's a very, very minor criticism.Anyone interested in the recent developments of first-person shooters or in the way a modern game can tell a story in combination with an open gaming world, should buy and play this game.Gameplay: 28/30Graphics: 19/20Sound: 9/10Longelivety: 9/10Technical: 9/10Steam Integration: 6/10 (Uplay required, but that works fine for me)Personal appreciation: 10/10Overall: 90/100			"

												Well....  I had to start again due to lost saves  after playing it for 15 hours the first time, however done and dusted now and still plenty of game left to be fair. Loads of side missions left to complete, outposts to liberate and radio towers to climb and activate. This is a really big game.I completed the story, most of crafting tree, most of the level up tree and a good chunk of side missions.Interesting story... if somewhat ridiculous... but all in all a really enjoyable game. You don't play through the story nearly twice if it's pants do you?Much more fun the second time through with the new GFX card and slikly smooth framerates, great fun playing on the big screen too with the surround sound. Not a perfect game, but an enjoyable one and I certainly got my £15.99 out of it and may return to finish off missions here and there. We'll see though.			"

												Solution to the Uplay issue: Disable the Uplay overlay1) Go into Uplay settings2) General settings tab3) Untick the ""enable in-game overlay for supported games"" box4) Start the game and click to confirm you want to start the game without the Uplay overlay onThe issue is Steam AND Uplay tries to enable their overlays to the game which cancel out and makes the game freeze and crash. By disabling the Uplay overlay, it allows Steam to take over and the game runs smoothly. I had this issue for about 5 months before figuring it out, sadly.Review: Solid game, played it on console back in the day when it first came out but never finished the story, just fooled around in the open-world. 4/5 stars. Only 4 stars because the graphics are slightly dated in 2016. Good tropical setting, amazing story, good believable antagonist (the voice acting is where the villian really shines). It's better than Far Cry 4 in all departments besides graphics. There's even more players on Far Cry 3 than all of the Far Cry titles on Steam (perhaps the summer sale has something to do with it, who knows?).			"

												It might not be fair to ""downvote"" this game for that reason, but I feel it needs to be mentioned. The ""Steam"" version of the game also bundles a ton of crapware that gets installed on your PC, whether you want it or not. Namely, it installs Ubisoft's ""Uplay"" DRM/Steam-like system. It also forces you to create an Uplay account. Basically, Steam serves as a glorified CD-key seller, whereas your CD-key actually needs to copied and activated on UPLAY.I think this is unacceptable. We buy games on Steam, because it's a streamlined delivery method, and the DRM is handled by Steam itself (or at least transparent to the user). If Ubisoft wants to shove their DRM and services down everyone's throat, that is fine, but Steam should not be enabling them without being very explicit to their players. Of course, there are no refunds, and uninstalling the game DOES NOT remove all of the installed crapware.			"

For me it's one of the best Single Player game.Gameplay - 10/10Beautiful world depicted on the tropical island, giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore caves, forests, mountains, hunting for animals on land and under water. We can attack the enemy camps and capture them. These sandbox gives many, many opportunities.Storyline - 9/10Story is presented in a nice method. We have many ways to pass the mission. We can do it quietly or destroying and killing everything what we meet on the way. The story is for 10h game.Characters - 10/10Each character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. My favorite character in this game is Vaas Montego, he fits to this game like a ""fist to the eye"". Is also a plus, we can choose the path of the main character.Graphics - 9/10Graphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. Water, sky, trees, etc. are beautiful.Sounds - 10/10Music and ambient sounds in this game is great fits. I liked moment with Skrillex (Make It Bun Dem), but I don't wanna spoiler. Animals noises are natural.Overall - 10/10If you are thinking about purchase this game, if you like open world and First-Person Shooter games, I would recommend these game for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun comes from the game.

 Doesn't Play Nice With Windows 10	This is a very good game. Still looks good, even today. A competant story (that eventually runs out of steam hard toward the end), and at this point an iconic villian. Fun gameplay and will run like butter on most modern systems.Oh hello there windows 10, care to screw it all up?So yeah at least in my case and a couple other forum users, Windows 10 made launching this game a nightmare. Either it wont launch through steam at all or it will immediately crash. Here's what you do:Go to your folder for the game, for example: C: > Program Files 86 > Steam > Steamapps > Common > Far Cry 3 > binRight Click on farcry3_d3d11.exe (not farcry3.exe), go to properties > compatibility and set it to windows 7 (8 may work too but i use 7). Then launch THAT executable and only that one. Should work fine then.If you're willing to deal with that headache, then it's still a great game.			"

												The game itself is enjoyable, but I can no longer play it. A couple months ago I uninstalled this game because I wasn't playing it. After installing it I can no longer access my Uplay account because Uplay wouldn't accept my password. I tried to recover my password, but Uplay refused to send me a password recovery email. I tried to get support, but in order to get Uplay support you have to log in to Uplay. I can't play anymore because Uplay won't let me log in. Thanks, Ubisoft. You truly are my greatest ally.Also if you're wondering ""Why didn't you make an account to contact support?"" Well I did, but even after a couple months I never did get that confirmation email.[No Spoilers and tl;dr at the bottom]Edit: After numerous comments asking me to change my review to postive, I've decided to go in-depth as to what I think about the game. I'd advise you to take my opinions with a grain of salt because I haven't been able to play the game in about a year. As for the game itself I would say that it's enjoyable at best. The story isn't interesting in the slightest, but the occasions when Vaas shows up can be quite entertaining. I would say that Vaas was the only reason the story slightly interested me at all because I didn't care at all about my friends. Why would I considering they weren't developed enough for me to even care? Without spoilers the ending gives 2 choices that you have to make on the spot and none of them effect anything. They're not satisfying and the only reason there are 2 choices is because you gotta have that variety right? Anyways I don't think that the story is the reason people play Far Cry 3, because the game is more focused towards free-roam. The world is big, but there isn't much to do. You can hunt, do some side missions, take down enemy outposts, pick flowers, find some collectables, but that's about it. There isn't much going on around you so it makes the world feel empty. I don't remember seeing many animals besides a couple of herds and a few lone panthers. When you take down an outpost the enemies stop spawning in the area, which makes sense, but it makes that area far more boring and almost usless in terms of replay value. One thing they did to fix this is that you can reset the outposts when they're all overtaken. It's a much appreciated feature that should add a lot of replay value if you've enjoyed the main game. There is around 4 weapons for each class (Snipers, pistols, rifles and such) and some special weapons, but most of the common weapons are just generic. A few good examples of the less generic weapons are the A2000, U100, Flamethrower, and BZ19. Shooting in this game shouldn't be that interesting, but it feels much more satisfying due to the fantastic animations. One last thing I liked is that you can customize if you want to go in with a stealthy or more explosive approach. The game gives you a lot of options if we're talking about how you want to approach enemies.I'd say if you want to have a game you can play sometimes and have a bit of fun go ahead and buy this one. If I remember correctly there is co-op so that might be fun with your friends. I've never tried it, but it might be worth a shot. Twenty dollars isn't too bad of a price, but at that price you're better off getting Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Bioshock 1, Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Insurgency, Fallout New Vegas, Splinter Cell Choas Theory, or Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon (I like the atmosphere and weapons in Blood Dragon more than 3 because it feels a lot more unique. Also it has laser guns + lazer lizards) If you want a free-roam jungle fps I don't know any others besides Far Cry 3, so if you want to play this game specifically for that reason alone it wouldn't be too bad of an idea to get this. If you want this for the story just look it up on Youtube. If you want this just for Vaas, refer to my previous statement.tl;dr: Get it if you want a free-roam fps jungle game. The story sucks, Vass is kind of cool, and the free roam and variety of approaches may be the deal breaker for you. It's all right as a free-roam game, but don't expect to be blown away at all or interested for more than 20 hours. There is co-op but I can't say anything about that sense I haven't played it. It might be worth a try with your friends.			"

Just don't.You need uPlay to play it, and there is so much DRM involved that you WILL have gamebreaking bugs because of it. Welcome to the wonderful world of Ubisoft.Again, don't buy it.

												Far Cry 3 was my introduction to the Far Cry franchise. Now I’m not a huge fan of first person shooters (FPS) but there are some goods and this is one of them. This is a open world game which other then the story missions to advance the main objectives you can play how you like.  Set on an island where you Jason Brody must free your friends from the psychotic Vaas.  And there are times you wish you could play as Vaas or enter his mind at least because he is an first-class psycho.  Rook island is a land semi-forgotten by the world.  Where you hunt down relics of the ancient ancestors that lived on the island.  See and feel the effects of World War 2 on this Pacific island.  Truly a world where anything goes and does happen.  The story happens in a nonlinear fashion but as you progress you will see how it all fits together and how this forges your champion Jason Brody.  And the nice thing about the far cry series is each game is its own other then being an open world shooter you don't need to play them in an particular order.  If your looking for a game you can run through swamps, jungles, and mountains you found it don't get me wrong it is no Skyrim on that size but it will take you a good 10+ to get from one side to another.  But if you are one of the people that has to everything in a game you can easily get 60+ hours of play time.  The biggest downside of the game is your friends you are rescuing how they seem unaffected by this island.  The graphics are awe inspiring and the cut scenes will have your heart racing especially.....* NO SPOILERS*  Get the game and find out for yourself. "

												Far Cry 3 is a first-person shooter action game created by Ubisoft Montreal in 2012.The player, Jason Brody, skydives with friends and ends up on an island full of pirates and natives called Rakyat that are in conflict . Jason escapes but is unconscious. An inhabitant of the island, a Rakyat called Denis rescues him and performs a tattoo that gives Jason powers. This is the first step on his journey to become a warrior. From there he must find and free his friends.The game is a sandbox, and the main story is just a little part of it, the player is free to make a huge amount of fun activities. Play racing , throw knives , face challenges, hunt animals , free towers and regain positions held by pirates. The game has the graphic quality of a first person shooter with the freedom of an RPG .The graphics engine is called Dunia Engine. The graphic quality is very good , similar to Crysis, awesome for being a Sandbox. Far Cry3 was one of the best and most complete games of 2012. Extremely funny and fascinating.It is a worthy successor to Far Cry , well above the poor Far Cry 2 . A true wonder for lovers of external environments and forests in games.The game was released for PC , PS3 and XBOX 360. The PC version has superior graphics and a powerful graphics card with DirectX 11 is seriously recommended.And Trisha the Warrior ..... ohh, I can't tell you how hot she is.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Far Cry 3 es un juego de acción en primera persona creado por Ubisoft Montreal en 2012.

Un habitante de la Isla, Rakyat, Denis, lo rescata y le realiza un tatuaje que le brinda poderes y es el primer paso para convertirse en un guerrero. A partir de allí deberá buscar y liberar a sus amigos. El juego es un sandbox, si bien tiene su historia principal, el jugador es libre de hacer una enorme cantidad de actividades divertidas. Jugar carreras, lanzar cuchillos, enfrentar desafíos, cazar animales, liberar torres y recuperar puestos tomados por los piratas. El juego posee la calidad de un shooter en primera persona con la libertad de un juego de rol.  El motor gráfico se denomina Dunia Engine. La calidad gráfica es muy buena, similar a un Crysis, impresionante para ser un Sandbox. Fue uno de los mejores y más completos juegos del año 2012. Sumamente divertido y fascinante. Es un digno sucesor del Far Cry, muy superior al pobre Far Cry 2. Una verdadera maravilla para los amantes de los juegos en selvas paradisíacas con entornos externos y animales.El juego se lanzó para PC, PS3 y XBOX 360. La versión de PC tiene gráficos superiores y se recomienda una poderosa tarjeta gráfica con DirectX 11. Y la Guerrera Trisha..... uhh ni les cuento esa guerrera como está.			"

												Uplay really ruined this game. Your game does not save, even if you do a manual in-game save, if it doesn't sychronize with the Ubisoft cloud. If you have a sporadic internet connection, as I do, you can basically kiss your in-game progress goodbye. After the game crashed on me and I restarted it, I load my game to find out I am about a dozen hours of gameplay back. This is completely unacceptable, considering every other game I have encountered has no trouble saving or loading your progress. There is no reason you should have to be sync'd to a company's servers the entire time you are playing a single player game.The money I spent on Far Cry 3 is the only money that Ubisoft will ever see from me. Hopefully they can use it toward updating their awful system.			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Far Cry 3 

			Views: 1,346		

			Join Trent on a summer vacation to Rook Island as he reviews Far Cry 3 in anticipation of Ubisoft's upcoming Far Cry 4. Does this open world FPS intelligently convey the regression of civilized man...		

Many people dream of finding themselves posted on a white sand beach on an island in the pacific, sipping a tropical drink and flicking tenacious hermit crabs from their belongings. If you are ambitious and a bit stupid, like Jason Brody and company, then you may try to spice up the proceedings with a bit of skydiving. So begins, Far Cry 3, a game about a bunch of American yuppies on a vacation that has seriously gone wrong. Back and 2004 Far Cry's open world gameplay was revolutionary, roaming tropical islands slaying mercs and trigens created quite a splash before being encumbered by the tsunami that was Doom 3 and Half Life 2 later the same year. With S.T.A.L.K.E.R being the only other franchise to successfully merge open world shooting with light RPG elements, and Crytek moving toward more traditional levels for their Crysis games, the market is wide open for Ubisoft's vacation from hell simulator.  While living it up in Bangkok in order to celebrate his younger brother obtaining his pilot's license, Jason Brody and crew make the ill fated decision to go skydiving. They happen to land on an island infested with pirates and they are taken hostage where they are being primed to be sold into slavery. Jason escapes and meets some locals who aid him in his quest to find his friends and escape since they see it as an opportunity to have Jason liberate their island. It's a tale that's part Deliverance, part Indiana Jones with a dash of the drug abusing hijinx in Alice in Wonderland. Far Cry 3's narrative benefits from a number of eccentric personalities like Spike Lee's Island dwelling clone Dennis, gaming's most possessive and insane ♥♥♥♥♥ Citra,  and doctor who indulgences in enough mind altering substances to make Hunter S. Thompson blush. Topping off the insane cast of character's is Vaas, the leader of the pirates. Unfortunately, Far Cry 3 blunders Final Fantasy VIII style by shifting the focus away from Vaas partway through the game and substituting a far less engaging and charismatic villain. The well worn theme of civilized man reverting to a more primitive state to survive in a primitive environment is a bit hamfisted as every few missions has Jason returning to his girlfriend so that she can keep pointing out how he has changed... Also, the plot is tainted by a white messiah complex. For some reason it seems that the legions of native warriors are not the equal of one white guy with a crappy tribal tattoo and a desire to save his friends.  While Jason is not a soldier or gun toter by trade, he quickly warms up to carrying a firearm and explosives in order to liberate his friends. Missions give Jason the opportunity to earn money and experience which he can use to augment his skills and buy new weapons and attachments. Slaughtering the wildlife also gives Jason the opportunity to craft new storage for ammo, explosives and money. The flora can be harvested in order to create medicines that allow Jason to heal and enhance his senses. While all of these crafting opportunities help make use of the large game world and the critters that inhabit it, it also means that the game can have an agonizing start. Initially, Jason can only carry one weapon and very little ammo meaning that exploration grinds to a halt after only a few minutes before needing to resupply. You will want to craft new holsters to hold more weapons and compartments for more ammo immediately. Torching bears with flame throwers, using grenades as depth charges to kill crocodiles and sharks and running kommodo dragons over with jeeps does provide a depraved and perverted form of entertainment. Also populating the world are radio towers that have to be scaled in order to unlock a section of the map a la Assassin's Creed and Outposts that need to be cleared out in order to keep those pesky pirates from roaming certain regions of the map. Both the towers and the outposts have unique layouts and terrain that distinguishes one from another but never the less you will fall into a pattern of uncovering the map then liberating the outposts as you progress deeper into the game which becomes terribly repetitive. The wildlife in Far Cry 3 doesn't exist solely for the benefit of adding pouches to Jason's belt either. Animals are often found in cages in enemy outposts where they can be freed to create havok. It just so happens that pirates are much easier to kill when they are trying to save one of their buddies from getting murdered by an angry cassowary. While Far Cry 3 provides weaponry and attachments that encourage stealth, it's also possible to raid outposts full shock and awe style with guns on full auto chucking grenades like Eli Manning throws interceptions. Both methods have their thrills but almost invariably players will lean on their overpowered weaponry late in the game to steam roll the opposition. The extra 1,000 experience just isn't worth the time saved by storming an outpost Rambo style.  Fortunately, Far Cry 3's main missions provide a much needed reprieve from the repetition of radio tower climbing and outpost raiding. Missions often take Jason to instanced areas like abandoned Japanese bunkers from World War 2 and ancient temples with Indiana Jones style perils. Even a handful of late game filler missions offer some riotous thrills and enough fireworks to please even the most jaded action gamer. Forced stealth sections are staged in such a way they they are painfully easy however and some really irritating quick time events rear their ugly heads and detract from the experience. Like wise a mid game string of quests that have you raiding ancient temples to reassemble a magic compass throw the tone of the game off. If all of the aforementioned content isn't satisfactory to you there are also extra missions that have you killing animals and special targets with a specified weapon, score-based Rakyat challenges and some small errands given to you by NPCs. It's a rather robust singleplayer that will last most gamers 15 to 20 hours.  The Far Cry 3 experience doesn't stop with it's campaign however. There are six co-op missions that tell the story of a group of rough around the edges characters who have been duped out of their money by the Pirates and are pursuing them on Rook Island. The narrative is sparse and the gameplay does little to really take advantage of having three friends playing alongside you. You earn experience that unlocks upgrades that can also be used for the competitive multiplayer suit. Multiplayer is a collection of variations of classic multiplayer modes like Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill, capture the flag and domination. The multiplayer does little nothing to take advantage of some of Far Cry's more unique features. Don't expect your foes to be mauled to death by tigers or to be able to jump into a vehicle to make a hasty escape. Odds are, players will get more time out of the main campaign. "

												I can't play because of Uplay problems.[EDIT] OK, decided to try again. Re-installed game. New & exciting Uplay issues. Stuck at ""Game information is loading"" screen in Uplay. Checked online, many other users have this problem, Ubisoft Support Staff offer useless, obvious advice that suggests they are dodging the issue (e.g. ""Make sure that you are launching it from your Steam Library""  and ""You will see the Uplay client come up, and it should function properly after that""). Do you even read the problems people are posting?[EDIT 2] Someone suggested switching to offline mode, which I did. Now, Uplay won't let me login when I launch game in Steam, saying ""If this is your first time using Uplay on this computer..""  - (which it's not)  - ""..you need to log in online at least once before using offline mode"".So.. it won't let me login, saying I need to login before I can use offline mode? So then I try to login and... it won't let me login because I need to login before I can use offline mode? Arghghgh. And logging in via the net doesn't give any options, just useless crap like selecting avatars.Anyone that can provide advice on how to login to turn off 'offline mode' when Uplay won't let me login.. gratitude in advance.[EDIT 3] Searching for info on how to login when I can't login.. Uplay Support Staff advice: ""You would have to successfully log in once in order to use the ""Always start in offline mode feature"". Seriously, who is paying these guys?			"

												By far one of the best games I have ever played.Storyline - 9/10Would be 10/10 but I think the player would need to have more influence in particular events. Apart from that, brilliant story and I was so excited to see what happened at the end!Characters - 10/10The main characters that you will encounter throughout your playthrough are: Jason, Vaas, Hoyt, Riley (debateable) and Dennis. A great set of characters, who are very interesting and hard to read just by their actions (I think this is a good thing).Graphics - 10/10For a 2012 game, the graphics are brilliant, . The sky is awesome and some of the scenery is just unbeatable in my opinion!Performance - 10/10Don't really need to explain this one. The rating I have given it explains it all.Open World - 9/10 Would be 10/10 but when you are trying to hunt and explore for instance, you are constantly being attacked by bandits or privateers, but if this wasn't a problem the game would probably be less enjoyable, I just think it could have been toned down a little bit. Apart from that, the open world is fantastic, you can hunt, explore, drive, just go on killing sprees or just admire the beautiful scenery that this game provides.Overall - 9.5/10I have came to this conclusion because this is a brilliant game with only a few minor problems. It is a MUST buy for all PC gamers in my opinion.Did i ever tell you the definition of  ZUEIRA? is to UAHEUAHEUH over and over again and expects things to change  "

												Doesn't run. Typical Ubisoft. Not recommended. I've had trouble with every Ubisoft game on here, and this is the end - I'm not going to risk my money on their products any more. It seems it's their UPlay authentication software. I've tried downloading their latest version but it's no good. Tried all the solutions suggested on the forums. No joy. It strikes me that if it won't run, it has no business being sold. If it doesn't download with all the files needed to install & run it, it's a lemon; a dud.			"

												Just finished the single player game and I did a good chunk of the side stuff other than some stuff like the gambling and racing... the game sure does pack a lot of content and has some pretty cool moments. Easy to recommend to anyone that enjoys sandbox FPS action. I kind of got fed up with the game 80% of the way in and just wanted to finish it already but that's just me. I was more patient with far cry 2 and I enjoyed that game overall more than this game even though in many ways this has improved on fc2's most obvious annoyances though it does introduce some of its own. The game's key fights are decided by quicktime events... that was really lame but I'm really just nitpicking. There's so much stuff do in the game that it practically has something for everyone. Solid game that is amazing in parts.			"

Oh wait, they won't listen to us honest customers, so I guess I will give this game a thumbs down. Uninstalling!			"

												Uplay ruined it for me. So much that I can't finish the game because Uplay won't start up to verify the damn thing. It's one thing to have DRM, another to have TWO, and a ♥♥♥♥ing problem when it won't allow you to play the damn game... Just when I was enjoying it...[EDIT] I'd never thought I would ever say this, but get the console version instead... Obviously games with the Ubisoft logo on it.			"

												The game is fun.    However I am unable to play it after the first day as Uplay is failing to launch. Ubisoft constantly makes these games that you have to wrestle with to get to work, while my bud who pirated FC3 is having no troubles what so ever.   I understand that most people dont have these problems, but when you make a product that renders MY goods unusable it makes it not worth risking money on your company.   Buy this game, and all ubisoft products with the highest level of caution as, make no mistake about it, you are taking a gamble.			"

												Far Cry 3 is wonderful in terms of the environment and graphics (stunning visuals!). There are not many games that have such an enjoyable system of roaming around the map, hunting, driving, swimming, flying etc. The fight is often easy, but fun. The singleplayer experience is quite tense and full of fast-paced action (car chases, bomb escapes, burning houses, helicopter flights, ambushes... a lot of good points). There are even some stealth aspects, you may conquer the outposts in a silent-assassin way and I admit - it gave me a lot of good gameplay experience, especially with later knife skills. Aside from the outposts you'll see it's just a nicely scripted shooter often with no practical use for silent approach :)So, why do I give it a negative mark? Let me explain in a few points...If you spend some time on doing side miniquests and hunt, you get really powerful - I quickly got to point when I maxed my skill tree, had bought everything I could and still had overflow of money. Of course, it's up to you how far you go with exploring the map, so let's say it's not a minus, more like neutral remark.The game has a very dark feeling in it. A lot of despair, loneliness, brutality, often without reason. Sometimes the protagonist make extremely stupid, unbelievable decisions. Your enemies (and some allies...) are psychopatic maniacs. There are a lot of drug themes. I know a lot of these are justified by the plot, but every time I moved a bit forward in game (not counting map exploration), I felt sad and dull. (game music even amplify it) Watch out, if you feel pesimist, probably this game might just make you feel worse...Whole drug aspect - not only there's too much of it for my taste, I also feel that the game creators took it as a handy shortcut for fixing loose plot points. I don't want to leave spoilers here, so let's just say that replacing a few proper fights with drug induced visions (and then, magically, your character somehow won everything!) is very cheap. You see a problem but don't solve it, just hop into narcotic projection, see some ghosts and delusions, get back to 'real' world and everything is already done. Yay...Although many parts of the campaign were enjoyable (especially action scenes mentioned before), the ending itself was so disgusting/stupid (I chose ""good"" ending, ""bad"" one was even worse) that it totally threw me off this game. Honestly, I haven't played it anymore since I finished the main plot.Multiplayer - I managed to unlock everything before I finished singleplayer and then, without the feeling of getting rewards, it got very boring. It's not a bad experience, but it's very chaotic, certainly not better than other shooters. There are no dedicated servers, so you have little influence on any technical aspect of the game. Also, expect A LOT of hosting problems, a few host migrations during one match seemed like a standard...Oh, also the game needs to be played under Uplay - Ubisoft DRM system, which is very inconvenient, much less comfortable than Steam... (a bit ridiculous, that we already have to use two platforms, Steam and Uplay, at once to play a game, who knows how many additional programs we will have to run in future to play one game?)			"

												I want to begin this review by telling you, that the game itself is a masterpiece and that I definitely enjoyed playing it, UNTIL Uplay ruined both Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon for me. I played through both games once, but kept them installed in case I wanted to replay them. And, unsurprisingly, the day came where I wanted to do so.But for some inexplicable reason the Uplay overlay told me ""♥♥♥♥ you! If you thought you could freely use a product you paid for, then, my dear sir, you came to the wrong ♥♥♥♥ing place!""Long story short, because of the update my account got screwed over and my games now belong to a pre-update version which I can't access anymore.Good job ruining your games, Uplay!

												Uplay... god-damnit. Uplay means Noplay for me. I am tired of running extra 3rd party clients. I already play through Steam, and that is perfectly fine for me, it has more than enough DRM features. I don't want to run Uplay as well and have it all linked up. I don't care, I don't want it. Uplay is one of the heaviest DRM I have seen in a while. It's a hassle, and I use Steam already...I don't want yet another program open to ""connect"" with others and ""track my progress"". For Steam being what it is, I forget how much Ubisoft likes to really remind the player that they are playing UBISOFT'S game and the player just has ""access"" to it. It's like long term renting at a flat price.As far as FarCry 3, the game itself, by this time the internet is full of Reviews by now. So I won't recap. I hear it's a good looking game and can be a lot of fun. But combined with the issues above and being at a point in my gaming life where I just didn't care as soon as the opening scene started. I just wanted to get out on the islands, wander, explore, adventure, blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Yet as I listened to the story drone on, and started the first stealthy escape sequence I just remembered: ""I don't care... I really don't care. I don't want to go through this 'tutorial' period. I don't want to be introduced to a bunch of characters I don't care about , locations half of which I won't return to, objectives I'll forget what they are related to, skill trees I'll get tired of trying to unlock, loot out the a-hole, blueprints for too many things  won't make, and everything else for the first few hours or so. Just leave me alone, let me wander. Basically, give me the end game freedoms. I don't have time for all this."" (Note: I am just stating my personal sensation at the time, clearly not all games are approached with this level of cynicism. But this one did not grab me enough to fight through it this time. And although I do greatly enjoy open world exploration games with many of these features, this one felt to tedious and predictable right off.)Obviously, this isn't really a review of the game, just a friendly reminder of ""Uplay"" and it's annoying "" joys "". And combined with a bit of a predictable set-up, I just can't say I want to deal with it. Even after a good sale. It looks cool, and there looks like some good fun moments, but I guess I just don't want to put in the time to get there.For you real fans, I am not putting down the games themselves. I am not trying dissuade anyone seriously interested in this game, or the franchise. But those on the fence, stay there and maybe lean back a little. Uplay is freaking annoying. It's like running a whole 'nother Steam while you are already playing your game through Steam. You even have to activate other Ubisoft games with activation keys inside Uplay the same way as you do in Steam. And while in game you get a little prompt to open Uplay with shift+F2 just like you can with the Steam overlay...seriously, if you are wondering if maybe you could waste a little casual time for fun in FarCry 3 with the ease of Steam...Nope. It is all an extra annoying hassle with Uplay. It's lame. And consider, if Uplay servers go down, you may not have accessto your game/s. If you already really like the game and very much want it, go for it. You've already made the choice and it does look good.[If it was without Uplay, and a ""standalone"" game in this way, I would recommend on sale; post FC4 release.]			"

												Well I think after the 12th BIG crash I think I'm ready to right a review of FC3.  Now first of all this is not a hit on the game, the game's great ... when it works, The Co-Op is probably the best part, 4 friends, screwing around making the lives of pirates more miserable, best cooperative I've played, better than L4D/L4D2, (sorry Valve) except the fact that u can have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of add-ons in L4D/L4D2, that's awesome.  (sidetracked) :/FC3, as well as the others in the series are great fun, however my problem is with U-PLAY.  Steam doesn't have a problem with my computer and has always accomidated me with an out-dated and newly built (this year) computers, but UP seems to have problems with ... perhaps u could tell me, I haven't a clue, crashing/lost host/lost connection/no internet/no mic/no sound/glitch glitch glitch, twitch twitch twitch.At this point Steam thinks I've played 34 hrs, reality is 17 hrs, I checked, I literally have spent almost 17 hrs fighting with all the above problems - changed settings - restarted - gave up and tried the next night.  I can turn right around and play ANY game..  ANY!  and not have an issue, right after I crash!So if your good at working around or rewriting script or what have you, then you'll love this game.  If your looking to just go and play because you've already waited for it to install, and start a UP account, and exit out so it can update, then you hunt your friends down, then you exit SO THAT can take effect, then it updates, loads, searches for MORE updates, THEN, if your good, then you can play ... oh wait .. no sound, start again.  Then I DON'T recommened this game because you'll become frusterated and possibly hate Ubisoft that much more.*Note*  I dont download anything or run 'backround programs'  it's pretty much a gaming comp. which I might look on the net or right an e-mail .. sometimes.  this current comp is:  Optimal/Over-spec for this game.  I've NEVER crashed on anyother online Co-op/Multi-player of ANY kind ... EVER.			"

												Far Cry 3 is an action packed adventure. You have multiple objectives you can do and they don’t have to be done in order or you can simply never do them! You can find relics, raid outposts, explore, find treasure chests, and many more endeavors within Far Cry 3. The campaign reminds me of college students on vacation and things go south and rather rapidly. I don’t want to spoil anything, but the story itself contains mysteries, mystical happenings, and a crazy adventure that won’t leave a bad taste behind like other action adventure titles. The game itself is open world and both islands are living, breathing entities. Whether its people driving around, guards patrolling, or a lion prowling in the tall grasses of the jungle, there is always some form of activity going on in the background or around you. To explore this vast world, one can obtain ATVs, vehicles, boats or air gliders and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Rook Islands. The scenery has lush jungles, waterfalls, white sandy beaches, clear blue waters, swamps, and green grasslands. The developers put a lot of thought in this game and it seems they added a bit of every biome in this title. You’ll notice outposts and telecommunication towers – the outposts provide you with a means of fast travel, a place to sell/buy items, and local militia to fight near your proximity. The telecommunication towers help you reveal large portions of the map so you can prioritize your next adventure or continue your way on the campaign. There are a few factions on the islands, but I won’t go into them since they may or may not be a spoiler (I’d rather be safe than sorry). With any open world game there is customization or crafting (most of the time) and this game delivers, even though it is on a smaller scale than other titles. Your crafting consists of killing wildlife and using their hides to make a bigger holster, a bigger ammo bag, etc. in order to obtain more items (ammo, syringes, etc.). You can customize guns (paint, scope, magazine, etc.), but don’t assume the customization is big compared to Battlefield titles or other shooting games. They do bare bones on customization with guns, but they do improve a big portion of the stats relating to the gun (aim, ammo capacity, range, etc.). They could have added more customization/crafting options in the game, but I did like the quests that one must obtain to maximize their crafting potential. The UI was clunky at times; I’d have to press multiple times of ESC to get back to the game as one example. The game was well enough to ignore the clunkiness of the UI and the game has a few years on it, so it isn’t ‘modernized’. I didn’t have any FPS drops or bottlenecking when playing this title. I never experienced any crashes or delays or audible problems that sounded off or distant. The voices were done in a way to have an emotional experience and trying to connect with the player when going through the campaign and experiencing the hardships from protagonist, his friends, and his enemies.A title like Far Cry 3 needs no spoilers and I truly think most people who like action adventure games will enjoy this title. I might not have done everything (finding relics, treasure, etc.), but I did finish the campaign and I would recommend this title to anyone. There are still a lot of content for me to finish, so this game is worth its price.  "

												Far Cry 3 is an open world first-person shooter published by Ubisoft Entertainment. It is the next installment of Far Cry series after Far Cry 2.Far Cry 3 gameplay, it has open world, it has small RPG element, and it has one of the best villain character ever. In my opinion Far Cry 3 open world feature is almost similar to Assassin's Creed where you have to climb a radio tower, interact some sort of panel to explore some area on the world around the tower. In Far Cry 3 you don't just get to shoot somebody and run. You can buy and upgrade weapons in store, level up getting new tattoos which conveniently giving you new abilities such as walk faster or something, also, there are some upgrades that require you to hunt for animals hide or plants. The best part is, when you shoot a tiger, it will fight back! Let your guard down and a leopard will eat you. Got bored? Maybe you should go to a village and play some poker games and rob those poker players. Do you want to become Hawkeye? Legolas? or maybe Rambo? Use explosive archer and blow some goats. Got angry? Use a flamethrower and burn the forest! Far Cry 3 has many great feature for a first-person shooter. You will like it.Far Cry 3 has cool graphics, it is one of the best graphics I've ever seen, not because its so advanced, but because the weapons first-person animation is unique, so alive and... Okay maybe it's not one of the best, but I like it. Far Cry 3 has very good performance.Too bad Far Cry 3 multiplayer feels like it has been left out, because it's not as awesome as the singleplayer mode. I was thinking the multiplayer will be more like huge maps on the same island, hundreds of players fighting together, something like that. Same thing about the cooperative play. But at least you get to blow something up with bow in singleplayer.Far Cry 3 is not bad, its good, I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												I would recommend this game to everyone, even though it is a UPlay game. It's fun and exciting to play. The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is excellent. I really enjoyed it and had several play-throughs for the 93 hours I got to enjoy it both in single player, multiplayer & co-op until, my UPlay account was stolen from me. I now own it again on a different account that I had from a long time ago and am going to play it over again. Got it on sale for real cheap on Humble so, it was worth it to purchase it again, to me, anyway. I installed it directly through UPlay this time and not through Steam. I'm still a bit upset that UPlay has failed to return any of my self paid long distance phone calls and for the first time, failed to reply to my support ticket, concerning the matter. They're usually good about answering me whenever I've had problems. All-in-all, I got the game again and will enjoy playing it in SP, MP & Co-op once again. Will also be looking forward to FarCry 4.As an added note: The game also comes with a Map Editor. So, you can create your own maps.			"

												Far Cry 3 is a blast! Immersive landscape and environments, living wilderness, lots of enemies and multiple possibilities to take them down. Will you raid a camp Rambo-style, gun-blazing everything and everyone? Will you put C4 bombs on your car and use it to make a diversion? Will you open a cage to release a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tiger on your enemies? Or will you sneak your way through? The choice is all yours.The story is simple but feels alright, the characters are all pretty charismatic and have their own personalities; the game has humour and dramatic moments. It is beautiful and immersive. The gameplay is varied enough, and when you think it might become boring, new gameplay elements come in. Lots of missions and side-missions to keep you occupied for quite some time; I've played more than 16 hours when I'm writing this review and haven't even finished it yet. Take your time, do some missions, get lost in the jungle, plan your tactics and stop being a prey: be the predator.I only wish the stealth approaches would be more realistic like it was in Far Cry 2, and a better crafting system.At first I didn't think I'd like this game, but now I love it.A solid 8.5 or 9/10 for this piece of work.

												Outstanding Open World FPS set on the Beautiful and Dangerous Tropical Islands.Some Bad:Suffering from some FOV Issue where it's fixed at Low FOV in most of the story sequences and some actions/animations such as Climbing, Driving, Openning Door. Which may cause mild nauseous. But fortunately they're not so frequent.Also no Motion Blur and Mouse Acceleration options, but they can be turning off by modifying the config file.Lacking of separate Audio Slider sometime the BGM is too loud and cannot hear the conversation.Some Good:The Graphics look absolutely gorgeous with the proper Options for Low-Spec PC to High-end PC.Freedom in how you can play. Though you need to unlock the Skill trees buy doing Main Quests to some extent on the vanilla gameplay.Mods, Lots of Mods that gives you Varieties in how the game can be played.Memorable Characters: The Characters you met in the game are pretty interesting.Crafting, Hunting, Mini-Games, Side Quests... So many things to do.-Recommended!- "

												If you love a really stupid story in a game or simply don't care about the story at all this is for you.If all you care about is driving around in a beautiful scenery and doing repetitive missions or just doing what you like, go for it.The story of this game was completely idiotic and almost kept me from completely playing this game.Now all the other aspects aren't bad. Hunting, collecting weapons, liberating outposts - all that is fun (altough repetitive) and kept me playing to the very end (even collected all the extra stuff), but the story really ruins the game.Really, all I could think of while playing this was that the ""hero"" of this game is a complete idiot, whose decisions you, as a player, have to live with.Stay away if you care about games with good and/or witty stories.If you don't - go for it.

												If there's one thing Far Cry 3 does incredibly well, it's give you a very detailed, open-ended game world that's loaded up with so many optional objectives, collectibles and side missions that you'll probably put the game's main narrative on hold in favor of exploring. It's a fantastic-looking first person shooter with a great combat system, and while the main story isn't exactly Shakespeare, there's enough interesting stuff going on to more than make up for it.Far Cry 3 takes players to the tropical paradise of Rook Island, where Jason, a young 20-something vacationing in the South Pacific with his friends, is captured by a notorious pirate gang led by the violently insane Vaas. After losing his brother in an escape attempt, Jason is rescued by a man named Dennis, who brands Jason with a mysterious tattoo. Apparently, Jason has the hidden potential to become the legendary warrior that the local tribe, the Rakyat, and it's up to you to save your friends, free Rook Island from the pirates and most importantly, kill Vaas.While Far Cry 3 may not have the same kind of gritty narrative that's chock full of grim moral ambiguity like its predecessor, Far Cry 2, the adrenaline-fueled, action-packed adventure that Far Cry 3 offers instead is still entertaining. Each story mission has a nice mix of open-ended game play and scripted sequences that can be a lot of fun to play through, but when you're crawling through ancient Chinese ruins trying to find a mythical artifact, hidden away centuries ago, or the leader of the Rakyat starts talking about how great a warrior you are, it can feel like Far Cry 3 is taking a few ideas from other popular action-adventures and trying to put a darker, edgier twist to them - and it can come across as a tad melodramatic as a result.One of the most intriguing things about Rook Island is that it has a really complex ecosystem that feels active and alive. Throughout your travels, you'll encounter flora and fauna of all shapes and sizes, from wild boars and leopards to birds of paradise. You're just as likely to be killed by a tiger or a Komodo dragon as a gun-toting pirate or mercenary, and you'll occasionally run into skirmishes between the Rakyat and pirate forces. As you progress through the game, you'll get to see how your actions have an impact on this environment. The island starts out full of enemy-occupied outposts, and hacked radio towers make navigation difficult by shrouding large chunks of your in-game map. But as you liberate those towers and outposts, they'll reveal the surrounding area and reduce the pirates' influence in the region.Liberating Rook Island is where Far Cry 3's impressive combat comes into play. Almost every engagement offers flexibility as to how you want to take out your opponents, and you'll build up a large arsenal of customizable weapons provided you've spent some time unlocking radio towers and looting corpses and containers for cash. Every gun, such as shotguns, silenced pistols or flamethrowers, have their own uses in a firefight, depending on if you like fast-paced battles with lots of explosions and bullets or if you prefer something that lets you be more quiet and subtle. Far Cry 3 also introduces skill and crafting systems for improving your abilities and making equipment. Completing missions and killing enemies will grant you skill points to use on various perks that'll increase your health, damage resistance or allow you to pull off nifty action hero moves, like being able to fire a gun while riding down a zipline or using an enemy as an impromptu human shield as you gun down his buddies with his own sidearm. The crafting system is oriented around making items to support you in your adventure. Most of the island's animals can be killed and skinned to give you the materials to craft larger grenade or ammo pouches, and you'll also forage for plants to make syringes that either heal you or give temporary bonuses, like detecting enemies or animals through walls.Far Cry 3 does have a few minor issues that could've used a bit more polish. Navigating the myriad of menus can be a pain for one, and occasionally the context-sensitive HUD has issues distinguishing whether you want to pick up a weapon or loot a corpse. Also, whatever behind the scenes mechanic controlling the random placement of NPCs can seem overeager to spawn enemies for you to encounter, leading to weird instances where you drive along an empty stretch of road only to watch as a truck-full of pirates materializes behind you. Thankfully, that happens so rarely that's it's more of a minor annoyance than anything else, but it can break the immersion slightly when it does.If you need a break from the already content-heavy single player portion of the game, Far Cry 3 also has a robust multiplayer component with a Call of Duty-style style leveling system that'll unlock new weapons, equipment, and ally-boosting abilities as you play. Far Cry 3 also comes with a four player co-op mode, where you and a handful of friends can play through a side-narrative of four people seeking vengeance against a cruise liner captain that tried to sell them out to pirates.Far Cry 3's single player story may have its ups and downs, but it's still an incredibly in-depth action experience. Its combat and open-ended gameplay is engaging and well-designed, and there are plenty of incentives to explore the game world to see what you can find. The multiplayer modes, while not as detailed, are a nice extra feature that's just as enjoyable as the single player campaign.			"

												The good: FarCry 3 is a beautiful game. It handles well, vehicles are fun, combat is fluid, and you can sneak or go full auto as you like for most missions. There is great variety of things to do, many items to collect across the islands, and cool places to explore. Some minor RPG elements are added, but it is still a FPS at heart of course, so combat dominates. The bad: I think the story was written by 16 year olds. I had to stop playing half way through because I just couldn't take it any more.			"

I do though, and this serves as a heads up, that you MAY encounter serious issues with this product.9/10 Such Fail Many Pirate.

												I got this game and started it up not knowing what I was getting into, I was totally blown away by the game and played it to death. Here's why I don't recommend it. After not playing for awhile I decided ""Hey why not play some FC3"" so I downloaded it and went to boot up the game. As I was waiting for the game to load the title screen it crashed, so I tried booting it in safe mode, verifying the files, restarting steam, redownloading the game, etc. At this point I was getting a little frustrated so I went to check the support pages...1 day later the game still wasn't fixed and my support request tickets have not been answered at all. So I won't recommend this game because while it's obvious that this game is great, the ****ing ***holes at Ubisoft decided to **** me over by not allowing me to play the game I PAID MONEY FOR and didn't even ****ing try to help me or the other people that are having issues. I loved this game so much... **** you Ubisoft. OH AND UPLAY IS A PILE OF ****			"

												Within the first thirty minutes I experienced an incredibly emotional and engaging introduction that rivaled all my favorite memories from similar games. Remember the beginning to Half Life 2 or dying in the beginning of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? Far Cry 3 wipes those experiences under the table and then continues to give you things you never thought possible in a game of this magnitude.  Every drug-laden sequence early in the game makes you feel like first-person shooters have risen to a new level in terms of creative narrative story-telling.We are presented with a very typical open-world game. We can explore the scenic island, take on a slurry of optional missions, search for a staggering amount of collectibles, or take on the newest gaming cliche: hunting. The exploration feels very reminiscent of Skyrim. The stealth elements are familiar for fans of those genres. There are role playing elements and skill tree upgrades. It’s got a little bit of everything and at first-glance they’re all done well.Even with a new high-end PC I couldn’t play this game on ultra, but on high Far Cry 3 looks absolutely incredible. Environments are gorgeously rendered allowing the player to immerse in every detail of the beaches and jungle down to single blades of grass. The character models are perfectly motion captured and so well acted that you want to know “Who is this guy playing Vaas?” These elements provide a real emotional connection to what’s happening. From the very start you become completely immersed and invested in your motives, the story, the characters, and the world as a whole.So what’s the problem? Far Cry 3 is a great game that suffers from the trappings of what makes it a game. The strengths and impact of the opening sequence are quickly diminished when your first few mandatory missions act as tutorials of collecting plants and skinning pigs. With further progression you are inundated with endless optional missions, while entertaining, are irrelevant to the larger story. More may not always be better. And the more you play, you’ll realize: this game is riddled with all the tropes of similar experiences.You’ll need to escape from a burning building, hunker down for turret sequences, use “stealth” to follow a person in broad daylight, and deal with a car chase where you blow up pursuers with a grenade launcher. Meanwhile, every meandering story mission you go on seems to further remove you from any logical character development. Fighting a giant tribal ink demon in a drug-induced state looks cool, but it’s completely pointless and punctuated by a ridiculous first-person sex scene. There are multiple times in the game that make you question what you’re doing and why, because at a certain point none of it makes sense.This game would have benefited immensely from a shorter and focused campaign. What should have been a linear and powerful storyline is ruined by padding the game out with irrelevant mechanics and tired plot sequences. There was such amazing potential dealing with concepts of human trafficking and how revenge at any cost can transform an ordinary person.  However, the human drama takes a backseat. We’re left with a game that feels manipulated to meet bullet-points on a marketing checklist and a feeling that we are the lowest common denominator for a target demographic.A lot can be learned from games like Spec Ops: The Line. What seemed like a formulaic shooter was actually a concise narrative that took risks. It explored and engaged the player with what trauma and death can do to the human psyche.Far Cry 3 could have easily cut characters like Willis, Citra and Hoyt and focused on the drama with Vaas. The optional missions could have been made available as a narrative hook after the main campaign or online experiences with friends. The problem I have is that mechanically the game is still fun. I can recommend it for those reasons. However, narratively speaking, it had so much potential and in the end I was just disappointed with the entire package.			"

												Far Cry 3, a story driven first person shooter.I purchased the Deluxe edition of the game when it was on the summer 2014 sale for $9.99 and have played a total of 7 hours as of this writing.I would fit this game into the FPS genre and add that this is more then just an FPS, its a Story Driven FPS. There is a compelling and interesting story to go through with the solo campaign of the game and the game starts off with an intense beginning.My first several hours into the game and I have to wounder why I didn't get into the Far Cry series before. Far Cry 3 is the first game in the series I have played and I am pleased with it thus far. I do want to keep playing more and finish the story line to see how it all comes to conclusion.There is more to the game if you play a multiplayer coop campaign but I have not yet tried that as I want to experience it all at my pace and not run and gun through it all. I will eventually play coop but not for a while.There is lots to do in the game other then the main missions. I have spent time hunting down animals for there skins, collecting plants and exploring sunken ships, caves and ruins.The crafting in the game is simple, its not overly complex like other games with crafting. If you want to upgrade your wallet to hold more money then you will need to collect animal skins of a certain animal. You will see what kind of animal skin is needed when you select the upgraded version and then on the map you will see the symbol of the animal. In that area somewhere you will find it, kill it and skin it. This will be how you will go about hunting animals to get there skins so you can upgrade your various gear, like, Loot sack, ammo pouch, weapon holster and so forth.When gathering plants (Green, Blue, Read, White) you will use them to make syringes for restoring health or to make a boost in abilities. I have only made health restorative ones as of yet.There is allot more to the game beyond the main missions. There are random supply drop's side missions where you will drive a vehicle from point to point (a marked flare on the ground) till you get the supplies to the needed person. Hunting various wildlife, timed runs, finding lost relic's, letters and video memory cards.The game map starts off with a small section visible and as you activate radio towers throughout the map more sections become visible. The areas that are not visible also do not show up on the mini-map making it more interesting to explore and find the path the to other radio towers.Hang-gliders are also around the island to use and sale through the air to other sections. Its kind of nice to to glide in the air over the island areas and see what there is around.Far Cry 3 is very Xbox 360 controller friendly. Button arrangements are done well and its a joy to play with the controller over keyboard and mouse.I didn't like that I have to access the game menu to get to the crafting and would have rather seen an option of a work table or something in a safe zone (or in the game world) for doing crafting. Other then that, I have to say that this game is very impressively done and UbiSoft did an excellent job. I am looking forward to the next Far Cry game.Having waited during the Summer Sale of 2014 for the Deluxe edition of the game to go on sale and getting it for $9.99 I have to say a resounding Yes! I am sure that subsequent sales will have the game on sale as well.

												I have mixed feelings about Far Cry 3:The good:1. Great world environment.  The jungle, water, caves, underground bunkers, ancient temples all look beatiful.  2. Hunting is fun and exciting.3. Open world to explore.  I'm a fan of open world games :)4. Good selection of skills and weapons.5. A lot of side quests and collectibles.The mediocre:1. Building textures look pretty bad.2. This game is very taxing on PC's.  It's the only game where my FPS drops to the 30's here and there.   3. Hunting becomes completely obsolete after you acquire certain upgrades, which can be very early depending on how you play.4. Save system absolutely sucks.  You can lose a lot of progress if you forget to ""save"" by buying or selling an item in a store.5. Most of the side quests are unneccesary.  I only did the supply runs, hunter quests, and the trials of the rakyat.  I still managed to get all the money and experience for all skills.6. Animals and humans don't look that great.  Except the main characters during cut-scenes.  7. Taking over outposts is fun... for a while.  Once you see one, you've seen them all.8. Some folks criticize the main story, and it's nothing we haven't seen before.  I don't expect much out of the story in a FPS anyways.  I mean, this isn't Mass Effect.  Both endings are kind of crappy I must say.Overall it's a good, fun game.  But for all the hype it got, I expected a little more depth and less repetitiveness.  It's very similar to Just Cause 2, but with added hunting and stealth.  A good experience while it lasts, but I wouldn't play through it multiple times.*EDIT: If you want to read up on the game or on whether to get the game or not, don't bother with the Steam forums.  All you'll read are posts about how bad Uplay is.  Uplay runs fine on my end, in games including FC 3, Blood Dragon, and Assassin's Creed 2/Brotherhood/Revelations*			"

												This game holds a very special place in my heart. Far Cry 3 is a nearly perfect game. I picked this game up during the Christmas Steam sale and I enjoyed it a bunch. I was hooked almost instantly. The shooting and combat in this game are great, and the multiple choices your given to tackle some missions also adds to its diversity. The multiplayer is it's biggest set back for me. Not the team deathmatches and stuff like that, but the co-op missions. I felt like the story could've more work. I love this game and the ""big"" set back isn't really massive. Far Cry 3 is an excellent game to play any day and I highly recommend you pick it up "

												This is a review in 2 parts. The game is fine. It's dated, and the game is far less 'open' than it tries to pretend, but it's what you expect. It's a bit of fun, and for that, it's worth what I paid. I bought it on sale, and the game content is worth the £5 asking price. So why....you ask....do I not give this a positive reply?UPlay. Short for 'unplayable'It took me longer to get UPlay to work than Steam spent downloading the damn game. It messed about with passwords, it blocked me playing, and only after time wasted tearing out my own hair did it let me link my ID to steam and acknowledge that I had the game. The release notes do not ask you if you want this wretched piece of Spyware installed. They just do it. Was I playing online....no. I was playing OFFLINE through steam. Why force this foetid piece of stinking manure on players playing offline where no DRM is needed. Can I play with no internet...no. Does my net speed tank when I fire up this game.....yesDoes this need to happen at all....NO!If Ubisoft take their stupid piece of rubbish DRM and poke it firmly where it deserves to be shoved, then I would give this game a much better rating. As it is .... they won't and I will be requesting a refund.			"

												An amazing game, featuring stunning visuals and gameplay.. The combat system allows you to play the game your own way, whether it be like rambo or hitman, or a combination of both himbon! and many other play styles.. The story could be strong, but its easily over looked when there is so much to do and explore.. This has quickly become one of my top 5 favorite games of all time, I would rank it up there with the GTA Series, Elderscrolls, dark souls and Dota 2.The co-op adds many more ours of fun and a social immersion into the tropical island paradise/hell.. Get this game you won't regret it, definitely worth.Ohm by the way... did i ever tell you the defition of insanity?			"

 Far Cry 3  According to me this is the best game from the entire series. The plot tells the story of Jason Brody, who together with friends is kidnapped by pirates during the holidays. Unfortunately, our hero escapes and decides to save his friends and brother. Location which will visit are two very large size islands on which we will have free access to travel through using a variety of vehicles. The game is split into a very interesting story missions and side quests which are designed to help us improve our character. One of the most important secondary thing is to climb on a towers those actions unlock new side missions, cases with loot and items to the collection like letters and other things. Another important thing is the bases that we have to liberate, either silently or a loud. The game offers a good amount of fun and exploration, a great story and characters, brilliant soundtrack, interesting side missions in the dlc and a large amount of diffrent weapons. There is also a multiplayer mode which is cool but no one is playing and there is cooperative campaign up to 4 people which is fun to play together with friends. In my opinion Far Cry 3 is a brilliant production and sincerely I can recommend it to everyone.  "

												I definitely had a pretty good ride with this game. I was introduced into this series with Far Cry 4, with this being the second game I've played in the series. I've noticed a lot of similarites between the two games, in terms of gameplay and such. Regardless, I still had a lot of fun with the game as I loved Far Cry 4, so was bound to like this one as well. Solid graphics and gameplay. I don't really have much to complain about them. You have good combat as there are various ways to go with any situation, whether stealth or head on. Lots of stuff to explore and collect, side missions to do, and more. In terms of story, it serves the setting and game well. It kept me interested and wanting more. Setting is pretty good as well, taking place on an island with lots of mountains, forests, vegatation, caves, ocean, lakes, and much more. Lots to explore on this island. To be honest, I did have some mixed feelings with the last few events at the ending of the story, but overall, was satisfied and happy with the ending I chose and how it turned out. It took me about 36 hours to get 99% completion, for those wondering. I enjoyed the music of the game as well. A fair amount of times during the game's story where I thought it choice of music was quite suited and pretty cool. Overall, there's a lot to do in this game, from hunting, to racing, to assassination missions, to liberating villages, and much more. I was left pretty happy, impressed, and satisfied with this game. Would have no problem playing this game again, as I think of it to be a really great game that I'd definitely recommend to anyone. Two thumbs up from me!			"

												*** This review is ""NOT"" about the game, but Uplay, as this is the fundamental cause of all problems. And stop complaining without reading my review. Or if you think I have something against the game, then by all means, stay ignorant. This negative review is about Ubisoft, and Uplay, NOT Far Cry 3. ***First of all, I have loved Ubisoft back in the old days, and I thought they were one of the best game companies.Now? I think it is one of the worst. First of all, let me ask, what the hell is Uplay? And how am I supposed to make this god-awful client even work? I start Far Cry 3 from desktop, by clicking on the icon and nothing happens. But on Steam, it says the game is running. So I have to shut down the game manually....which is not really running in reality. And then I try starting the game from Uplay and I see where it says ""Play"", but it doesn't look like it is highlighted and not really clickable. In fact, it is not clickable. So then why is it there? So....I downloaded the Uplay client itself and tried to play it from Uplay directly. Oh, now ""Play"" button is clickable there, Yay! Click! It says the game is running on Steam, but I do not see anything again. I actually installed it once, removed, and re-installed and still nothing is happening. Let's see, Ubisoft, uh, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING ONE OF THE WORST CLIENTS MANKIND HAS EVER SEEN. And guess what, it doesn't seem like I am the only person here. Google ""farcry 3 uplay not working"" and see for yourself how many people are having problems with this garbage-like client. Or you need even more proof? Go to the store page of Far Cry 3. And check out the negative reviews on this game. They are mostly about UPLAY.I have found a few solutions for this, and well, some of the suggestions are to remove certain files, install some new driver, go into some folder and change something........uh....I bought the game, and I have to put up with all this garbage? They might as well put up a warning sign that reads ""This game has one of the worst clients that will drive you nuts, so if you don't think you are sure about your PC being able to run the game because of Uplay, then you might want to reconsider purchasing.""GFWL was not that good, but not as bad as this. EA Origin is not bad, but it's actually pretty good. Steam, is definitely one of the best. Uplay? Pure garbage, in fact, it really proves the whole point of Ubisoft being one of the worst companies in the world. May I ask why Uplay is necessary? Is it necessary? Ubisoft has the history of screwing up the PC ports of Devil May Cry 3 and Resident Evil 4, the old PC version. If this is how they are going to do business, well, then I think their games are not worth full price, at all. I am glad I got this POS when it was on a sale. How is the game? How the HELL am I supposed to know? Uplay is not letting me play, so well, I wish I could tell you? But I can tell you how the client was. A complete piece of GARBAGE. Will NEVER pay more than 10 dollars to an Ubisoft game, ever again. They obviously have NO CLUE how to do business. Even though Activision sells the same stuff Call of Duty every friggin year, they at least NEVER make a stupid-♥♥♥ garbage client like this.Oh, I'm sure the game is good. It really looks fun. But if I can NOT EVEN LAUNCH IT...then what? ZERO (0) out of 10 for Uplay. UBISOFT = UPLAY = COMPLETE FAIL.For the game Far Cry 3, I give ""?"" out of 10. Well, I can't rate a game that I can not play?			"

There a lot of different guns available and you can customize them to adapt to your gameplay style: either you go sneaky beaky or you go full rampage. The AI is very good too. Plus, there are tons of alternative missions you can accomplish to make the game almost endless.Far Cry 3 has just become one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												In my opinion, this was the last good Far Cry game.With a great story, interesting characters, amazing gameplay mechanics and a beautiful open world to explore in the Rook Islands, there is not much to nitpick about this game, aside from the QTE boss fights, the controverisal two endings and the infrequent bugs that occur.Far Cry 4 was okay, Primal was awful, to me, this was the last good Far Cry game to ever come out. This is definitely worth your money, along with the DLC.			"

Disney's Pocahontas With An M-RatingThe ending is enough to justify a negative review but I'll go more in depth...It's a Taken/Pocahontas story we've heard before: bunch of bored, spoiled, rich, white kids travel to a deserted island where they get jumped by Spanish-speaking pirates and are held for ransom. One of them runs away (the player) and the story somehow turns into a heroic epic to save Pocahontas, her people, and the friends the player character is slowly caring less and less about. Pocahontas and her people grant him powers that they possess but can't use the way he does (or at all) because he's American and they're incompetent and he's special and blah blah blah. Then it turns out, the people who've been helping you are actually evil all along. Wow, plot twist!This may just be me but the constant notifications bugged me. A lot. The game doesn't stop pestering you until you check every notification even though you've been notified of the same thing a billion times before that. I know I got a relic, game. I chose to pick it up! I know I can craft a medical syringe; that's why I got the green leaves to begin with! Hell, this game notified me so much that, after the first 15 minutes, I already knew how to craft all of the basic pouches and syringes. If I needed to remember, I could just look in the menu. I don't need constant notifications pestering me.It's a simpler version of Assassin's Creed mechanics in FPS mode. Don't get me wrong, the developers should be able to recycle their mechanics—it's their game. The gameplay was entertaining and the graphics were absolutely breathtaking but there were still too many similarities between Ezio's game and FC3 that I couldn't keep separate. Liberating Borgia towers outposts, climbing to the highest point and synchronizing getting radio towers working, and doing the Leap of Faith ziplining down became a tedious chore after the 3rd time. I found it more fun to attempt a Leap of Faith and send Jason Brody awkwardly stumbling down the tower to his untimely death. ""Stealthing"", or more accurately crouching right under your enemy's noses (sometimes literally) and hobbling about, is a joke that made me laugh several times. I'm sure that was unintentional.The story felt as uninspired as the protagonist—who is the most boring player character I've ever had the misfortune of controlling. In Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft made me want to do the mini-missions and care about the people just as much as the awesome main missions we chose to do. Whereas in FC3, I tended to skip every single mini-mission because I just couldn't care. Sometimes the main missions were just as mind-numbing as the side missions. As someone else said, the game felt more linear because it forced me to go certain directions and do certain things rather than being the promised open world it should have been. I'd get notifications throughout the game saying that if I stepped out of indistinguishable bounds, I'd forfeit a mission I didn't even know I accepted. With some near-identical mechanics, I couldn't help but constantly think about how much I missed playing Assassin's Creed, especially with its superior storytelling and better sandbox gameplay.Last but not least, cultural appropriation[swanblood.tumblr.com] + antiblackness[en.wikipedia.org] + noble savages[en.wikipedia.org] trope = not cool. The cultural inaccuracies were played out and the racial fetishism made everything feel skeevy. Maori people and Pakatan Rakyat leaders would not be happy to see the defiling of their history, culture, and traditions. Not cool, Ubisoft.TLDR: This game's an unoriginal, hot mess that stinks like moist butts basking in fresh, warm urine with gameplay that reminds me too much of Assassin's Creed. They had so much originality with Assassin's Creed that they failed to do the same with the latest Far Cry entry. Even more debilitating is Ubisoft's blatant disrespect for indigenous people and black people. You might as well watch an episode of Rugrats where they dress up in racist tribal regalia because you'd be getting the same disgusting result. Skip this and play Blood Dragon instead.2/10			"

												After completing Far Cry 3 on normal difficulty, I am now playing through once more on the hardest difficulty and am trying to complete all of the missions this time. I usually don't play through a game twice, but this game is worth it. There are so many things I like about this game, where to start...Open World: Far Cry 3 offers a massive, beautiful open world and allows the player to choose one's pace. You can explore the island, do missions, build up skills, build up gear, and follow the story all on your own time. The world is full of goodies like treasures, relics, wildlife (useful and some dangerous), plants, missions, vehicles, and more. Story: A very simplistic summary would be that you play as a guy who was on a nice trip with his brothers and friends, but then things go downhill and you wakeup in a cage with your brother. You must then escape and save your friends all while building new skills and learning about the island. Of course, it is a rather intricate and enticing storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat, especially when things heat up.Gameplay: Unlike most first person shooters, there are so many ways you can choose to play. You can do the traditional guns-a-blazin, you can be like Hitman and stealth your way through, you can be like James Bond and use your surroundings to unleash hell on your enemies, or you can do what I did which is all of the above. Characters: I thought the characters were very well done. One of the main antagonists in the game, Vaas, is personally my favorite video game villain I have encountered. A very interesting character indeed, though I won't say more than that, you will have to play it and find out for yourself. Besides Vaas, the other characters were also very well designed.Weapons: This game has a weapon for everyone. Pistols, SMGs, LMGs, Snipers, Assault Riffles, Flame Thrower, RPG, Grenade Launcher, Bow, Flare Gun, Explosives, etc. When your weapon holster is maxed out you can carry four weapons. They are all very well balanced, nothing is too underpowered and nothing too overpowered. Very well done. Vehicles: A fair variety of vehicles. Everything you would expect on an island like the one in Far Cry 3. Once again, nothing is too under or overpowered when it comes to vehicles. My favorite would have to be the glider, quite unique and very fun to use.I could go on, but I'll just add one more thing because I think it was incorporated quite well. There are a few instances throughout the game where you are giving some type of drug that sends your character on hallucinogenic, soul searching journeys. They were quite entertaining and really added to the whole storyline. This is definitely a stoner-friendly game, however I haven't smoked while playing (yet anyway), though it would be fun. Overall I would give this a 95/100. Not a perfect game, but very captivating. I'm also not a big fan of the Uplay launcher, but my rating didn't reflect on the launcher, just the single player game.			"

												EDIT: I'm playing the game through a second time, trying to go for 100% completion. I'll make another reviewI do not know where to start, to be honest. This game was simply, one of the best games I have ever played, for years. When I was little my dad bought me FarCry, and I played it, but it didn't interest me as much, because I was more of an arena gamer. But this game here, man, simply blew my mind. The campaign got me stuck to the characters, and the missions actually gave a challenge. I never bought any thing or used skill points because I never really payed attention to those, but when I started using them, it made the game alot more fun. The campaign has tons of plot-twists and made the game more exciting, and for the choices you choose, it creates a more diverse story.As an improvement for the game, it would be better if the ""Boss battles"" or combat battles would be more realistic, because I feel like I am in a dream whilst dueling Vaas/Hoyt. One Hole in the story though, its a slight hole though. IN the beginning, you see a guy in a beanie wearing glasses: THat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is Vincent Salas. Who is he? Is he the friend Vaas mentions in the beginning, ""DO YOU WANT ME TO CUT YOU OPEN LIKE I DID YOUR FRIEND(Topkek he forgot to say no homo)"" Anyways, this character was supposed to be in the game where you accidentally shoot him in the game when you are with Vaas. His name isnt even in the intro, yet you still see him and you are with him. And he was never in any part of the game besides the intro, and none of the characters even mentioned him. But if none of the characters mentioned him, that would mean he never existed; then who was Vaas mentioning in the beginning? Anyways, Vincent was just cut from the game for some reason, but he is presumed dead.Overall this game was pretty damn amazing. 10/10 With badass approval.			"

												In process of development of technologies of game with the open world all become richer also nasyshchenny, and their superiority over linear games – more and more pronounced. Far Cry 3 – fine to that an example. Competently combining successful elements of two previous episodes (apart from console backs-off the Instincts series), this shooter it is quite expected – and it is deserved – becomes the favourite in the genre. The Geympleyny mechanics also was enriched with a stealth – villains obediently go to that place where you threw a stone, and thus hold up a back under a knife, – but the stealth carries out also other essential function: allows to hide from patrols. Posts and patrols in the second Far Cry at any stage started irritating terribly with the abundance and sticktoitiveness – extreme devils persistently pursued you everywhere while you didn't calm them a well-aimed bullet, and to pass their unnoticed it was difficult. Here the visibility indicator and as soon as you see is provided that the opponent paid attention to your location, it is possible to hide quickly behind a bush, and that will go further on the affairs. Very conveniently to regulate thus number of casual firefights. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

												Far Cry 3 is a great game. The island is really a living place and you can spend a good amount of time by traveling in some car or hunting some animals. By the way, this is the best game to use a bow, I really enjoyed use it during all the game, the gameplay is fantastic.It has some great music, sound effects and voice acting but the story could be much better, but it is almost ok. You start trying to save your friends but after some point later in the game I completely forgot about them (and I feel bad for saying it, LOL), but I was having too much fun playing around in the island, going to new towers and hunting new animals between the missions... Well, what can I do?On the other hand, Vaas is a great and unique character, unfortunatelly the others aren't that interesting as him (except one soldier in later game...), every time you encounter him is very cool (and crazy).After all that I went to co-op, which is a very linear and short storyline, but is fun and works great. In every mission you will face some sort of competition with your friends (sniper, jet ski, rpgs, buggies, ...) and that makes it even more fun and a lot less repetitive. You should play it.			"

												What a massive game this is. Huge islands to explore with just too many sidequests. You can just run/drive/fly around and do nothing or you can; hunt animals, craft items, free settlements, find relics and other secrets, take over radio towers, do some trials and a whole lot of other activities and (side)quests. It's seemingly endless and completing the entire game will take you probably well over 50 hours. Now that's some value right there.The graphics are just gorgeous, no matter what settings you use. You can't make this game look bad, you just can't. The animations and models are some of the best I've seen in a game. Wow. The same thing applies to the sounds and voice acting, which is brilliant and truly convincing.While doing the story and sidequests you'll earn XP to upgrade your skills. There are 3 skilltrees in total and the way you play the game is entirely up to you. The Shark skilltree will let you upgrade your assault and healing skills, while the Heron tree will help you with your sniper skills and speed and finally, the Spider tree will let you focus on your stealth and survival skills. There's no right way to play this. There are many ways to complete an objective. And that's what makes Far Cry 3 fun, but not necessarily unique.However, there aren't many FPS that give you this much freedom, while telling a realistic, focused, story at the same time. So I take my hat off to Ubisoft for creating this masterpiece. The commercial and critical success for this game is well deserved.Let this be a lesson - and example - for future first person shooters. Hooray for Far Cry 3 !			"

												I can't get this game no matter what I do.m I've already checked every single online solution I can find. I've contacted Ubisoft support and what a joke that is. They send you 1 solution per week. If that doesn't work then you wait a whole week to get 1 more solution that again doesn't work. What the hell is wrong with Ubisoft. I think I'm done spending money with this company. I'll give my money to someone who wants it.			"

												This is the first Far Cry game I have played, and I am quite impressed. The main plot line has great characters and the shooting and hunting/crafting mechanics are solid.I know this is somewhat polarizing, but I happen to love the writing and general theme of spoiled california kid gets jungle fever. It directly mirrors the insanity that happens in the game, there is a definite arc where the hunted becomes the hunter. In the end of the game I was only using the bow and trying to melee combo everything.It has crashed quite a few times for me, but only after several hours of play time, usually in load screens, but the auto saving mechanism is quite good so I have never lost progress.I immediately see why Far Cry Primal is a thing, which may be my next Far Cry (perhaps after blood dragon?)

												06-May-2016 : Finished main storyEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :Attacked by a tiger while busy sniping enemy targets? Check.Attacked by a crocodile while swimming in the river to infiltrate enemy bases? Check.Eaten by a shark while hunting a man-eater shark? Doh... Check.Died from falling while climbing a comm tower to fix it? Check.Unlike the boring Far Cry 2, this game is amazing. Great graphics, gameplay, environment, voice acting. It's so fun that I didn't feel burdened doing side quests or hunting for a certain animal skins or collecting stuffs. The collectibles also easy to find and marked on the map.As for the story... the first half of the story is really good but it start going down hill on the second half when you reach the second island with new antagonist character. The developer needs to hire better writers for the next FC game. Also, the boss fight is really lame. You spent hours surviving great combats, dodging bullets and explosion to get to the antagonist and when you finally fight the ""boss"", you fight him in a hallucination-like QTE scene? *facepalm*CONCLUSION :Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.

It constantly crashes my PC or totally freezes it up, forcing me to power it down the hard way. Either Steam or Ubisoft needs to make sure their♥♥♥♥♥♥runs correctly. Its complete and total BS to purchase a game, only for it to be a total piece of sh*t. I have more than enough hardware specs to push this game in high to ultra settings if I want. However, this crap won't even stay running for long in medium or low settings. I don't reccomend this game to anyone. Stay away from this one.			"

												[Please Note This Is Only A Partial Review Having Played 1/4 Of The Game Thus Far!]So this game is amazing, no doubt about it, and a full review will soon follow, but I ABSOLUTELY cannot recommend this based on the fact that its uPlay implementation is PATHETIC!I've put in over 15 hours of gameplay only to discover to my horror that the saves it was meant to save (by default to the cloud) somehow failed, and I lost over 10 hours of gameplay! All my hunting for upgrades, over 20 outposts, I'm gutted, truly. But as I said, this game is indeed amazing and I'll take this one on the chin and trod along, making doubly sure my games are being saved (have we not come so far into the gaming world where this is inate?).To add insult to injury, uPlay is EXTREMELY intrusive, and one can't even get to the Main Menu without it wanting to download this and download that, download profiles, download stats, it takes a whole couple of minutes EACH TIME before you get into the game! You wanna do trials? Oh ho ho, lets sync (think) first. I've had to force myself to play in offline mode (once again PATHETIC!) just to be able to run the game like the hundreds of other games I have in my library. And the first time uPlay install? Let me just say it kept looping with one of its ""infamous"" updates...But this is the last time I EVER support Ubisoft, I'm sorry, but they are appalling. If I wanted to play a Ubisoft game, I'd buy the game and play it via uPlay, but I have STEAM for a reason and it’s just really silly that I have to play a uPlay game THROUGH STEAM. Origin and uPlay need to come to an agreement to release games to STEAM (aka individual keys). They can certainly count on me never buying one of their products again. Hopefully they learn from the giant how to do things right.			"

												Where do I start? I loved FC 2, I loved its mature story, its realism, immersion and many other things (hated the respawn mechanics tho and hate ubi till this day for ignoring this issue like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s they are).But FC3?? its like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ little brother of FC2 and 1, It threats you like a little kid, basically saying "" here, shoot something, cut some tigers and drive around with speed of light while you are basically invincible""Three main sins of FC3 that break the spell for me are:- Its incredibly dull- it lack any immersion whatsoever- its easy, very very easy1. DULL, everything is the same and repetitive,  weapons are only FEW and all are similar really, hunting is fun for like 30 minutes and then gets annoying and unnecessary ( you get the holster and ammo pack upgraded in about 30 minutes and anything else you don't need, especially the wallet which I do not understand why even exist since you unlock weapons which are free for ever and everything else u can pick up), fighting is dull as hell mainly due to the easiness. AI is just apes with firearms.  Stealth is ridiculous, enemy must be blind, I can clear out all camps with just a knife. Dont get me started on unlocking the radio towers which is just atrocious, and pointless.2. Immersion. There is non. Everything feels staged and unrealistic, the story is ok but the main character is a joke. I couldn't get into the story from the very first few minutes. I mean how some random dude from rich family is all of the sudden an expert commando killing machine just cose some doc told him hes a warrior, and what do u know, he suddenly is, climbing, diving, sniping, killing, sneaking and god knows what else he can do. What really hit me was that he's brother actually would be a MUCH better main character knowing he was a military and all, at least I could understand why he handles guns and knife so well, but no, he dies almost immediately. For comparison, in FC2, you are an experienced mercenary/military/hitman with a clear task given, much more immersive and that I can understand, this is my job to eliminate and thus being an ace sniper and firearms master suddenly feels completely not out of place unlike FC3. World is meh, Graphic is meh too, everything feels like its made of plastic.3. Easy mode all the way. I played the hardest setting, and it was a walk in the park, I can kill the camps in any way there is, name it, knife, sniper rifle, zerg rush with machine gun, rpg barrage, anything really.  But since I really like stealthy strategic approach with sniper rifle, I got to say it was just laughable, I yawned as I was picking enemies off with no problem, and when I got silenced sniper rifle with better zoom? haha I couldn't even be bothered to kill anyone with it, it just felt unfair to the poor AI.Conclusion, to me, this game is a one big bore and the difficulty is insulting. However I can see how  people  like it, its easy to pick up and just shoot away,not what I personally look in fps tho hence that is the reason for me disliking it. And thats why Im not recommending it. It's just not worth of the Far Cry title, its not Far Cry, it resembles Just Cause much more than FC1&2, it is not serious, it is easy and childish, not what I was expecting from FC series.			"

												7/10 -What a trip. I enjoyed hunting animals to craft items, Looting, finding relics and completing side missions to get money to upgrade and buy weapons, stealth killing, sniping from a long distance to shoot a cage to let a tiger out of it and watch it maul everyone nearby, taking over enemy posts so I can fast travel to them, fixing towers to show the map and unlock new weapons, running people and animals over with my car, upgrading my character with xp to unlock new moves, starting things on fire and watching it spread and last but not least the story missions. You can craft plants but I ended up not crafting any except green ones which give you health because the rest of the plants you can craft are basically useless. Who wants to craft a plant to allow you to be flame retardant for 15 secs? I didn't care anyway. Unlike plants crafting animals is useful since you can carry more weapons at a time among other things by collecting their skins. I had fun hunting these animals in the wild and checking my list of how many I needed of a certain breed to create whatever it was. However it was pointless hunting animals anymore after you craft everything unless you want to gain barely any money in doing so or just for the hell of it. Looting dead bodies got really annoying because you have to wait and see the same animation over and over again. There is no way to skip it. Another annoying problem was if their weapon is nearby you have to hover over a certain spot on their body to loot them since you use the same key press to pick up their weapon...why couldn't I just hover over their body and get the loot automatically without pressing anything and press a key if I wanted their weapon? I ended up all the time swapping my weapon accidently because of it. There is really no death animations just ragdoll physics. Which is disappointing since I liked how in Far Cry 2 you can snipe someones leg and they start yelling in pain from it and if one of their friends is nearby they could pick them up and carry them to safety. You shoot anyone in the leg in this game they just die and fall over. The story was a let down to me. It's really a big lame excuse to kill people on an island. You go to the extremes to save your friends in any situation. I didn't like the main characters voice it was annoying and laughable at the sametime. It doesn't help that your character is a real ♥♥♥♥♥ and makes very poor decisions you have to watch unfold that you don't like. The ending wasn't satisfying at all. Don't get me wrong though I did enjoy alot of the story missions. The co-op is alright but can be frustrating due to waves of overwhelming odds and connection issues. The motion blur in this game gave me headaches and there is no way to turn it off. I am only nitpicking here but you can't blow up a car or truck by sniping it's fuel tank. You can't cut down trees. You can't blow up a building having it's walls collapse in. You can't fly a helicopter. You can't even see your own feet. It's no Crysis that's for sure but I did have fun and I spent alot of time just wrecking havoc.			"

												So I don't normally review games, mostly because I don't feel the need to, but Farcry 3 is a different case. I've played my fair share of games, RPGs, MMOs, FPS'. But none of them have ever given me the same adrenaline rush that this game offers. Now don't get me wrong I'm sure there are better games out there, but Farcry 3s enticing story (I'm about halfway through atm) and deep character progression are something to behold. (Not to mention the incredible voice acting).This game offer many different ways to play and there are multiple ways to complete a mission. When you're not off killing pirates and blowing s##t up, you can kick back and go out hunting (surprisingly therapeutic) or play some mini games that the villagers offer. There is an unbelievable amount to be done is this game and the whole map feels like a playground, where you do things your way.I would go into the story, but I'd get carried away and probably spoil something, so all I'll say is that Vaas is possibly my favourite villian of all time be it in a book, movie and of course game. So I'm not saying everyone will love this game, but if you like the freedom to do whatever the hell you want and also don't mind a pretty brilliant story (in my opinion) then just buy it! I nearly didn't because of all the complaints about a so called Uplay, but trust me its not that bad! A little unesscary, but once in game you forget all about it.			"

												Might not be a bad game, if Uplay wasnt so brutal. The game constantly crashes. Why is this game so buggy? When I attempt to load it will get stuck in an endless loop. If I try to buy a gun, it crashes. If I try to update my skill tree, it crashes.When the game gets going, I have a lot of fun. I love the open world aspect. I can explore what I want and go where I want. I can take out enemies stealthy with a knife or go in guns blazing. The world is beautiful and fun to explore.Unfortunately, I found this game can get repetitive within the first island. Rather than create new challenges, it seems like take another base (with the same enemies). Yes, you can attempt to stealth it, or go full on combat, but eventually it loses its flare. Looking for relics gets boring fast. The game designers made some interesting puzzles to solve, but it feels like bad version of Tomb Raider. Relics lose novelty fast, after 60 of them, if you arn't completely bored of them, you still have another 60 more to go. Its fun to watch the world get reinhabited by the island folk, but their animations, or scripted events get boring fast. It almost seems meaningless to take a base from the enemies and where do the good villagers come from? It would be fun to find villagers hiding and occupying little outlying huts. Am I happy that I purchased this game? ... Yes, but because it was on sale.			"

												I'm not sure what I expected. It's the same tired formula of far cry 2 and other ubisoft games. A large beautiful environment, but filled with pointless fetch quests, terrible dialog, and nonsense story. I feel sorry for the artists and voice actors. I'm sure they did their best, but there's nothing rescuing the lackluster quests, story and dialog. The writers failed this game.The gunplay and combat are alright, but none of the characters or storyline inspire any sort of desire to help them or advance the story. A lot of wasted potential. This is seriously some of the worst writing and dialog I've ever seen.Go play Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. It's a way better game but was way too short. This garbage was way too long.			"

												I've spent HOURS trying to get this game to run properly - it won't. If you have Windows 10 and an Nvidia GPU, I suggest you read the support forum posts before buying. There are just too many possible problems to consider. I've disabled as many of the possible conflicts that I know how to, I've tried multiple compatibility settings, and I've run everything as admin ; nothing helps. The game looks really fun. If you have an older computer, it might work fine for you, but it's been a daylong headache for me.			"

												Not a real sandbox experience. Sharp mechanics and slick graphics, but absurd plot content that the game constantly forces on you. Game experience is as if someone was in the room with you while you were playing an FPS and every 15 or 20 minutes they snatched the controller out of your hands and refused to give it back until after reading a few pages from the ridiculous screenplay for a Michael Bay movie he has been working on in his free time.

Story line is very good. Open world Islands and beaches and mountains are beautiful place. Vaas is Badass! So you need Survives do get more weapons and use drive on any of Vehicles and hunt wild animals  and fight against pirates and Drug gangs for protect yourself and people freedom and  save your few friends life then need get out of deadly islands. I started play this Far cry 3 I looked at people and places made me feel place like in the Philippines or Southeast of Asia that cool.  In my opinion Review is 10/10. :D			"

However... it goes through Uplay which has cause many errors like sometimes during the game the Uplay overlay will say it cannot connect to the Uplay service and there is nothing you can do to get rid of this annoying error message. (even in cutscenes)Sometimes it disappears from my library and i have to press install and wait for it to discover all the existing files.It also installed that piece of crap Uplay by itself without asking. Its like self installing bloatwareIts just DRM ontop of DRM its absolutely ridiculous and infuriating.Great game slightly tarnished by forcing everyone to use Uplay.			"

												Elements from Far Cry 1 & 2 that didn't work are gone, things that did work stayed.  Skyrim with guns, Assassin's Creed with guns, Borderlands done without the campiness.As awful as the Far Cry 1 story was, I can actually see a connection between that & 3.  Even though each game is considered a spiritual successor and has no connection to one another, I can tell 1 & 3 have a lot of similarities in story.  The difference is, 3 isn't a hackjob story with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting.Beautiful graphics, great gameplay, great story, memorable characters and one thing Ubisoft does great: amazing intros to their games.  This is definitely a good 20 hour playthrough, highly recommended if you like FPS with open world questing, skills to level up, hostile outposts to clear into friendly outposts, driving, flying, shooting, hunting.  Oh yeah, the hunting is actually fun, sometimes hard and actually useful.Great game, worth the price on sale.			"

												No. Just no.The game is a big step-up from its predecessor and it is really good when you're free roaming the island taking out pirate camps, exploring the monotonous but beautiful landscape. And it looks pretty nice. But that's about it.There are a lot of problems with the pacing. Half an hour in the game and I was carrying a modern french assault rifle and a silenced sniper rifle with free access to unlimited ammo if visiting the right places. The crafting mechanics are completely contrived (why do I need tiger-skin to make bigger pouches?) and there is a lot of dissonance between gameplay and story. The protagonist lies in doubt about his actions, about killing other people while ingame recklessly slitting throats of pirates like there is no tomorrow.The story itself is very unengaging and the characters in it are just as boring. The supporting cast ranges from ""meh"" (the friends) to ""completely braindead and annoying"" (everyone else).The big shaman girl is just a ♥♥♥♥♥, calling the main character ""no warrior"" after he single-handedly defeated a dozen pirate camps while her so-called warriors did nothing at all.The half-enemy strange guy that kidnapped your best friend attacks you with a knife. And for some contrived reason your player character pulls out his knife instead of just shooting him with the MACHINEGUN IN HIS HAND. Argh.Vaas, the big-bad from the beginning of the game waits around corners to punch you like... fifty times. It gets old VERY fast.Lots of setpieces don't make the slightest sense. I have a clear shot at the big-bad-evil-guy and am carrying around a Remington sniper rifle. Can I take the shot? Nope. Because cutscene.I escape the pirates and decide to steal a helicopter instead of just slipping into the jungle... why exactly? Oh right, because Vaas needs to recapture the player.I finally get the opportunity to attack Vaas' hideout and decide to kick in his front door and go in guns blazing. Alone. Not to mention the combat in this game works best if you rely on stealth and hit&run attacks. Riiiight.This level design belongs in a Micheal-Bay-Style FPS like Call of Duty and not in something with this kind of survival-vibe.Also the kills on the antagonists aren't even satisfying because they're just boring QTEs. In conclusion: If you want a free-world action game get GTA or Just Cause 2. If you want a spectacle shooter get CoD. If you want a shooter with an engaging anti-war story get Spec Ops: The Line. If you want a first-person survival game.. uhm.. Metro? Stalker?  But not this.			"

												Amazing.This game is an absolute masterpiece, and in this review, I'm gonna stick by Yahtzee's rule of: ""A game must be able to stand on singleplayer alone."" and, wow, this game really does stand out. The summary of this is that you (the protagonist) and your friends has been kidnapped by pirates and you've escaped. The rest of the game you are trying to get them back. Venturing throughout the game, you battle amongst different species of animals, depending on the food chain. This includes sharks, snakes, komodo dragons, crocodiles, tigers, panthers, and bears. Majority of a lot of the predators on the island include intense quicktime events when they attack by suprise. One sticking out would be a crocodile attack. If you fail to complete the quicktime event, the animal kills you. If you finish it, you either kill the animal, or damage it. You need to also kill animals to craft larger objects (bigger bandolier, more space in wallet). A situation which I found hilarious was where I was hunting for tapir to gather their pelt. I was interrupted by a tiger, who literally left my health at the lowest point. To which I retreat to the river where I was instantly attacked by a crocodile. The game realistically shows all the different situations in the jungle and proves Vaas as he said: ""if the jungle doesn't eat you up alive, I will."".Going onto characters, Vaas is one of the best villians I have ever had the pleasure of laying my eyes against. True fact, Vaas wasn't even supposed to be in the game, Michael Mondo's(Vaas' voice actor) audition pleased Ubisoft so much, that they decided to create the character Vaas for him. As you saw the summary above, which is quite bland, Vaas introduces the story of insanity. To which it makes you think, what if all of this isn't happening and you're sedated or on drugs? What if this is all a dream? I may be sounding completly irrelevant and random, but the theme of insanity really does make you wonder what is actually going on throughout. Not to mention there are even more villians than Vaas.While you battle pirates and animals, you have a wide range of weapons to choose from. There are RPGs, bows, SMGs, rifles, shotguns, flamethrowers, flare guns and machetes. Not to mention you get to customize your weapons, for instance, you can add a red dot sight to your bow to help accuracy or add a extended mag to your rifle to stop running out of ammo quicker. Your character also gets tattoos from the Rakyat which improve your fighting and stealth skills. The tattoos you get to pick from are the heron, the shark and the spider. Tattoos that would be an example would be moving faster while crouching, the throwing knife takedown and the added health bars.If you are thinking ""tl;dr"", then my summary of this review is that this game is one of my favorites I have ever played along with other great games like Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, and Fallout. There are a few problems with the UPlay, which ruins it a bit. But all in all, a great game.10/10 GG Ubisoft.			"

												Far Cry 3 é simplesmente ÉPICO! Caçar, sobreviver, matar.. coisas constantes nesse jogo que vai te deixar em suspense do início ao fim. Não é a toa que recebeu ótimas notas nas Review's mundiais. Uma ilha gigantesca, lotada de animais selvagens para se caçar e diversos piratas lunáticos espalhados por todos os cantos da Ilha comandados por um dos vilões mais épicos da história dos games, o Vaas. No game, você acaba sendo raptado pelo Vaas junto com seus amigos e também seus dois irmãos, e no fim acaba lutando para conseguir salvar a todos e sair vivo dessa Ilha do Terror. Eu geralmente não curto muito os jogos da Ubisoft, ainda mais pela Uplay existir, mas esse jogo aqui é diferente.. É um jogo incrível que me fez ficar bastante tempo viciado nele!Se você tem dinheiro pra gastar, esse jogo é indispensável! Coop divertidíssimo e um Multiplayer de certa forma viciante, achei até melhor que o Multiplayer de CoD. Jogabilidade excelente e gráficos de primeiro mundo. Um dos melhores jogos que já joguei na vida, e que recomendo a todos jogarem sem pensar duas vezes ;D------------------------------~ NOTA: 9,8------------------------------			"

												What can I say about Far Cry 3?  The game is pretty.  That is the only good thing I have to say about this game.The following review may contain spoilers!!!  You've been warned!!!You start Far cry 3 and the first thing you notice is how great everything looks and you think to yourself ""This is gonna be great"".  Since this is a game that lets you free roam you do the first storyline mission, maybe two and then you just go explore.  The problem with exploring is there really isn't anything to explore.  You have to liberate the radio tower in an area to unlock the map and then you get 2-3 camps to liberate to remove enemy soldiers from the area.  The only other thing to do is find all the collectible crap that might unlock signature weapons but mostly is just there to keep the OCD people playing until they complete 100%.  Everything that was fun or interesting about the game was over by the time I finished the first island.  The second island in the game was not fun at all and contains pretty much every crappy gimmick that has been put into video games in the past decade.  Seriously timed button presses, mini games,  and poorly made rail shooters.  I only completed the storyline missions on the second island just so I could finish the game.  It wasn't fun, interesting, or engaging.  It seems like they knew their game was bad so they decided to make you have to jump through hoops to unlock literally everything in the game.  You have to unlock the map, the weapons, extra weapon slots, extra ammo slots, all the skills, literally everything.  Nothing in this game happens without you performing some kind of grind.  This isn’t fun, what happened to the days when games were fun?     "

												This game is good. However Uplay is the downside, here is why...I bought Farcry 3 off steam, to play Farcry 3 you need a Uplay account (Farcry 3 is made by Ubisoft). When i bought the game from Steam it gave me an activation code. I put this key in and all was well (i got onto the game). However, the problem occured when a few days later i went onto Uplay to go on Farcry 3. I clicked on Farcry 3 and it asked me to put my activation key in again. I put the key in and it said ""This CD key or Activation code is already in use with another Uplay account..."". This was exactly the same account as i had used to type my activation code in before. I have not been on the game since, thanks alot Uplay. I want to know if anyone else has had the same problem, i wonder if it was to do with the Uplay update. Uplay highered my blood pressure dramatically and has ruined this game.			"

												Far Cry 3 is the king of aesthetics. The jungles scattered throughout the island are overflowing with detail, wildlife, etc. The game does a great job at having you feel immersed as you try to save your friends from an unforgiving warlord, and his henchmen. The first few hours of the game are bliss. You're just killing things, and getting tatt'ed up. The game then becomes stale. You start killing the same enemies, start recieving the same missions, and you are even forced to travel halfway across the map between missions.     Then there's the protagonist. His profile indicated he is a grown man- but his voice actor makes him sound like a disney-channel sitcom teen. This shattered it for me. His expressions even made me cringe well into the game. Though he grows, the more you learn about him, the less you want to be playing as him. In short, 6/10 , expected something more.			"

												Too many quicktime events and too much guiding by the hand. The missions are not that unique, and the writing for the main character was not too great. The scenery is the best part, but overall the gameplay is rather bland. I am glad I got this onsale.			"

												Let me just start off by saying that there is very few games out there that can keep my attention and get me so drawn into the story that I don't want to stop playing. Now that being said here's my pros and cons of this game(and trust me when I say the pro's heavily outweigh the cons)Pros:Awesome storylineStreamline gameplayWide variety of guns for every type of playerWingsuit..because who doesn't love to ""soar like an eagle""?Parachute because crashing to the ground is never funA lot of character depthLots of side things to do from missions to upgrading gear and unlocking new skills even after the main story is overTons of replayability(BIG BIG BIG plus in my book)Crazy plot twist after crazy plot twist keeps you on your feet throughout the main storylineCons:Vehicles are a little wonky on the controls and sometimes impossible to controlSemi-Short storyline(this is my only big complaint about this game)*this is a personal opinion for me* I wish using the Parachute to Wingsuit combo makes your glide longer in the wingsuitBow controls are a little hard to get used to but can be mastered if you stick to it, not as easy to use as the guns are in this game making it almost obsolete compared to the rifles.Overall this game is a definite suggestion for anyone who loves games that play like Tomb Raider(2013+), Just Cause, or the other Far Cry games.

												I tried to like this game.I really tried.That's not to say Far Cry 3 is a bad game. It has some very interesting features and there are a lot of improvements over the previous game (Far Cry 2), for example:- Better stealth. Enemies can no longer spot you from miles away and snipe you with a pistol.- No more infinite vehicle chase. If you come across an enemy patrol, you can outrun them instead of having them follow you till the end of Earth.- More animals. Far Cry 2 had animals (Zebras!), but thtey were extremely rare.- No more weapon deterioation. F*** the gun jamming mechanics in Far Cry 2. All it did was to force the player to visit a gun warehouse in between mission.- Weapon customisation - horray for red-dot sights- Stealth take down - in Far Cry 2 if you sneak up to someone and stab them in the back you will alert everyone nearby, but in Far Cry 3 you can actually perform a stealth kill with a melee weapon and even hide their body.- Better fast travel - I can't remember how many bus rides I took during Far Cry 2.- Crocodiles. I will never forget the first time I see an unsuspecting NPC get dragged into the river by a crocodile.However, this game also has a lot of flaws, some I found critical, other annoying enough to put me off the game:- You can't save during a mission. Sure you can quick save (which btw isn't mentioned in the game manual) to keep the loot you have found, but you will lose any other progress if you don't complete the mission in one sitting. Far Cry is supposed to be an open world game, so why the heck do I have to go to the menu to abandon quest if I change my mind half way through?- Too bloody many tigers. More than once I have seen an outpost (that I am supposed to conquer) get slaughtered by some wild tiger/komodo dragon. While it's funny to watch the first time, it rapidly gets less interesting after that.- NPCs keep repeating the same line. It's as if they only know 20 words in total.- Immersion break. If the locals have formed a resistance group against the pirates, aside from the occansion patrols, why is is that I seem to be the only one fighting?- Terrible health system that forces you to choose a stealthy approach. Even with a bullet proof vest, you can only last for a few seconds in a gun fight before you health is completely depleted. You pretty much have to thin the enemy out from a distance using a silenced weapon in order to survive.- Odd graphics. This game has some very weird shading that reminds me of cell-shaded games. It is as if the developers can't make up their mind on whether to make the game look realistic or cartoonish.I know that a lot of people will disagree with my opinion and there are a lot of positive reviews out there regarding this game. However, I feel that I have given this game a fair chance and I just cannot get around to enjoying myself playing it.			"

												Don't buy this game. The story is terribly written in my opinion and doesnt fit at all in the far cry series. the gameplay is very repetetive, with each outpost having the same structure. it comes too predicable that even at the hardest difficulty you can easily do well at the game just using a pistol. In the story (Both co-op and single player) it's just cliche after cliche after cliche. It happens so often that it just gets annoying and it just feels awful. You get no connection to the protagonist at all, you won't llike him, you don't even want to be him and wish he'd just jump off a cliff, break his ankles and left there for no one to be found ever. Neither do you feel connected to the world. In most games you get a sense of where you are, roads feel familiar, certain parts feel like home. In this game it is just jungle after beach after dirt road and they all just seem the same.The story is full of spiritual nonsense that could fit in a setting centuries ago or in a different kind of world (where magic and unicorns exist), but not in the 21-st century on a tropical island where everybody has 17 guns. If you have a gun, you don't need some pretentious spiritual power to kill just another thug with a group of his guards. Honestly, the only way the game is fun is to just avoid all storyline missions, not using the map and running around blindly shooting people. Basically what FarCry 2 consisted of.The co-op is kind of alright in the game. The campaign doesnt really have that much story (this doesn't really matter though, it's about shooting things with your friends). It consists of multiple chapters which can be played chronologically. It's fun to do a few times, but the problem is that all these chapters are so repetetive and contain the same things, you never get a nice surprise. The worst part is the extreme glitchiness in Co-op. Anybody has a ping over 60? Fat chance that when you respawn after everyone dies, somebody on your team will just randomly drop dead and has to wait for the next checkpoint. Or he seems to appear on top of a building, while you're standing inside it. Good luck saving him when he gets incapacitated. Furthermore it is impossible to play with 2 players, as random kicks without a visible reason happen very often. if you play it with 2, and one gets kicked, you automatically get booted because 'there aren't enough players.' Say goodbye to your progress.All in all, get off the store page, and spend your money on a better game. But not this, don't do this to yourself.			"

												So this game, has an interesting enough concept, you get to roleplay a white whiney teenager who goes for a holiday then gets captured by a much more interesting villain who has some great dialogue and presence.It breaks down into an Ubisoft favourite, capture X area Y times with slight variances with upgrades in weapons inbetween and a forest of trouble between the areas (like the very linear and constrained Assassin's Creed).The much more improved part of this are the great NPCs and the environment of the jungle, you will end up getting surprise attacked by a tiger, crocodile or shark rather than getting killed by any human characters since they are quite predictable and even on ultra hard mode they are easy to sneak up on.The game has XP and money barriers for progression but there is an interesting hunting and gathering requirement which requires you to gather animal and plant products for consumables and how much ammo or how many guns and consumables  can be carried.Littered throughout the open world are various racing and shooting mini games in addition to hunting, searching and assassinaitng quests.  This is all great and fun indeed.The graphics are quite great especially with everything turned up.You're probably asking why I don't recommend this game.Ubisoft seems to have trouble programming and supporting its titles beyond console release.Thsi game is littered with gamebreaking bugs, glitches and will make your machine regardless of if it is top of the line 2 years ago or top of the line today to crash or hang.Sometimes you'll be able to play the game for 4 or 5 hours straight no problems other times you'll have difficulty having it running for 15 minutes.It seems to be a theme with Ubisoft every PC port they make has an unexcusable number of problems.In addition to this there is the extra layer of trashware implemented - Uplay.  Which is basically a massive Ubisoft advertisment which requires administrative access to run and is morethan likely one of the causes for autosave points to crash your machine.If you would like your machine to crash more times in the one playthrough of a game than over the last 3 years, by all means buy this game.  If you want ot keep your sanity and send a message to Ubisoft that PC gamers will not put up with a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥job then do not buy this game.			"

												Like skyrim with guns. Needs mods to make the gameplay more fun, but it never gets its core problems fixed.Lacks depth, exploration is only fun for the first 2 hours. Very repetitive gameplay, in the first hour of the game you've seen 90% of the content the game has to offer. Weapons are very unsatisfying, they lack a punch and don't feel unique. Driving is awkward and you'll never drive too long before crashing your car. ""RPG"" mechanics are very, very shallow, there's only a ""perk"" tree in wich you unlock some abilities you'll rarely use, and you can unlock them all anyway. Stealth mechanics are simply bad. It's not even worth mentioning the ""survival"" mechanics and the gathering wich is just a chore to make the game feel longer instead of just letting you buy more ammo space and such.And don't get me started on the story.If you are looking for an open-world FPS with some RPG mechanics play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. instead.

												This game is actually rather shallow. You have a wide open world with alot to explore and... well thats it. There is virtually NOTHING else to do in this game beyond the story. You can do super TINY lil missions like ""Go kill a lion with this bow"" and capture little camps so that your buddies can take it over and even then the fight is easy on account of it being a simple ""kill 8 dudes"" kinda deal. The story is pretty bad in my opinion. You play a total wimp rich white boy with less hair on his chest than a newborn. There is no choice in the majority  story at all which would not be so bad if the story was good. The supporting cast is relatively bland and fail to be interesting or even create any sort of bond between you and them. I only like one on your friends because he looks like Nick from L4D2. Your character (besides being a limp-weenie) is an utter retard. CHECK YOUR CORNERS DANGIT! The story of the game also involves a large amount of tribal ritual mumbo jumbo that I find utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are alot of drug-related sequences you go into in this game to the point where I just know my guy is going to have a serious addiction. The combat is just pathetic. Its not interesting due to a lack of enemy intelligence and overall difficulty. The game is so easy and I played it on the 2nd hardest difficulty. I could have pushed it to the max with little difference. The AI are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and present no challenge. They all act as independent units with no teamwork at all other then random chance bringing them together. Stealth in this game is alright in of itself, but feels entirely hallow due to knowing that you can breeze through the enemy 12x as fast if you just ran in. Stealth killing the enemy loses its pleasure when you know the enemy are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The crafting is weak as all it results in is you becoming MORE overpowered and giving you even LESS of a challenge. The story is crap.The combat is crap.The story is MEGA crap.The main character is ULTRA crap.Buuuuuut the game is very pretty. The visual design is by far the strongest part of this game.Is it a bad game? No. I dislike it because I value characters and story very highly and this game utterly fails in this department destroying my attempt at an un-biased view.			"

												I stuck it through to the end of the campaign, but this is the first game in a while that I was happy to delete.  This game is a “far cry” from the Trigens that I loved in the original Farcry, and it’s turned me off the series now for good.  There’s a reason why the game is so cheap. Visuals are incredible.  Sound is awesome.  The characters, voice acting, and animation are top-notch.  At its core, the FPS gameplay is superlative!  This game is BEAUTIFUL and provides movie-quality experience.  The best advice I can give if you already own it but haven’t tried it, is to play it free-form and enjoy the open-world experience.  But if you want a better FPS story experience that looks just as good, try the Crysis titles instead. As for co-op, I didn't try it, but I’m sure it’s good, as the FPS mechanics in this game are very good.However the campaign content in Farcry3 is so RAW that I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone playing this game.  I like my meat medium-rare, but this one is still on a living animal.  I am VERY concerned that underage people are experiencing it.  Now, don’t peg me off as some religious bible-thumper that is pro-censorship; you should hear me swearing and cursing at slow drivers while I tear down the roads cutting people off in my gas-guzzling tweaked-out car.  In the end, with FarCry 3, I just was not ENTERTAINED by “playing through” the actions you are required to take to progress in the game.The game is plastered with EXTREME profanity, there was no hope of me playing it with the volume up without offending anybody nearby.   The pirates are constantly swearing at you, taunting you, calling you a mutha*cker, the main character swears as he skins animals or nearly dies, and the cut scenes are so full of offensive language that it seems they had to fill a quota and fill in as many sh!t’s and fu*k’s as they could.  The single-player campaign has you hunting animals (boars, pigs, deer, goats, sharks, komodo dragons, dogs, leopards, tigers, bears) with all sorts of weapons, including bows, shotguns, assault rifles, and flamethrowers.  Yes, there ACTUALLY is a mission that requires you hunt down and kill eight dogs with a flamethrower.  Now, to be fair, they were advertised as “rabid dogs that need to be put down.”  But as I approached with my flamethrower in hand, and walked right up to the pack of 8, not one attacked me.  And as I started to flame them, all they did was run away whining.  NOT a fun gaming experience.  I have a dog, she’s an important member of our family.  THIS was in no way fun.And then, the premise is, you skin each of the animals.  On the screen, as you do this, you get a gory visual of the main character inserting his knife into the dead animal, ripping the skin off, and putting the lump of flesh into his rucksack (usually with a “f*ck!” while he does it).  This is REQUIRED so that you can “craft” larger containers to carry your crap in.  Otherwise you can only carry one weapon, with little ammo, and very little money.  F@ck, if I want do that crap I will go play deer hunter.  And CRAFTING?  Why, since MineCraft came out, does everyone think they need to have it too?!   If I want to mix sh!t together, I’ll go try to cook something in the kitchen and fail miserably.  Why can’t I just pick up med kits or buy them in stores like all the other FPS games out there?  No, I have to search for green leaves to CRAFT syringes (where does the syringe come from???)Anyway, back to the story.  It is a mystical tale of human trafficking, drug trade, overcoming all odds, and saving (or betraying) your friends, who are being held hostage on the tropical paradise by pirates.  The bad guy characters are all way too over-the-top insane.  Hilarious at times, mind you, I did laugh, but Vass is simply too much, and he sure screams a lot.  Oh, and did I mention he swears?  Hoyt is a bit better for language, and funny too, but you actually see him for less of the game than Vass.  You spend half of the key plot sequences in (apparently) a drug or mushroom-induced hallucinogenic state, fighting fiery demons with a bow and arrows or knives.  At the end of these sequences, I found out that, apparently, I succeeded in killing the bad guy.  What the hell?  Why can’t I just put a bullet through his head?  Oh, was that a bit too gory for mainstream gaming perhaps?At various points, the game has you holding space bar down to TORTURE people.  It includes first-person sex scenes with a crazy jungle girl.  There are themes of r@pe (including homosexual – you are asked to pucker up your a$$ up on several occasions).  There are people that are burned to death in cages in movie-like experience.  If I want to see all of that, I’ll fire up an old copy of Amistad.  This is NOT entertaining.All in all, it’s just too much.  I just want to run and gun and save the hot chick so she can suggestively tell me that I should come over later with a smile and a wink.  Happy ending.Back to the good in this sh!t sandwich – the guns are done very well, with a good selection and interesting attachment options.  The vehicles in the game are lots of fun, all sorts of road and water craft to try, albeit with some questionable physics.  The islands themselves are beautifully constructed, with beaches, caves, hidden pathways, old temples – everything you loved from Tomb Raider, and more.  The open-world concept is very nice, “freeing” the radio towers is an interesting side quest for the first 10 towers, and then it gets tedious afterwards (though the puzzle aspect of it was fun).  At least it unlocked new guns and opened up your map, otherwise I wouldn’t have bothered.  I have the same feelings about re-taking outposts, it was fun the first 20 times.  However the game requires you to do it in order to open up new “hunter quests” so that you can craft the very best equipment.  By the end of my ~25-hour experience, I simply had enough and powered through the rest of the campaign so I could delete it from my hard drive.  Unfortunately for me, once I start something, I usually have to finish it.  Notice I didn’t have to mention uPlay to complain about this game.  But that part sucks too.ANYWAY, there was one memorable and awesome part of the game that I want to mention – you are required to take your newfound flamethrower and burn up some drug fields on a plantation to set back the local warlord.  As you arrive at the mission site, the soundtrack switches over to gangsta rap (a good track actually!) while you run and spray all of the drug fields.  It was very well orchestrated and reminded me of the epic fax machine scene in Office Space.  If there’s one reason I’d start up Far Cry 3 again, it would be to do that mission.  If it was available as a separate $2 mission, I’d buy it and play it.Don’t do it kids, go enjoy real life or a more encouraging game instead of wasting your time with this overly-negative story experience.EDIT:  Steam Censorship			"

												Date of review: 10.24.2014Platform: PC  Released in 2012, Far Cry 3 became a huge success, considered by many the game of the year (or at least the FPS of the year), something which I also believe it fully deserves. An open world FPS experience has never felt so polished before.Story:In the third installment of the Far Cry series you take over the role of Jason Brody, a 25 year old american daredevil who is currently on a holiday with his friends and brothers in Thailand. Everything is party and fun until the group goes skydiving over the supposedly uninhabited Rook Islands, only to land on a world occupied by pirates who deal with kidnapping and human trafficking…While the plot is not as mature and meaningful as the one of Far Cry 2, it’s more than first meets the eye, being a carefully built satire.Characters are very deep, and Vaas Montenegro is one of the coolest antagonists ever to show up in a game.Though not directly related to the main plot/story line, the detailed history of Rook Islands (going back all the way to ancient China), the Rakyat (the native people of the islands) the Japanese occupation during the second world war, etc. adds a lot to the game and to the immersion.9/10 Visuals:Far Cry 3 looks absolutely stunning. Colorful yet wild, the tropical world has never looked so good and alive before, with breath taking landscapes and dozens of animals roaming/flying around. This is definitely one of those games you just enjoy by looking at. The variety is also impressive, from the lush jungles to the sandy beaches, from ancient temples to small villages, it’s simply a pleasure to roam around, and explore, and the small details really make it feel rewarding.Combat also looks and thus feels great, with brutal animations and beautiful explosions, making firefights incredibly fun.The day-night cycle (although somewhat short) is present as well and adds a lot to the visuals, creating sights which will easily take your breath away.Of course, such visuals will require a decent system in order to run smoothly on High and/or Ultra detail settings. On the test rig (for reference see test system specifications at the bottom of the review), I could run Far Cry 3 at 1080p Ultra details and 2xMSAA with very good frame rates. I did get some rare fps drops in very intense fight scenes, but even then the game was more than smooth enough to be played. Turning MSSA over 2x however, pretty much killed my frames, but this is absolutely acceptable considering the visual quality. All in all, you will need something like an Intel Core i5 3570K or an AMD FX-8350 CPU paired with a GeForce GTX 770 (GTX 680) or an AMD Radeon R9 280X (HD 7970 Ghz Edition) GPU to be able to play on Ultra settings with 2-4xMSAA at 1080p resolution. However, I also know people who play Far Cry 3 on low end PC's or laptops and they were still able to get decent fps rates on low to medium detail settings, so the game seems to be quite well optimized... thumbs up for Ubisoft (for a more in depth analysis on system requirements I advise you to check the ""Far Cry 3 Performance Test: Graphics & CPU"" on Techspot).10/10Gameplay:If you thought visuals were the game’s greatest strength, you were wrong… the gameplay is simply fantastic. Far Cry 3 takes over where Far Cry 2 left off, but delivers so much more in a significantly more polished way.The main plot is long, with varied and fun to play missions. The secondary missions/quests may not be as meaningful as in Far Cry 2 for example, but the game more than makes up for them with the unbelievably fun exploration, hunting, gathering, collectibles, etc. Really, collecting stuff and exploring has never felt as rewarding and as fun, whether you are searching for relics or letters from the Japanese soldiers (who occupied the islands during the Second World War), or whether you are hunting a rare white tiger or gathering herbs, you will have fun. You could probably rush through the main plot in 15-20 or so hours, but if you allow yourself sucked into the world of Rook Islands you can spend 75+ hours and you will still have plenty of stuff to do. Simply awesome.Of course this is an FPS, so one of the main questions here is, how are the guns? Short answer: great! There are well over 20 weapons to choose from, pistols, sub machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, light machine guns and even exotics like the flame thrower or the re-curving bow. Also, almost all weapons are customizable, you can attach sound suppressors, scopes, extended magazines, etc. providing a truly varied arsenal which you can configure to perfectly fit your play style.Long range and close quarter combat is usually viable in every FPS, but Far Cry 3 will also be completely playable using stealth tactics, even more, you will be rewarded for stealthy kills and takedowns (which are awesome by the way), or carefully and tactically liberating outposts without getting detected. Oh and do you remember the outpost re-spawn problem from Far Cry 2? It's gone! In Far Cry 3 a libreated outpost is taken over by the Rakyat, and will serve as a safe house.As in the previous Far Cry installments, vehicles are also available. And I have to say (at least for me personally), the cars handle better and are more fun to drive than in many racing games… which is not something we are used to from an FPS.But Far Cry 3 is so much more than a simple open world FPS… the introduction of RPG elements might sound scary for some hardcore FPS fans, but Far Cry 3 nailed it. During your adventures you gain experience and eventually level up, which is rewarded with skill points which you can use to unlock some incredibly cool and brutal takedown moves and other bonuses. The skills feel balanced, you’ll never become a Terminator, but they are also rewarding enough to make you want to unlock them.And we are still not done, Far Cry 3 also has crafting! Now don't imagine a complex gathering/crafting system. You can gather skins and furrs from animals to create ammo bags and pouches, and different plants for different syringes which can heal you or provide different short term bonuses. Not much but it perfectly fits the game and the setting.10/10Sound:While the previous Far Cry games were ok when it came to sounds, they never really managed to impress me. Far Cry 3 is different, the soundtrack finally contains some memorable tunes, the ambient sounds are great, the guns, the explosions and combat in general sounds brutal, and the voiceovers are some of the best I heard in a long time, again with Vaas stealing the show.10/10Replay value:Far Cry 3’s plot is linear, and there aren't many choices you can take, you won’t replay the game for the different endings, but for everything else, because Far Cry 3 is pure fun. And... for Vaas!9/10Conclusion:The third Far Cry game really managed to put an incredibly polished and fun gameplay onto the table. It would be nice if developers finally understood that visuals and content are important, but in the end, it’s the gameplay that will really make a game fun to play… because a good game is fun to play.Great games however, are not only fun to play, but also look great and also have tons of content, and Far Cry 3 is one of these, it simply delivers in everything. Definitely a must have!9.5/10Test system specifications: AMD FX-8350 (OC @ 4.6 GHz); 8 GB DDR3 RAM @ 1866 MHz; AMD Radeon R9 280X (AMD Catalyst 14.4 and 14.9), Windows 8.1 64 Bit Pro.			"

												I am rewriting my review, leaving previosu thoughts but i have now made a final decision. I can no longer recommend this game because:1. The game is in a constant state of requiring to connect to ""far cry 3 services"" which is just nonsense. So apparently when I launched the game,  I was greated with ""failed to connect to far cry 3 services"". Cryptic, for sure. Basically an issue on ubisoft's end.     While playing, every time I access the menu or map (and in this game, you do it a LOT) I was forced to set for about 15-30 seconds after, everytime, interrupted by an immergency message saying the game needed to connect to ""far cry 3 services"". It failed, every time. After this attempt, I was ""allowed"" to keep playing as long as I didn't use the map or inventory/crafting screen because then it would try again.2. The map is beyond glitchy and buggy, its broken and in many instances, preventing the use of fast travel or even basic viewing. Game itself is fine, the method of delivery is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. Avoid. BELOW IS MY PREVIOUS REVIEW TAKE ON THE GAME INITIALLY. I really like this game ! But I'm reviewing the steam digital version here. And unfortunately, compared to what Steam offers, it's downright idiotic that their entire opportunity to use TRADING CARDS or  ACHIEVEMENTS       is GONE because of U PLAY.  U PLAY is like a steam wanna be except it doesn't do what steam does , it just tries to do what xbox live does, and I was never interested in either. I really don't mind U play that much, but its pointless since nobody is going to see your account because nobody uses U PLAY apart from when they are forced to for a few select games of their choosing. GREAT game ! A little silly stupid sometimes with how inept a character can be until you suddenly gain control and they turn into Rambo's dad.          Hindered by being forced to use a second DRM game launcher that is essentially a second Steam..... that prevents Steam from doing what it does best.  And nobody needs two different online platform accounts for the same game.			"

												You are Jason. Normal dude, with a 7/10 model qt girlfriend (her butt is 10/10 though). A sudden turn of events change you in to a tattoo loving, native boning, acid tripping badboy. You walk, you run, you drive (poorly), occasionally you jump from helicopters with some kind of gliding suit. You kill and harvest the meat of a number of animals. It’d be much too convenient to simply buy things you need when you can just kill boars, tigers, … and sharks. How do you kill a shark? Just stand on land and shoot it, duh! You also have a weird fetish for radio towers, but people give you free stuff for going to the top of them, so why not? Oh yeah there are a bunch of bad guys constantly trying to kill you too.Yup, just another day in paradise.The good:+ A shooter pretty much anyone can pick up and play. The easiest difficulty I didn’t have a problem playing with a steam controller.+ Impressive visuals. Can still challenge even a GTX 1080.+ A sizable world that I never really felt bored in.+ Decent story, but the game is not that story heavy. Think GTA V not the Witcher 3.+ Great voice acting with very interesting characters.+ A decent mix of missions.+ A satisfying kind of bad♥♥♥♥♥ending.+ Trippy drug induced sequences add some artistic flair.The bad:- Weird technical glitches, at least 2 missions I had to replay because I was unable to loot an important body.- Crappy save system. Can only save outside of mission. Event then some times when you save you don’t end up where you think you will on load.- Occasional crash, this will cost you some time because of the save system.- Weird performance deterioration between save points / transitions.- Bad driving controls. Driving is overly challenging on a controller.- Couldn’t get it to recognize the steam controller. There is a controller mode but had to map controller to keyboard / mouse. Less desirable because you have to remember what everything is mapped to.-Uplay. Need I say more?TLDR;A pretty good looking shooting romp around a paradise island that I think most people would be able to play. Story is OK if not a little weird. A few technical glitches hold this game back from being highly recommend, but if you can overlook that it’s still a decent game. I’ve played much worse so I say give it a shot.			"

Singleplayer:Campaign:I played the campaign on it's hardest difficulty and it took me somewhere around 15 hours. The story is about Jason Brody having a vacation on an island. And wakes up in a cage realising that his vacation is over and he has to save all his friends so they can get back home. This sounds and also felt generic. But as you continue through the game the story gets more and more interesting, due to well voiced characters and the inspiring monologues. The game also felt like some kind of total recall to me, because the character has many drug trips. So even when I was playing the normal sp missions I was asking myself if it wasn't just a drug trip. Because if the bulk of the story was a drug trip the story would make a lot more sense. The campaign story was mostly the reason that kept me playing. Gameplay:The gameplay other hand was good and entertaining, but nothing special for me. Some early missions could be annoying, because you were forced to play stealthily. Also the sp missions can sometimes feel as a narrow route.  The power of the gameplay itself is that you can choose how you want to play. stealthily or guns blazing. Both can be fun but both also have some issues. The stealth problem is that the ai can be annoying. And for guns blazing you can easily run out of ammo and have to break your arm to revive yourself many times if you play guns blazing.(Atleast on my difficulty. I would maybe recommend to play 1 difficulty below or first do a lot of side missions to unlock more health, weapons etc.) Also if you have no ammo you mostly have to camp until you can easily knife someone, without getting hit. Sadly every endboss fight from the game showed the definition of insanity in gameplay. The game was also a bit overwhelming in the beginning because of the many menus with upgrades. At first I ignored them, but later I really saw the benefit of it. Otherwise you will easily die.  The graphics of the game still look nice, I especially liked the lighting. And how much effort there had been put into the building. Open World:I have to be honest I haven't done that much in it. Because I wasn't really interested in it. Still I can say if you are interested in exploring the world there is alot to do! There are enough side-missions, which is mostly killing enemies/animals in a certain way, missions where you have to go from A to B as fast as you can etc and, of course, collecting stuff. Really the only thing that made me stop fast-traveling from mission to missions was the tower climbing and the animal/flower hunt to unlock stuff. They were more rewarding to me than the side missions that just give you money and xp that I already had enough of. Online:Multiplayer:In my opinion the mp isn't that special. It has 4 standard game modes. Of course they are varied with some nice ideas. But to me it just feels like a cod-clone. The multiplayer also has a strong map editor. Probably at the time there were many great mods made. (I found some interesting ones on youtube. ) But now that the game isn't as active anymore, I couldn't find a modded map to play.-Co-op:I played the co-op with someone many months before continuing my singleplayer campaign. It was pretty long at 6-8 hours. But still the co-op was pretty generic and forgetable. The only thing that I liked were the mini-games. What is strange is that the multiplayer and the co-op leveling system are combined. So if I had only played Co-Op, I would have all the unlocked loadouts for the multiplayer. Overall:I can say Farcry 3 is a great game, but you can ignore the multiplayer and co-op, because they aren't that special and that active anymore. I think for the people who only own FarCry 4, FarCry 3 is still a great game to play, especially for the campaign, that makes it something special.			"

												Booooo uPlay.This game requires a uPlay signin to play. In some cases, uPlay activation is either unobtrusive or not required, but for this game, it is. You will launch the game in Steam, which launches uPlay, which launches the actual game. My actual time played is about 8 hours, but Steam isn't reflecting it for that very reason.That being said:+Big world!+Shooting/stealth is fun and for the most part, enjoyable.+One of the few games with a satisfying flamethrower that catches huge patches of jungle on fire.-Pretty unoptimized, but I can't tell if it's because I have to run uPlay as well.-Skill trees suck. They do that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ""Lock certain abilities until you're further in the story"" thing. Just give me a skill list instead of a tree then!-Hunting is a neat idea, but terrible in execution. I GUESS I'M CARRYING ONE GUN FOR THE REST OF THE GAME BECAUSE I CAN'T FIND A GOAT TO CRAFT ANOTHER HOLSTER! It just ends up feeling like filler, since there isn't much reason to explore the world besides crafting supplies.-Garbage interface. Feels really slow and clunky, like I'm playing the game with boxing gloves on.-The story starts out pretty interesting, but is spread thin and really makes you ask ""Who cares?"" about halfway through.So between all that AND a terrible uPlay implimentation, I'd say avoid.

												I have 23 hours in this game and I've barely completed the first few missions.The world is BEAUTIFUL, in fact, I'd have to say it's the msot beautiful environment I've ever seen in a video game. It's something that Far Cry 4 failed to deliver. This game is STUNNING.Not only that, the characters (aside from the MC some might argue) are extremely well designed, and have top-notch voice atcting. This is a truly once-in-a-generation game. It's something I find myself always coming back to and playing more of just because it's so damn fun! It has a really neat hunting/crafting system to hep carry more gear, and a - if not a bit cheesy - unique level-up system based on tattoos.TL;DR - The ""Reviews"" section from the big names for once doesn't lie about this awesome title.

												It's a game that feels like it wanted to go in the opposite direction of FC2's incredibly open world where the sheer variability of systems could backfire or interact in amazingly memorable ways, to a tightly-focused, more crafted island that has a small cast of distinct characters. And if it was just that first island with the distinct characters and the well-crafted experience, it wouldn't have me giving it a thumbs-down, but the problem is, the game takes this massive nosedive in the back half.I feel like I should state I had fun with half of this game, and so if you can find it for half price, that seems reasonable, but as a whole, this is the digital equivalent of swimming half of a lane pleasantly, and then finding that the return trip has replaced your flippers with concrete blocks.

												I would like to start this review by saying this would probably be a great game if I could play it, but Uplay makes it so difficult to open this up and play it its crazy. It doesn't even work most of the time.Another thing I like to do with some of my games is load 100% finished savegames in free roam games so I can run around the island and do whatever. So far I have not been able to do so because Uplay's ""cloud protection"" wipes out saves, rewrites, replaces and overall just messes everything up. If you can deal with uplay go right ahead but if you can't pass on this one or get it on a console.			"

No load button, save is compeltely automatic so if you screwed anything up and miss clicked too bad, now you're stuck. I don't see why at all you wouldn't add a load feature while playing the game and instead of abandoning my racing it puts me an hour back because screw you...Tecnical and ease of use issues really ruin the game for me.

												Far Cry 3 is an interesting return to form for Ubisoft. What is it? Well it's adventure to put it bluntly, and it seems like they geared the whole game around it. Adventure, action, survival. It's plot bares very interesting similarities to 19th century adventure stories like Treasure Island, with the protagonist having to face pirates and psychologically grow stronger as a character.In terms of gameplay the game is fundamentally very similar to Far Cry 2, but at the same time very different. The plot structure is more cinematic and focused on story. Adding to that, animals are much more heavily focused upon. The game introduces a crafting system and inorder to carry more guns and ammunition you must skin specific animals. This actually makes the game very interesting with how you hunt animals in the overworld and breaks up the monotony of killing pirates fairly effectively.That's not to say the game is without flaws. While the protagonist is portrayed as an everyman, even on the hardest difficulty you are death incarnate outside of cutscenes. Adding to that the game's sidequests are more or less just ""Kill this particular enemy with a specific weapon"" or ""find this particular animal"".Ubisoft designed the world very effectively. Overall it's kill pirates, get money, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es. Not necessarily in that order.			"

												This game is great had so much fun with it.  The story is awesome and some what believable.  The world is detailed and the gameplay is immersive(dem health regen animations man). After you finish the story I recommend setting up a classic rock station on pandora and YOLOing it on the outpost, so much fun.10/10 TAT bros for life and would strap c4 to a monkey again			"

												Where to start. IMO This game overall is nothing special. Even playing on the hardest difficulty this game was easy. Tank your way through and inject enough medical needles to turn yourself into a walking testosterone infused pot head, and you will be fine. Stealthing made it a little more challenging, but not by much. The story is nothing to right home about, most of the characters are just boring, the script for most of them was like somthing out of a bad modern action movie, opened world with not much to do, money is freaking EVERYWHERE, obtaining new weapons is as easy as climbing a tower, upgrading all of your varius storage packs are as simple as killing a few animals, and this game is repetitive AS HELL! Find artifacts and letters (it's as easy as an easter egg hunt), liberate outposts by killing about 6 to 8 guards, climb towers to get free stuff, damsel in distress, medical runs, hunt animals and bandets, and the main story (about 8 hours). Thats it, there is nothing that makes this game stand out from the rest. The story didn't have a stong start and just feels like poorly writen action movie. It doesn't become interesting until a character named vaas tells you the definition of insanity. But once he dies the story goes down hill again faster than lemmings. It's not all bad though, a few of the characters are interesting along with some dialogue, and it tries to spice things up. But it's not enough to backlash all of the♥♥♥♥♥♥Over all if you are a FPS junky and don't mind doing the same thing over and over and over again go for this game. But if you want games with outstanding sotries, interesting gameplay, new and different ideas, and memorable characters. look elsewhere.Also, note how i never metioned the graphics and multiplayer? Thats because almost every ♥♥♥♥ING FPS does nothing but that now.			"

												Quite a memorable game with memorable characters. Despite being mostly a free-roam game, with plenty of distractions and activities, like hunting, killing, swimming, gliding etc. it has a decent story.As I mentioned in the beginning, the characters are one of the strongest points in this game, every character with their own strong personalities, each one with their own insanity, great voice acting and motion track. The motivation and choice freedom of the protagonist feel a bit wooden and not quite dynamic, but the diversity in the activities, making it feel not quite so linearity dependent, compensates for the lack of story control.The story can be easily completed with minimum of effort, since difficulty doesn't really represent an impediment (if you play shooters often, you can aim for the highest difficulties), but making the side activities do help in certain cases, especially for the traveling part.The vehicle control is quite fluent, reminds me of the car from Half-Life 2. The weapons can be customized in a variety of ways, from adding attachments to adding a camo, quite easy to use, they have ironsight, so for any Call of Duty player they should be a no-brainer.It has a sort of RPG-like skill tree, which allows you to get new abilities and features, supporting your gameplay as well as your herb/animal crafting system.The co-op is average, not much of a story, really linear levels, it's basically a cooperative competition, since each level contains a sort of mini-game with ranking, so you will be able to beat your friends and brag about it. It's sometimes bugged, you may be spawning dead, fall through the ground.The multiplayer is quite...empty...not many people play it, it has basic game modes like team deathmatch and domination like modes, feels a lot like a ""Call of Duty"" style. You also have a multiplayer leveling system (not the same with the one from single player), which will unlock new weapons/skills etc. I also happened to encounter some cheaters and some bugs.Also wanted to add that this game's antagonist (the cool one), Vaas, was a source of inspiration for one of my cosplay projects, feel free to check it out.

												Let's start by talking about why Assassin's Creed 3 is pish. It's a game obsessed with making you play exactly how the designers had intended. Those rewards you get for full synchronisation aren't rewards for playing well; in fact, withholding them is a punishment for playing a mission any way the designers didn't intend. Assassin's Creed 3 wants you to hit certain beats to look stylish and will end the game if you don't dance to its tune.Back in Assassin's Creed 2 the series valued emergence - the kind of crazy nonsense that might or might not happen depending on how you did or didn't play. You'd get a target and more often than not you'd do your thing and the game was happy for you to do it the way you want. Far Cry 3 loves emergence, and that makes it a more authentic Assassin's Creed than Assassin's Creed 3.It's not an unfair comparison. They were mostly developed at the same studio in Montreal, they both begin with the same old quote from Alice in Wonderland and then they both proceed to share the same ideas all over the place - similar towers to climb, similar minigames to play, a similar focus on hunting endangered critters, and a similar structure - with one critical difference: Far Cry 3 lets you do most things your way. It's a thirty-hour anecdote generator and some of the year's best gaming moments have been emergent madness spawned by Far Cry 3's checkpoint assaults.Now, there's a lot I dislike about Far Cry 3. The campaign has all your Game Design Favourites like Forced Stealth, Escort Missions, and First Person Platforming is terrible. I don't want to have to keep leaving the game to see my map or craft items and I don't see why Far Cry 2's magical cardboard in-game map couldn't have carried over to Far Cry 3.I once grumbled about Far Cry 2's respawning checkpoints but 3's alternative has you gradually stripping the world of content until there's nothing left to fight but a bunch of tapirs. And I'm not keen on the - to lapse into sociology-speak - ""othering"" of the Rakyat, the white dude restoring order to a disorderly ""ethnic"" land via the hot end of his assault rifle, or the implied♥♥♥♥♥♥and QTE disco stabfest stuff either.That's not to say I want Far Cry to be a PG-rated no-chairshots-to-the-head cuddlefest, because I miss the sheer brutality of Far Cry 2 - a game where your bestest buddy deforests acres of jungle with Agent Orange just so you can have a clear line of fire at the guys farming there, never mind the damage it does to the ecosystem or to your face.In Far Cry 2 even your friends weren't your friends and it all felt like a proper descent into madness - mad characters, mad game design, one final mad moral choice, the lot. Cut to Far Cry 3 and you're punching your brother until he cries, doing the whole ""look at my hands... what have I become?"" thing and then getting straight back to jumping off a cliff with a hang glider and dive-bombing guys for phat XP. Thematic consistency is the all I'm after - Far Cry 2 had it; Far Cry 3 doesn't. But Far Cry 2 also had bad guys who could spot the golf ball Alan Shepard teed off the Moon just as it's passing Jupiter so every mission became a shoot-'em-up killing spree where everyone and everything caught fire. Four years on, Far Cry 3 has bad guys with all the observational powers of a referee in the WWE, so stealth works and works well. You get to hide and feel powerful right up to the moment you make a silly mistake and then you get to fight off a small army with the obscene firepower you're given within minutes of starting the campaign.You have fantastic tools with which to scout out an area and so many ways to know when enemies are nearby - the radar, Brody's X-Ray vision, their constant chatter - that you master the environment. Games have become sorta obsessed with ""empowering"" players - apparently ignoring the important lessons taught by games like Resident Evil and Dark Souls on the way.But in stealth games every system needs to be transparent or else you end up shouting ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T"" at the screen when a brown man standing in front of a brown tree in a brown forest filled with brown grass on the other side of the universe puts a bullet between your eyes when you were hiding behind a rock. Far Cry 3 understands stealth like Mark of the Ninja does and it means you have the tools to play the game how you like.When he's not making games badder in badder Andy Kelly likes to take out outposts with a couple of neat sniper shots to the alarm system, then pick everyone off from afar. Me? I like to get in the camp and get up close with knife and bow. And we've both had fun with it. Something goes wrong so you hide and relocate, or you Rambo everyone to death with explosive arrows, maybe.I carry a grenade launcher everywhere like Mask De Smith and go explodey the very second a pirate or a Cassowary gives me an excuse. I once had a grenade launcher joust with pirates on a bridge until I'd dumped five truckfuls of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into the river. Weird things happen in far Cry 3 and it's brilliant.When Ubisoft are trying to force Uncharted-style scripting into Assassin's Creed's massive open world it's clear game design is headed down a dark rabbit hole. And at the bottom of that hole isn't a magical wonderland filled with whimsical characters and adventure; nope, it's just a regular hole filled with rabbit poo. Far Cry 3 is good because it lets you tell your own stories within the neat boundaries Ubisoft give you. Mad emergent things happen and you're forced to deal with them using whatever comes to mind - stealth, fire, missiles, running away and hiding - Far Cry 3 doesn't care what you do, so long as you're having fun.And then you go away and tell your friends about what happened in your tropical adventure and they tell you what happened in theirs, and the stories you tell are different. That's what videogames are supposed to be. Any idiot can tell you a story, but only a videogame can give you enough flexibility to be creative and tell your own. Far Cry 3 is a proper videogame and I have the stories to prove it.If you like it, make a ""Yes""Thank you for your time!			"

												I wish I could recommend this game. It's moderately fun for the majority of it - aside from the annoying dream sequences - but the main story ground to a halt when I was suddenly forced to go on a stealth mission that automatically fails if you're ever detected. The fact that this restriction had not previously existed in any mission beforehand coupled with an imperfect AI detection screen (they saw me through a solid door once) and it made for an impasse in the game and - ultimately - left me unable to recommend this game.In an era of games like Dishonored, artificial stealth requirements - especially when I'm carrying more than enough ammunition to kill everyone in the base - just ruin the gameplay. There are too many other games that don't suddenly manufacture artificial requirements in missions to play to waste time on this one.			"

												Far Cry 3 seems promising, at first.  I think.  To be honest, no.  There was always a glimmer of this being Just Cause 2 meets Tomb Raider reboot meets maybe a dash of Spec Ops crazy, but it takes these good ingredients and pops out a mediocre product.   It's also full of rather game-ruining bugs, which were promised to be patched up by Uplay and Steam but ultimately cut many hours of progress to shreds (the camera/rocks could not be accessed, all my guns and ammo were stripped for no reason at all.)Maybe it's better on consoles, but it's ultimately a very, very generic product (Hope you like recapturing the same little outpost 32 times) outdone by its predecessors and JC2.

Posted: December 26, 2013
												Formulaic and honestly quite boring, it forces you to play as a stealthy player whether you want to or not. The main missions are filled with escort quests, not since Goldeneye have I been so utterly enraged by a stupid NPC that I have to protect. I hate the protagonist and I hate his friends. I actually hate the islanders even more and started killing them wholesale. Hunting and skinning animals and gathering plants is a meaningless grind the same can be said abouit the letter's relics, and climbing radio towers. All of these things seem to be inserted into the game to artificially inflate the legnth of the game.  I don't know how the hell this game got rated so highly because one word comes to mind Boring. Disclaimer, as a whole I would give this game a 6.5/10 based on how beautiful it is, and how mechanically strong it is, these things however are only half the battle.  The story, character interection, and other activities take away from what is otherwise a mechanically strong/ aethetically pleasing game.  Because I believe it is in poor form to criticise a game without Justifying the reasons for my opion's I'll break it down for you here.Stealth play: I firmly hate stealth play in FPS as a matter of forced enjoyment, all the assassinate pirate quests and taking of compounds plus  several story missions make you employ stealth or you fail/ Get killed by endless waves of reinforcements. Terrible mechanic is terrible, the frontal assault option needs to be just as viable, I mean this isn't splinter cell, once your equipped correctly yyou should be able to run and gun not sneak and stab.Escort Missions: I get it my friends and I all got kidnapped and now I have to rescue them / get them to safety, However, after I've mowed down an entire batalion of pirates, why the hell do I have to get ino a boat/ jeep and do an on rails turret section until we are in safety? (another thing I hate seriously screw turret sections and screw game designers for putting this crap into a game.Why the hell can't I save my ""Friend"" and tell them to run ""That way"" and then pick off the pirates as they try to persue us on foot in the jungle. I mean one of the biggest theme's in this game is you unlocking your inner hunter/ Jungle fighting badass, not unlocking your inner turret working door gunner.The Protagonist: Jason is easily my most hated protagonist, the words Whiney, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ come to mind. I mean the whining would be acceptable right up until you meet a certain island lady and unlock your inner badass hunter. (Citra I am talking about Citra) After you embrace your inner hunter you should no longer whine when gutting animal's you should no longer be brooding you should be a badass predator in the making. Instead what we get is the same kid getting more and more tatted out and mainting the same attitude.His Friends: There is not a single one that I like, If it were up to me and I could make the morale choice earlier in the game I would have made the choice to let them stay kidnapped and instead concentrated my Vendetta against Hoyt and Vaas. From the movie star to the goophy ""Stoner"" not a singe one of them is an NPC that I feel for, I don't want to save them because I honestly don't care about them.The Islander's: Why the hell are the indiginous ""Maori"" (Quoted because they are not Maori although they are likely very much so modelled after them. Or atleast I believe so, I honestly stopped paying attention after I had to fetch someones medicine and wanted to punch my monitor.) so damned helpless to solve their own most basic problems. Actually I am not going to fault this game too heavily for helpless NPC's giving me stupid fetch quests that they should be able to do on their own, as its indemic with almost ALL modern games. I'll give this example, One NPC begged me to go bully another NPC to stop him from digging up her daughters grave. The player is supposed to be this mythical great warrior, ""Read stealth prison shanker"" why would you rationally bother such a person with that sort of task? That would be like if I was in a huge war zone, and a Spec Op's soldier showed up to save me and I then asked him if he could deliver a love letter to my girlfriend. I would be told to **** off and probably be pistol whipped for suggesting something so stupid and you know what? I'd deserve it. These people are supposed to be badass warrior's what we get is a group of bumbling idiot's that after a few, ""Spy on my boyfriend, and Fetch my daughter"" quests will make you just want to outright shoot them  instead of helping them.Further if your their savior, they should be helping you (by providing valuable information not in a direct manner) not begging you for help with trivial tasks..The Time Wasters: Skinning animal's and processing plant's started out as fun but soon became quite a trivial chore, I equate them with kill 5 boars (this time literally"" and other such quests in MMO's. Climbing radio tower's is another example of forced enjoyment this time via jumping puzzles. What you have is a person running up flights of stairs and circling their way up a tower. This wouldn't be bad if their wasn't almost 30 of the stupid things in the game. (why the hell are there so many of these things on such a small group of islands in the first place?) And this brings us to the absolute joyus Memory cards, Relic's and Letters. 120 relics,  20 Letters, and I think 30 memory cards. Why? Do you really need to inlfate your game by adding so many of these things? I have a thought for the game developers on this one; Less is more when it comes to trivial tasks. Imagine what you could have had your game designers doing if you removed say half of all of those items, 60 relics, 10 letters and 15 memory cards. What amazing thing could they have done instead of designing a complex labarynth of undergound tunnels for the express purpose of putting a  Boar/ Shark Relic in there, Dittor for the jumping puzzles for the Heron relics. Could have probably designed a whole other Island, or given **********SPOILERS SPOILERS******* Vaas a decent showdown / death scene instead of that dream sequence off camera death.***********SPOILERS OVER********* instead you had them designing the aforementioned cave systems instead. As a player I don't feel that Boar relic #24 added anything special to my game experience other then making me think I really wish I had some bacon right now.  "

												Far Cry 3 spits the naive, arrogant and entitled Jason Brody into a spiralling world of violence, anarchy and survival, beset in a jungle, where survival by whatever means necessary is the norm as he restores order to the islands by takling over pirate camps and towers to reveal a map of the islands. This is what a first-shooter, open-world game ought to be. Sure, it lacks character development in some scenes, such as Jason's thrust into the island without seeing his emotions unfold as he loses his brother to Vaas. And the main villain: He was really top-notch. Vaas played his role perfectly, though the game mechanics downplayed his role as a vilain. Taking down bosses in choreographed button mashes and simplistic scenes is no way to end a boss. Same went for Hoyt Voyker and Buck Hughes.All in all, its' many hours of exploration, take-downs, gliding, sky-diving, killing and blowing up things. A journey you'll be begging to return to over and over again.Second part: Co-Op. That is some awesome stuff. Adds many, many hours of hilarious gameplay and challenge-based system that add up XP , a'la Trials of the Rakyat in Single Player.Multi-player: Well, this is probably my favorite so far. You can't play it once. Custom maps can also be built and be featured here too.Notes: Mature content. Everywhere. Overall rating: 9.5 out of 10. "

												I have about 20 hours on the ps3 version, this is a very fun open world game that you can do the story at your own pace, I did all the extra stuff such as owning the control areas and activating radio towers first, but it goes at whatever pace you want. The game looks visually amazing and this game has my favorite villian ever, Vaas.			"

												Endless world FPS... Only if you like these. Continuing straight from FC2 (game char') you fight on a far away island to release your friends. While there's obviously a lot to do, single player can be over after 8 hours or less if you choose not to play any mission outside the plot. Some mission are fun, some get boring (actually, most of them are kind of repetitive in one way or the other after you play them a few times). Graphics are marvelous, and the sound is great too, but after finishing the game you feel some parts of the plot are weak, f.e. the parts where you fight bosses - you black out, all other enemies disappear... weak.The multi player was disappointing, but I really liked the Co-op (left4dead play style, with pirates instead of zombies). There are 8 missions to be played for hours, with a ladder to abilities and experience, as in any other shooter today. The Bad things in the MP are many sever disconnections, and visual bugs (like floating dead people, etc...).It's not as good as the gaming media shouted, but if you explore the whole island, buying it today for 7.49$ (in sales) , it is a money well spent.BTW, there is no reason to buy the Deluxe edition - unless you want the whole thing. It's main addition is 2 Island side missions, nothing more.7.5/10			"

												Far Cry 3 spits the naive, arrogant and entitled Jason Brody into a spiralling world of violence, anarchy and survival, beset in a jungle, where survival by whatever means necessary is the norm as he restores order to the islands by takling over pirate camps and towers to reveal a map of the islands. This is what a first-shooter, open-world game ought to be. Sure, it lacks character development in some scenes, such as Jason's thrust into the island without seeing his emotions unfold as he loses his brother to Vaas. And the main villain: He was really top-notch. Vaas played his role perfectly, though the game mechanics downplayed his role as a vilain. Taking down bosses in choreographed button mashes and simplistic scenes is no way to end a boss. Same went for Hoyt Voyker and Buck Hughes.All in all, its' many hours of exploration, take-downs, gliding, sky-diving, killing and blowing up things.

												I'm not sure what to think about this one. I haven't played much because, quite frankly, the game just got very boring. I thought this game would be a lot like Fallout 3 with such a large open world and hunting down and finishing quests when, in all honesty, after the long opening (which you can't save and continue later without having to start half of it all over <annoying>) I found myself mostly wandering around (or driving, which is a nice addition) killing a few people here and there or hunting animals and plants to create things which is just clumsy. Quests are one thing, but looking for radio towers to activate just seems ridiculous. Nobody on the island would have done that yet?? On the plus side, the graphics are great and the weapons (when you can get them) are awesome plus, finding vehicles (land, sea, AND air) and driving (or gliding) them is fun and necessary to explore such a massive open world. I plan to revisit the island soon and see if there is more I just haven't seen yet. I'll update this when I do.			"

												Farcry 3 Is a rpg first-person shooter, with a hint of  ""Cassowary Attack Simulator""You play as Jason Brody, And your objective ?To find your friends captured by the evil cassowary king ""Hoyt Volker"" (no relation to me)Basically you go around killing stuff and then skinning animals to make a better handbag, weapons purseand ammo sack.Since Hoyt Volker is the cassowary king he possess the power to control cassowaries. He uses them to attack you while you loot the enemies you just killed.. Goodluck and remember to play with your sound on, otherwise you will never know how close those♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off cassowaries are to flay you while you are feeling up some dead guy for 4 $ and a spent lighter.

												FarCry 3. One of the BEST games I’ve ever played in my years of gaming.There’s so much to talk about, I guess I’ll divide this game into multiple categories to talk about.– The storyline 10/10Words literally how amazingly amazing it felt to play this game. The story mode was well thought out and executed perfectly, an original story with everything else was amazing. I do not wish to spoil the story too much because you NEED to play this game. Basically you are a tourist visiting an island when suddenly something goes wrong…– The graphics 10/10Graphic-wise the game is beautiful and detailed, when you’re playing it, it feels like skyrim but with better graphics and more realistic weapons. Sure some computers may not be able to run the game, but the majority of the people who can run the game on the best graphics will admit it you can feel a simple breeze from the wind. The weather system can’t be talked bad about at all because the rain wasn’t too annoying, but was made just perfect.– The A.I 8/10The A.I is the only element in the game I could complain about, yet it was marvelous. In times during the game I noticed some A.I glitching in the wall or just auto-noticing me behind a wall. In other times the A.I were just surprisingly professional by avoiding all walls and hiding behind baricades while shooting me only when I stand up to shoot them! Also the A.I of animals was made so they act like they do in real life, from turtles crouching in their shell to sharks slowly getting closer and going in for the kill.– The Controls 10/10Everything was designed wisely, starting from the basic-in-every-game controls like WASD and Shift to sprint to smaller details like switching items in your inventory around the way you like.– The gameplay 10/10This is the main element of the game which is most essential. The possibilities are infinite, you can play the game as vanilla as you want by using weapons you pick up from the enemy but you can’t taste the game truly unless you’ve tried the RPG’s or the Flamethrower. The leveling up system in the game is not like any other but a very original concept. You unlock new weapons and get them free in shops by claiming land from the enemy or climbing radio towers which noticeably become harder to get on top of with every new one. You can also convert to be a better warrior for the sake of the island by leveling up and getting “Tatau” aka Tattoo’s on your arm which give you abilities like holding your breath underwater longer or decreasing the damage you take from animal bites.– The Ending 10/10 I really can’t talk much about the ending to not spoil it, but the way you want the game to end is all up to you. There are 2 endings so it’s all up to you how you end the game.– Final Verdict 10/10The Game as a whole is a 10/10. A First person survival which has more then 30+ Realistic animals. I recommend everyone to play it.			"

""You kissed the girl, now you have to pay!""I recommend this enjoyable open world FPS. You loved your trip to Thailand and happen to like Apocalypse, now? Pros and cons in order:Positive: Absolutely amazing optics and level design. It is worth getting all the collectibles & loot, just because of some amazing caves and scenery. Vehicles are fun. Controls are easy and understandable. The main story is set right from the beginning. Some characters are done nicely; specially Buck and Vaas are great. The game had it's fun moments, including the side quests.Sometimes offers the choice between the Run & Gun or the stealth approach. Only minor bugs on Win7. (Some Dollar bills couldn't be picked up) The Co-Op mode is lotsa fun. As well, it got four great characters and good missions!Neutral:Liberating Outposts has absolutely no impact to the main story.Hunting was cool, but there were too many predators in the game for my liking, in case you have been idle for too long. You can bypass certain hard bits with Godmode-Syringes.Negative:The boss fights are all scripted and mostly alike.In general your main character as well as your friends are highly unlikeable. The first half of the story is fast paced and pretty good as well. After that, it looses steam quickly (Ubisoft, isn't it?) and barely crawls over the finish line. Did I mention the ""boss fights"" are non-events?The weapon's menu and the whole economic system are unbalanced. Weapons are tons of the same. With ""Signature Weapons"" each class has a weapon which maxes all peers out. The main story missions are very unimaginative and too much alike: Sneak somewhere in to kill someone or blow things up, exit in a rush.Not sure if owed to my minor difficulty level, but there weren't any helicopter battles except for a brief moment in the main story and the Rakiyat trials - and well, yes the last outpost. As well, I missed any navy battles or hang glider escapes built into the main story.Enemy AI seems to ""tag"" you even through bushes from miles and it is quite hard to loose the line of view, theras close to you, they start stumbling around and make easy targets. The loot button is the same as the weapon's switch button. This is extremely annoying. "

												It all began when I read Swiss Family Robinson as a kid and watched Gilligan's Island reruns on television. It probably continued while watching Fantasy Island, (and Herve Villichaize in the belltower shouting ""de plane! de plane!"") during a harsh Indiana winter. I'm referring to my love for the South Pacific Ocean. My love for that place was finally requited when I spent two and a half years there in the US Navy on a forward deployed Fast Frigate. I left the Navy, and those cherished waters never to return again save for my dreams and memories. And that's the sucky part about aging. Each passing year makes the details a little more fuzzy, a little more distant. Sometimes I feel as if they're the memories of an entirely different person. And then I played Far Cry 3. Guam, Diego Garcia, The Indian Ocean. It was all there for me, revisited on my computer screen. It was like an odd sense of coming home. Not only did the game's protagonist, Jason Brody, share the same adventurous locales as I did at his age, we also went through a deflowering of innocence all men take the path of, albeit mine occurred over years. Poor Brody's innocence was shattered the moment his brother and friends were accosted by the villians, Vaas and Hoyt, drug and slave traders who inhabit the gameworld like monsters. As I lead Brody through a dark passage of rites in rescuing his friends and a preciptious push into manhood I've gotten to know the island like my own backyard. I've not been affected by a game like this in ages. When I haven't been playing I've been listening to the game soundtrack so efficiently and appropriately helmed by Brian Tyler (e.g. Constantine, Iron Man 3.) Driving down the Indiana countryside looking up at these gray autumn skies and listening to this music, it just makes me yearn so much to go back to the island. It's a desire only fulfilled when I can sit in front of my computer again and lose myself entirely in the gameworld. The game will soon end for me. I'm on the last long downhill leg of the roller coaster. And it's been an ecstatic ride. Watching the end credits will be bittersweet, I'm sure, because I'm going to be reacquainted with that old feeling of leaving home once again.			"

												I loved both Far Cry 1 and 2, but uplay is a horrible DRM system that you can't get around, even with the Steam version. The console way of going through options and interacting with stuff also affects FC3 and heavily so. I personally have raged so hard over this, because it started as a PC game and I looked so much forward to FC3. What a load of zhit. Honestly and I I'm sorry for the language, but this is completely ret@rded. Waypoints even on the hardest settings showing where to go to begin with. You have to mash space to knife a guy, and you have a feeling that the game is made for five year old kids. A hint system that is forced upon you, and while you go through it you can't do anything. All options are locked, you want to throw a stone and make some noise? Well too bad, wait for the game to allow you to do so. You need to jump over an obstacle, you just press space and your characters does it. Forget about the game engines of Quake or Unreal, where you actually could jump around and had a feeling about the world. Don't buy it and make the same mistake I did, get the pirated version and decide afterwards whether this is something for you. Money completely wasted on my behalf.			"

This game perfectly describes ""open world"".I surely recommend it to buy this game, i bought the game when it was around 5 € (around -80%) .. aaaand i'm looking forward to buy Far Cry 4 sooner or later.Maybe one thing that's bad/weird and that is that you need another client (Uplay) to play this game.

												I have beaten this game 3 times on Xbox360 and once on PC, I think i'm somewhat qualified to review it. Here are my thoughts...Pros:- Looks nice- Feels good to play- Ultra satisfying combat- Cool bad guys- Open world, lots to do- BoobiesCons:- Anti-Climactic in a lot of parts- Some AI issues- Lots of frustration in some parts- Second half of the game is so different it could be a seperate game-Epilepsy8.5/10A good buy if you like shooters and killing stuff			"

												Far Cry 3 is like your favourite action movie. It has snipers, exploding vehicles, and a maniacal villain named Vaas. Already this may sound like a clichéd shooter, but Far Cry 3 does so many things well, that it’s hard not to dive back into its world again. Along your perilous journey, you will climb up a radio tower, cover yourself in magical tattoos, and drive a quad-bike into a river. All of these elements, while definitely daredevilish, don’t feel out of place in Far Cry 3. The map is vast, and allows you to explore to your heart’s content. Hunt wild animals to collect their skin, or liberate enemy outposts to gain respect amongst the civilians. In Far Cry 3, it’s completely up to your how you approach situations. Beneath the crazy guise that Ubisoft paints with Far Cry 3, lies a character that actually cares. Jason Brody, along with his other twentysomething friends, travel to the remote Rook Islands, for a holiday. But all is not what it seems. Vaas, a psychopathic leader of Rook Island, captures Jason and his friends. Jason escapes, but his other friends are not with him. Jason must meet with local islanders to find his friends and go home. Playing Far Cry 3, I thought Jason was an excellent character with a determined, hard-working spirit, who wants nothing but to keep his friends safe. Vaas is a wonderful villain, with humour, but also a sort of finess on how he handles situations. The strange calmness he portrays is intimidating, but at the same time, left me uneasy. He is definitely a unique character, and one that I welcomed into the game. The only this is, Vaas seemed to swear a lot, often too much. This took away from his character slightly, and was one of the only disappointments I had with this game. Far Cry 3’s gameplay is diverse, entertaining and never gets old. One moment, you will be fighting for your life setting pirates on fire, and the next you will be jumping out of a plane in a wingsuit. All of these never felt nuanced or out of place, and whether you are using a keyboard and mouse or a controller, the controls are easy to pick up, and similar to other games of its genre.The game’s campaign mode is quite long, and lasted me around twelve to fourteen hours. While it is definitely the main aspect of Far Cry 3, after you finish your missions on Rook Island, there are still so many other places to explore and new things to discover. Loot is found everywhere throughout the vast map, hidden in crates. Bodies can also contain money and trinkets, which can be sold for money at stores. Plants are also found on the minimap, each a different colour. I found the Green Leaves especially useful for crafting important medical syringe kits, which have saved me from death countless times.The customization of weapons in Far Cry 3 is amazing. If you really want to, you can add a Red Dot Sight to a .44 Magnum handgun, or an extended magazine to an ACE assault rifle. All of these can also be customized with decals and camos, letting you find the weapons that are more suited to your play style. You can equip an M249 SAW, an LMG, and a LPO-50 Flamethrower and torch the lot, or go in silently with a silenced Z93 and a Recurve Bow with a Reflex Sight. In Far Cry 3, it’s completely your choice.Vehicles in Far Cry 3 could have been much improved. There were only three “classes” of vehicles, like the army-like 4WDs or the sedans and quad bikes. These all handle basically the same, and I personally am not a fan of first-person driving and was disappointed you couldn’t change this. Also, vehicles are scarce around Rook Island, and I was often without a ride and sprinting for ages to get to a destination in time.Overall, Far Cry 3 is an amazingly diverse, creative and humongous first-person adventure, and one that will keep you glued to your monitor in excitement and anticipation as it shows you a fantastically good time.

												Uplay is terrible. Imagine that you're trying to play far cry 3, whicch you recently bought for 75% off, eight minutes before the sale ends, completely forgetting about Uplay. When you launch the game, uplay launches, you stare in horror and remember. the Ubisoft weekend sale. I should have known. This has probably ruined the experience for me. Oh, and the game only successfully runs 20% of the time on launch.			"

												I loved both Far Cry 1 and 2, but uplay is a horrible DRM system that you can't get around, even with the Steam version. The console way of going through options and interacting with stuff also affects FC3 and heavily so. I personally have raged so hard over this, because it started as a PC game and I looked so much forward to FC3. What a load of zhit. Honestly and I I'm sorry for the language, but this is completely ret@rded. Waypoints even on the hardest settings showing where to go to begin with. You have to mash space to knife a guy, and you have a feeling that the game is made for five year old kids. A hint system that is forced upon you, and while you go through it you can't do anything. All options are locked, you want to throw a stone and make some noise? Well too bad, wait for the game to allow you to do so. You need to jump over an obstacle, you just press space and your characters does it. Forget about the game engines of Quake or Unreal, where you actually could jump around and had a feeling about the world. Don't buy it and make the same mistake I did, get the pirated version and decide afterwards whether this is something for you. Money completely wasted on my behalf.			"

												Far Cry 3 is a sum of many ubisoft games, they have taken many features from their other IPs and successfully combined it with the tropical setting of far cry 1 the end result is a brilliant open world fps that is exciting to play till the end.There is coop and competetive multiplayer in FC3, the PvP is decent fun you level up fairly quickly and have battle cries and can customize a lot, you can spend a decent amount of hours in it before getting bored, the PvE is really fleshed out and the characters are well written and is objective based you will have better luck finding a game in the competitive mp rather than the coop mp.The single player is a very diverse,really fleshed out levels and thoroughly exciting until the end. The best part i loved about FC3 was that it rewarded stealth play example if you take out an outpost you get 500 xp take out the outpost but without triggering the alarm and you get 550 xp and if you take out the outpost without being detected you get 1500 xp. This is the reason why i almost always used stealth to take out outposts and you can do the same in most of the missions. The wildlife makes it feel like a real world where you can skin animals and sell it for cash or use for crafting, the herbivores will run away scared of you the carnivores will actively attack you and try to kill you, you can also set animals like bears,tigers and lions on the enemies by luring the animal to them or by shooting the caged animals which is a lot of fun.Traversing through FC3 is a blast you can use the outposts you captured as fast travel, the cars are decent to use the water vehicles are very fun to use espically the jetski, the most fun you can have traveling is when you ziplines and the glider, later during the late game you will have access to wingsuit and paracute which makes traveling from one point to the other even more exhillariting and fun to do. FC3 is a looker it looks really good and the vistas change from region to region some of the segments are breathtaking, the level of detail if you can run it on very high/ultra is mindblowing, the lighting the shadows and the particle effects are really well done, the facial animation doesnt look that well but it is a 4 year old game now so cant complain too much. The jungle truly comes alive as the meshes of the trees grass and plants make it feel really life-like.I feel FC3's villian characters are really interesting with backstories and are well developed especially Vaas whose voice actor really brings the character to life but the hero characters espcially the main hero J.Brody is not intersting nor convincing the character will blurt out stupid puns and make fun or everything and sometimes acts all serious making him feel like a man-child. The story is simple and the game has two endings, i only wish they made the ""bad"" ending somewhat better but i guess then it wouldnt be the bad ending but overall the story is servicable and the characters for the most part are good.There is a lot to do in FC3 from unlocking towers to view segments of the maps, free outposts to fast travel and access new items, complete side quests in which you are required to eliminate enmies or animals using speific wepons, looting is very fun and the game actively encourages you to do so the chalice ones are hard to do and fun since it makes you explore, apart from these you have races,gambling,knives throws, etc, so yeah a lot to do. FC3 tropical setting really helps the mood of the game and the nigh and day cycle really bring out the jungle vibe. The game doesnt have too many  bugs or glitches, i did run into a few popups and stutters but mostly its looks good and runs well. The problem sometimes occues in mp when uplay decided to disconnect you automatically during game and its quite annoying but thanfully thats just on the mp side of the things. You can crafy syringes to enhance your abilites and skin animals to upgrade carrrying ammo, extra guns and special bows.There are also some dlc missions which are quite good if you have them, blowing stuff up feels really rewarding and the enemy AI is really nice, they will try to flank you into the open they actively use grandes to make you go into open areas to kill you easily.The tagging system in FC3 really makes the stealth aspect very intriguing as you can tag the enemies observe their pattern to quitely assassinate them or set animals on them. The takedown feature is probably the best feature ive seen in video games reason being the variety of takedown you can perform, from the simplet takedown to chain,gunslinger,death from above/below, heavy and grande, each does something differnet and feels really satisfying.Lastly the audio is really crispy and on point, some of the soundtracks are spot on the one instance where you light a weed farm on fire with flamethrower has skillrex's ft. damien marely make it bun dem is brilliant and become my faveourite track, you can hear the hissle of snakes and the roars of the tigers from a distance giving you audio feedback as how to approach your immediate surronding.Overall an excellent open world game by ubisoft and truly back to the Far Cry roots and a step in the right direction since i considered FC2 a failure, FC3 is a game anyone can easily love and sink hours into you can spend anywhere between 20-40 hours doing all kinds of things, I completed all outposts and towers and many of the missions and still wanted to play for an hour or so coz travelling with the wingsuit was so darn fun.Easily recommeded to anyone at any price point.

												Far Cry 3 is a hugely enjoyable open world FPS set on a beautiful tropical island.Game-play is great, providing many alternate methods of completing your objectives. This offers players the chance to use stealth and silent weapons to pick off their enemies one-by-one while remaining undetected. Alternatively you can run in and gun everyone down, which is slightly less fun and not as rewarding. Many games boast this feature of choice and always seem to be lacking in either the stealth system or just general combat. I'm glad to say that Far Cry 3 delivers on both fronts. The game offers a huge array of things to do aside from the main campaign. There are around 30 outposts, 20 radio towers and tons of extra side missions sprawled around the game map. Completing all of these side activites is bound to give you numerous benefits, but not without a challenge. Far Cry 3 also contains one of the best hunting system I've seen in gaming. While not forcing you to have to hunt for survival or anything, hunting will give you many materials to help craft items to make you character carry more items, weapons and money.Now, the story. At first the story of Far Cry 3 doesn't seem like much, you're an American tourist on holiday with your friends to an exotic Indonesian island. But what lives on this island is much more sinister than you expect. A huge group of pirates, lead by Vaas Montenegro, a once good man driven to insanity by the temptations of evil. You are Jason Brody, a typical American who has a desire for adventure. The character arch of Brody is great, showing how much a man can change when something is taken from him. The story is one of madness, strength and discovering the darkness of human nature.The visuals are pretty excellent. The world is colourful, vibrant and perfectly lit, the island and all of the characters on it look spectacular, even on the medium settings my PC was forced to run it at.The soundtrack is overall pretty great, especially a track which appears toward the end of the main campaign.I highly recommend picking this up if you're a fan of FPSs and/or open-world games. It's worth it at full price but this game is no stranger to sales so it might be best to wait until the time is right and pick it up for less. uPlay also seems to be bearable with this.			"

												Well just completed it....aaaand well I dont think its nearly as good as people make it out to be.The main story is imo extremely short, and too much out of your hands.In the end you get a choice, but honestly it barely is a choice from the perspective of the player, we only kinda know about our main characters background but what we play and thus experience is the complete other side of the coin.So this choice in the end is some stuff we get told apperently happened....vs the stuff we ACTUALLY experienced in the game....so yeah, not much of a choice really.And what is with the Hype around Vaas? Dude is seriously barely in teh game, hell everyone is barely there because the core story is so damn short but man, Vaas is in like what, 3 scenes?Whoop di♥♥♥♥♥♥ and nothing about those were remarkable or memorable, hardly the Bane from Dark Knight Rises now is he?Story falls apart in many places anyway, like the bs reason as to why I cannot instandly kill main baddy,♥♥♥♥♥♥was also so damn predictable urhhhggggg.The Island is huge and the game looks good and places are recognisable, soon you will know you way around just like you do after playing a while of GTA, thats all pretty cool.What is not is the actual content, or lack there off.Sure tons of stuff to collect....but that I find hardly constitutes of content.Skyrim for example as a lot of big stuff going on next to the main story, this game could learn from that because it has nothing of the sorts.All in all I think if I would have to express the experience in a rating, I would be inclined to say maybe a 7/10 but that would be generous.Its not bad, but its most def not the rating it has on several websites, really need to up our standards yo.

												Kui sa oled FPS Shooterite fänn, siis tegemist on MUST PLAY mänguga. Imeline graafika, story ja gamepaly on super combo. Täiesti prefektne. Muidugi oli ka paar asja mis häirisid, nimelt oli loot cheste väga palju ja nendest sai vähe kraami. Mõtekam oli sidequeste teha. Ütlen siis ära, mängu lõpus on valik, ehk saad lõpetada mängu kahte erinevat viisi. Mina ise valisin selle ""inimlikuma"". Selliseid valikuid oleks võinud olla rohkem mängus. Osad cutscened olid minule vastutahtmist. Näiteks ütles karakter, et ta tahab saarele elama jääda, kuigi mulle see üldse ei meeldinud. Kui tagasi tulla story juurde, siis asi on väga deep. Mida kaugemale jõuad, seda rohkem tahad kätte maksta. Selles mängus soovitan palju eeltööd teha enne main questide juurde asumist. Kindlasti oleks vaja võtta kõik radio towerid ja outpostid ära. Mängu alsutades oli plaanis ka kõik relicid, messaged ja memory cardid ära koguda. Hiljem sain aru, et see oli praktiliselt võimatu. Memory cardid (tegin ära) ja messaged olid mõleldavad, aga 120 relici on natuke üle piiri. Lõpetamiseks kulus 25 tundi, mis on open world mängu kohta täiesti paras. Kindlasti kui oleks teinud veel side queste ja chillinud oleks 30 tundi ka ära tulnud. Mängus on ka veits rpg elemente, ehk sul on võimalus enda karakterit leveldada ja asju craftida, et paremini metsikus looduses ja sõjas toime tulla. Kindlasti soovitan mängu, see on igat senti väärt!			"

												I'm going to try and make this short, but it will be hard since this is one of the absolutely freaking best games I've ever played.Okay, here we go.This game includes: Jetskis, boats (some with guns mounted on them) , ATVs, lots of different cars (some with guns mounted on them), cargo trucks (my favourite), hanggliders, wingsuits, weapons in general, flamethrowers, RPGs, lots of wild animals, a enourmus beautiful landscape to explore, lots of minigames, and of course, a deep and totally amazing story. A deep and totally amazing story for both the singeplayer mode and the 4 player co op mode. And of course, there is the ordinary multiplayer mode aswell.The game itself is pretty much a sandbox, so you can rund around in a open world and do whatever you want.But a couple of things you should know if you are planning to buy this game: This game requires Uplay to work (at least it did for me), the game might be a bit laggy (mine was, but changing from DirectX 11 to DirectX 9 helped a lot), and the saving system is a bit complicated (you can only have one saved game at a time, the game doesn't always save when you hit ""save game"" even if it says it does, etc.)Anyhow, I would give this game a 9.5/10. It's absolutely fantastic.That pretty much sums it up.  "

												Far Cry 3. FAR CRY 3! Ubisoft must be proud of this game. Far Cry 3 takes the open-world action onto a completely new level. You can either spend your time completing missions, overtaking enemy outposts or hunt animals. Hunting animals isn't there just so the jungle feels alive, it actually has a huge purpouse. You can skin animals and craft wallets to store more money, craft better weapon holsters, or craft potions to, for example, see all enemies, all animals, regenerate health etc. Upgrade and customize your weapons exactly the way you want. You can even fight SHARKS in the game, which feels absolutely INSANE. That was only the Singleplayer. But no. Ubisoft doesn't stop there. Far Cry 3's multiplayer is AMAZING. You can level up, make new weapon loadouts, customize your weapons like in the singleplayer, decode data from flash drives and disks to unlock new weapons modifications. When your team wins a match, the person who has gathered the most experience can either kill the enemy with the most experience with a unique death move, or free him.  This game does everything perfect. I cannot say anything bad about it. Anything.Final Rating : 10 / 10BADASS			"

												Note: to see this review in it't true form go to: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/03/game-review-far-cry-3.htmlFarcry 3, ""like skyrim with guns!""  that is not true in the least, Farcry 3 is a fun game and a good game but it is not a shooter skyrim. because the marketing for FC3 decided to compare it to skyrim i'm gonna compare it to skyrim too. First: Open World. Farcry 3 is more of an ""Open Map"" granted the Map is big but parts are locked off until you do certain things, also there are a lot of invisible walls on the island itself. i don't mind that, in fact i understand why they did it. but Skyrim doesn't have that. Next: Side quest. Farcry 3 has actives like racing,shooting,hunting, and kill missions. but they don't call them side quest, the ones that they do call side quests are pitiful and worthless. most of them you have to go ""Spy"" on someone across the town and then report back to who gave you the quest, or you go here and kill 15 of this or that and ""save"" a poor civie. In the end the actives are way more fun then the side ""quests"".  and third: Customization, you can't make your own character in FC3, you can't even change your outfit. once again i under stand why they did that, but they are the ones who started compering the two.Ok now that is out of the way lets focus on the Single player story line. The Story of Far Cry 3 is that you and your friends are vacationing on a remote island, but what you don't know is that it is controlled by a cruel gang of Pirates and Drug lords, you start off captured and locked away in the Pirate base, and you have to escape. Now i don't want to spoil anything about the story line so i'll stop there. Story Wise the game is epic there are some times where the other characters appear to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but most of the time the story was fun and exciting. The villain of the game is like a more gory Joker and it really is insane. most of the time you won't even now who is your friend and who is your enemy. The main villain does stay around for a while but you never will think that he shouldn't have survived your attack or feel like he is god-like in some areas because the script writers didn't want to kill him off. (*hint COD Ghost hint*) The game has tons of the stuff for you to do and the skill and perk tree is large and helpful, you can craft meds and other helpful things, and hunt animals for their meat/skin. the Single Player story line took me 9 hours on Normal. keep in mind however it took me longer because i didn't rush to do the main quests.The Co-op mode of Farcry centers around a band of travelers who are left for dead by their greedy captain who works for the pirates, the Co-op gameplay is all on a different island from the Single player one. the Co-op itself is fun but compared to the Single player island the co-op one feels like a hallway shooter, also there are few players playing co-op and even fewer who will stick with you to go through it. when the Host leaves a Co-op game (and VS games) the game takes a ridicules amount of time to ""Migrate"" and when it starts most players leave meaning it migrates to other players each time taking longer, in fact once this lead to every one on my server to leave. The VS mode in Farcry is as you expect two teams fight each other to the death and who ever loses all their points first is the loser. the high set scorer and the wining team gets to to choice to spare or kill the highest scorer on the the team that lost. all in all the MP in Far Cry 3 is fun and enjoyable but because of their crappy Net code you might not be able to play very long.in the end i would say buy the game for the single player experience and if you have some buddies with the game maybe you can actually get through a Co-op game.

												Far Cry has always been the best hang gliding series out there, and this one, while it does not vastly improve on the hang gliding formula, is still an improvement at the end of the day.Unfortunately, the series still suffers from some the same problems that have plagued it since its release. Far too many obstacles and opponents in between you and the next hang glider, and the hang gliders are so spread out. I assume they are so widespread in order to build anticipation before you glide over the countryside, but it's a little exaggerated.7/10, hang gliding still fun but not really added to.			"

												Far Cry 3 is all about adventure, carnage, the jungle aspect and getting the best guns for your assault type. There are a lot of areas where FarCry succeeds but many more where it simply falls through the floor. Far Cry 3 offers a compelling storyline through the singleplayer campaign. It is almost unrivaled and allows you to take hold of a person and watch them grow from a normal friend-loving schoolboy to a psuedo-psycho badass of the jungle. Multiplayer is completely broken as there a lot of bugs and hiccups along the way. The loadout option is pretty much useless as there is currently one build that destroys anything else that you put against it. Coop is a very welcomed theme within the Far Cry series, it's just a shame it wasn't implemented into the overall storyline. Or atleast contained within it's own world. Rather than you and a friend playing within the island sandbox, you are forced to go through objective-based and competition-based tasks that follow a very crappy storyline of 4 people just wanting to get rich and get out. ++ Singleplay, Multiplayer and COOP modes. + Guns and tools are nice+ Great scenery +++Buy this game for the singleplayer- Multiple bugs- Uplay requirements/overlay- Game-breaking bugs- Overpowered SMG class- Graphics are similar to FC2 but..worse? I would only recommend this game for the singleplayer and nothing else. The coop is fun if you're with the right people and playing on INSANE mode.  "

												Welcome to my review of Far Cry 3.I will discuss all the negatives and possitives you need to know,if you are interested to buy the game.The game requires Uplay – and you have to have Steam and Uplay active to play the game.If you don't mind this,we will continue to the positives.I will not compare this game to the others of the franchise because is different in many ways.First the story in the game is more serious and you will want to know what happens next,see how the story unfolds – but there is one big problem …And that's that wonderful open world that they have created.You can get lost, doing side missions,activities and collectibles.You can/and will hunt animals so you can craft better gear,to expand your inventory.And most of the events get your worth of time spending passing them. For example – if you go and unlock all the Radio towers not only you will have the complete map – but also free weapons in vendors.The gunplay is awesome,it's easy to get used to,and you will be having fun everytime you have to go to combat.The gameplay is varied,most of the mission you can go gun-blazing but you can go stealth also.I passed the main story + some side activities in more than 20 hours,but I kinda want to go back to finish what I have left behind.The story is great,the voice acting and music really shines – and show how good they wanted you to immerse yourself in the role of the main character,how you want to save your friends like him,how you would want for him to finish his journey.Far Cry 3 showed us,that not only open worlds can be immersive and fun – but also can give a good story driven experience.If you like a open world in which everything you do,you will have fun doing buy the game.If you want to play a open world game,in which not only the content is much larger and you have hours of activities to do,but also you will want to do them – you will want to finish the story.

												This game might be worthwhile under certain circumstances. If you like the movie or novel ""the beach"" you might like this game. I strongly suggest buying this game on a sale though.+ Hunting wild animals+ Many weapons to choose from+ Nice fire animations+ Big world with a lot of cars, hang gliders, boats to use+ Upgrading weapons is possible+ Fighting is fun although liberating enemy bases gets old very fast+ Skill tree+ Nice graphics if you think this is important for a game- Protagonist is too unsympathetic. Srsly, he is a ****. - Boring story with too much drugs and such things going on. this subject bores me to death. Others might like it though.- Annoying friends - Too easy- Some people won't like the endings- You can't really interact with a lot of your allies and they don't do anything. I felt indifferent to them which is a bad thing and sign for a game. - Far Cry 3 runs with uplay. I didn't have any problems at all with uplay but some people are not too keen on buying a game on uplay.In my opinion is this game far from being perfect and the islands lack depth but this game is still a decent game if you want to explore a world for some hours.Replay value: AverageRating: 8/10.Recommendation: Yes			"

												tl;dnr :: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - IT USES UBISOFT UPLAYDO YOURSELF A FAVOUR and CHECK OUT THE UPLAY FORUMS before even considering touching your wallet. It will take you more time to fix this half baked DRM catastrophe than you'll ever spend time playing the games you wanted to play- if you ever manage to even get them running.A simple google search showed me other ways to play Ubisoft games without UPLAY, and while these unsavoury methods might promote unlawful activity IT WOULD BE BY FAR THE BETTER OPTION if your goal is to Actually Play A Video Game.I'd love to give the actual product a review here, but: ubisoft uplay.

 Far Cry 3 has just become one of my favorite games of all time. I wasn't expecting such a great storyline from a game like this.The open world is incredibly beautiful and detailed, I discovered myself running around for no good reason, just to enjoy the view. There a lot of different guns available and you can customize them to adapt to your gameplay style: either you go sneaky beaky or you go full rampage. The AI is very good too. Plus, there are tons of alternative missions you can accomplish to make the game almost endless.			"

												Basically the place I go when-ever I get high on shroomsPros-Alot of weapons to choose from-Weapons each have ironsights and accessories you can equip onto them-Alot of animals with outstanding Animal A.I (e.g. A tiger will try to kill you), which makes the world seem alive-DRUGS-Character Development-FREE DLC, a co-op one which was meant to be in the game though-Good and intriguing environment and atmosphere-There is something to do after the main game-Its a Ubisoft game for god sake, same people who made Assassin's Creed-Better than Previous Titles-Skill Tree(s)-Plays like a RPG ( a bit)-Amazing Antagonist, Vaas definitely wins Villain of 2012-Story is amazing-Its not a miltary FPS-Can choose from run and gun approach or a stealth approach like me-Leads you from one moment of events to another brilliantlyCons-Uplay-A few bugs-UPlay-Gets repetitive after a while-UPLAY-Multiplayer Sucks after a while-Driving sucks-Co-op mission design was terrible-UPlay SucksOverall, I suggest you get this game since this was 1 of the best 2012 titles along with 'Borderlands 2' and 'The Walking Dead: Season 1'. It has alot of replay-ability and its really makes you feel like you are on the island. Also...Did I mention this game has Uplay in it?Rating: MUST BUY!Final Verdict: 9.3/10			"

												Far Cry 3 é fácil de recomendar. A atenção aos detalhes e a direção de arte do jogo é sensacional. A história é meio adolescente, mas é uma aventura na ilha. Ela é dividida em 3 partes: descobrimento, exploração e ação. Vale a pena tirar férias de verão nessa ilha. E quando o jogo termina, fica aquela sensação de que essas férias acabaram, e que é hora de voltar pro mundo real.			"

												Truly excellently made amazing game!Graphics: The graphics are very very very nice, but this is far cry and they have been great since the first all the way through. Always pushing the boat with these games. Audio: The audio is very well presented in the game from the guns power to tropical birds and ocean sounds. Very nicely done here to listen too. Controls: The controls are super easy to get used too, sometimes seeming clunky or doing something opposite. Overal easy to master and power this gameGame: This is by far the best Far Cry and overal experience of playing this game, I would vote the best game of the decade.  I cannot jester enough.  I was jumping into this game expecting alot and I got sooo much more.  It really is that good.Only problem I have is minor and that is no free roam coop and coop is to linear for me, but otherwise amazing. You are set on a path and you cannot go off, it is like a one track road for coop. Still good fun though!Multiplayer is good fun but needs more vehicle and open based.  The singleplayer is amazing, graphics are the best I've seen to date.  How the character plays, moves and feels is amazing.This is the best game ever made to date...Th story is superb to play through and watch every video with some amazing stuff to do around the world when you want to explore, from caves to swimming, to taking over enemie bases while letting s bear or tiger out of a cage to kill everyone. There is so much to do in the game it takes a lot of hours. The multiplayer is a different story so you can play through two different sides which is cool there too Worth every penny and I would recommend this game!			"

												I consider this game having three acts, the first starting out on the island and hunting down Vaas, the second having you reach the second island, and the third having you complete the game.It has 38 story missions total, so about 12-13 missions for each act. The game is also split between two islands, the first two acts take place on the first island with the final act taking place on the second. The game starts off great, I was really enjoying the first act, and the side missions were fun enough to keep me doing them. However, after a while the side missions just get boring, as unfortunately they fall into the Ubisoft formula of ""Go here, kill this, come back."" that plagues their games. I completed about 2/3 of the side missions before I just started ignoring them, and strangely all of the side missions you can do to get special animal skins to craft the best upgrades are all on the first island, so you'll have every upgrade before you finish the first act. Also for the first act you talk a lot with your new buddy, Dennis, and he helps you through learning the ropes of the island. I really liked Dennis, and by the end of the game I really felt bad for him.The second act is where I found the game really fell flat. I quite enjoyed Vaas and his role in the game, but unfortunately he doesn't stick around until even the end of the second act. After him you have to deal with his boss, Hoyt, who has hardly even been mentioned until this point in the game and isn't nearly as interesting. Along with losing interest in the side missions, I was also losing interest with the story. There wasn't really much keeping me going at this point, even Jason was starting to irk me, as I just couldn't understand a lot of his decisions and most of what was even coming out of his mouth anymore.However, I feel the third act is where the game really shines. The last 10 missions are fantastic, and your new new buddy, Sam, is a really fun character and adds a lot of spice back to the game. I definitely like Sam more than Dennis, and the story missions with him are by far the best. Fortunately Jason was getting a little better in my eyes and I was liking him again, and a lot of the stupid things he was saying in the second act have passed. The final few missions were amazing and I finished the game with a significantly higher opinion of it than I had by the end of the second act.Meanwhile, there are lots of collectibles, as is to be expected from a Ubisoft game. This game seems to try and one-up Assassin's Creed by having at least a thousand chests scattered around the two islands (this is probably an exaggeration, but good lord there has got to be at least 500), not to mention 120 relics, 20 Japanese WWII letters, and 20 drug dealer memory cards to collect. As with all Assassin's Creed games, you can purchase maps to show you where everything is, then you just have to collect them.Overall, the game is very fun despite the weak middle part. Though keep in mind that it will be a test of endurance if you plan on achieving 100% completion as the collectibles and side missions are an exercise in tedium.			"

												Far Cry has always been the best hang gliding series out there, and this one, while it does not vastly improve on the hang gliding formula, is still an improvement at the end of the day.Unfortunately, the series still suffers from some the same problems that have plagued it since its release. Far too many obstacles and opponents in between you and the next hang glider, and the hang gliders are so spread out. I assume they are so widespread in order to build anticipation before you glide over the countryside, but it's a little exaggerated.7/10, hang gliding still fun but not really added to.			"

												Well, i must admit, i'm a bit disappointed.I mean, about scenario. It's perfectly written and capable with atmosphere of Rook Island, but it's still merciless. The ways you will choose in scenario will make you suffer. Less or more.But it's an interesting story about a rich-american ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s transform into a warrior. But still a ♥♥♥♥♥ lol :P That wasn't a spoiler.Well, if you're bored and want something different, i recommend this game.Pros:+Great Scenario+Amazing island+Nice skills+It's not like CoD, sets you're free. It's openworld.Really open world. (Please check the third ""Con."")+Stealth is ammmazingly funny. Loud is not at all.+There's an in-game money but you can get weapons free by activating radio towers (Please check the first ""Con."")Cons:-Climbing to the radio towers made me rage quit several times. Unneccessarily hardened♥♥♥♥♥♥-Ammo efficiency. The game forces you to take corpses' weapons. you can carry tooo lesss ammo.-Island is amazing, but travelling may be boring sometimes.Not a ""con"" at all, but i'm warning you.Playability: Average 50 hours if you play full stealthy and complete almost every side jobs. (It'd be more if multiplayer and coop still alive.) But if you have friends still playing, you may try coop, i have no idea about it. But intro looks fun.Graphics: 9/10Scenario: 9/10Musics: 10/10Worth to time & money: Absolutely. "

												What can be said about Far Cry 3 That hasnt already been ♥♥♥♥ing said? No really?The gun play is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, The world is just about as open as you can get to the point whereyou have explored and done everything and cant move on untill you litterally have to do story as thats the only way to get to your next major location, the customisation feels great, the stealth is actually useful and interesting. YOU CAN BURN DOWN EVERYTHING! (Well most things atleast...) and the voice acting (For the most part) is extremly memorable and fun for the story, the only major exception there being the NPC's who all have the same voice actors recorded on a potatoe but who gives a ♥♥♥♥ they are there for you to kill. The cons whowever I think are pretty well globally known.The multiplayer just doesnt function half the time, there are tonnes of glitches where you just cant do anything about it and have to either reload your last save or die to fix them, the enemy hitboxes can be abit buggy and the single handedly worst part Even now 5 years and 3 months after its release... Uplay. God ♥♥♥♥ing dammit Uplay your the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with in all my time gaming, no matter where it is PC Or console no matter the game Uplay is the most unco-operative peice of trash I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with And thats including Origin and having to deal with actual people while working in retail.

												Far Cry 3 is the best/worst game you will ever play. It gives you a wide open world to explore at your pace, but only when it suits the gameIt gives you plenty of side missions to complete in your own way, but they all have arbitrary rules that you need to follow.It gives you a gripping story of a dudebro trapped on an island who lets go and makes his own way, losing his sanity in the process.At the same time you will lose your sanity because while your free to do whatever you want, you can only be as free as the game lets you.For examply, for arbitrary reasons the game restricts your progression until you've completed certain missions. Theres no real reason listed in the plot. Theres no gameplay stability that is disrupted in the gameplay that letting you level up however you want. The game has no reason to restrict you.But it does.Though I might sound a bit critical of the game, it really is fun. Its just also really stupid. REALLY stupid. I highly recomend it, but it has its quirks that don't make any sense.			"

												Fantastic story. This game has one of the best stories I have seen and characters. You are given some choices on what you can do during the game. Gameplay is almost perfect but tends to get unchallenging when you unlock things further on. The world is fun to explore with dazzling sights and many different types of animals. The graphics are very well polished, except in soome occasions you will see the most horrible plant textures. The game is Open World to some extent. You cannot explore the whole Islands until you progress the story, however you are left to explore the two Islands at your will once you beat the game. Although I loved the game I did hate one thing. Uplay. When you buy this game you have to redeem it on Ubisoft which can be annoying to people whom like me prefer having everything in one place such as Steam. Overall I loved this game.			"

												Far Cry 3 is a good game, a great game even. You could even say it's an excellent game. No game is without fault however I'll talk about some of the good things and some of the bad. First: the guns; the core part of any FPS. They're so fun to use in this game simply because they all feel different and it's very easy to recognize the differences between all the weapons. Stealth is also a big part of the combat, stealth takedowns and silenced weapons eventually become your best friend as rushing in is generally a bad idea (especially once you've reached the later half of the game) even on normal difficulty. Optional objectives are spread throughout the game which include: side quests, hunting challenges, sniper challenges and poker. Most of them are purely optional offering nothing more than something to do while you're playing others are higly incentivized (Radio towers, hunting, liberating camps + supply drops) as they offer XP, money and lead to unlocking better equipment and guns! Getting around isn't that hard either (provided you aren't getting shot at) and you'll find that once you have access to more fast travel points you'll reach your destinations really quickly!Now I'll touch on the story for a bit before I get to the cons! The story... not so great! That is to say it's not amazing, but it feels a lot like an action movie and those don't really require great stories either! I did find, however, that across the story there were a few memorable characters and sequences that I really liked but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. Also worth noting, several instances of nudity!And now the final part of this lengthy review, the cons! There were quite a few bugs, mostly visual and none of them game-breaking definitely a slight on the game but they can be over-looked! I found that when I was exploring or hunting for collectibles whenever I had a waypoint on my map there was no clear indication as to whther or not the thing I had waypointed was above me or below me. By the time I realized this this I had usually gone too far off to find the actual path to the thing I was looking for. And finally, the major offender... UPlay! I have nothing against the platform itself but not having it installed prior to playing this game lead to me waiting a good 45 mins before I could actually play the game. It also requires you to be connected to the internet for a enjoyable experience, meaning if you've got a dodgy connection or are simply having issues you should probably just play something else.To wrap things up, like I said in the beginning, this game's great. If you have any interest in shooters or open world games then you have to give this game a spin, as there's tons to do and you'll probably have a good time doin' it!			"

												Works darn fine with 3 GB ram, even though the minimum is 4 GB ram. No crashes, great graphics and view, and intense violence, with lots of fun! If you are in search of a REAL survival game, this is the game for you! Who doesn't enjoy getting free guns just by going on top of a radio tower and activating it? The weapons provided in game are super good, and makes the game fun! If only this game didn't have to use UPlay, that would have been a whole lot better.....4.4/5 - 0.6 lost due to UPlay and Specification Error.			"

												The feeling and atmosphere you get from the jungle is unlike any other game. The dense vegitation and landscape really immerse you in the environment. Stealth works very well in this game and can be tough but rewarding. Huge selection of different kinds of weapons and attachments will make customization endless. Each time I do another playthrough, I spend 30 hours just roaming the map. The world is very interactive. Definitely worth it.			"

												I was really looking forward to a CryTek-powered open world shooter.  What I got was a dirty needle and some pig entrails.  This is a disgusting game in more than one way.  Obviously, there's a crafting system that involves gutting and skinning animals that you hunt.  It's gross and I can get past that.  That's not the disgusting that bothers me.  The enemies are pretty rough characters -- drug runners, kidnappers and mercenaries.  Looting them will yield an assortment of colorful vendor fodder like dirty needles, crackpipes and the sort.  This bothers me a bit...but I can get past it.  The game, however, seems to pride itself in what an ugly world and situation it places you in.  Loading screens treat you with random, stream-of-consciousness words, a few of which are obscenities.  Of course the in-game dialog is repleat with obscenities.  I guess you can't have a modern ""gritty"" game without them.  At this point, I'm swallowing a lot of ugly for the sake of the game play, which holds up pretty well until you start hitting certain progression walls.Like many games claiming to be open worlds, the world is gradually revealed or unlocked through progression in the story.  Character skills and crafting recipes are similarly locked to your storyline.  In the end, it was these restrictions that put me off to the game entirely.  I hated the storyline for the game's ugliness I described above.  I just didn't want to run through it.  However, with at least half of the game world locked away behind irritating game content, I lost my will to play the game at all.  And cheat codes don't help you much in escort missions in which NPCs will gladly take cover in front of enemy gunfire.All of that said, I laud CryTek for what they tried to do here -- open world shooting with crafting and skill systems that feel lifted from the latest MMO.  I loved that concept.  I just wish it weren't tied to content that made me feel worse for playing the game.			"

												Jumped from rooftop. Landed a knife on an enemy's back. Grabbed his knife and threw at other enemy.      RAMBO/10     Now, seriously,this is the best game that I have played in a long time. The story is very captivating and the gameplay is very adictive. You are completely free to choose what to do next, like: you can continue your story completing missions, or you can try sidequests around the island, or you can just hunt some animals and craft your gear, or you can explore the island and loot some cash, or you can free some outposts... In short, you can do pretty much everything you want in that island.     The graffics are excellent, I played the game at ultra and the lightning effects, combined with foliage and water reflection are so beatiful sometimes you'll just stare at the landscape and enjoy it.     The background music is great, the sound effects are very immersive and realistic. The radio that plays at cars is OK, but after 10 or 15 hours of gameplay it will get repetitive (I guess there is 3 or 4 playlists, and they start at the same part of the same music everytime you enter in a car by the first time) but that is just a detail.      The worst thing about this game is Uplay. Really, this thing is very annoying. I always open my games through GeForce Experience, so in order to open and play FarCry 3, I open GeForce Experience, that opens Steam, that opens Uplay, that finally opens the game. I hope this is not a new trend, because I already have Steam, Origin, Rockstar Social and now Uplay. What will happen if every game company creates a digital store/ social hub-like program like Steam? Hell, that's what will happen. A quick tip for every company in the world: USE STEAM.      If you aren't sure whether you buy this game or not, try the following: type ""The Far Cry Experience"" at Youtube and click play (I recommend Machinima's playlist) YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT      Obs.: If you already played this game and doesn't know what ""The Far Cry Experience"" is, GO WATCH IT NOW, as I said before, you will not regret it.Never played Far Cry 1 or 2 before. I only bought this game because it was R$ 20 and came with a bundle. The truth is: this game is so good it is forcing me to pay R$ 100 for Far Cry 4. I hate you, Steam sales! Gimme back my money!!

												After finally getting Uplay to work for this game, which took me a reinstall and about two hours total, I found it surprisingly bland. The characters were nothing to write home about, and sometimes I had a dislike for them, such as both the protaganist and antagonist. The hunting was lackluster and was often inturupted by random encounters which ruined them entirely and cost me to lose my quarry. On top of that, the gunplay I found surprisingly boring and unsatisfying. Furthermore most interactions between characters did little more than frustrate me.			"

												Far Cry 3 is a solid game. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys FPS or sandbox genres. It had surprisingly well designed game play which made the game feel fresh for the whole time I played it. Graphics looked good on my 5 year old pc and sounds were even better apart from music. Voice acting was nice and sounds of the jungle felt good if not great. So it is definately a better game than FC2 or first Far cry. What surprised me most is the fact that this game really feels like both of those games thought they were nothing alike when compared to each other.Sneaking is decently done, and variety of weapons and different missions kept the game going for around 30 hours. Although the jungle looked good, it never really felt in any way threatening and was kinda like walking in a zoo or something. I hope we'll see more dense, darker and frightening jungles in the future. And more varied landscapes, these islands felt a bit too dull in a way that it all looked pretty much the same apart from some swamps. As I realised that the Island looks pretty much the same all around, I kinda stopped looking after the chests and relics. Didn't bother looking for them from the south island at all compared to the fact that around 60 % of the chests in top island was gathered and all the relics.That being said, I still didn't think this was a GOTY or even 9/10 game. I would give it 8.5/10. Main flaws of the game is the story and the characters. Story is thin and empty: about rescuing your brothers and friends and becoming a ""warrior"" for the local tribe. The story makes little sense and feels very weird time to time, especially towards the end. The atmosphere changes drastically between characters that are meant to be funny and the few minute drops of serious conversations with your friends. Combined to the fact that between missions the protagonist is running around picking flowers, hunting, flying, playing cards and doing whatever, the story feels disconnected from the world. I got the same feeling that I got from Far Cry 2; Someone wanted to make a serious game with serious plot about insanity, but at some point someone wanted to water it down and make it more relaxed and funny. The result is mish mash that's neither funny nor serious. Then again I felt that I played the game wrong. I should've just went straight for the main missions and totally ignore about everything else the environment offered me.I didn't know much about the game before I played it but I definately knew about Vaas. He was the biggest disappointment. He had maybe 10-20 mins of screen time and barely made any sense at all. And no, it's not a testimony for his insanity, it's testimony for directors lack of will to make this game a whole instead of gathering of pieces. There were no other characters that were in any way memorable, except for the main protagonist which turned out to be decent. And the ending, oh dear what the hell.All in all, I will most likely return to this game at some point, although I think I completed everything worth doing in the game, only some relics from south island and few hunting and Wanted missions got left over. Maybe I try to complete the game as fast as possible just to see if the main plot would be more coherent instead of what it turned out to be in my first play.This opinion is based on single player experience only, didn't play multiplayer or co-op.

												If you’re deciding whether to buy Far Cry 3 for Uplay or for Steam, I’d recommend you just get it for Uplay. Sure the Uplay client is inferior, but you’ll have fewer problems getting the game to work (took a long time to get the game to run). Also, when you start the game in Steam, it just launches Uplay anyway so it’s basically just a shortcut. I had kind of a unique situation so I can’t say for certain that you’ll encounter the same problems playing the Steam versionFirst off, the game is very hardware intensive. It probably stressed my system more than anything other than Watch Dogs, which I just gave up on running due to low frame rate. I had to turn down the graphics a bit to get a nice 40 fps for Far Cry 3. If you have better than a GTX 460 video card you should be fine.For gameplay, the game is very similar to Far Cry 2 (big surprise). It’s a first person shooter with 4 gun slots (you unlock them through crafting). Similar to many other modern shooters, when you kill a gun wielding enemy, they usually drop that weapon for you to pick up, or just scavenge the ammo. There’s a stealth component to combat where you are rewarded (with extra exp) for sneaking up and using takedowns on enemies rather than just running in shooting. Various styles of takedown are unlocked through skill points as you progress through the game (such as dropping down on enemies or pulling the pin on an enemy’s grenade and kicking him toward his buddies. I mentioned crafting earlier and the crafting system is very simple, if somewhat time consuming. You hunt animals for their skins and use the skins to unlock equipment upgrades. For example 2 goat skins might increase the number of grenades you can carry or 2 flowers can be turned into a healing item. I spent about 3 hours just hunting all the animals to upgrade my gear before tackling the main story quests. Similar to Tomb Raider and Deus Ex: Human Revolution, “leveling up” doesn’t make you stronger with more HP or damage. It just gives you a skill point to spend.The game story is very well written and executed (completely new protagonist and story from the previous Far Cry games). I won’t spoil it for you but you start as a non-combatant and end up as a badass. There’s a ton of collectible items strewn across the game map telling the history of the island (kind of like Tomb Raider) and you’re rewarded for finding them with more exp.Overall the game is fantastic and a definite thumbs up. I only have the basic version so I can’t tell you if the “deluxe edition” is worth getting. I kind of doubt it though. By the way, I thought Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon was a DLC for Far Cry 3. Blood Dragon is actually a total conversion and you don’t need Far Cry 3 installed (or even owned) to play it.			"

												Far Cry 3 was an interesting experience. The core game mechanics were very fun and responsive but the problem of the game turned out to be the story. The game went the usual GTA sandbox route where you can just roam the game world doing various activities or engage in the story missions. Those story missions just weren’t very fun. The thing is that instead of building over the existing fun gameplay they seemed to constantly take away from it by constraining the ways the player could play the missions and filling them with quick time events. To top it all off the characters and script of the game were just ridiculously clichéd and uninspired outside of barely few fun exceptions. Even the missions themselves quickly boiled down to just following markers and watching cutscenes. The main character in particular was just not convincing at all and made me question if anyone in Ubisoft knew anything about human beings. As I said the core game mechanics were very good (if you don’t count the driving sections) and at best made me think of games like Fallout 3 and Just Cause 2. Lastly, I need to point out that people making Far Cry games seem to have an endless fascination with tropics and paradise islands. I happen to hate them. Here’s for hoping that the next Far Cry game will take place in some sort of Twin Peaks inspired setting.			"

												Best. Game. Ever*.Buy it and don't pirate it, because this game does not like pirates in particular. I love how you are given alot of freedom to just do whatever you want. It reminds me of assassin's creed and The Elder Scrolls games alot. What I like most is how you can hunt and craft for better equipment. The skill tree is nice also, but it does not bind you to a certain way of playing. So you can still be stealth without actually having to get alot of perks. Another amazing aspect of this game is the landscape. The jungle looks absolutely stunning.There's not too many downsides. The only one I can think of now is it being too easy to get all craftable gear maxed out. It took me around 23 hours. The amount of variety in the ""wanted"" missions is too small though. It basically always comes down to knifing some dude who downloaded media illigally. Conclusion: Get it. It is totally worth the price and it will keep you busy for hours if you like first person shooters / RPG's.*Not actually best game ever but alot of fun.			"

												!!! Far Cry 3 !!!Hmmm...Game Of The Year 2012? Yeah, I'm 2 years behind on this game and i cant believe i let this one slide me by. Let me start by saying it's refreshing to meet a game where it's strongest point is singleplayer, usually current games stash all of their real content into multiplayer then hack on some half-witted single player just to have it there.First off, just to get it out of the way, you have to deal with the horrible abomination that we all call Uplay...I'm glad i could finally play the game in offline mode, but still, it's a dumb program in the way of your gaming experience. There were also alot of server issues galore when i tried and i have yet to be able to play a single CO-OP game. so as of this review, ive stuck to singleplayer.Most people pass this off as an average console port, but i don't really think so. as far as graphical options, this game truly delivers. Full DX11 support and even offers a dam FOV slider, when was the last time you saw one of those beautiful things? Mouse smoothing also isn't a problem since you can just turn it off. The amount of sheer detail found in this game is outstanding, but moreover, its consistent. Most games of this scale will throw in the occasional bland texture, but ive yet to see ANY.I'll start with the story, it is really quite interesting as you progress and experience Jason, a town-raised ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, changing as a person; lowering himself to Vaas's level. Becoming a warrior himself.  Vaas, is very Heath Ledger (joker) like, the way he talks and his fast paced personality. you can clearly see the amount of effort that Micheal Mando (Vaas voice actor) but into him. The game is even matched with little tid bits of ""Alice in wonderland"" quotes thrown here and there between the chapters, they fit perfectly.Supporting Far Cry 3's story is a pretty large arsenal of side quests; ranging from hunting special animals to races to mini games. There always seems to be something to do. There is even a very robust crafting system in place, at times it feel very lackluster but as my progress in the game grew deeper, i found myself liking it's simplistic style more and more. Crafting in this game is essential and really makes you want to go hunt or gather ingredients for syringes that besides healing you can grant you some neat abilities (the ability to sense the animals around you or repel predators,etc). Now this is a Free Roam RPG shooter, so as well as crafting and side missions, your hit with 3 character advancement skill trees that as you unlock the skills in them, tattoos appear on your forearm *or tataus like they are called here* i feel the skill system could have been a little better, but i think that was just me remembering FFX oh well.The huge focus of this game is its amazing amount of freedom in anything and everything you do. Sure there are a couple of story missions that are kind of linear or restrictive, but other than that it's all up to you. Do you like to make a noisy entrance into the enemy base, without knowing where the enemies are, spray-and-praying Call of Duty style? Go ahead.Do you like to stalk your prey and make a plan and try to keep to it as you silently pick them off with your silenced sniper or trusty bow? You can do that. Or maybe baiting your enemies while you sneak into their base, plant amine near every alarm and next time they see you BOOM! Or maybe let that leopard trapped in that cage do the job for you. Done! You have so many options it can be overwhelming at times. Most AAA RPGs that are released now and boast with their freedom of choice don't even come close to this game.As for the animals, this is where the game does a VERY good job. There are two types of animals: carnivores and herbivores. Predators and prey. Wherever you go chances are you will see leopards chasing deer, tigers hunting buffalos, sharks eating tortoises, bears assaulting villagers etc. It feels very organic, natural and chaotic as well. These animals can make your life very hard - like surveying an enemy outpost only to find yourself attacked by a tiger, thus drawing enemy attention and realizing there are 4 times more enemy troops now. Or making a run for it and having to cross a river only to be assaulted by a crocodile and dragged underwater as soon you dive into the river. Splendid!well, i think i made you read for quite long enough. all in all i would highly recommend this game, especially if you like first person shooters. im sad to say my review was based only on the singleplayer, but ive heard from many people that Far Cry 3 has a very solid multiplayer and an extremely fun and engaging CO-OP, matched with a high singleplayer replay value. this is defiantly a game ill be playing a few times over-XeroSyphon			"

												When I picked this game up in the sales for a few pounds, there was no way I expected it to be as brilliant as it actually is. Farcry3 follows Jason, a slightly wimpy American teenager who gets into trouble with some bad guys on an island. In essence, they kidnap some of his friends and he goes to get them back. Firstly, let's get the characters out of the way. Lots of people hate Jason and his friends, and although they are very 1 dimensional, I have to say I grew fond of Jason. His transition from cowardly white boy to tattooed warrior was a great development throughout the game. The other characters are brilliant; The unstable and unpredictable Vaas, in particular, I absolutely adored. And Sam. BLITZKRIIIIEG! I love the fact that you hear them referring to you as 'Snow White' as your legendary status increases, it makes you feel like a badass.The game is just so much fun! I felt genuine fear as I ran and hid behind bushes from the enemies, having heard their trucks driving closer and closer. I nearly had a heart attack the first time a tiger jumped on me, and laughed out loud as a herd of cows chased me. I adored having to go to certain areas on the island to hunt for different animals to make things. The skill development trees are great, and the skills built up perfectly in sync with the difficulty progression of the game. The open world feature is brilliant - it makes the game less linear and a lot more interesting. I absolutely loved the idea of having to turn on the pylons to unlock sections of the map, and the turquoise water, sandy beaches and lush tropical vegetation make the game look stunning.The tasks are varied and a lot of them are so much  fun  (the drug fields task was probaby my favourite task in any game, ever). From having to drive a quad bike against the clock, to sneaking into camps to take things, to shooting a gun and making everything explode from a helicopter, to torturing somebody, the tasks are endlessly entertaining. At no point in this game did I think 'oh great, another one of  these  tasks'. And that's another thing: you have a lot of choice. No, you don't have to keep taking out all the enemy camps, you can sneak around them. No, you don't have to do lots of vehicle driving if you don't want to. Aside from the main storyline, you can play the game how the hell you want. The difficulty increases throughout the game so perfectly, you have to take your hat off to Ubisoft. Towards the end, the tasks got really quite demanding, and there were several instances where I 'ragequitted' and sulked for half an hour, before having to go back for more punishment. And to me, that is the sign of an incredible game - I had to finish it, I needed to know what happened. The storyline is probably the best storyline I have seen in a game for a long time, it flows well and you genuinely care about what happens. Of course, there are a few bugs and general irritants in the game. The enemies are very 1 dimensional and often a bit daft, as Jason's friends are. Some of the later tasks are ridiculously difficult (constantly spawning enemies). Having to pat down dead bodies to steal stuff means you'e continuously having to hold E, and the character feels a little bit clunky when you're climbing around. Having said that, these are very minor issues that took absolutely nothing out of the game, I'm just trying to balance it out a bit. I wish I could go back to the time before I played FarCry3 and start all over again. I absolutely recommend this game, and for the sale price of less than £5 you would be absolutely crazy not to have this on your list.			"

												When this game first came out, someone said that it is like Skyrim with guns.  I think that's generally a fair assessment.It was a bit frustrating that some of the missions required stealth since I don't think this game was trying to be a stealth game.  I really liked being able to boat around and I was terrified of swimming in the open oceans due to the sharks (it felt rather real).  The upgrade system was a bit foreign to me since I hadn't seen perks implemented as they were in this game, but it didn't take long to figure it out.  The injections system by which you crafted stuff like health vials and a few other buffs was a bit awkward and I don't think it added much to the game (although it was a necessary thing to do in order to play successfully).I had fun playing it.  I don't expect to play it again, though.   I'm a bit excited to give the previous FC games a try, though, once I work through my backlog a bit.			"

												Welcome to beautiful, massive and entertaining open world of Far Cry 3.Storyline is awesome and deep, will take you a long time to finish if you are very bad at stealth gameplay.A lot of additional Mini Games such as: hunting challenges, poker, land and sea races, deadly warrior and much more.Big weapon arsenal: from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1911 to AMR anti vehicle sniper rifle. A big choise of skins and attachments for your weaponry. Tons of collectables which unlock more missions and equipment. Multiplayer servers are still active and still has players, a lot of bonus weapons like type 10 ( a mini shotgun) and Tanto blade. CO OP is really fun with or without friends. Has its own storyline. (notice that leveling up in CO OP levels you up in Multiplayer too). The game is really brutal- contains partial nudity and gore (SPOILER ALERT! : THEY CHOP YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FINGER OFF!)Do not recommend buying this game to  less than 14 year old teenagers. In conclusion: one of the best games i have ever played 9.9999/10!Really reccomend it!			"

												Let me start by saying I'm not usually someone who enjoys FPS games but I think to call FC3 simply an FPS would be wrong. Although the storyline and setting is pretty typical of FPS games (bad guys/terrorists vs you/the little guy) the gameplay its self isn't typical. Infact, the game rewards you for trying outlandish, improvised or tactical approaches to seemingly ordinary objectives. You'd think all this freedom means it's just another one of those titles that you derp about blowing yourself and everything else up till you get bored and leave the game to rot in your library, but the storyline and characters within FC3 do enough to make you want to actually finish or at least progress through the game. The map itself, teamed with the crafting mechanics and ecosystem, is great fun to explore. The little relics and hidden locations mean getting sidetracked can be worthwhile. I personally also really enjoy the patrols of bad guys and having to hide or engage, which is just another way the game has of reminding you not to relax for too long.  There are a few things that annoy me however. Firstly, you need a Uplay account to run this. I bought through Steam because of the convienience and achievements and all that cool stuff, but Uplay wipes that out. There are a few UI/Navigational annoyances in this game too, menus mainly. Some of the flavour texts I feel are a little overdone, or repeated too often to be funny. These are however more preferential things than a straight up issue.In short, even if you don't play FPS games, you'll still probably enjoy this enough to warrant picking it up through a sale. Good fun.			"

												Good, but somewhat overratedAfter all the praise I’ve heard and read about Far Cry 3 I approached the game with some high expectations.I had played – and enjoyed - the original Far Cry. About the second Far Cry I read a lot of rather lukewarm comments and only purchased it on a Steam Sale  a year  or two later. As expected it was a mixed bag of an interesting open world gameplay (with an entirely different feel than FC1), but somewhat underdeveloped and riddled with annoying elements and a completely uninteresting storyline. Still I have to admit that somehow the game managed to keep my attention and I played it through to the end.When I read about FC3 it seemed like once again a different kind of game than FC1 or 2. But once I started playing I found that FC3 is very much a continuation of FC2, but thankfully much better developed and with a lot of smart improvements.The storyline is more interesting, the world is richer and more diverse and there’s a nice mix of gameplay elements to offer diversified gameplay experience. For the most part you can set your own pace, alternating between storyline missions and the various side missions to stretch gameplay and broaden up the experience.  Some elements, like the radio towers, were obviously adopted from Assassins Creed, but it’s a nice change of pace. The basic concept works quite well and gameplay all in all is enjoyable.But while I thoroughly enjoyed the game some flaws and strange design choices kept FC3 from being a great game. Let’s ignore some of the weak spots in the storyline (and  skip over the pretentiousness of the “Alice in Wonderland”-quotes suggesting a depth the storyline simply didn’t have, and ignore the unsatisfying conclusion) and just look at the gameplay:Crafting was basically an interesting idea, but I found it not all that useful and basically pointless in the second half of the game (Perhaps more useful on more difficult settings, but I played medium and don’t think I collected a single plant on the southern island). Money also is an important point in the beginning, but loses importance in the second half (most of the time I had more stuff to sell than my wallet could handle). I have the strong suspicion that shops originally should be spread scarcely across the map (as it was in FC2), but the integration of autoshops in most spawnpoints made shops pointless and gave gameplay a strange rhythm. That goes along with the quicktravel option, something I liked on one hand (especially later, when I hunted for relics), but it robbed the game some of its immediacy, since you could hop around the map (at least between unlocked points) and resupply as much as your wallet allowed. That’s the other extreme to FC2’s four travelpoints, which forced the player to travel long distances to missions. I would have wished for something in between: Less travel points, less (or even no) autoshops, no free weapons after radio tower missions.And to be honest I found many gameplay elements repetitive after a while. Freeing enemies camp was fun most of the time, but many of the additional missions overstayed their welcome during the second half. IMHO it would have been smarter to introduce entirely new gameplay elements on the south island (if done smartly motivated by the different environment and enemy group). As it was the second half felt like “more of the same” and I found myself rushing through the missions.Another missed opportunity was to integrate real sidequests. While inhabitants all over the map offer the player little sidequests, those have to be worked through immediately. How much more interesting it would have been to have quests, which can be accepted but finished either later, or might even have to be dealt with on a different spot on the map. All in all FC3 was a definite improvement over its predecessor, but I can’t help but feel that some compromises and design flaws kept it from being even better. We will see if FC4 will correct some of those mistakes, but frankly as much as I enjoyed FC3 I’m not compelled to purchase FC4 immediately. "

We will see if FC4 will correct some of those mistakes, but frankly as much as I enjoyed FC3 I’m not compelled to purchase FC4 immediately. "

												Without even getting into the horror that is Uplay, Far Cry 3 is an unimpressive game. It tries and fails to be GTA in the jungle for the simple reason that it lacks depth. This game consists of you repeating what is basically the same task over and over again while playing through the plot of the first two seasons of “Lost.” Give it a miss. "

It's kinda nuts because you can heal body-bullet wounds by wrapping a piece of cloth around your left arm, which is super realisic.

												This is a very difficult game to review, I'd like to note before we begin that this is my opinion with my OWN experiences... you may think the problems I found with it to be nothing or you may just not like me bashing your wonderful game but I'm speaking or in this case typing from the heart, any stupid comments will be ignored including those that wish totell me how gay I am or how much of a♥♥♥♥♥♥my mom is.Now onto the review shall we? This is a very fun game... I stayed up 2 and a half days straight to complete it but there is really nothing to do but the story and that lacks so much...This is not a game like GTA, it offers a wide variety of extra tasks to do but there is no need to do them other than to feel the grind, one extra is the ability to hunt to craft upgrades and the ability to find flowers to create medicine or buffs but I completed the game without upgrading any of my gear and I never had to create buffs... the only thing worth while creating was medkits and once you unlock the ability to heal yourself without medkits(much slower) you will not find the need for them... I also never really ran out of ammo and if I did I just picked up another gun off an enemy.. easy!That is another thing I find lacking.. there is so many weapons but for the entire game I stuck with the AK47 from one of the first people I killed at the start... I don't even know what other weapons there was.. was no need..The Graphics are nice but of course a little dated now and with my settup appeared very cartoony.. the people that is had thick black borders around them.. the world however was beautiful!Now the story.. jeeze.. it was amazing BUT.. I found a lot of flaws with it.. to start with the story restarts 3 times.. 3 times you complete it and it takes everything away from you and sends you back to the start only this time something is a little different... I also hated the weird magical mystical scenes.. granted when I'd smoked some weed or had hallucigenic powder blown in my face? great! but then you reach say a boss battle and your transported to some made up magical place where the fight consists of button bashing (really.. you have to mash keys when it tells you to win) at first I did not even know I had killed the first boss.. I thought I was somehow on drugs in fact I still believe I was on drugs.. I swear I killed him while on drugs and he never actually died but after i came around apparently I killed him so you know? ok?Towards the end I felt this was a pebble compared to Farcry on my old Xbox (the original) and I felt that though the story was good it was very very short akin to DLC (as i said they restarted it 3 times to make it appear longer) I like te premise for the story I just don't like how it was executed.. Now I had great fun with this game but I don't know I'm sort of half for recommending it and half for not... right now it feels a cross between original farcry but done as a point and click adventure game.. I've decided after a small break to decide that I'm NOT going to OFFICIALLY recommend this game however I'd like you to be well aware that this is a magnificent game even though there was to many flaws for me to recommend it.. you should buy it if it's affordable to you.. (IE you're mega friggen rich or it's on sale)I recommend this game but I don't, 5/10 (meet you half way) BONUS PET PEEVE: There are enemies on it that wear about 40 body packs and can take about 6 rounds of my assault rifle to put down, I thought they were going realistic here? get them to carry a riot shield next time and leave fantasy alone.. it's clear you guys cannot grasp reality/make pretend anyway! (you're suppose to aim for the head, aim for the head and you'll do great!)			"

												Far Cry 3 was one of my favorite games of 2013.As with the previous Far Cry games, we have always expected them to be a PC gaming benchmark graphically and this game is no exception. The graphics are excellent, and can bring high end gaming machines to their knees! However, even with a mid range graphics card you could easily manage some playable settings and enjoy the game to the end.The characters are quite easily the best part of this game. Vaas is possibly the greatest villain ever portrayed in a game, largly down to immaculate voice acting & believable animations. Even the side characters you meet on the way are believable and help immerse you in the story.Controls are easy to get to grips with whether you use keyboard or control pad. I played through with an Xbox 360 controller and it was an enjoyable experience start to finish. The feeling of the guns is realistic and they feel different whether using a pistol of LMG, the weight and control is spot on.Overall the game is immaculate and shouldnt be missed. It's a shame the PC multiplayer seemed quiet because I thought it was brilliant, some nice game modes, excellent maps, and the graphics are still on point. Better than the typical CoD games. Did not get a chance to try Co-op but from what i've seen it seems fun.I would give the game 9/10 for single player alone, could have been 10/10 if the multiplayer had been able to extend my time with this game!

												At first i felt like this game was trying to hard to make this game Open World. Dont get me wrong i loved this game, but i bought it for open world and side quests. Far Cry 3 had ""side quests"" but these quests would mess up the story line and often mess up the main story line. The open world aspect to it wasnt open world at all really just a large world filled with nothing in particular. In my opinion i would recommend it to people who like a game that sticks to the storyline and just that. I would not recommend this to people who like games like ""skyrim"" or ""fallout"". I do know its bad to compare these games to this, but if thats what your looking for, dont get this game.			"

I prefer sneaking up on everyone and taking them out silently with my knife. There are just a lot of playstyles to try, and that's what makes it cool. It's a huge open world with a lot of things to explore. Probably one of my favourite games.			"

												You play Jason Brody, some rich kid from California, who goes on a trip with some friends and ends up as a hostage of the local pirates. After he barely manages to escape he is recruited by Tribals who call themselves the Rakyat, and goes on a long and erotic journey to self-discovery. While the initial Idea is pretty good, it is not executed very well. Jason never killed anybody nor skinned an animal, but after the cut scenes end and you can finally go out and explore, you can happily murder half of the Island´s population without hearing a whimper ever again. Well, except when skinning animals; Jason never gets used to that, even though you have to kill the whole fauna twice over to craft a wallet and a rucksack. This is something Tomb Raider pulled off better. Another problem is that the faction you are working for (and you have no choice here) is not really likeable. Even though YOU are supposed to help THEM, you rarely see them fighting the pirates. There are several occasions where, after ""liberating"" one of the pirate outposts, I´d hear some Rakyat proudly proclaiming: ""WHO`S THE MAN?! ME!"" Yeah buddy, you sure are. This goes on and on, and after a while you ask yourself why you would even help them in the first place; your goal is to rescue your friends. But because some black guy who fished you out of the river, put some tattoos on your arm and sent you to the local drug king told you to, you´ll happily oblige. BECAUSE YOU ARE A WARRIOR, JASON. AND YOU NEED DA TATAU TO BECOME STRONGER. This part of the story is just unnecessary.The game also has an obsession with drugs; on several occasions Jason ends up getting drugged, whether willingly, by accident, or per force. These dream-like sequences may be fancy for the first time, but are outright annoying the second time around. This is the part where you can guess what Ubisoft´s Target Demographic must have been. The Far Cry series has always been known for graphical fidelity; this one is a slight exception in my opinion. While the game DOES look good overall, there are some things that are worse than in the previous games, if not♥♥♥♥♥♥in general. I can´t understand how a game that runs essentially on the same engine as the previous game looks worse, even though they even upgraded it to the second version. When you compare the two games side by side, several things just stand out negatively: the LOD and view distance are handled way better in Far Cry 2. I have never experienced such severe pop ins like I did in Far Cry 3, especially since it uses a rather obvious effect to do so. Secondly, Far Cry 3 uses way too much SSAO, to the point where objects have black halos surrounding them. Unfortunately you can´t disable this effect in game without switching to DX9; you have to edit the config file if you want to get rid of it. Another thing I really can´t understand is a weird graphical glitch that happens when you are inside caves. Sometimes the walls appear all shiny, like somebody spent two weeks smearing oil on random cave walls. The sound is generally pretty good, the weapons all sound quite alright. Only problem here is that all suppressed weapons use the same sound, no matter if you are using an assault rifle or a shotgun. This can be kind of annoying when you tend to use more than one suppressed weapon. But this is nothing compared to the sound quality of EVERYBODY except the main characters. Every single civilian, pirate and rebel sounds like his voice was recorded with a microphone wrapped in a plastic bag; the sound quality is just awful at times. Couple this with repetitive voice lines á la ""FOCK. DIS. HEAT"" or ""BURNS LIKE A MOTHER WHEN I♥♥♥♥♥♥ SHOULDA USED A RUBBER."" and the problem will become really obvious. The gameplay itself is what really saves this title. The gameplay is mostly fluid, rewarding and well, fun, that you can forget most of these annoyances when you get the chance to play undisturbed for more than half an hour. It is way more fun to ambush pirates with mines, surprise them with C4 or just stab everybody with your knife than playing the main missions, which sometimes severely limit how you can approach the situation. Maybe this is why I liked the southern Island more; the whole tribal hero ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is cast aside, and there is only the mission and how you want to approach it, just like the previous games. Unfortunately the game is almost over when you reach the second island, leaving you with such a low amount of missions that I wonder why they even bothered making another island.The weapons are fairly standard, ranging from pistols to rocket launchers. But for some reason some weapons have their attachments disabled, something which really sucks in the beginning. This is strange because all weapons HAVE attachments, which you can use in coop and multiplayer. A simple mod can unlock all attachments for the weapons, which makes me wonder why they chose to disable them in the first place. There is also a problem with the game´s difficulty. First of all, the AI is not that great. Even though your enemies can take cover and try to flank you sometimes, they just charge towards you most of the time. Couple this with aimbot like accuracy on the higher difficulties and bugged fire that you can´t put out because the QTE prompt does not show up and you know what to expect. Because of that, a stealthy approach is easier most of the time. If you do get spotted, you can abuse the takedown system by shooting even the armored guys until they stagger, walk around them and stab them in the back to kill them instantly. Things like that make some encounters ridiculously easy.  After all I have criticized, you´d think that I don´t like this game. But here comes the funny part: I can´t deny that Far Cry 3 is a fun game. It has some major flaws and annoyances, but at least this time the gameplay is decent. Stabbing people, blowing up convoys and hunting the local fauna just has a certain charm. While it is not a bad game per se, it is not a good Far Cry. Despite this, pick it up when it is on sale, it will keep you occupied for a while.  "

												I just can't put this game down. It is just too immensely rich and fun to play. There is always a cave you haven't explored, a secret you didn't find, a nice place you didn't see, a way of fighting you didn't try before... Rook Island always makes you come back for more.Gameplay--- I have to place this statement in a proper context though. My first playthrough on the vanilla version of the game only lasted about 25 hours, full of high-tempo combat, mad driving, killing pirates by the dozens, completing missions in a hush-hush way. This is because the original game can feel a little FPS-mainstream (damn you, COD, for what you have done to the genre). The emphasis is a little too much on the action, and less on the open world and side missions, as is the case with Far Cry 2. However, where game-dev's fail in order to satisfy the producers and the company, the game community comes to the rescue. With proper modding (Ziggys Mod!), this game becomes what it had to be all along. The pace is slowed down, the difficulty has gone way up, making run-and-gun console-type approaches impossible. Instead, you have to resort to guerilla-warfare and the use of stealth and your natural surroundings. The over-guidance of the vanilla game is gone; you have to rely on your own noodle now. Sometimes you'll be the hunter, sometimes you'll be the prey, and that is what makes this game an exciting experience. Also, you will notice that this game is much richer in content than you noticed at first, since you spend too much time running and gunning in the vanilla version. Now, you can just ignore the missions and go hiking the amazingly beautiful island on your own.Storyline--- Although I get the feeling that it is a little too cliché-ridden, the storyline is quite decent. No big plot twists or big schemes, but enough to keep the game going, and to give you a sense of urgency. Also, it does a good job in letting you question your morality and sanity by the end of the game, a nice break from the justified-violence themes in other games in the FPS-genre (yep, looking at you, COD). The most credit has to go to the voice-actors, who did an incredible job in giving the characters some depth (Vaas already is a classic). Technical aspects--- The graphics of this game are just insane (keep your finger on the print-screen button!). Then again, so are the system specs, even for current standards. Bear this in mind when you buy this game!Multiplayer and coop--- Not really worth the trouble. The multiplayer is COD-clone without depth (sorry for the fanboys that I keep mentioning this franchise in a negative way). The coop, however, is quite fun and easily accesible, since it uses a sort of 4-player drop-in format like L4D. But honestly, who cares? This is the best single-player experience I had!Conclusion--- Buy it, mod it, fall in love with it. Once you set a foot on Rook Island, you'll never want to leave.			"

												So I recently bought Resident Evil 6 and since the download is so slow I could send my dog run to China, swin across the Pacific ocean and come back, and my download would still be at 50%!While it's making the download, I figured why not review Far Cry 3, Ubisoft's 2012 best game and one of my personal Games of the Year of 2012 (like I said before I have 4 ""winners"").Graphically, the game is stunning, everything is high-res, attention to detail is ludicrously high! The color pallet is incredibly varied! I can actually see greens (true greens, not f*cking brown-grey-ish greens, Skyrim!!!!), the water is actually blue! I was shellshocked the first time I saw it, it's truly amazing and a sight to be seen ASAP!Story wise is where I can safely say the game shines (since every single side quest is as repetitive as a CoD game. Side quests are basically: kill this super holy♥♥♥♥♥♥huge beast animal! OR it's: This pirate is really badass and only you can save us! Kill him! But with a knife because it's our ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will-get-you-killed-some-day tradition!),  one of the antagonists (of course, Mr. Insanity himself: Vaas!) is the best villain of all time! Movie-wise, book-wise, game-wise, whatever-wise. Vaas is the perfect Villain I've been expecting to see somewhere for years!! The story tells the personal story of Jason Brody, who is trapped along with his girlfriend, brother and friends in a circle of human traffic, lead by Vaas and other amazingly written villains (not as good as Vaas, but they are still some of the best I've ever seen anywhere!). The story is really good, character development EXISTS! It's amazing! One of the best storylines of all time! Although it's annoying the cliché at the start where Jason is a lonely boy who doesn't know how to do anything and 5 seconds later he's Jason Brody, the son of Rambo + Chuck Norris in the womb of John Connor! It's not very believable, but with that aside, the story is stellar and it's the steal of the show along with the graphics!Gameplay is pretty standard, you have guns n' sh*t and you have to kill some animals to create bigger bags to create bigger ammo pouches, bigger rucksacks (for loot), bigger wallets (it's pretty obvious...) and carry more guns (up to 4 guns, yes you can carry 4 LMG's if you want to do so). The is an RPG like system where you gain XP for stuff that you do and get skill point with then you spend in 3 different skill trees, which allows you to have more health, takedown heavier enemies (this game has stealth and actually does it WELL! F*ck me finally!), among other amazing traits!Gunplay is pretty good, guns have a very nice handling and feel. Most of them sound very powerful. However in the demo shown at E3 2011 (I think it was E3 2011, not sure) the guns, like the AK (the one shown) looked and seemed to feel much better in that demo than in the actual game, but those are small complaints since the AK still feels amazing in this version.SOund design is amazing as well, you can hear jungle noises, tigers roaring, gun fire at the distance. The Island is alive and it's great! It really really is! I love the game and everything about it! The game also has a FULL Co-Op campaign up to 4 players and a FULL Multiplayer component (with perks, attachment for guns, clan support, so much, just so much to cover in this game, you can easily put over 40 hours out of it!)Get it at any price, even 49,99€ it would still be worth it! On Steam is now 29,99€ buy it now or wait for a sale, you won't regret it (unless you're not a tropical island/FPS fan, but who isn't? Nobody, that's who!) :D			"

Bear this in mind when you buy this game!Multiplayer and coop--- Not really worth the trouble. The multiplayer is COD-clone without depth (sorry for the fanboys that I keep mentioning this franchise in a negative way). The coop, however, is quite fun and easily accesible, since it uses a sort of 4-player drop-in format like L4D. But honestly, who cares? This is the best single-player experience I had!Conclusion--- Buy it, mod it, fall in love with it. Once you set a foot on Rook Island, you'll never want to leave.			"

												As soon as you get the game and run, it downloads and installs this software called Uplay which i had no idea it did, so now some Uplay window pops-up and says i have to sign up! To play a ♥♥♥♥ing game! Which i bought on Steam! After the ♥♥♥♥ing annoying sign up. Not to mention how ♥♥♥♥ing annoying it is. Why can't i have all my games all in my steam?! Makes no sence. Is it that hard to make the game just run through steam instead of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Uplay?! This game is awesome in every way! My review would have been possitive. Maybe when they figure out that people HATE Uplay and they ♥♥♥♥ing remove it from launching a game you bought FROM steam i will change my reivew massivley until then... ♥♥♥♥ you Uplay and ♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft...

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupFew words about the gamePlaying this game was a really good, even suprising experience, something new and different from most of games i play. I don't always finish this kind of games, as it's often gets farmy or too boring but this game simply made me stay around for moreAdvantages - Amazing looks and variety of surroundings - Movement system is realistic what in my opinion makes it really, really good - Diversity of armament, there is more than enough to match your equipment to your personal style of gameplay - Entertaining storyline that makes you want to play more and more - Authenticity of characters, especially Vaas, i loved his personalityDisadvantages - Taking over camps is required to progress the story and it's a bit monotonous - Modding of games is simplified to choosing few colors and sights, nothing really useful - Uplay.If you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!

												Far Cry 3 is a solid, albeit formulaic game in every aspect. You won't find very many ""flaws"" (for those whom aren't having problems with Uplay anyway) once the game is up and running. Solid gameplay, solid story, great looking world, excellent music score, memorable characters...you've heard as much already I'm sure. So what's there to dislike?The only real problem was how there wasn't any 'heart' in the game. By following a formula they never left any room for the creativity and innovation to fully unleash the world of the island. It's difficult to explain but easy to spot the places where they focused on following formula instead of improving user experience/immersion. For such a high production game this lack of going the extra mile somehow ends up being the only thing that prevents it from being perfect.If you don't own it you should really buy it during a sale. Not my GOTY (I enjoyed The Darkness 2 significantly more), but definitely worth a playthrough. The low to no replayability shouldn't matter with Far Cry 4 out now anyway.			"

												Far Cry 3, for me, is what Far Cry 2 should have been. In its predecessor the game lacked a proper story and also the game was very difficult. I remember the creators explaining it with the story, i.e. in order to really grasp the reality of the harsh African environment the game had to be hard even on a normal difficulty level.Far Cry 3 finally has a story and a more interesting protagonist. Also, the antagonist is memorable - his attitude, the voice acting, everything related to his personality stands out. The game gradually gets more difficult and you have a sense of progress here - there are no respawning enemies at the outposts any more: once you capture an outpost the local natives will take full control over it. They later on send patrols to further explore the island so it is now common to see them fighting with the enemies. I liked this approach as you could truly feel you were part of a story here and the fate of an entire people was dependent upon you. Oh, you want to clear an outpost in a much better way? (e.g. following the stealth approach) No worries, the game lets you reset all outposts so that you can complete these again earning some extra achievements.Proper fauna was also missing in the predecessor. Here you have all kinds of animals you can hunt. Hunting is important as by obtaining the skin / hide of your prey you can apply upgrades to your gear. You can have greater pouches to have more money with you or store more ammunition. I liked how you can even pick up herbs so that you can craft syringes that grant you an extra ability for a short period of time to make battles easier.And of course we have an enormous amount of collectible items scattered throughout the island. They are atop mountains or deep within in hidden caves. You need to swim in from the outside only to suddenly be attacked by a crocodile. Far Cry 3 is an exceptionally good game. If you don't mind signing up for UPlay (achievements are logged via that instead of Steam) you should not have a problem with this game. It is beautiful, it is entertaining, it has a good story and an amazing wildlife (e.g. a tiger can easily attack a deer in front of your eyes). And what's more in order to gather all collectibles and complete all side missions the game will hold you captive for at least 50 hours. And this is only the single player campaign as you still have coop mission and multiplayer.			"

												uplay is such a terrible peice of software, and you are forced to use uplay to play FarCry 3, that's enough reason to not bother with this or any ubisoft game on the pc.  as far as the game goes it's predictable, but a decent adventure sandbox game. just cause is a better series and i would recommend playing that over this.

												8/10Awesome gameplay, open world fps with gun customization, stealth, cars/boats, crafting, etc. Combat is really enjoyable and doesn't feel repetitive. The story, however, feels a little bit weak. The plot progression feels counterintuitive, especially the end of first island and the start of second island. Since it is an open world game, it is not story oriented at all and there are only a handful of main missions. Furthermore, side missions are somewhat rewarding, so I did only a few side missions. The story is also relatively short for an open world  game. However, I think the game has a powerful ending.			"

 Far Cry 3 You've been captured by pirates, and it's up to you, Jason Brody, to rescue your friends and get the hell off the island. As action heroes go, Brody is an unlikely one. While Far Cry and Far Cry 2's protagonists had military or mercenary backgrounds, which at least explained their ability to reload an assault rifle in three seconds, you're just an over-privileged Californian bro in his early twenties stuck in a nightmare situation.Far Cry 3 is one of the best open world games ever. This game offers a wide variety of different things to do, From Liberating Outposts to even hunting animals for their skins! Far Cry 3 is a delightful and harsh tropical wonderland, crawling with wildlife and threatened by the pirates and drug runners that disrupt its peace. Furthermore Far Cry 3 also has multiplayer, co-op so you can play online with friends or just play a game of deathmatch , Far Cry 3 also has a map editor where you decide what you want in your map, from where you want the animals etc...When i got Far Cry 3, i thought it was going to be another typical First Person Shooter game but i was wrong, Far Cry 3 adds realism to the game which actually makes you feel as if you are Jason Brody yourself. Far Cry 3 is a game i would definitely recommend to people who love fps games but  WARNING: THIS GAME HAS ANIMAL ABUSE SO IF YOU ARE A ANIMAL LOVER THEN THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU . I would give Far Cry 3 a 10/10 for many reasons, one of them being the graphics which is just out of this world and the characters are well created especially Vaas who is my favourite character in the game simply because of his humour. To the people who do not own this game or don't have the sufficient funds for it, wait for the sales to come around then Far Cry 3 will drop prices massively and that's when you can get it but if you do not own this game, you are really missing out.What i don't like about this game are the constant notifications and reminders. These are so frequent, and so annoying, like if i am roaming around, nearly every 10 seconds a notification pops up on the top corner of the screen about the objective which can get a bit annoying but that is all that i have against this beautiful open world fps game.

												This game can be defined with three words. Open world immersion! Crafting, hunting, exploration, side games, challenges, optional quests, lively characters, and amazing weapon design -- this game has it all! Not many games live up to the given price tag, and this is one of them. I spent fifty hours on my first play though. That is an extensive single player fps.Cut off the music and turn off all of the ""hud"" options that can be toggled, (I left the grenade indicator on) and this island will come to life. When hunting, the player will need to stand still and listen for the growls and other noises made by the animals. The items obtained from the wild life give the player options to craft new weapon, ammo, and consumable slots. The open world feel will often send the player face to face with tigers, bears, or enemy patrols when least expecting it.The ONLY thing I didn't like about the game.... Is the main character! I wanted to smack my guy in the face way to many times =/ But that is a small price to pay for a full and complete game that has been polished into a guided, open world thrill ride that is sure to please. The first time you light an enemy base on fire then slide down a steep mountain side for a quick and slick escape from the guard dogs like a serious BA, just to land on a pack of frickin' grizzly bears -- you'll be hooked!

												I've played about 30+ hours of Far Cry 3 on PC and another 40+ hours back on Xbox 360, meaning I've had quite some experience with the game. That being said, Far Cry 3 is probably Ubisoft's prime example of advertising and hyping without fully delivering, hence my negative review: it's far from as great as people claim it to be.The Good:· Michael Mando's performance as Vaas Montenegro is very well done, simply one of the best motion capture in any game.· The huge island allows for hours of exploring, hunting, and doing sidemissions. The Bad:· First I'm going to list what bothers me the most, and it also happens to be the thing I liked the most... Vaas. Ubisoft promoted Far Cry 3 with Vaas from the get-go; putting him in the early demo, placing him on the boxart, including a wahini-figure in the Collector's Edition... his insanity was basically the center of the game. Unfortunately, those promises weren't met. Slight spoiler warning ahead so please skip to the next point if you don't want any bits of the story given away, but Ubisoft's oh so glorious Vaas Montenegro had a combined total screentime of 15 minutes. Yep. Durning your 30+ hours, only 15 minutes will be spent looking at or listening to Vaas. It's like buying a movie ticket to go and see Fight Club just to end up watching A Good Day to Die Hard.· The missions are repetetive beyond believe. Save this person, do this for that guy, kill these guys. The sidemissions exist largely of racing- and huntingmissions, both equally boring after the first time. The only enjoyable mission -- spoiler warning, again -- was the one where you had to burn marijuanafield with a flamethrower to a raggae-dubstep beat. If only there were more original missions like those.· The character development is so unbelievable it feels parodic at times. You go from a party-going teenager to a hipster Rambo that is able to murder hundreds of experienced soldiers in a few hours.· There's no real reason to craft anything. Health syringes are useless if you have upgraded your manual healing skill that'll automatically heal you when you're out of syringes (by bandaging your scratched arm when you fall or pulling out a bullet when a tiger attacks you. Yeah...) Your wallet can only hold a certain amount of money, so maybe crafting a larger wallet would be usefull. But why do so if climbing all the radio towers will basically get you all the weapons for free?The Visuals:· The overal graphics are very nice, from detailed textures to great lighting, but the shadows were so overdone it almost felt cartoonish.Final verdict:· High expectations, even higher promises, and ultimately you get an avarage repetetive shooter. Far Cry 3 is the best example of how Ubisoft spends more time hyping and advertising than polishing what could have been a much better product. 6/10 "

												What a massive game this is. Huge islands to explore with just too many sidequests. You can just run/drive/fly around and do nothing or you can; hunt animals, craft items, free settlements, find relics and other secrets, take over radio towers, do some trials and a whole lot of other activities and (side)quests. It's seemingly endless and completing the entire game will take you probably well over 50 hours. Now that's some value right there.The graphics are just gorgeous, no matter what settings you use. You can't make this game look bad, you just can't. The animations and models are some of the best I've seen in a game. Wow. The same thing applies to the sounds and voice acting, which is brilliant and truly convincing.While doing the story and sidequests you'll earn XP to upgrade your skills. There are 3 skilltrees in total and the way you play the game is entirely up to you. The Shark skilltree will let you upgrade your assault and healing skills, while the Heron tree will help you with your sniper skills and speed and finally, the Spider tree will let you focus on your stealth and survival skills. There's no right way to play this. There are many ways to complete an objective. And that's what makes Far Cry 3 fun, but not necessarily unique.However, there aren't many FPS that give you this much freedom, while telling a realistic, focused, story at the same time. So I take my hat off to Ubisoft for creating this masterpiece. The commercial and critical success for this game is well deserved.Let this be a lesson - and example - for future first person shooters. Hooray for Far Cry 3 ![Rating: 92/100]			"

												This game is amazing with a great story, amazing visuals and really good shooting mechanics.Gameplay-The shooting mechanics in this game are brilliant. The guns feel very nice to use and there are a lot of different types to use. Enemies can shoot through thin walls which is both realistic and amazing, and cover is done really well too. If you hide behind something you can aim down the sights and you will lean out or fire over the top. Scattered across the map are radio towers and enemy strongholds. Radio towers are useld like veiwpoints in Assassins Creed, where you have to go to the top and trigger an animation to be able to veiw that area on the map. Another bonus to these is that you get some really nice veiws from the top. Unlocking radio towers unlocks free weapons in stores, so you never have to pay a large amount for a gun. Enemy Strongholds can be taken out by lots of different ways, stealthily stabbing everyone, sniping all the pirates or just running in all guns blazing (which is likely to get you killed).There are several different vehicles in the game to get you from A to B. They are really fun and feel nice to drive with a keyboard and the handling is very arcade-y. There are also 3 types of boat and handgliders scattered across the map for fun transport. Enemies and friendlies will patrol in these as well and some really fun situations can emerge where you find an enemy roadblock and try to run from it, only to be pursued by two cars filled with pirates.The first part of the game is very survivaly as you are unequipped and have low health. Hunting and crafting are used to improve your equipment and skills are used to improve yourself, such as adding more health, not running out of stamina and being able to hold your breath under water for a lot longer.I would reccomend playing on hard or very hard difficulty otherwise the game just becomes too easy within about an hour.The Map-The first half of the story takes place on an absolutely stunning jungle island. It is absolutely huge and is covered with stuff to find. Temples, outposts and caves dill the map with stuff to do. The second half of the game is located on an island about a kilometre south that is made up of mountains and to me, wasn't as impressive. It was still very good but there just wasn't as much stuff on it to do but the outposts and enemies there are a lot more challenging, so that's fun.Story/Missions-The story missions ranged form burning fields of weed with a flamethrower to shooting pirates to exploring ancient tombs in search of a treasure. The characters are really well written and the voice acting is brilliant. After completing the game there are still many side missions to do aswell as hunting activities and bounty quests. However, one of the biggest problems with the game becomes apparent during the missions, the checkpointing. Sometimes it is fine but other times you will die and be reset to 5 minutes earlier, that becomes annoying.AI-The AI is very good, especially on the higher difficulties. They react to sounds and their dead bodies and don't just look for you for ten seconds and then stop, they will keep on searching. Also, they don't just follow paths, their movement seems very dynamic and don't patrol a small area on a repeated loop.Graphics and Sound-On a GTX 760, intel i5 4690 3.5GHz and 8GB RAM, I get about 60FPS in 1080p and everything at ultra, apart from a few things which are at high. The game is beautiful and colourful and the FOV goes all the way up to 110, which is better than most games (ahem Skyrim). The sound is brilliant aswell and the way enemies react to sounds feels real. If htey hear a gunshot they will search in the direction it came from to find it. All weapons have a unique sound that is very luad, like a gun should be, unlike other games where an assualt rifle sounds like a cough.Overall-The game is amazing and really fun. The checkpointing is the only real issue I have with it but otherwise it is brilliant. "

Not as hard as Far Cry 2 IMO...Side quests get boring really quickly (like in previous Far Cry games), deliver A to B, kill  this thing here, take over enemy base etc and nothing new. They refuse to evolve from Far Cry 1 and 2 and  just stuck the same content, just a different layout scheme.Personally get Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, it might shorter, but it's much MUCH! more fun to play with all the 80's retro film gimmicks about.

												It's like they took the new Tomb Raider and mixed with the first Far Cry. It's a little on the easy side but it's still very fun.As far as co-op is concerned, expect a network error that crashes your game just as you are about to finish any map.  Other than that, it's mindless fun.			"

												(Scroll down for Pros and Cons) 82 hours and one of my most played games on Steam (I have over 220), it is amazing. Far Cry 4 will be similar, and I know everything about it so far. If you like FPS, adventure, open-world, fun, b00bs, guns, parties, Co-Op (unfortunately not open-world, but WILL be in 4), and games worth your money, you found the right one!Pros:-The enviroment. A huge map and probably my favorite open-world game, ever! The second part of the map opens after half way through the game. While the enviroment isn't as detailed as Far Cry 4's will be, it's still an amazing treat.-The graphics. They look the best for 2012. 'Nuf said.-The characters. Interesting and awesome (especially Vaas, in my top 3 favorite villians of all time) and a story that will keep you interested even after the game is over!-The weapons and cars. While there is no flyable helicopters (Which there will be one in Far Cry 4 called the Gyrocopter), the cars are varied with random encounters with Pirates (Grunts) down the street. The boats are awesome and that comes to our next pro.-Hunting and Scavenging. In Far Cry 3 you can hunt animals (don't worry, they're virtual and not real) and pick flowers. With animals, you can make upgrades, like more holsters for guns, ammo pouches, and sick stuff. With picking flowers, you can make ""medicene"" (drugs) which boost things in combat, hunting, and health.-Co-op and Multiplayer. They didn't stop with the Singleplayer, and it still would have been an amazing game, just look at my hours! (86+ hours) Unfortunately, the Co-op is linear but a nice touch, and the Multiplayer isn't just stapled on. They have a cool decoding system and Battle Cries, which are very helpful. It gives a lot more teamwork than Call of Duty ever would.-B00bs. You probably say Nudity on the Rating, but how could I not put this in? Seriously?-$30.00. You've got to pick up this game for that price, no matter what kind of gamer you are!-Mini-games. From Throwing Knives to hunting Legendary Animals, there is some Minigame for you!Cons:-No Open-World Co-op. There will be Open-World Co-op in Far Cry 4, which I can't wait for. My biggest con.-The enviroments are a little empty in some places, which it will be fixed in Far Cry 4.-No Elephants or the Gyrocopter, until Far Cry 4.-No worth-while DLC. (Besides Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and for $15.00 you should pick up if you like this game!)-When it ends. Great choices at the end you can pick from and I loved the game.Rating (Non-Bias):9.5/10-Bad-A$$ Seal of Approval (Even Angry Joe gave it one and a 9/10!)Rating for Hardcore Far Cry Fans:9.8/10-Bad-A$$ Seal of Approval (Even Angry Joe gave it one and a 9/10!)They're just missing the Open-World Co-op with a friend.P.S: You might recognize me, that's because I currently have the 8th most Top Rated Guide of Far Cry 3 (It's called ""Far Cry 3 Ultimate Guide"")! I'm so glad the community could be there all these years to meet that goal! I am accepting requests to add things to the Ultimate guide.			"

												Amazing open world first person shooter with survival elements implemented.The vegetation is dense and well-detailed. The vehicles are varied and feel satisfying to drive.The Co-op multiplayer, however, is completely different to the hunting-survival-like single player.Co-op gameplay reminds me of Left 4 Dead (but without the zombies). You and 3 friends run and gun your way through set paths blasting and shooting absolutely everything in your way. There are even mini-games where you compete against your friends to get the most points.It's a bit different from the single player, and can provide a breath of fresh air if you are bored of sneaking around in the bushes stalking a tiger in order to craft a larger wallet or whatever.The Versus multiplayer is like any other first person multiplayer game- not much to say here apart from there are some playlists which include custom maps made by the community which is a nice addition. (did I forget to mention there's a level editor included with the game?!)Overall, a brilliant game that can fill all your first-person shooter desires.There are some mods online which can tweak your single-player experience to make it more realistic and emphasise the survival aspect of the game, as well as make the weapons more realistic (ie: more deadly).

												Только за то,каким харизматичным и интересным,ярким и злобным,страшным и опасным сделали Ubisoft Вааса Монтенегро,можно поставить твердую 10/10.Очень красивая графика,тропические пейзажи,исследование острова и множество квестов,пусть и однотипных,но тем не менее интересных. К каждому персонажу взялись твердо и уверенно. История каждого героя игры интересна. Да,кстати,здесь есть сюжет,причем очень интересный,что бывает редко в наше время. Это единственная игра за последние несколько месяцев,в которую я играл до приобретения в стиме. Затягивает с 1 минуты. Здесь и азарт,и крафтинг,и ""взрывоопасная"" стрельба,и исследование острова,и борьба со злобными хищниками. Хочешь выжить,сражайся,исследуй,выживай. Как по мне,это Игра Года 2012. 10/10.			"

												Far Cry 3 is a game that takes place in Rook Island, which is divided into North Island and South Island. You begin the game as Jason Brody, an American tourist who is vacationing with his friends looking for fun on this tropical paradise. Things go wrong when pirates kidnap them for the purpose of selling them into slavery. You encounter a leader named Vaas Montenegro, who makes life a living hell for you and your friends. Later you’ll run into another nasty guy in the name of Hoyt Volker, who lives in the South Island has more powerful pirates protecting him.Jason may seem like an ordinary guy, but you can make him quite powerful using the skill tree system. There is plenty to explore, including the plant life, the animal life, and the numerous outposts controlled by the pirates. You will also get to know the Rakyat, the natives of the island and you will learn their traditions as you progress through the story. The story missions are interesting and well-scripted, but the most exciting part of the game is being able to freely explore the island when not working on a story mission. The world has plenty of randomness such as shootouts between the Rakyat and the pirates. Other times you will see animals attacking the Rakyat. On some occasions you will see animals like bears, tigers, and leopards attacking the Rakyat tribe. On other occasions you will see tigers or bears stalking boars. Sometimes the predatory animals will come after you and you will have to kill them in order to survive. Other times you see a pack of dogs with one howling like a wolf. You look around to see if these animals are stalking you.There can be benefits to killing animals in the game. After killing them you can skin them in order to craft bigger wallets to hold more cash and craft loot rucksacks to carry more leaves and loot recovered from containers and dead bodies. Liberating outposts requires you to kill all pirates guarding them so that they can be your safehouse. The game rewards you more for using stealth than for going all out on a shootout against the pirates. Each outpost contains alarm panels near the flags representing the outposts that pirates can use to call reinforcements should they find you. But you can shoot out the alarm panels to eliminate the possibility of reinforcements. The sniper rifle comes in very handy when trying to liberate outposts. I would shoot a few pirates and find a place to hide by hiding behind rocks and in the foliage. The XP gained from liberating outposts is used to develop Jason in different ways. This is the RPG element of Far Cry 3. There really no wrong skill to learn because all the skills are useful in some way. You can learn to take down an enemy from behind using the brutally effective machete. Then you can learn to take down an enemy by taking one down from behind and throwing the machete immediately to take down a nearby enemy without alerting others. Liberated outposts offer side missions such as assassinations and hunting animals both common and rare. You have to complete assassinations by using your brutal knife, so using any other weapon will result in mission failure. This is in line with Rakyat tradition that you will learn to respect in Rook Island. The hunting of animals requires you to first stop by a site to pick up a weapon designated for hunting the animals. Using any other weapon will result in mission failure. The hunting of rare animals is rather interesting because the skinning of these animals will help you craft larger wallets, larger ammo pouches, larger loot rucksacks, larger syringe kits, etc. So hunting and crafting go hand in hand and will help you throughout your exploration of the island.Whether you’re hunting, crafting, searching for relics or lost letters from dead WWII Japanese soldiers or progressing through the main story, Far Cry 3 is rarely boring. You can unscramble radio towers throughout the island to make your map clearer to read and to help Rakyat supply lines. As soon as you kill deactivate a radio tower, you will have a supply drop side mission available. Supply drops require you to drop medical supplies within a certain time limit. This type of side mission lets you know how treacherous driving can be in Rook Island. It also can get a little repetitive. In my opinion, the supply drops side missions are the most tedious in the game.There are many vehicles that you can drive, but driving on the roads can feel a bit awkward. Driving boats and watercraft can be a lot of fun while exploring the gameworld by sea. You can navigate from one place to another by ziplining, which is more fun from a first-person view than I expected. It’s cool to zipline, get to drop down on a pirate, and brutally stab him at the same time. There are hang gliders scattered throughout the island that you can use to reach faraway places or hard to reach areas.In the original Far Cry you could use binoculars to tag enemies you see in the distance. Far Cry 2 removed that feature to make it more realistic. Far Cry 3 has brought back the ability to tag enemies in the distance, so you will be able to see enemies through walls after tagging them. Weapons would eventually wear down in Far Cry 2, so you had to replace them. In Far Cry 3 weapons never wear down from use and you can upgrade them using the built-in store in each safehouse for a price. Some weapons can be upgraded by using attachments such as a sniper scope, a laser sight, or a silencer. Some weapons can also be customized by painting them in a variety of colors that are available in the built-in store.The AI in the game is very good, as you will see enemies react to dead bodies. They will automatically go into search mode in an attempt to find you. They will try to flank you if they detect you or they can hide behind objects such as rocks and shacks. They enemies work as a team when trying to find you and kill you.The graphics of Far Cry 3 have very impressive textures and make Rook Island look alive. The animals are incredibly detailed and so are the skies whether it’s sunny or raining. The details of the faces of the Vaas and Hoyt look amazingly realistic as do the faces of the pirates.Without trying to spoil the end of the game, I will only say that there are two endings. Each ending leaves you with moral choices to contemplate. The story missions are somewhat linear, but having two possible endings for the game makes it more entertaining.In my opinion, Far Cry 3 is the best in the Far Cry series. The other two Far Cry games emphasized an open gameworld, but Far Cry 3 is the most open gameworld and the random encounters really help this game. The randomness ensures that the result of approaching an outpost will never be the same each time. You may infiltrate an outpost on your own only to be interrupted by a predatory animal such as a bear, tiger, or leopard. Sometimes, your attempt to liberate an outpost is thwarted by a jeep filled with pirates. Far Cry 3 is a classic action game that I highly recommend to anyone.			"

Good stuff: * Open World* Storry is good,* Gameplay great* Missions Ok* Interesting and memorable characters* it has stealth elementsBad stuff:* Controls, they complicated controls a lot, the simple stuff like movement is ok, but when you want to do takedowns, consume stuff, you need to hold the keys instead of short press. and in a lot of cases you do stuff that you dont want to, for example, i want to do a takedown and move back. but instead moving, i drag the body* I dont like the voice of the main character :D his voice is sometimes too girly and his friends/family are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s :D* Some minor bugs in game.* huge problem is the uplay, that is required. i would preffer steam.Overall the game is fun, and i would recommend it to others. :)			"

												Far Cry 3 is another incredible game in its series. With stunning graphics and an immersive story which really makes you feel one with the game.It's also very well optimized, meaning random FPS drops are almost never if not at all.The multiplayer is rather empty now, and the Co-op doesn't live up to the single player campaign. But the games you do find are always fun and guarnteed to be worth it.The campaign's pure length is more than enough to make up for the lacking multiplayer...And is easily replayable and enjoyanle.Moving on. Some none essential characters during cutscenes have slightly poor sound and animation. But it really should not be something to put you off the game.I would more than recommend this game to people with a good gaming rig. My nVidia GTX 660 plays Far Cry 3 on ultra very well, and the regions of a 640-650 should be able to run it on medium-high settings at decent framerates.			"

												SPOILER ALERT!I have to grudgingly recommend this because of the excellent stealth gameplay and realistic level design, despite uplay and one of the stupidest plots ever written for a video game. Some highlights:Our protagonist meets his friend, who has an escape plan:""How will we escape?""""We found a boat!""""Awesome!""""A broken boat.""""I... uh... guess you could fix it...""""A broken boat in a cave at the top of a mountain.""""What?""""A cave with no boat-sized exits...""""Seriously?""""...or any nearby water.""(long pause)""How many of those pills did you take?""""Eleventy?""""Yeah, that's what I thought...""Our protagonist meets up with Buck, who has been sending him to uncover ancient lost tombs:""Listen, Buck. The last two times you sent me to a 'lost' tomb, it was filled with pirates. Not centuries-old ghost pirates - the normal kind. And when I got there, you were already there waiting for me. I'd guess that both you and every pirate on the island already knows where the stupid tomb is. So instead of using this magic stone compass thing, why don't we try looking for the tomb on a tourist map first?""Our protagonist meets up with Buck one last time:""Hey Buck""""Hey, Snow White. I'm here to betray you.""""That was incredibly obvious. Do you realize that I'm holding a small arsenal?""""Yep.""""...and that I killed like 200 dudes on the way here?""""Yep.""""...and that all you have is a dull antique knife, and you're standing on the other side of the room?""""Yep.""""Then why tell me?""""Because you can't shoot me during a cutscene.""""Touche.""Our protagonist meets a deep cover agent:""Hey I've got a plan to kill Hoyt.""""Hit me.""""First we'll bring you to his private office and introduce you to him. You'll try to get a job working for him, and after we've earned his trust we'll get you an invitation to one of his poker games. You can kill him when you're alone with him at the game.""""Wait... this plan starts with meeting Hoyt alone, then follows an elaborate set of steps so we can... uh... meet with Hoyt alone?""""Exactly.""""I can't think of a problem with that. Let's go.""Our protagonist is presented with a moral choice at the end of the game:""Jason, you must choose to leave the island with your friends, or kill them and stay here with me.""""You want me to do what to my friends?""""Kill them.""""Sorry, I thought you said kill them.""""I did.""""Not even if you weren't obviously a psychopath. Nobody would kill their friend for no reason. Actually, nobody would even have lifted the knife to her throat unless a cutscene made them do it. Why would you even include this as an option? Seriously, who thought this ending was worthy of occupying space on my hard disk? Hold on a second. Let me Google this.""Jason puts down the knife and pulls out his phone.""Wait..."" he giggles ""the main writer thought this plot was clever? Oh my goodness."" he starts laughing ""the guy thinks that he's subverting video game cliches by just retelling them in the most literal way? Hahaha. Oh this is good. He said in an interview that he thinks we should be looking for deeper meanings rather than just saying 'I get it. That was dumb.' That would be like looking for deeper meanings in Earnest Goes to Camp. He honestly thinks critics hate this plot because we only half-listened to it, not because we understood it and think it's idiotic.""Jason ghasps for breath and wipes a tear from his eye.Citra stares at him for a moment. ""So... uh... are you going to kill your friends?""""No, but thanks for the laughs.""""Wait! What will you do now?""""Steal some cars and sneak into a bunch more heavily armed compounds because - honestly? That's a riot.""Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here "

												There are some different angles to look at this game. It's not a brilliant, that's for sure, but I can't tell exactly, is it good or bad.Certainly, pros overcome cons, but cons aren't that small issue to negate them completely, as I do with games I'm really in love with.I start from good side: Far Cry 3 is a complete adventure at some tropical islands, where you have to (and have might to) overcome cluster♥♥♥♥, and take a life under control. Dream of so many people. Great story plot, quite comparable with Cameron's ""Avatar"" movie.As a game, first-player-view shooter with some ""gaining new abilities with experience"" (RPG-elements)... It looks good, it allows to move as you please on large and full of life archipelago, and, most needed, it allows you to shoot people (and other things) when and how you want to - which is much clever, than usual ""narrow corridor bang-bang run"" ala Call of Duty series.As an inheritor of Far Cry 2, it washed away bigger part of boredom, reason, why so many people turned predecessor down. Far Cry 3 is an open-world game, where you may actually like sub-quests and spend ""a little more"" time than you have to beat story line.But... there are cons part.First of all, oh precious realism, makers of Far Cry 3 most definetely casted it away. Some American boy found himself trigger-happy - that is one thing. But, that boy, cutting throats and sneaking to clear an avanpost silently all by himself... ""Ne veriy"" (Don't believe it) - Stanislavsky would say. Secondly, I don't like Jason Brody (protagonist) for one bit. Not a golden boy from prologue, not a rambo-like gut-cutter he evolved. All that story 'bout ""insanity"" make me sick. So, if I'd believe my ""nature instincts"", like game asks me to at start, I'd through it away. It's way Hollywood-and-plush, ""Hunger games"" on good bones of ""Battle Royale"".For game itself (gameplay process). It looks nice, but Just Cause 2 (released 3 years ago) looks greater and sharper, in terms of visual quality. As for game balance, in sandbox conditions - they have to lock key characters in buildings and scripts. Othervise, everyone will end up killed by varans and cassowary. About rambo-ing. Sure, I can silently clean an outpost, spend time to look for patrol routine, calculate lines-of-sight for every soldier on it... But why do that? Without any reconnaissance I can rush forward, and kill all of them (armed with AK's, SVD's and probably some machine-guns and RPG-7) face-to-face, with my machete and shotgun. On hardiest setting possible. On quarter or less time than silent approach. Talking 'bout realism again.Finally, for comparison with Far Cry 2, I'd say, yeah, they cut boring parts with respawnable avanposts, replace some of ""dogs of war"" realistic stuff with more hollywood-like decorations, very dramatic, of course, but edged teeth of action-stuff-fans up to zero.There are other lesser flaws, like stupid bow and driving-worse-than-in-farcry2, but I don't want to dig deeper.Overall, game is big, sometimes even fun and clever, game have catchy moments, but even then it has that ""seen it before"" scratch of second-hand cloth. Definetely NOT a must-buy. Take it at some discount, if you up to FPS games and don't fall to all that marketing crap already - or don't bother at all, it's not all that good. Total mark - 6,66/10PS: multiplayer and co-op features could have been a bigger win, but they are too glitchy, too narrow-viewed. Look at Battlefield, for much better online experience.			"

												Far Cry 3 is a first person shooter that takes its inspiration from movies like The Beach. You are an adventurer stranded on an island of criminals, corporate mercenaries, pirates, profiteers, tribal folk and misfits.A huge sandbox map with a variety of challenges: from hunting animals and finding treasure, to side missions and of course the main mission. The islands offers plenty of land to explore, great missions and colourful environments. The character handles nicely and has some enjoyable abilities, like stealth, hang-gliding, swimming and sliding across the dirt. It has an adequate multi-player aspect and the element of stealth makes this rather enjoyable.One of the things I love about this game is the locale: the NPCs look great, conveying a Pacific Islander culture in a way that is virtually unseen in video games - their tattoos, their look and their New Zealand(ish) / Moari-flavoured accents are a rare thing in a culture dominated by US flavoured action adventure (there is a strong feeling of authenticity about the islander culture, even though it's explored through the filter of Western assumptions). I'd like to see more of this cultural diversity in games - we have a great diversity of humanity and it is not explored often enough in games. The culture represented in this game is a refreshing change from the Americana or Americana as viewed through a sci-fi / aliens / African American criminals lens. Far Cry 3 could probably have been improved by making the protagonist a non-US citizen. This issue of cultural adventuring alone has  me currently savouring every moment of awesomeness that is the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. universe. Just the cultural setting alone makes Far Cry 3 an outstanding adventure. But it is also highly playable, which is the bottom line in gaming.I really like this game, the variety of weapons and vehicles, the tropical locale, the characters... although the treasure hunting gets a little tedious. So near to completion, and I've stalled because of the small amount of treasure left that I still have to get to. I look forward to finishing the game all the same, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting and pacy adventure.			"

												Very thrilling main storyline and thick atmosphere for an open world game. Unfortunately, the exploring part of the game falls pretty flat - apart from some rather pointless artifacts there isn't much treasure to be found on the island. Still, one of the better single player shooters out there.			"

												SUPER immersive and fun gameStory is absolutely great (not exactly believeable but good nontheless) and characters were humorous and for the most part well developed. Incredibly beautiful tropical islands; you get to kill enemies by stealth, swim, cause explosions, burn everything in sight, dive, hang glide, drive cars then destroy them, and skydive. Crafting is very basic and easy to remember; gameplay and mechanics are fluid. Only a few slight frustrations, such as difficulty with takedown menus prompting.Do not pick the 2nd choice for the last chapter or you will be disappointed.			"

												Great open world game, it is beautiful and offers you to be free in you playstyle.Stealth is however better rewarded. You are free to go where-ever you want, whenever you want.This is great for those that like to max out and go exploring before questing.Not everything is positive:Once you enter a mission zone, you can not get out again and The Force keeps you from dropping in from the sky.The escape routes are also predetermined when they do not need to be, to make sense.The last main story quests up until the cutscene were poorly written however.

												I've been a Far Cry fan since the first one came out for the PC and I consider that one to be one of best shooters of all time. The Xbox versions were also great so I was really stoked for Far Cry 2. I have to say I was very dissapointed with that entry in the franchise. The idea for it was great but it suffered from some minor but crucial flaws mainly due to the whole open world scheme, which didn't work so well in my opinion, in a franchise that established itself as being a great straightforward (but strategic) FPS.So, as you would guess, when I heard Far Cry 3 was keeping the same formula was the previous one, I didn't get very excited for it. I tried it out for just thirty minutes and thank god I was wrong. Everything about this game is great. Puts together the over the top action of the first games with a more refined open world aproach of Far Cry 2. This game works well in so many ways. Even when you finish all the main and secundary missions you will be wanting for more. And the game will definitely give you more of what you want. As you can tell, I didn't go alot into detail on this review, but there's no need for it. Trust me, play it. It goes down for as one of the best, if not the best, games of 2012.			"

												Highly Reccomended. This game is worth every penny you pay for it. The story is engrosing, the combat is varied in nature and well executed. And more than any other game I've played, it balances a sandbox and story focused game. I find the missions and story to be nearly equally enjoyable. However, the game is let down by one thing.                                                                                          *SPOILER ALERT* One of the most interesting villians in gaming history, Vaas, is killed off about half way through in a lazy (but cool looking) QTE-style boss fight, and replaced by a fairly token rich evil man. In future, more Vaas, less Hoyt (Whose name I had to google, he's quite forgettable.)Edit: Uplay is terrible. That is all.			"

												Far Cry 3 is beyond any doubt an amazing game and an experience that mustn't be missed, even with it's flaws.The graphics, ambience and voice acting are all amazing and makes this game one of the most asthetically pleasing titles in recent years, however as a result Far Cry 3 is pretty demanding in the hardware department. So make sure your gear is up to speed and optimize it for maximum performance. The gameplay has been referred to in the past as ""Skyrim with guns"". This is true, Far Cry 3 puts the player in the heart of a tropical paradise plagued with drug-running pirates and gives them the opportunity to go about as they please: Exploring areas, fighting off skirmishes and collecting items. However unlike Skyrim the primary story isn't completely optional, with constant reminders appearing on your screen to go here or do that while out experiencing the island for yourself makes you feel like a dog in an off-lease park; yes you are free in a sense but you're still not in total control of your experience.To further add the sensation of ""freedom with boundaries"", Far Cry 3's story is very restrictive in comparison with the exploration. During a mission you are forced to use this one specific weapon, drive this one specific vehicle, do this objective in precisely this particular way, go here within the alloted time; the list goes on. Adding unpredictable restrictions to the story makes the player feel like a ball and chain has been shackled to their ankle, which does no favors to the overall experience of the game. However, when you are allowed to play your way, Far Cry 3 really shines through. Plotting out ambushes on fortified outposts or joyriding across the island running over whatever gets in your way is a blast through-and-through, made even better by a large variety of destructive weaponry ranging from grenade launchers, RPGs and even flamethrowers. The story of Far Cry 3 is simple, you take on the role of Jason Brody, a rich white boy who loves hair product. While you and your friends are on a drunken binge in exotic places you're all kidnapped by a band of pirates looking to ransom you and then sell you off to slavery. Jason manages to escape and begins his adventure to rescue his friends and kill the bad guy and get the girl. To be frank, the story isn't all that great. Jason Brody and all his friends are shallow and dislikeable, and I'd much rather shoot them all in the mouth than risk my life to save them. In contrast, antagonists in the game are interesting and imaginative and save Far Cry 3's story from being dullard. Vaas Montenegro, the most well established villian is similar to the Joker from Batman: Arkham Asylum, he's psychotic, unpredictable, imaginative and fun to watch. Far Cry 3's combat is split into two categories: Stealth and shoot-em-up, and both are well-made and flow well into eachother as the situation requires. Jumping into foliage when not in combat makes it so enemies cannot see you, allowing you to plan out your attacks or to play venus fly trap and lure them to you by throwing rocks before jumping out and puncturing them with a knife takedown. The takedowns are a very satisfying insta-kill against unarmored enemies (and can be used against heavy foes later in the game after acquiring a perk) so long as you take them by suprise, and with unlockable perks takedowns become even more versatile and deadly by either pulling the pin off a grenade of the freshly deceased or going for multi chain stabs. On the other side of the combat spectrum the guns and shooting mechanics are satisfying and have a good healthy punch to them. Unfortunately the combat indulges in one of video game design's bad habits, Quick-Time Events, prominently when fighting carniferous wildlife like aligators and sharks. You're swimming across a river when SURPRISE GATOR SEX comes up, then you're given half a second to mash a specific button before you die. QTEs are a bad mechanic in video games and while they're not too prominent in Far Cry 3 they still feel unecessary on the whole. Finally the worst part of the combat is the battles against the main antagonists like Vaas or Buck, both of them being such hostile albeit savourably enjoyable characters you'd think the fight would be memorable, right? Wrong. When fighting them the game designers decide to put you and your foe into a sort of drug-trip combat sequence that makes no sense and is incongruious to the rest of the game, followed by a series of QTEs taking control away from you for the sake of trying to make the encounter more cinematic. This resulted in final struggles that were disappointing and left a very sour aftertaste. So in all, Far Cry 3 is a game with flaws, but they don't drag it all the way down. Far Cry 3 is fun, addicting and worth the time (especially if you got it while it's on sale). I suggest you look past it's flaws and let the overall experience take you in.Also before I close off I need to mention: Far Cry 3 also has an online multiplayer, which only exists for the purpose of having an online multiplayer. It's unimaginative deathmatch and is not anything special.			"

Also in transition of areas (quicktavel/just going somewhere) when new data is being loaded.During seven hours played it crashed 12 times. The bad thing is you what you find if you google these bugs.

												Great FPS, decent and interesting story (hard to come by these days), great realism.  Has an AK that feels as powerful as the one in real life. Lots of sandbox aspects that make the replayability pretty good.  Choose your own approach to your enemies. Lots of mini-games and mini-quests to spice things up and keep it interesting.  Same as far-cry 1 and 2 really, big island with lots of uncharted territory that you seek to destroy and control.  Unlike facry2, guard posts do not respawn and once you control a zone of the map your allies patrol it instead of the enemy. Read in a review that you can't save the game manually, that it only autosaves, but this isn't true, you can press ESC>Save to save at any time. Don't know what all the complaining is about with Uplay, it hasn't given me any problems whatsoever.  Yes you have to register and log in with Uplay but that's pretty much all you have to do.  Then it's just play and don't worry about it.  It gave me some concern about this purchase but I suspected it was just trendy little sheeple regurgitating things that they say to one another, and I was right. Good deal, especially at $8.  Would recommend.  "

												This is a game that is completely out of my own radar. I was not a big fan of the setup but I assure you as soon as I started the story, I could not stop. It was fun seeing a tiger rampage through a village and eventually slaughtering them and it was even more fun burning weed with a flamethrower. Again this is completely out of the ordinary for me to play a game like Far Cry and I sure as hell don't regret it one bit. Multiplayer was boring and side missions were not engaging for me. So I recommend anyone not used to the genre to go for the story and you will enjoy it.			"

There is no way to turn off head-bob, and increasing FOV doesn't really help - running results in a queazy barfy feeling.

												Far Cry 3 succeeds like its predecessors in providing an open world action / thriller set in a tropical climate.  Like similar games such as GTA and Batman: AC, the current objective is shown on the map... there are side missions and mini-games that can be unlocked and played at will.  Portions of the map details are hidden until radio towers are ""unlocked"" by scaling them and sabotaging the fuse box.  Weapons and skills are steadily unlocked as progress is made in both the main story line, collecting hidden treasures, and completing various other tasks.  Thrown in for good measure are hunting and crafting, and a completely separate and very challenging co-op campaign.On the plus side:> The world is beautiful and nicely detailed.> The story is quite good and features one of the best antagonists in any video game I have ever played.> The weapons look, feel, and sound excellent.> The stronghold raids and ""kill nasty dude x"" side missions are the meat of the game and very entertaining, with many ways to approach them> The takedown skills are challenging to apply and fun when they work.> An excellent PC port with all the graphical and control flourish we expect.On the negative side:> The game ramps up too quickly... I found myself proceeding at a reasonable pace, and by act 2 I was becoming overpowered... this along with another mechanic in act 2 makes the second act seem anti-climactic.> On the same vein, the first act Boss feels more threatening than the second.  He also was such a good character I was disappointed that he was dead.  Can he have his own game, please?> The native peoples character models are too similar.> The world does not feel ""lived in""... it feels more like an action game set piece.  There is also very little variation in the game world.> There is very little incentive to continue exploring after the game ends.The co-op campaign is very difficult... you will want at least 3 players for that.  I bought the game on sale on steam for $5... was it worth it? Yes absolutely.  I would say $20 is reasonable for this since I got nearly 40 hours of entertainment out of it.8/10 "

												Uplay just ruined the game for me. I bought the game in Steam, installed Uplay, made a Uplay account, logged in once - then was told that I have to download the game again? So is said f### it, shut it off, and went to sleep. Since then all Uplay servers have been ""unavailble"" when ever I try to log in....Hey Ubisoft I just wanted to play a great game and now I can't because you've crammed DRM down my throat. Not cool, if you keep forcing DRM on people you'll just push more people to pirate your games rather than buy them and you'll end up like Sony - forever bleeding money like a dying whale.

												Far Cry 3 is my current favorite game. Throughout the course of the game you learn the importance of stealth, resources, allies, and enemies. The only complaint I have is the co-op mission glitches that make it hard to invite your friends sometimes. With that in mind, the story itself is very entertaining and well put together. In a way, I would like to say the game is realistic, because once you zone out after playing it for a few hours, you get really intense and into it. The graphics are pretty great a good majority of the time, but my laptop isn't exactly prepared for me to have all the graphics up in ""high"". If you like first person shooter games with a story/theme, I'd definitely recommend this one!			"

												A terrific game... ruined by UPlay. In addition to the autosave problem that goes haywire if my internet isn't stable enough thanks to UPlay, , the save file error actually corrupted my C Drive files and rendered it unstable. Luckily, I got to scan and fix my C Drive and did a system restore, but such glitches should not happen thanks to multiple DRMs required to activate to even launch this game, that sprouts only more technical issues that could have totally been avoided had I purchased the actual disc. Sadly disappointed by this, and I don't dare to open this game again, in risk of ruining my harddrive again.Thanks a lot, UPlay. You ruined a game for me on Steam.			"

												A game that might be a satire on the disconnect between the events of a game and the story it's trying to tell. If that sounds too pretentious to you, it's also a brilliant FPS that sets you loose on an island full of awesome weapons, predator beasts, jeeps, boats, hangliders, tons of blood-thirsty enemies, and Vaas the lovable pirate king.

												Beautiful graphics are just not enough to turn this game around. These are the positives: responsive controls with customizable keyboard configuration that actually works (funny that I have to call that out, but many games execute this poorly), good graphics, and a large, often interesting area to explore. If that's enough for your gaming experience, then this is the game for you. If you like multiplayer, also, this is a great setting. However...If you want a good single-player game, unfortunately, Far Cry 3 also has these things that I have to put in the negative column: really, really annoying major and minor characters (including the main character Jason, who must be the all-time worst ever created for a shooter - bad, whiny voice acting combined with no redeeming values), an awkward game interface for controlling inventory and crafting (obviously designed entirely for clunky consoles), endless messages popping up on the screen to tell you things that you already know or don't care about, poorly executed ""big game hunting"" that is both cartoonish and annoying, and worst of all: every major villain must be dealt with in some kind of ""alternate-reality"" setting that seems to be happening in the unlit hallways at Ubisoft. Note to game designers: every time you move someone abruptly out of the game world you have been carefully creating for them for the last dozen hours, you ruin the immersive experience. Boss fight with Vaas? Lame. Boss fight with the weird Australian guy? Lame. Boss fight with Hoyt? Lame. Boss fight with the giant island demon thingy? WTF? Lame. Half-way into this game I absolutely lost any interest at all in how it would turn out and finished it entirely so I could expunge my disappointment by shooting a few more pirates. I give this game a 5 out of 10.  "

												This game deliveres only some of it's hype. It is wonderful to drive around the vast islands and enjoy  random little events happening. On the other hand story is so much bull after few first missions that i stuck mainly to side missions when ever possible. This takes away immersion from gameplay as you can't really do missions when you feel like. Worst thing in story is it's black magic mubo jumbo that can't be taken seriously. Whenever drug induced hallusinations or massive power dreams come to play all the realistic feel is drained from game. This makes games atmosphere really sway too much to enjoy. Maby cooperative mode will redeem this game for me, but i won't play story ever again.			"

Crafting is very basic and easy to remember; gameplay and mechanics are fluid.

												Highly Reccomended. This game is worth every penny you pay for it. The story is engrosing, the combat is varied in nature and well executed. And more than any other game I've played, it balances a sandbox and story focused game. I find the missions and story to be nearly equally enjoyable. However, the game is let down by one thing.                                                                                          *SPOILER ALERT* One of the most interesting villians in gaming history, Vaas, is killed off about half way through in a lazy (but cool looking) QTE-style boss fight, and replaced by a fairly token rich evil man. In future, more Vaas, less Hoyt (Whose name I had to google, he's quite forgettable.)Edit: Uplay is terrible. That is all.			"

												Far Cry 3 is beyond any doubt an amazing game and an experience that mustn't be missed, even with it's flaws.The graphics, ambience and voice acting are all amazing and makes this game one of the most asthetically pleasing titles in recent years, however as a result Far Cry 3 is pretty demanding in the hardware department. So make sure your gear is up to speed and optimize it for maximum performance. The gameplay has been referred to in the past as ""Skyrim with guns"". This is true, Far Cry 3 puts the player in the heart of a tropical paradise plagued with drug-running pirates and gives them the opportunity to go about as they please: Exploring areas, fighting off skirmishes and collecting items. However unlike Skyrim the primary story isn't completely optional, with constant reminders appearing on your screen to go here or do that while out experiencing the island for yourself makes you feel like a dog in an off-lease park; yes you are free in a sense but you're still not in total control of your experience.To further add the sensation of ""freedom with boundaries"", Far Cry 3's story is very restrictive in comparison with the exploration. During a mission you are forced to use this one specific weapon, drive this one specific vehicle, do this objective in precisely this particular way, go here within the alloted time; the list goes on. Adding unpredictable restrictions to the story makes the player feel like a ball and chain has been shackled to their ankle, which does no favors to the overall experience of the game. However, when you are allowed to play your way, Far Cry 3 really shines through. Plotting out ambushes on fortified outposts or joyriding across the island running over whatever gets in your way is a blast through-and-through, made even better by a large variety of destructive weaponry ranging from grenade launchers, RPGs and even flamethrowers. The story of Far Cry 3 is simple, you take on the role of Jason Brody, a rich white boy who loves hair product. While you and your friends are on a drunken binge in exotic places you're all kidnapped by a band of pirates looking to ransom you and then sell you off to slavery. Jason manages to escape and begins his adventure to rescue his friends and kill the bad guy and get the girl. To be frank, the story isn't all that great. Jason Brody and all his friends are shallow and dislikeable, and I'd much rather shoot them all in the mouth than risk my life to save them. In contrast, antagonists in the game are interesting and imaginative and save Far Cry 3's story from being dullard. Vaas Montenegro, the most well established villian is similar to the Joker from Batman: Arkham Asylum, he's psychotic, unpredictable, imaginative and fun to watch. Far Cry 3's combat is split into two categories: Stealth and shoot-em-up, and both are well-made and flow well into eachother as the situation requires. Jumping into foliage when not in combat makes it so enemies cannot see you, allowing you to plan out your attacks or to play venus fly trap and lure them to you by throwing rocks before jumping out and puncturing them with a knife takedown. The takedowns are a very satisfying insta-kill against unarmored enemies (and can be used against heavy foes later in the game after acquiring a perk) so long as you take them by suprise, and with unlockable perks takedowns become even more versatile and deadly by either pulling the pin off a grenade of the freshly deceased or going for multi chain stabs. On the other side of the combat spectrum the guns and shooting mechanics are satisfying and have a good healthy punch to them. Unfortunately the combat indulges in one of video game design's bad habits, Quick-Time Events, prominently when fighting carniferous wildlife like aligators and sharks. You're swimming across a river when SURPRISE GATOR SEX comes up, then you're given half a second to mash a specific button before you die. QTEs are a bad mechanic in video games and while they're not too prominent in Far Cry 3 they still feel unecessary on the whole. Finally the worst part of the combat is the battles against the main antagonists like Vaas or Buck, both of them being such hostile albeit savourably enjoyable characters you'd think the fight would be memorable, right? Wrong. When fighting them the game designers decide to put you and your foe into a sort of drug-trip combat sequence that makes no sense and is incongruious to the rest of the game, followed by a series of QTEs taking control away from you for the sake of trying to make the encounter more cinematic. This resulted in final struggles that were disappointing and left a very sour aftertaste. So in all, Far Cry 3 is a game with flaws, but they don't drag it all the way down. Far Cry 3 is fun, addicting and worth the time (especially if you got it while it's on sale). I suggest you look past it's flaws and let the overall experience take you in.Also before I close off I need to mention: Far Cry 3 also has an online multiplayer, which only exists for the purpose of having an online multiplayer. It's unimaginative deathmatch and is not anything special.			"

												Heard very good things. Played first mission. Exploration restriction made me question open world. Got bored. Thought FC3 kinda sucked. Stopped playing.-Months later-Friends bashed me for hating and assured me open world after first mission, so I gave FC3 a second chance, and god thank goodness that I did. I've put in over 50 hours in the past month playing this damn game every day until late at night.The character development is outstanding. Far Cry 3 will mess with your mind as you play as Jason Brody, losing yourself to the wilderness and insanity of the jungle that has one rule and one rule only - kill or be killed.Gameplay is smooth, interactions with the wildlife is vast and extensive (hunting, crafting, climbing vines and towers, harvesting plants, etc.), stealth is amazing, weapons are super fun (knife throwing, flamethrowers, recurve bow, snipers, etc.), additions are wonderful (hang gliding, exploring ruins, collecting artifacts, playing poker, sharpshooting, rakyat challenges, etc.), and so so much more asldkfj The main storyline is stunning and intense, and the side missions indulge you in the stories of the local villages. God, this game. I've never played a game quite like FC3. It's like Skyrim and Fallout 3/NV with a more involved story that will trip you up and make you question your own life. This game has got everything. Even strippers. This game has strippers. 10/10But seriously, this game is as fun, astounding, and riveting as the trailer makes it to be.			"

												A gorgeous game, sandbox-ish game where you are a jungle warrior instead of just having a vacation.I say sandbox-ish, because while you can do other missions and activities than the main story, it feels like it's not that much that you can do and half of it feels the same. That said, this game is certainly not bad. Actually, it's really good.The story goes where your friends, brothers and you go on an exotic, adventurous vacation. What they didn't saw coming was that you all would be captured by swashbuckling pirates who want to sell you for ransom money. That is certainly not what the brochure said...You manage to escape and you have to find and safe your friends and brother.All in all, it's pretty good but it has some flaws of which mostly: Character Progression.The game starts as you, scared and unexperienced. Never killed a man before but the moment you get a weapon in your hands, the main character goes pretty much berserk. While it is understandable that you can't limit the skills of the player, the story doesn't make this progression better and soon you will be the Berserker Warlord of the Jungle.It has potential but it goes just a bit too fast to believe it.Gameplay feels smooth and feels right. From the firefights to the stealth, nothing to really complain there.There really is a bunch to do and terrain to see and it looks damn good.The biggest problem I had with Far Cry 3 is that the Field of View returns to default in cutscenes, making it look like every character is invading your personal space.All in all, a beautiful game with a name story and lots of things to do!

Far Cry 3 was by far my favorite Far Cry game to dateI Played through Far Cry 1, 2 times and loved it, I haven't played much of Far Cry 2 yet.Though I was hoping for a sequal to Far Cry 1 but there was no Trigens to be found but oh well cant have everything right :( StoryThe Storyline was very engaging and the pacing was good. There are some moments when it can start to feel repetitive like getting to the top of each Radio Tower but that's a small detail that can be overlooked. There's lots of side missions to do some unlockable some DLC but all are well worth it and help to extend the gameplay for a few extra hours. If your only interested in the campaign you can just play through it and move on but if you prefer the open world exploration element theres TONS of chests, locations, artifacts, tasks and missions to do to get extra cash and provide you with more play time. CO-OPThere's also a 4 player Co-op campaign which though its not as good as the main campaign its good fun with friends and has some head to head challenges to add a bit of competitiveness to the mix. MultplayerMultiplayer is nothing special, try it out maybe but.... eh9.2/10- My Favorite Far Cry game. 91 hours well spent "

												As irritating as it is to be force to interface with Uplay, I haven't received any significant bugs from it - and wouldn't consider it enough of a deterrant not to buy the game. For its competitive pricetag, it's a very entertaining open world shooter with a cool (albeit somewhat repetitive) physics engine. Plenty of things to do and places to explore which means hours can be spent aside from the main storyline and overall I'd rate the gameplay experience pretty highly. Very pretty game. Good variety of weapons and ways to play. 8/10			"

												One of the best singleplayer experiences I've ever had. Excellent voice acting, incredible animation/accuracy of movement/body language, beautiful environments, interesting story/intriguing premise, super fun gameplay that allows for uniquely unfolding situations/creative solutions...just one of the best games I've ever played. Feels like Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones, and The Goonies all rolled into one. I cannot recommend this game more.			"

												""Far Cry 3"" might be the best shooter of this generation! It has an intense story, great grafics and sounds, believable characters and you can choose your own playstyle. If you want to mow down your enemies with an LMG like Rambo, you can do that. Or, you can be sneaky with a bow an knife and assinate your unaware foes like... Rambo, yeah.Anyway, it's an absolute recommandable FPS experience!			"

												This is a game that is completely out of my own radar. I was not a big fan of the setup but I assure you as soon as I started the story, I could not stop. It was fun seeing a tiger rampage through a village and eventually slaughtering them and it was even more fun burning weed with a flamethrower. Again this is completely out of the ordinary for me to play a game like Far Cry and I sure as hell don't regret it one bit. Multiplayer was boring and side missions were not engaging for me. So I recommend anyone not used to the genre to go for the story and you will enjoy it.			"

												Please only consider buying when you are okay to playing with major bugs that will NOT be fixed Far Cry 3 is great! Wonderful graphics, game mechanics, atmosphere and story.Mess begins if you want to play that wonderful game because it crashes more often than North Korean economy.The game constantly crashes. constantly. it crashes mainly whilest using the inventory (shop/crafting/looting) or saving so you can't play safe and save your progress before doing something. Also in transition of areas (quicktavel/just going somewhere) when new data is being loaded.During seven hours played it crashed 12 times. The bad thing is you what you find if you google these bugs. These bugs are known and discussed in the UBI forums for several months and still UBIsoft does not care to fix them. Because you ♥♥♥♥ing already payed.watch yourselves:google search[www.google.de]Ubi Forum search[www.google.de] "

												Great FPS, decent and interesting story (hard to come by these days), great realism.  Has an AK that feels as powerful as the one in real life. Lots of sandbox aspects that make the replayability pretty good.  Choose your own approach to your enemies. Lots of mini-games and mini-quests to spice things up and keep it interesting.  Same as far-cry 1 and 2 really, big island with lots of uncharted territory that you seek to destroy and control.  Unlike facry2, guard posts do not respawn and once you control a zone of the map your allies patrol it instead of the enemy. Read in a review that you can't save the game manually, that it only autosaves, but this isn't true, you can press ESC>Save to save at any time. Don't know what all the complaining is about with Uplay, it hasn't given me any problems whatsoever.  Yes you have to register and log in with Uplay but that's pretty much all you have to do.  Then it's just play and don't worry about it.  It gave me some concern about this purchase but I suspected it was just trendy little sheeple regurgitating things that they say to one another, and I was right. Good deal, especially at $8.  Would recommend.  "

												I always thought that motion-sickness caused by games was a myth. That changed once I played FC3. There is no way to turn off head-bob, and increasing FOV doesn't really help - running results in a queazy barfy feeling. After about an hour of that plus the ridiculously wobbly cutscenes a massive headache came on.Anything positive I might have to say about the game is obscured by this camera issue.

												Well, there are pro's and cons of the game. It does deserve at least one playthrough, as single payer is great, beautiful graphics, interesting story and plenty of collectibles. I have had a lot of fun with it and I do recommend buying it as it is a very fun game, even if it isn't on sale, but in the end I ended up completing the story, then drifting around collecting treasures and relics to try and fully complete it,  but ended up bored of it. But main thing, DO NOT buy this game for the co-op. It is terribly bad, not balanced at all, buggy with dudes appearing from nowhere. I did not enjoy the co-op mode at all, which is a shame, considering how good the single player experience is.Also, the Uplay thing is just a tad annoying,			"

Far Cry 3 was by far my favorite Far Cry game to dateI Played through Far Cry 1, 2 times and loved it, I haven't played much of Far Cry 2 yet.Though I was hoping for a sequal to Far Cry 1 but there was no Trigens to be found but oh well cant have everything right :( StoryThe Storyline was very engaging and the pacing was good. There are some moments when it can start to feel repetitive like getting to the top of each Radio Tower but that's a small detail that can be overlooked. There's lots of side missions to do some unlockable some DLC but all are well worth it and help to extend the gameplay for a few extra hours. If your only interested in the campaign you can just play through it and move on but if you prefer the open world exploration element theres TONS of chests, locations, artifacts, tasks and missions to do to get extra cash and provide you with more play time. CO-OPThere's also a 4 player Co-op campaign which though its not as good as the main campaign its good fun with friends and has some head to head challenges to add a bit of competitiveness to the mix. MultplayerMultiplayer is nothing special, try it out maybe but.... eh9.2/10- My Favorite Far Cry game. 91 hours well spent "

												I'd highly recommend getting this game. Especially if you're a lover of action and surprises, because that's what Far Cry 3 is all about.Throughout the game you can choose to either be a stealthy killer by adding suppressors, laser sights to your guns or even using a bow. Or you be like a tank and just shoot everything that gets in your way with every big, powerful gun you can get your hands on. The map is really big and has so many new places and things to discover. Invade enemy bases and take them out to claim it to yourself and your people or just go hunting and collect animal skin to craft new weapon holsters or backpacks. And then there's the story line. I'll try not to spoil anything on this one. It has many plots and twists in it, many unexpected scenes which you may wish didn't happen but sometimes you could've prevented it to happen, because at some points you can choose your own destiny. The story also shows us how adrenaline and power changes people.. Or should I say, person? The main character encounters so many new experiences that he has never even thought of before, which leaves a great impact on his mind and makes him want to stay where he is instead of trying to get back home with his friends and family, because he believes that he belongs there now and he needs to finish what he started.All in all, I'd say it's definitely on my Top20 best games list, not to mention the awesome, atmospherical graphics.

												Far Cry 3 is great game that I only recently bought. Far Cry 3 is an fps (first person shooter) with a great story line. There are also side missions such as bounty hunting, finding old relics, etc.  There are also ways to upgrade your character (Jason) by “Skill” or upgrading item such as loot bag, wallet etc. by “Crafting” and lots more. I personally recommend this game to any Open World, FPS, Action, Shooter, Stealth loving gamer. However still have in mind, it’s still 18 so there are many swear word, the occasional finger or 2 and blood.			"

												Far Cry 3 is an entirely open world FPS that offers massive amounts of exploration, collectibles, missions and other features like weapons. The single player campaign is great although the main protagonist is entirely hit or miss as far as personality will go. The side missions in the main game are unfortunately quite emotionless, although the DLC side missions are actually good. The multiplayer was glitchy at launch and never picked up and is mostly an afterthought now. The game also has a following on the nexus modding community so be sure to check out the interesting mods!			"

												This is a great open world FPS with an engaging story and fantastic visuals. I found playing this with the controller to be a more enjoyable experience as a lot of the controls are clearly designed for use with the 360 pad. Especially the jumping stealth kills. Unlike many FPS games your character actually speaks and engages with the NPC's and environment which I find makes the game much more immersive. The game features a light RPG element with skill levelling, inventory management and crafting. All of which are done very well and don't feel tacked on or an afterthought.I have played this game through to completion, my only gripe would be that towards the end taking the final few enemy encampments and towers did feel like a bit of a chore. Early in the game it was all great fun but 30+ hours it does feel a bit like... not another flippin outpost!Overall I would class this game as a must play for FPS fans, it's a corker!			"

This game will take you through the ages, introducing new Weapons, new parts of the map, and meeting new people who will help you on your quest to find Jason's friends, and to help him find and defeat the master of the Pirate Army.This game hasn't got the longest storyline, and I have got to about half-way through it, so I would suggest a full play-through of around 30hours or so. The graphics in this game are great, wtih realistic features and other great scenery available for your viewing while playing this game.Overall, a great and HIGHLY Reccomended game! "

Far Cry 3Assassin's Creed with gunsSo is it good? Yes. Is it great? Well, that depends on what you want. I enjoyed the ""story"" or rather the awesome characters, acting and voice acting in this game A LOT. It is simply really well made, I cannot remember a ""better"" antagonist in any recent or even not so recent game that I have played.The gunplay and graphics are awesome, the game feels very smooth.But there are downsides. The beautiful landscape is not filled as well as it could be in my opinion. Sidequest and especially collectibles are repetitive and grindy to the point that they are annoying and boring.Another part of the game - namely liberating outposts - is immense fun, while other freeroaming aspects did not quite entertain me as much. Especially hunting. Fun for a short while, but after that it is just a grind and then it is suddenly useless.I am not a huge fan of sandbox games and unlike Assassin's Creed with the nice fighting system, there is simply a lack of challenge when shooting the mildly insane AI. What I also missed was decent music. Especially in a caribean setting like this I would like to hear some more reggae outside of missions (don't get me started on the car radios).All in all I enjoyed this game a lot, but I would suggest focusing on the main story line and stealthily liberating outposts (for fun).#Ghost			"

												Heard very good things. Played first mission. Exploration restriction made me question open world. Got bored. Thought FC3 kinda sucked. Stopped playing.-Months later-Friends bashed me for hating and assured me open world after first mission, so I gave FC3 a second chance, and god thank goodness that I did. I've put in over 50 hours in the past month playing this damn game every day until late at night.The character development is outstanding. Far Cry 3 will mess with your mind as you play as Jason Brody, losing yourself to the wilderness and insanity of the jungle that has one rule and one rule only - kill or be killed.Gameplay is smooth, interactions with the wildlife is vast and extensive (hunting, crafting, climbing vines and towers, harvesting plants, etc.), stealth is amazing, weapons are super fun (knife throwing, flamethrowers, recurve bow, snipers, etc.), additions are wonderful (hang gliding, exploring ruins, collecting artifacts, playing poker, sharpshooting, rakyat challenges, etc.), and so so much more asldkfj The main storyline is stunning and intense, and the side missions indulge you in the stories of the local villages. God, this game. I've never played a game quite like FC3. It's like Skyrim and Fallout 3/NV with a more involved story that will trip you up and make you question your own life. This game has got everything. Even strippers. This game has strippers. 10/10But seriously, this game is as fun, astounding, and riveting as the trailer makes it to be.			"

												Worth it. Bought this one on sale, usually the only time I can afford games, but starting to see that original price still would have been worth it. Gameplay is solid, the open environment opens up several playing styles for you to complete different missions, or just explore the map slaughtering endangered wildlife at every turn purely for the sake of more useful attire (really, I just murdered two sharks for a wallet). The game incorporates most successful traits from most of the sandbox genre, roaming wildlife, dangerous vistas, strangly hard to kill tigers, vehicles to make getting around the map easier and for the truly lazy; fast travel. Now that it's been out a while and the price has come down, definitely a title for anyone interested in shooters but hates being restricted to linear map progression.All that said, ♥♥♥♥ Uplay. The game demands to be run through a different platform called Uplay. On first opening the game you are required to create a new accound and verify the key, not so bad. Unfortunatly the game continuously syncs online files, and promts in game menu new from the developers. I don't know if its the platform itself or the game but it seems to crash 1/5 times using fast travel, which is rather inconvenient if you just spent twenty minutes hunting bears and fighting off komodo dragons. Still the game is fun. The developers put in a good effort and as far as core gameplay, this has some of the best.			"

												Kinda bummed about all of these bad reviews....I am so far enjoying this game.....I really enjoy the crafting/open world/and combat elements. Pretty amazing graphics. Love the different kinds of combat def doesn't make you stick to just stealth mode or agressive (enjoy having the choice). Tons of side missions to do but the story line is pretty great in general. I enjoy the survival aspect of it with the wild animals too.  So much fun loot and weapons!! And an insane amount of vehicles. Makes me feel like a kid in a candy shop. :) A lot of the negative feedback prevented me from paying any interest but I am glad I finally bought it. I don't even mind using U play....it isn't a huge deal....yes it  would be sweet to just run it off steam and not download something else but in all honestly it took a minute of my time and I think it is still worth getting the game for.

												Single PlayerFar Cry 3's single player is immersive, and supports several playstyles such as stealthy and also loud and can be played either way and it will still be fun. This game incorporates a fun story into an open world very, very well with lots of side missions which are easily as fun as the rest of the game. Aside from the gameplay, the graphics are quite stunning aside from some floating grass occasionally.10/10 - Would be confronted about my knowledge of the definition of insanity again.MultiplayerFar Cry 3's multiplayer is a fun multiplayer that requires skill to not be killed and the gameplay is much more fun then I had originally thought from seeing footage. Aside from waiting in the lobby for an unbelievable amount of time, being shoved into lobbys at random and all, the multiplayer is good.11/10 - Would sit in lobby againAlso Uplay is required - but don't worry, Uplay isn't as crap anymore			"

												Of all my 72 hours and 4 complete playthroughs so far - not one has been boring, dull, or not played to its full. Seriously, other open-world games do not even come close to this, yeah, GTA is the most popular because of its diversity and gameplay, but the survival and adventure feel of Far Cry 3 tops most other gaming experiences I've ever had. In my opinion with the gameplay and emotion that comes with this game, I can totally forgive every single one of its small bugs and occasional mishaps. If you have the money, don't hesitate for a second to buy this game. And if you don't, save your money, this is an experience you'll never forget.			"

												I stayed up until 5 AM liberating the top half of the map from pirates, weaving in and out of the jungle like a Navy Seal gone AWOL. That is fun. Pure adrenaline-pumping fun. The best story mission in the game is where you have to destroy pirate-controlled drug fields with a flamethrower. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning as I set pirates and plants ablaze, in a maniacal frenzy.Hunting is pretty easy when animals regularly pop out of Jason's anal cavity. Watching the same looting / harvesting / skinning animations play hundreds of times is not fun. Neither is playing pointless minigames, like poker (cash is easy to come by, don't waste your time). The supply drop missions were fun for the first couple of times, but they ultimately didn't stand up to repetition.The story is a loose deconstruction of Hollywood action flicks and club culture. Jason is a funny and sympathetic character, and so is the rest of the cast, especially Vaas. I got from start to finish without any complaint about the story, so that's an achievement.I won't be returning to Rook Island for quite some time due to the game's repetitive nature, but there are a handful of brilliant moments among the monotony. Just make sure to use a mouse and keyboard.			"

It's very fun to play, although Ubisoft have included their UPlay software. UPlay is required to play this game, although I don't see this as much of an issue as launching the game through Steam automatically launches the game through UPlay. It's very well set-up, and I would say it's very good performance-wise as console ports go.			"

												Far Cry 3 succeeds like its predecessors in providing an open world action / thriller set in a tropical climate.  Like similar games such as GTA and Batman: AC, the current objective is shown on the map... there are side missions and mini-games that can be unlocked and played at will.  Portions of the map details are hidden until radio towers are ""unlocked"" by scaling them and sabotaging the fuse box.  Weapons and skills are steadily unlocked as progress is made in both the main story line, collecting hidden treasures, and completing various other tasks.  Thrown in for good measure are hunting and crafting, and a completely separate and very challenging co-op campaign.On the plus side:> The world is beautiful and nicely detailed.> The story is quite good and features one of the best antagonists in any video game I have ever played.> The weapons look, feel, and sound excellent.> The stronghold raids and ""kill nasty dude x"" side missions are the meat of the game and very entertaining, with many ways to approach them> The takedown skills are challenging to apply and fun when they work.> An excellent PC port with all the graphical and control flourish we expect.On the negative side:> The game ramps up too quickly... I found myself proceeding at a reasonable pace, and by act 2 I was becoming overpowered... this along with another mechanic in act 2 makes the second act seem anti-climactic.> On the same vein, the first act Boss feels more threatening than the second.  He also was such a good character I was disappointed that he was dead.  Can he have his own game, please?> The native peoples character models are too similar.> The world does not feel ""lived in""... it feels more like an action game set piece.  There is also very little variation in the game world.> There is very little incentive to continue exploring after the game ends.The co-op campaign is very difficult... you will want at least 3 players for that.  I bought the game on sale on steam for $5... was it worth it? Yes absolutely.  I would say $20 is reasonable for this since I got nearly 40 hours of entertainment out of it.8/10 "

												I finally bought this during the 2014 holiday sale. I'm playing the hell out of Far Cry 3 and really enjoying it, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's completely indefensible. A real shame, because the game is really fun and well designed.Problematic themes and depictions include:A raging case of Last Samurai Syndrome. A white man comes to an exotic foreign world and is quickly adopted by the oppressed natives not only into their culture but as their savior, despite the fact that he knows nothing about their environment and has no applicable skills. We're supposedly a tribe of island warriors who've been living here since time immemorial but only you can save us, scrawny Californian douchebro who's never handled a gun before!As such, the Rakyat can't do anything for themselves. Only Whitey Samurai has any kind of power in deciding how the Rakyat fight for freedom. After the heroic white boy singlehandedly liberates an enemy outpost, a half dozen Rakyat warriors show up in jeeps to secure his conquest, AK47s at the ready, but they're only there for atmosphere. They're unable to take outposts themselves or even help the hero out. I know that having the player be the only being in the world with agency is a convention of open world games going back farther than GTA, but it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ed that these people literally have to wait around for the white hero to save them.Citra. The spiritual leader of the Rakyat is a colonial fantasy straight out of Victorian pulp fiction, the hypersexual female native drawn to the white savior, despite being surrounded at all times by hunky warriors from her own culture. Weirdly, she doesn't even look like she's the same ethnicity as the other Rakyat, who are supposedly... Polynesian? (The game never says exactly where Rook Island is.) Citra is ethnically unplaceable, and definitely has more ""caucasian"" features than the rest of her people, presumably to maximize her sexual appeal to the game's target demographic. Also, the warrior initiation ceremony of the Rakyat involves Citra straddling you while topless and grinding on your junk. Whoops, that was a spoiler, sorry.Dennis. At the beginning of the story, the white hero is rescued and guided by a magical negro witch doctor. Dennis has been adopted by the Rakyat years before, but is not worthy to be their savior himself. He can only assist our white hero, despite being depicted as much more competent and experienced.There are two enemy factions, the savage bloodthirsty ""Pirates"" and the professional mercenary ""Privateers"". The disorganized and drug-addled Pirates are all Afro-Caribbean, while the much more competent Privateers are (mostly white) Americans.The main bad guy is a white South African who is of course depicted as a genocidal monster. Poor Afrikaners, no other ethnic group is so easy to demonize in video games and action movies. It's not their fault that their accent makes them all sound like Bond villains.In conclusion, buy it cheap during a Steam sale, enjoy exploring the gorgeous world, the awesome stealth killing mechanics, and the wide variety of customizable guns, and shake your head at the tone-deaf racism.

												Far Cry 3 is an entirely open world FPS that offers massive amounts of exploration, collectibles, missions and other features like weapons. The single player campaign is great although the main protagonist is entirely hit or miss as far as personality will go. The side missions in the main game are unfortunately quite emotionless, although the DLC side missions are actually good. The multiplayer was glitchy at launch and never picked up and is mostly an afterthought now. The game also has a following on the nexus modding community so be sure to check out the interesting mods!			"

												Far Cry 3 is great game that I only recently bought. Far Cry 3 is an fps (first person shooter) with a great story line. There are also side missions such as bounty hunting, finding old relics, etc.  There are also ways to upgrade your character (Jason) by “Skill” or upgrading item such as loot bag, wallet etc. by “Crafting” and lots more. I personally recommend this game to any Open World, FPS, Action, Shooter, Stealth loving gamer. However still have in mind, it’s still 18 so there are many swear word, the occasional finger or 2 and blood.			"

												I enjoyed Far Cry 3 more than I've enjoyed almost any game for a long, long time.I don't care how dumb the story is (it's not, but that was apparently a fluke), it's internally consistent enough to be coherent and convincing while being vague and last minute enough in other places to be totally compelling and mysterious, like Lost was before Damon Lindelof realised viewers were way smarter than he'd ever given them credit for and his insistence that this wasn't a case painted him into a cringe-inducing corner.I digress.Far Cry 3 is really, really good and interesting and fun. The island is beautiful, the wildlife is interesting, the fire system is more or less intact from the otherwise terrible Far Cry 2 SO THAT'S GOOD and the music is some of my favourite in a long, long time. There's an overwhelming amount of things to see and do, thanks to the scattershot 'world map full of activity markers' Ubisoft school of design, and almost all of it is really fun and usually quite a diversion from the 'routine' gameplay.But nothing in Far Cry 3 is routine. Everything kind of feels special and exciting. If you liked Far Cry or The Beach or Lost or Arrow then you should definitely give Far Cry 3 a try. You probably should anyway.			"

Luckily, I got to scan and fix my C Drive and did a system restore, but such glitches should not happen thanks to multiple DRMs required to activate to even launch this game, that sprouts only more technical issues that could have totally been avoided had I purchased the actual disc. Sadly disappointed by this, and I don't dare to open this game again, in risk of ruining my harddrive again.Thanks a lot, UPlay. You ruined a game for me on Steam.			"

												Far Cry 3 was my first trip into the Far Cry unierse and I was really happy about this game.  I loved the environments,  I REALLY loved the story.  ITs got stealth elements, crafting elements, treasure hunting, murder, boobies, old WWII relics and the best part of all, you can do whatever you want however you want to do it.  For instance...Saw a base full of dudes.Shot the door to a tiger cage open.Tiger starts running around mauling the hell out of everything.Threw a molotov for good measure.Started a forest fire.Took out silenced SMG.Shot already burning dude in the face.Laughed about it.Used singed tiger pelt to make a better wallet.Stole a truck.Drove it off of a cliff. Landed on a pig.9/10Would laugh at other's misfortune and eat bacon again.			"

												A game that might be a satire on the disconnect between the events of a game and the story it's trying to tell. If that sounds too pretentious to you, it's also a brilliant FPS that sets you loose on an island full of awesome weapons, predator beasts, jeeps, boats, hangliders, tons of blood-thirsty enemies, and Vaas the lovable pirate king.

												Overall Far Cry 3 is a very solid First Person Shooter game. It has a very intense story that makes you want to finish the game from start to end without stopping. To note this is the first Far Cry game I have FINISHED. I could never finish the previous Far Cry games for many reasons. That being said this game in the series was very enjoyable to me. As you can see the game took me no more than 13ish hours to beat, doing some side missions and other little challenges in the game. It is a fairly easy game to get through compared to the other Far Cry games. One gameplay mechanic I really enjoyed was the stealth. It was top notch fun sneaking around taking people down with brutal machete kills. The skill system works very well with the game too. I never once felt underpowered in fact the way the game progresses you feel weak at the beginning, but towards the end of the game you are a bonafide killing machine. The story like I said was very entertaining, playing out like a classic hollywood revenge film. You play as Jason Brody a man who decides to go on a getaway vacation to a mysterious island. Things go south and your friends get captured, leaving it up to you to save them. The game has great character development showing how Jason must learn to adapt to the situation at hand and become a ruthless killer in order to save his friends. The game does feature 2 different endings each one being very different from the other. The endings were the only thing that made the game a little negative for me. Without spoiling much one of the endings is very empty meaning it feels as if it was rushed and things needed to be futher explained. Other than that it is a great single player experience. I have yet to play multiplayer. As far as technical aspects the game ran very smoothly never dropping its frame rate or crashing. I had a good experience with UPlay too. This is definitely the right step in the Far Cry series and I am now looking forward to Far Cry 4.9/10- TLDR Great game with awesome gameplay mechanics and a solid story. Looking forward to Far Cry 4!			"

												I had a ton of fun playing this game, and it's probably my favorite in the series. However I do have a few complaints;- The second island is more of the same from the first island- Hunting becomes completely useless after you craft everything, and everything can be crafted on the first island- The voice acting is pretty bad, as is most of the dialouge in the side quests- The two major boss fights are nothing more than QTEs- The game also just kind of ends and it doesn't feel like it comes to any firm end(Ignore my playtime please, I had some sort of bug that stopped me from launching it through Steam so I had to follow  these steps  to get it to play.)

The atmosphere of this one is just right, my completionist senses are still tingeling, but I must... not... The weapon system is well done, and does also work on a controller, rather than mouse and keyboard and I encountered no crashes or bugs so far.Just a great game. Now I just have to find someone willing to play the coop missions with me.Completion time: 19 hours. Considered I freed the whole Island and revealed the whole map.			"

												Far Cry 3 is an open world, first person shooter game that takes FPS games to the next level. For quite an old game it doesnt look half bad, bright coloured grass and wildlife give the area a sense of tropicality and the textures, models and sounds are amazing. Three of Far Cry 3's biggest and best features are the range of weapons, the choices you can make while completing normal tasks and the characters. On rook Island there are a massive range of weapons, including Rifles, Snipers, Bows, Rocket Launchers, Grenade Launchers, Flame Throwers and many, many more. These weapons each have the normal upgrades like bigger magazine, silencer and many more. These attachments let you be creative in killing; when overtaking outposts you can be sneaky with a bow and a silenced AK-47 taking out enemies with these weapons and skills, including creative takedowns, or you can go in guns-blazing with a grenade launcher, Machine Gun and explosive arrows. And Finally, despite the main characters weak and funny (in a bad way) personality, the other characters are really entreging. Sadly these characters seem to disapeer, or get taken out of the spotlight as soon as you meet them and start to like them. Thank Fully that is the only downside, your stuck with annoying characters and sadly your favourite characters are even killed or not seen a lot after an hour or two.Overall this is one of the best pc games I have ever played and I recomend it to anyone who has a pc and £15.

												I finally bought this during the 2014 holiday sale. I'm playing the hell out of Far Cry 3 and really enjoying it, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's completely indefensible. A real shame, because the game is really fun and well designed.Problematic themes and depictions include:A raging case of Last Samurai Syndrome. A white man comes to an exotic foreign world and is quickly adopted by the oppressed natives not only into their culture but as their savior, despite the fact that he knows nothing about their environment and has no applicable skills. We're supposedly a tribe of island warriors who've been living here since time immemorial but only you can save us, scrawny Californian douchebro who's never handled a gun before!As such, the Rakyat can't do anything for themselves. Only Whitey Samurai has any kind of power in deciding how the Rakyat fight for freedom. After the heroic white boy singlehandedly liberates an enemy outpost, a half dozen Rakyat warriors show up in jeeps to secure his conquest, AK47s at the ready, but they're only there for atmosphere. They're unable to take outposts themselves or even help the hero out. I know that having the player be the only being in the world with agency is a convention of open world games going back farther than GTA, but it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ed that these people literally have to wait around for the white hero to save them.Citra. The spiritual leader of the Rakyat is a colonial fantasy straight out of Victorian pulp fiction, the hypersexual female native drawn to the white savior, despite being surrounded at all times by hunky warriors from her own culture. Weirdly, she doesn't even look like she's the same ethnicity as the other Rakyat, who are supposedly... Polynesian? (The game never says exactly where Rook Island is.) Citra is ethnically unplaceable, and definitely has more ""caucasian"" features than the rest of her people, presumably to maximize her sexual appeal to the game's target demographic. Also, the warrior initiation ceremony of the Rakyat involves Citra straddling you while topless and grinding on your junk. Whoops, that was a spoiler, sorry.Dennis. At the beginning of the story, the white hero is rescued and guided by a magical negro witch doctor. Dennis has been adopted by the Rakyat years before, but is not worthy to be their savior himself. He can only assist our white hero, despite being depicted as much more competent and experienced.There are two enemy factions, the savage bloodthirsty ""Pirates"" and the professional mercenary ""Privateers"". The disorganized and drug-addled Pirates are all Afro-Caribbean, while the much more competent Privateers are (mostly white) Americans.The main bad guy is a white South African who is of course depicted as a genocidal monster. Poor Afrikaners, no other ethnic group is so easy to demonize in video games and action movies. It's not their fault that their accent makes them all sound like Bond villains.In conclusion, buy it cheap during a Steam sale, enjoy exploring the gorgeous world, the awesome stealth killing mechanics, and the wide variety of customizable guns, and shake your head at the tone-deaf racism.

												Got to say Far Cry 3 is a brilliant package. Visually it's one of the most gorgeous games I've played so far. The tropical island is lush, appropriately has wild life here and there but not oversaturating the islands. Shooting and the hide and stabbing work satisfyingly well. Compared to Far Cry 2 the game has much more substance. There's much more to do in the open world and it doesn't feel so empty. Plus the driving, which actually in 3 is much more optional than in 2, has much more weight and is through that more enjoyable. There's a lot of good writing in characters, especially in the ""evil"" ones. But I suppose like with every open world game there comes the sense of repetition eventually. Focusing doing too many side quests and other side activities might make you a little bored after a while.I really didn't have any problems technically despite maybe a crash that happened once during the 18-hour playthrough but that's just really minor. If you've got the specs on your machine to run this game and you do enjoy a bit of open world FPS, can't say you're going wrong by buying and playing Far Cry 3. Unlike Far Cry 2 it's totally worth your time. It's a sweet piece of... smooth jungle beauty.			"

												Enjoyable Combat in an Open enviroment.I really didn't gel with the Protagonist or his friends in this game. You play some rich, white, kid in his 20s who is on vacation with his equally cringeworthy friends. On a character level I just couldn't relate. But the game is so good that you ignore that.Don't get me wrong, there are some fantastic characters in this game. I feel as if a few of their stories were cut short too quickly, as if they ran out of time. But that aside they were still great! You meet a lot of very memorable characters and have the chance to interract with some of the best villans/anti-heroes I have ever faced while playing videogames.Vaas is right up there with Handsome Jack as one of (if not the) most charasmaticly evil badguys of all time.The combat is VERY fun. The exploring/open world enviroments are fantastic. The Graphics and great. The story is great in parts and ok in others (a few ""wtf?"" moments)I really enjoyed playing this game. It is very much Skyrim with guns. It was very much an enjoyable use of my time.			"

												This game has the typical flaws of a typical Ubisoft game.You are forced to install Uplay and sign up for a Uplay account. Yay more DRM.The gameplay is not immersive at all; the game stops at every moment to tell you that you're playing a video game, just to be sure. You have to fumble with menus to activate your buff syringes because you can only hotkey two (and one of those spots is usually used for special arrows).The plot is terrible and has some of the most infuriating occurrences of any story. In one hour, my character was knocked out no less than three times, two of which he was captured and executed, only for the character to live and come back to attempt to kill the bad guy again.If you're looking for an open world shooter, play a STALKER game.

												screw this game wont even let me play. Uplay is terrible and i dont know why they even use it. who ever made it should kill them selves because it is the most in consistent peace of anul debris i have come across. if you buy this game and or anyother ubisoft game like assasins creed or far cry 4, then good luck because uplay well ♥♥♥♥ you right in your ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥, get you pregnant with it's turb babies and ruin your entire family blood line, destroying your family as we speak. it is a real shame that because far cry 3 is a very solid game that i could play for hours if i had the chance. but uplay has to be that one guy who comes to the party univited and ♥♥♥♥s all of your women (including your mum) and steals your tv and sets your house on fire.

												Fary Cry 3 looks really good and is fun to play at the beginning but it gets repetitive really fast. The achievements aren't through steam and you have to use uplay which kind of sucks. Also, there are no real save spots. You can save when you aren't in certain missions but they aren't true save spots.I wouldn't really recommend it unless it's on a team sale. There are better single player FPS games with better story lines.			"

												Honestly, the game was fantastic, but it forces you to use a service called Uplay by Ubisoft instead of steam to track achievments, play online, and launch the game. Like I said, I loved the game and wanted to get all of the achievments, but I couldn't even get my correct name in Uplay (Had to use R3idoon instead of Reidoon and I can't change it.)I'll never buy a Ubisoft game again until they either allow you to change your username or get rid of Uplay all together. Extremely dissapointed since this was just a good game.			"

												I've been a Far Cry fan since the first one came out for the PC and I consider that one to be one of best shooters of all time. The Xbox versions were also great so I was really stoked for Far Cry 2. I have to say I was very dissapointed with that entry in the franchise. The idea for it was great but it suffered from some minor but crucial flaws mainly due to the whole open world scheme, which didn't work so well in my opinion, in a franchise that established itself as being a great straightforward (but strategic) FPS.So, as you would guess, when I heard Far Cry 3 was keeping the same formula was the previous one, I didn't get very excited for it. I tried it out for just thirty minutes and thank god I was wrong. Everything about this game is great. Puts together the over the top action of the first games with a more refined open world aproach of Far Cry 2. This game works well in so many ways. Even when you finish all the main and secundary missions you will be wanting for more. And the game will definitely give you more of what you want. As you can tell, I didn't go alot into detail on this review, but there's no need for it. Trust me, play it. It goes down for as one of the best, if not the best, games of 2012.			"

												Far Cry 3 is two games.The first 2/3 of it is an open world first person shooter that lets you control the pace. You can go hunting for wild animals, attack enemy bases, and tackle the vast majority of the missions in any way you want, whether that's via stealth or dudebroing it up, or whatever. It really is exceptionally good fun!The last 1/3 is just... well... it's linear, it's boring, it's Call of Duty-esque gunsplosions, i.e. gameplay is driven by linear environments with checkpoints, and progress is through attrition rather than player ingenuity. All of these are symptoms of a game that has lost its way towards the end, or christ, even had another team entirely working on it.Sure you *can* still explore the open world in the last third, but the impetus and momentum at this point is on beating the game rather than unlocking♥♥♥♥♥♥ since doing it is for its own sake at that point (earlier on in the game, side missions are to get XP to strengthen your character in order to tackle the tough story missions). The game even acknowledges this by raining ammo packs and body armour down on you at the end of each story mission at this point so you don't have to spend time going to restock.Couple this with a predictable plot, lame characters and a rather binary sense of morality, and Far Cry 3 is an okay, if not amazing, product. I can recommend it, since I felt compelled to finish it, but be warned: the last third of the game is really lame whereas the first two thirds are really quite good. Just be sure to get the game when it's cheap.6/10			"

Crafting is very basic and easy to remember; gameplay and mechanics are fluid.

												Far Cry 3 is another incredible game in its series. With stunning graphics and an immersive story which really makes you feel one with the game.It's also very well optimized, meaning random FPS drops are almost never if not at all.The multiplayer is rather empty now, and the Co-op doesn't live up to the single player campaign. But the games you do find are always fun and guarnteed to be worth it.The campaign's pure length is more than enough to make up for the lacking multiplayer...And is easily replayable and enjoyanle.Moving on. Some none essential characters during cutscenes have slightly poor sound and animation. But it really should not be something to put you off the game.I would more than recommend this game to people with a good gaming rig. My nVidia GTX 660 plays Far Cry 3 on ultra very well, and the regions of a 640-650 should be able to run it on medium-high settings at decent framerates.			"

												Far Cry 3 is a great game. The island is really a living place and you can spend a good amount of time by traveling in some car or hunting some animals. By the way, this is the best game to use a bow, I really enjoyed use it during all the game, the gameplay is fantastic.It has some great music, sound effects and voice acting but the story could be much better, but it is almost ok. You start trying to save your friends but after some point later in the game I completely forgot about them (and I feel bad for saying it, LOL), but I was having too much fun playing around in the island, going to new towers and hunting new animals between the missions... Well, what can I do?On the other hand, Vaas is a great and unique character, unfortunatelly the others aren't that interesting as him (except one soldier in later game...), every time you encounter him is very cool (and crazy).After all that I went to co-op, which is a very linear and short storyline, but is fun and works great. In every mission you will face some sort of competition with your friends (sniper, jet ski, rpgs, buggies, ...) and that makes it even more fun and a lot less repetitive.			"

												I finished the game and after some time reflecting this is my review:Pros:- Gameplay was fun overall;- Nice graphics;- Hunting was intense, fun and rewarding (without potions);- If you are the type of player that likes to play stealth  you'll get rewarded (with extra XP);- The characters were in ""place"", they represent well what they were suppose to do;- Charismatic Villain ( Vaas);- Some fun side quests;- Large area to explore;- Treasure/ cards hunting ( they reward you with gold, lore and special weapons);- Mini puzzles to get to the top of the towers;- Nice Co-op;- Took me 25 hours to complete on normal and i didn't collect all the stuff and neither unlocked all the outpost/ towers.Cons:- Boring protagonist, pretty clichê (if you ask me);- The characters speak in combat therefore you'll miss what they are saying because you're focusing on the combat and you can't even ""replay"" or have a ""quest jornal"";- The story is confusing, and doesn't give much answers ( there is a interesting ""Symmetry Theory"" on youtube that can help you out), but still we dont know if thats the truth;- You can get all the upgrates from hunting on the first island;- After Vaas died the story became pretty boring and a ""standard shooting game"".- Hoyt was pretty hyped at the beggining of the game but we saw pretty much nothing of him;- On the second island you can just fast travel next to the main missions without unlocking any outpost/tower;- The missions were harder as the game goes on but even if you died you came back with the progress that you had unlocked, like that mission that you and Sam had to destroy 5 fuel depots, you destroyed 2 and died and came back with 2 already destroyed instead of totaly restarted;  - Uplay can be a pain for some players;I  give it an 8,5/10I liked the experience of the game and I think you wont regreat buying it.

When you play the game on steam it will open UPlay and you have to hit play once again through that. Basically, it's no reason to buy the game, play it for 0.2 hours and give it a negative review.f			"

												A well produced and beautiful piece of work, made by ubisoft. As far as thee other far crys go, i think this one is way better then previous far cry's. this game is one that takes beauty and action and merges it into one that creates a world like no other. This game makes the player feel immersed, like they are actually there themself, hence with astonishing animations for whatever you do, whether it be climbing into a car, or even diving into the sea, with every action there is a animation. Thus with factors such as that, it makes the game even more fun to play and addiciting. i know this because i always smile when i do something within the game, from flying wingsuits(spoiler) to ziplining and shooting komodo dragons, this game makes me wanna play it more and more until my eyes are bloodshot(not that i would actually do that). And in terms of graphics, i am comepletly speechless. When i first left the camp, i immediatley ran and climbed the first hill i saw, and just watched in astonishment, of how beautful the island was and everything on and around it, everything was detailed, from trees to buildings, to even 1 leaf that was on the ground beside me. The whole world was just immaculate, and i just couldn't get enough it, most of my time on the game was just exploring and staring at the beauty of the islands lush nature and jungles. Plus don't get me started the water, as that was definitley a highlight in this game(for me anyway). but anyways, if you're wanting to know what te rest of the game is like, then i can assure you(well most of you) that this game is a must see for yourself to believe. the campaign was great, there were some parts that were abit confusing and dissapointing, but however that did not stop me from continueing on. This game is fun filled with lots of action, drama, comedy, and even some emotional and loving scenes(talking about the campaign and the world mostly). But yes, enough of me blabbing about my thoughts, just get the game and be prepared to be amazed. :DDDDDD peace guys x			"

												Recommended for the campagin, but the map editor sucks, because you can't make maps with animals or guns in it and after play it with your friends... This is because the game doesn't allow you to for some weird reason. I bought it for the map editor and the map editor only, so if you are really into mapping and don't really care about the campagin, you might wanna skip this one.			"

Far Cry 3Assassin's Creed with gunsSo is it good? Yes. Is it great? Well, that depends on what you want. I enjoyed the ""story"" or rather the awesome characters, acting and voice acting in this game A LOT. It is simply really well made, I cannot remember a ""better"" antagonist in any recent or even not so recent game that I have played.The gunplay and graphics are awesome, the game feels very smooth.But there are downsides. The beautiful landscape is not filled as well as it could be in my opinion. Sidequest and especially collectibles are repetitive and grindy to the point that they are annoying and boring.Another part of the game - namely liberating outposts - is immense fun, while other freeroaming aspects did not quite entertain me as much. Especially hunting. Fun for a short while, but after that it is just a grind and then it is suddenly useless.I am not a huge fan of sandbox games and unlike Assassin's Creed with the nice fighting system, there is simply a lack of challenge when shooting the mildly insane AI. What I also missed was decent music. Especially in a caribean setting like this I would like to hear some more reggae outside of missions (don't get me started on the car radios).All in all I enjoyed this game a lot, but I would suggest focusing on the main story line and stealthily liberating outposts (for fun).#Ghost			"

												I finished the game and after some time reflecting this is my review:Pros:- Gameplay was fun overall;- Nice graphics;- Hunting was intense, fun and rewarding (without potions);- If you are the type of player that likes to play stealth  you'll get rewarded (with extra XP);- The characters were in ""place"", they represent well what they were suppose to do;- Charismatic Villain ( Vaas);- Some fun side quests;- Large area to explore;- Treasure/ cards hunting ( they reward you with gold, lore and special weapons);- Mini puzzles to get to the top of the towers;- Nice Co-op;- Took me 25 hours to complete on normal and i didn't collect all the stuff and neither unlocked all the outpost/ towers.Cons:- Boring protagonist, pretty clichê (if you ask me);- The characters speak in combat therefore you'll miss what they are saying because you're focusing on the combat and you can't even ""replay"" or have a ""quest jornal"";- The story is confusing, and doesn't give much answers ( there is a interesting ""Symmetry Theory"" on youtube that can help you out), but still we dont know if thats the truth;- You can get all the upgrates from hunting on the first island;- After Vaas died the story became pretty boring and a ""standard shooting game"".- Hoyt was pretty hyped at the beggining of the game but we saw pretty much nothing of him;- On the second island you can just fast travel next to the main missions without unlocking any outpost/tower;- The missions were harder as the game goes on but even if you died you came back with the progress that you had unlocked, like that mission that you and Sam had to destroy 5 fuel depots, you destroyed 2 and died and came back with 2 already destroyed instead of totaly restarted;  - Uplay can be a pain for some players;I  give it an 8,5/10I liked the experience of the game and I think you wont regreat buying it.

Far Cry 3 ReviewStory: 17/20At all, the story of Far Cry 3 is pretty nice and you can have a lot of fun over the time. It's a long and well developed Story. You will take something like 25-30 Hours to play the whole Story and you won't get bored. Characters: 17/20I really like the Characters of the Game, the attributes of them are really well developed and i like them pretty much. World: 20/20The game has a huge open world, that offers a lot of things around the story: Extra-missions, taking over outposts & collecting relics, to name a few. So it can't get boringControls + Gameplay: 17/20The controls are just like in the other games, but the weapon selection layout is not really great. The gameplay is very open, you can do whatever you want, as long as you complete your Mission. You can either shot everything down or go stealth and kill them one by one, without getting noticed.Graphics: 19/20The Graphics are great. They really fit into the game and you can take a few nice Screenshots, if you want to.Overall: 89/100In my opinion, it's a must have for FPS/Adventure fans.Cheers!			"

												I usually play COOP games on Steam because it's basically what I like the most to play with friends. This game has a very good coop mode. You need like around 10 hours to complete all the missions on normal difficulty (I've played it with one friend only). The bots aren't that stupid and if you know the game mechanics from the story mode of the game you will like this as well. The multiplayer mode is hard to define because it's hard to connect to any game actually. So summing up if you want this purely for COOP, yes, yes and yes. If you like great campaign in single player it's even better.			"

												With the (at the time of writing) recent release of Far Cry 4 I think the best way to sum up Far Cry 3 is “Still entirely relevant”Far Cry 3 is a beautiful game and an absolute joy to play. The atmosphere and the vibrancy of the island you have at your disposal is such a wonderful contrast to most games with the First-Person Shooter classification. One of the most compelling parts of the Far Cry formula is the freedom to approach a situation in whatever way you can dream up. As a fan of stealth games, my mindset was to wipe out an entire enemy force and either make it look like a tragic accident or a nightmarish ninja slaughter. Another aspect that oddly sticks out in my mind is the guns; they all sound unbelievably real and deadly. I’m not sure how they crafted the sound effects for gun fire but they nailed it in Far Cry 3.So again, my best summary of Far Cry 3 is still “very relevant”. It is a fantastic open world, first-person, sandbox shooter with light RPG elements and I highly recommend everyone pick it up while it’s cheap!			"

One minute you are walking through the jungle, the next a pack of dogs are kicking your♥♥♥♥♥ The jungle is alive, The AI talk to each other and greet you as if they were real people. Which makes the game feel that much more alive! Taking bases has got to be one of the funnest aspects of the game. If you want to go in guns blazing you can, if you want to be a stealthy assassins and pick people off one by one you can! The hunting is also enjoyable I liked getting different skins to craft different bags, holsters and rockets. The villians are amazing in this game you almost don't want them to die. Besides Hoyte screw him...This game is very fun. I've played it through twice already and still find things to do. Ways to explore. The down side to this game is definitely Jason He never really says much to make you want to like him.  I like the other characters more than him. 8.5/10			"

												Far Cry 3 is framed as a shooter, and in that vein, there are plenty of guns, grenades, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and more. But there’s more to Jason’s skill set, which makes for a more sophisticated game. The ability to sneak and to throw rocks to distract enemies might seem like small factors, but combined with instant-kill maneuvers and AI that reacts to the environment, the result is a game that swings back and forth comfortably between action and stealth. Hunting in Far Cry 3 serves a purpose beyond errant urges to destroy something beautiful. Animal skins are used to create new pouches, loot sacks, holsters and more, each of which increases your various carrying capacities. It encourages exploration, as different animals live on different parts of the island, and some game is more dangerous than others. And tying crafting back into the main game, the best gear can only be crafted by hunting legendary animals tied to specific hunting missions.There’s so much to do in Far Cry 3 that it can be intimidating. You can climb a radio tower, which is a platforming puzzle of sorts, which in turn will reveal more information about the area of the island surrounding it. You can storm an outpost like an avenging angel or sweep through it like a ninja drawing off enemies with thrown rocks to pick off with a machete or bow — my weapons of choice — which in turn reveals new side missions. These include special hunts that yield rare skins that can be used to craft the best gear, or can yield contract missions with financial rewards to expand and upgrade your armory.That’s Far Cry 3’s greatest strength — every action has a result that ties into other actions and new rewards. Even from a strictly moment-to-moment mechanical perspective, quickly made decisions have very visible, immediate consequences. An idly thrown grenade might cause a chain reaction of explosions. An errant Molotov cocktail could take out your enemies, but might also surround you with killing flames. That first takedown kill might be perfectly safe, but if you get greedy and, say, use your new ability to chain a second takedown by throwing your first victim’s knife into a second, a sniper you didn’t see might watch it all go down and trigger an alarm, calling in even more enemies.

												Needs more definition of insanity.  Far Cry games are pretty much the same: simple but entertaining gameplay that goes on for far too long.  Some of the characters are pretty interesting though, such as Sam and Vaas.  The in-game menu isn't particularly good, and, to make matters worse, Uplay is constantly in your face with meta-gaming.  I'm still not fond of needing another service, complete with high scores and friend tracking, just to play through the story.  If you're willing to put up with Uplay and this game is on sale, Far Cry 3 is worth checking out, but it's a fairly mediocre game overall.			"

												Fantastic game! The story is fairly captivating, and has great characters, and quite the plot twist at the end. The open-world gameplay is enough to keep me occupied without the story, just killing those damn pirates for hours on end. Taking over camps is fun, and a challenge in the later game. Interesting skill system. Overall, my favourite from Ubisoft.			"

												Before playing Far Cry 3, I had not really been into Story Driven games. Until Now.This game is just something else I had never experience before, Not sure if it's because I had never really gotten into a Story line before or if it was the outstanding Action & Character Portrayals. Either way, This game is great for the price, and I would not hesitate to buy this game. Yes there is a few downsides to the game, but they are outweighed by the outstanding positives.P.S. Going from the bad rep that FC:Primal has on PC, this seems to be of much better value.			"

												Price Aquired: $7:49 during Winter sale 2014I picked up this game after playing Far Cry 4 on the PS4. I was impressed with that game and wanted to see what else the series had to offer. I was very very surprised because in my opinion - Far Cry 3 blows Far Cry 4 out of the water. Since I've purchased Far Cry 3, I haven't played 4 at all because 3 just...feels better. The game does a great job of setting up the story in the opening, and I became invested in the characters very quickly. The main character, Jason Brody, is on a mission to rescue his captive friends after they became stranded on a jungle island following a skydiving accident. This is a really compelling mission, and I, as the player, felt really motivated to save them. I'm not good at starting and finishing Single-Player campaigns (the last one I finished was The Last Of Us Remastered over the summer), but I was hooked into this one from beginning to end. The gameplay is very fun and feels very responsive. Seeing how many guards you can silenty snipe before they alert the rest of the outpost is intense and rewards smart playing. There are plenty of customizable weapons and I always felt like I had options. There are many fun weapons as well (namely the Flamethrower).Gunfights are fun and feel fair. I was rarely frustrated (except for the damn heavy soldiers). Anyone who is worried about missing elephants and other improvements from FC4, don't be. I didn't miss them at all.  The ONLY negative thing I have to say about this game is the occasional overuse of ""trippy"" drugs. The island natives occasionally give drugs to Jason to make him realize things from their perspective, and they lead to many many cool hallucination sequences. However they end up using this effect in a boss encounter or two and it takes away from the satisfaction of the fight. I would have preferred if they stuck to the realism a bit more in the boss sequences.I highly recommend this game if you like FPS games, games with a good storyline, or wanna see what the Far Cry franchise is all about for a good price.

												Far Cry 3 is one of the most fun games I have played in a long time. This is by far a great contender for current and next gen games. Love the stealth elements to the game and the visuals look amazing. This is what all open world games should be looking to achieve. There is not one dull moment in this game, from capturing outposts to fighting wild life such as tigers, bears, crocodiles and other animals from exploration. If I was to give Far Cry 3 a rating it would be 9/10 however if your machine is powerful enough to run Far Cry 3 at max settings I highly recommended installing a few popular modifications to the game like ziggys mod and sweetfx which would easily boost the rating for this game up to a   9.5/10This is one of those games that is only released once in a decade, defiantly not one to miss.

												Great game!9/10 in the BlacKy scale.The good:* Story starts great (no spoiler): A group of rich kids went for a vacation on an exotic island (or a group of islands if u'd like) to have fun, but then gets kidnapped by pirates. You free yourself and get help from local villagers to free your friends and take the kidnappers down.* Island looks amazing. Overall graphics is very up to date.* Exploring the island is very fun (whoever liked Red Faction Guerrilla's enviroment will like this aswell). Many side quests to do. Having a bunch of items to find (just like the classic hidden boxes from the GTA series). Driving a vehicle makes you feel as you're inside the game. You can actually feel bumps on the road.* The wildlife is very nice. Many exotic animals to encounter. Animal's AI is well done overall.* The more you advance in the game, enemies get thougher.* Customizable weapons. Need i say more?* Co-op is pretty fun when its not crashing. * You get to cheat on your gf with an amazonian nympho.The bad:* Story ends bad, in my opinion: I'll do my best not to spoil - When having the chance to get out of the island with all your friends, you take the other option, revenge, staying behind and killing those who have kidnapped you and your friends.* Enemies AI is a bit poor. They sometimes suspect that something is wrong but they dont tend to do much about it, even if they're defending an outpost, etc.* I've found all the syringes except health syringes to be unnecessary to use. No need to dive too much underwater so water syringe is irrelevant. The camera's ability to tag enemies and animals makes the hunter syringe to be irrelevant aswell. You can extinguish fire when you're on fire so fireproof syringes are, again, irrelevant.* Your health is too OP. You can make up to 10 health packs while also carrying impossible amount of crafting materials to make even more health syringes if you'll need to use later. After getting enough progressed in the game, you have constantly infinite amount of health which makes everything boring and less exciting.* The skill tree isn't as good as other games, E.G Borderlands franchise. You will eventually unlock all the skills in the game, which makes it unnecessary to think 'which skill am i going to unlock next?'. Some of the skills have absolutely no value in the game so you may think that even if you have free skill points to spare, you wouldn't pick that specific skill.* While the crafting option itself is very well made. Everything craftable in the game gets unlocked after ~50% of game time (finishing the north island), so you wont be needing to kill animals for hides at the second island at all if you have explored the first island effectively enough.* Activating radio towers makes the game very easy. Too easy i might say. Weapons will become free in weapon shops, ammo gets very cheap, and you get the sense that money isnt a factor anymore. If you like a bit of a challenge, dont do what i did, which was unlocking most of the radio towers before making the quests. Try exploring everything at once:- Do a few missions.- Do a few side missions.- Explore the island as you can: Find some artifacts / SD cards / letters / etc.- Unlock some radio towers and outposts.- Repeat* uPlay - Sadly this game runs by uPlay, which means constantly-crashing servers in multiplayer and co-op, no Steam achievements, and no real option to search for specific servers like in normal Valve servers via Steam.Multiplayer and co-op have no skill filter. A level 1 noob will often join a group of level 75's (highest level). The ugly:* VaasOverall:I admit i was 'letting myself go' on the bad stuff. But when you play the game, you will realize the good compensates the bad in many ways. Very enjoyable game. Open world FTW!Just dont count on the MP / Co-op to be enjoyable. Because of the above circumstances, its not.			"

And I love the idea of the tattoo you get as you progress through the game, it's awesome! I'd give it a 10 out of 10 just cauze it's just that enjoyable.

COMPLETED 100%A decent FPS by today's standards. The story is fairly linear, to say the least. The much publicized antagonist Vaas isn't actually showcased that much, only appearing in a few cutscenes before being long forgotten by the second half of the game. Not really a bad thing, since this gives way for further delving into new scenery when the game later branches out into another part, allowing for different new enemies and paving the way for other interesting characters. The open world of Rook Island is a large place to explore, though it's mostly repetitive in environment and landscape, even on the South Island. On a good note, the world is realistically put together and scaled in size. Possibly, it may very well be just as large as a real-life tropical island. Collectibles are spread across the entire islands, but the myriad of treasure chests scattered literally everywhere you go can be a game-breaker, and slight annoyance. With so many laying about, I could say the game is literally throwing money at you till the point where it is common to run out of things to buy at the store, leaving you full of unused cash and having to tolerate the incessant ""Your wallet is full"" messages that will be popping up constantly. But a minor downsight to the game nonetheless. For gameplay: the enemy AI is rather impressive and well-done, with reactionary actions like knowing when to take cover and losing sight of you. They can also be pretty dumb at times, whether acting logically or not. Weapons are, unfortunately, quite unbalanced, where the simple order of having guns later in the game being in every way superior to the earlier guns. This makes your choice of weapons pretty much straightforward. I'd rather prefer the wep stats spread out across the chart to give more chances for decision-making but that's my take.Some weps...or gear, are pretty useless as well, such as the repair tool that was so useful in Far Cry 2 has become a complete unnecessity and ""specials"" like the bow and flamethrower don't really have much benefits apart from being unique. The bow, especially, is essentially a pointless waste, given a silenced sniper rifle already does the same job better. Seriously, why does everyone love the bow as much? There's nothing greater about it.Overall the game is pretty much a stripped down version of its predecessor, improving in some ways, lacking in others; with its silly implementations like being able to heal yourself literally anywhere with a magical green syringe, enemies being marked for you and loot chests and plant herbs lying everywhere you go.Ubisoft clearly ""casualized"" it for the masses, removing the hardcore features from its predecessors while at least retaining its core features. This, at the cost of the game being too easy in comparison. And so the verdict... this game mostly great in quality, despite poor game design choices dragging it down, I'd say it's still worth the play.			"

												An enjoyable first-person shooter set in a beautiful open-world wilderness.In this game you will encounter a great antagonist, a disappointing boss fight, interesting character development and a lot of kick♥♥♥♥♥action.While some parts may be cheesy or rather silly, I enjoyed the story very, very much.It managed to hook me and immerse me deeply in it.Cons: Uplay / supporting Ubisoft.

												What can I honestly say?This game will probably always remain as one of my favourite games of all time. It's just absolutely extraordinary! There is so much to do. I could burn down a drugs farm with a flamethrower, stroll around the beautiful landscape shooting pirates with a shotgun or go hunting for animals with a bow. Not to mention the main storyline is just mindblowing.My only complaint is that the Steam edition requires Uplay to run it which is kind of a waste of CPU usage in my opinion. Why can't they just run it off only Steam? However Uplay is required for most Ubisoft games on PC. Also, the textures can occasionaly glitch but that isn't too much of a problem.So my suggestion to all of you? BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT! Not on sale? BUY IT! On sale? BUY IT AND BUY COPIES FOR FRIENDS AND BUY DLC AND BUY IT AGAIN!			"

												A great game! The story was pretty decent and the environments looked amazing. The world was open enough to be fun without being so large that you wound up hating it. I also liked having the freedom to choose between tackling an objective/outpost stealthily or just running in guns blazing. The co-op missions were pretty fun and challenging, but they are much more linear than single player and don't allow for any exploring as you play.			"

												This game is one of the, if not THE best game in the I have ever played. The story, the graphics, the weapons, the overall gameplay were just amazing. So much detailed, high paced action that will get you hooked onto this game in a flash. They spent a lot of time while making, and it really payed off. As you progress throughout the game, you unlock more and more powerful and fun to use weapons which you can customize to your liking. This game also has a lot of skills and abilities that you can unlock that really pay off in some of the harder missions. Overall, this intense, detailed, addicting game has a lot of choices that can make or break your ease throughout the story line, but really can pay off. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a thriller, heart-stopping action packed game, 10/10.			"

												Words cannot describe the sheer epicness of this game.The campaign's story is centered around Jason Brody and his friends who get lost and then kidnapped in the fictional Rook Island between the Indian and Pacific oceans. The story is well-done and the scope of the islands is amazing. There are many collectibles to collect such as relics and memory cards and they will surely add up more gameplay hours.Gameplay is smooth and can be split into 2 parts: stealth, and utter chaos of great guns and 'splotions :)The soundtrack and music in this game are very fitting and energetic; they breathe life into the world. As many reviewers and sites suggest, both the multiplayer and co-op modes feel tacked on and therefore are forgettable.If you want to experience a great open world game with tight first-person combat and platforming in a survival-themed story, then this game is for you. 9.4/10  "

Posted: December 11, 2013
												TL;DR- Far Cry 3 manages to improve on its predecessor without abandoning most of its basic mechanics. Does have a ridiculous plot that is terribly handled at the end. I had a love/hate relationship with Far Cry 2. I loved the weapons, the world, and the combat. But I hated the way the place was populated only by people who wanted to kill you on sight (except for in the closed cities). I didn't like the way enemies respawned automatically and the beautiful world was somewhat marred when I couldn't enjoy a senic boat ride without getting sniper fire, even though I'd crushed that outpost five minutes earlier. Unlocking weapons tended to be a bit tedious as well, though it was worth it to get some of the best ones. The mortar in FC2 is one of my favorite weapons in ANY game. It took patience to figure out, but once mastered it could be used to desolate an enemy encampment in dramatic fashion.FC3 keeps the nice variety of weapons, with the facepalming exception of the above-mentioned mortar. I guess it was unbalancing because of how useful it could be against outposts, but I still wish they had left it in somewhere. Vehicles are still fun, as are boats, plus handgliding is actually a bit more doable in this game- even useful when the game doesn't cheat and turn on the invisible walls for missions. Best of all, not everyone is out to kill you at all times. There are different factions in the game and only MOST want to kill you at any one time! You can actually see battles between the different factions where you can help one over the other. When you take out an enemy outpost, it stays down... unless you decide to revert them back to enemy control so you can have fun blowing them up again- a neat option by the devs to placate both sides of the 'respawning enemies' argument. Plus they've added carnivors. If you remember in FC2 they made some kind of hand-waving statement that they couldn't do that because it would wreck the simulation... or something. Well this time they said ""screw it, add more tigers!"" Bravo. There are a lot of gimmicks in the game. You can blow open the cages of conveniently placed animals to screw with enemies, use hand-gliders or zip lines that just happen to be near enemy outposts, or... all sorts of other stuff that sometimes gets a little old. But there's enough variety that the fun makes up for the head-scratching about why the redshirts don't learn not to leave a man-eating tiger around the middle of their base. There are plenty of unscripted surprises (the first time a croc tries to eat you, for example... happens to everyone) and the whole thing is just a fun romp. The plot... well, I don't really care much about the plot. They botched it a bit by having the sub-enemy be more interesting than anyone else in the game, and there's a lot of trippy psycadelic fight scenes. The free-form part of the game is the draw. There are some RPG elements that really don't need to be there and don't serve much purpose, other than to seemingly check off a box on the list of things every game is supposed to have... but it's not a big deal.Also a shame is the lack of a day-night cycle as in FC2. It worked so nicely and could have been used to great effect here with easier stealth at night and movement by day, or some other trade-off mechanic. Much of the plot is also nonsensical and a QTE torture scene is so hamfisted I had to roll my eyes when the protagonist looks at his hands afterwards. The whole plotlineis a contrived piece of garbage that could have been solved by your character or his combat-knife equipped buddy just killing the Big Bad who is sitting three feet away and jumping out a window... the same kind of thing you can do at every other part of the game that isn't a cutscene. But instead you have to wait until another QTE-ridden dream sequence... or something... to finish him off. Then have an awful on-rails sequence that, again, makes no sense and seems to be there just to annoy the player. Oh, and combine that with an escort mission. And the escorted person is a moron who seems to purposely get you shot down. The plot is a necessary evil. The way its handled is... well, an unnecesary evil. Frankly the entire last mission arc is crap. But FC3's island is worth the price of admission... maybe be smarter than I was and just ignore everything after the second island gets unlocked, plot-wise.			"

FAR CRY 3: HORY SHETIt's been a while since I've really gotten into a game. The last case of that was probably Half-Life 2, which we got our last bite of nearly 10 years ago. {insert obligatory half life 3 joke here}But having now finished Far Cry 3, with one of the toughest end-of-game desicions ever, one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard, spot on gameplay, graphics to make even the toughest console bigot consider switching platforms and characters that, while zany and in character insane at times (Yaas, vaas) seem real.Far Cry 3 is a Survival Adventure Exploration Collect-Em-Up First Person Mission Based Open Word Stealth Shooter based on a fictional archipelago overtaken by pirates and trafficers, forcing the natives into timid hiding. You play as Jason Brody, a rich tw@t who has a rich tw@t brother with a pilot's license who goes skydiving over said archipelago with his friends only to be captured by the pirates and sent to Vaas's camp. After a monologue from Vaas himself, which exists purely to set the plot and show how insane he really is, you manage to escape into the jungle, after Vaas kills one of your friends (Shut up, it's hardly a spoiler. It happens in the first five bloody minutes) You then find yourself in a hut with the Tatau, the game's major mechanic. As you gain XP throughout the game for progressing in the story, harvesting plants, gathering leathers, hunting, and taking over enemy territory you get Skill Points which you can then use to get upgrades for yourself, which ranges from things such as moving a bit faster when sneaking with CTRL to perfoming chained silent kills on groups of enemies in a few seconds like it's Arkham Night (but it isn't because nobody cares about that game anymore)You can craft equipment for yourself too, such as larger backpacks, larger wallets (because ♥♥♥♥ putting your money in, like, your bag or your pockets amirite) or questionably HIV-free health syringes from literally any plant as long as it's green. You can also claim enemy territory by liberating it's camp, which awards you with more XP for not being detected and not having the alarm sounded, and you can climb radio towers and activate them, clearing the map and unlocking/making free some of the weapons in the stores. You can buy weapons, equip certain loadouts and combinations for your play style, get upgrades such as larger magazines and sights, as well as camo for the discerning rebellius californian murderer.You can go looking for relics, treasures, ruins, tombs, and much more. The archipelago and it's inhabitants have a rich history, and the plot itself becomes immersive and deep, with more plot twists than M. Night Shyamalan with a cloning machine. Boss fights take place in what I often refer to as the Weed Sphere (weird psycadellic environments that are really hard to explain with text and text alone) and missions are sometimes addmittidley a little broken, buggy, or outright boring, but most of the time action packed, fun, and intuitive.Far Cry 3 gets a BUY THIS GAME ALREADY / 10.

												Игра меня поразила. Ни одной минуты нельзя проиграть без укуса, стрельбы, бодания, толкания и кидания в вас чего нибудь. Пространство игры большое, полностью свободноые действия, даже после конца игры. Сюжет замечательный, графика отлична, выбор концовки присутствует, как и сетевая игра вместе с друзьями или против них. Совеетую для любителей шутеров и *екса от первого лица О_О. Короче, игра стоит того....моих...800 рублей..., да ладно, я рад, что потратил их) (9/10).			"

												This is a long overdue review that I should have published last year after playing the game:I pre-purchased and pre-loaded this game at full price. I was so disappointed in the game that I felt like I wasted the $60 I paid. The game itself seemed to be quite buggy and it even prevented me from playing it at full quality. Due to the fact that I have ATI drivers and not Nvidia, the game itself would not go over 15-25 frames at a resolution of 1600x900 on low quality. When this game came out I was playing BF3 and Max Payne 3 at ultra settings getting 45-60 frames. There was no reason that this game should have been performing as terribly as it was. I even contacted Ubisoft customer support to resolve the issue I was having. All they told me was the typical stuff such as update drivers etc. I had already done the basics and they couldn't offer more help except to casually claim there would be an update soon. It was an update that never came. The game was s*** and you guys obviously didn't care. All you cared about was raking in the cash while you could. ATI users were screwed and it was plain to see that it was just an overall bad port to PC. Just like the recent Watch_Dogs, lots of PC users were left sitting with a game that didn't operate up to the specs they claimed originally. Now let's talk about the multiplayer. What was that trash? Attempting to create a fun or at least competitive multiplayer seemed none existant. The multiplayer probably should have been left out of this shiny gem. The map editor was fun, thanks for allowing me to make maps for a terrible multiplayer. Far Cry 2 wasn't the greatest but at least it was broken like the multiplayer and coop was for 3. And coop was not necessary at all. Again it was attempted to make a competitive/fun coop by allowing up to 4 players to run amuk. The only problem was the coop was close to being a rail shooter due to how linear it was setup. Making an ""open world"" game closed for coop was probably one of the dumber decisions you could have made in this game.[Spoilers ahead]So the story you guys made, it was okay I guess. It had some merits but some of it seemed quite childish and silly mostly. You play a typical white guy who despite his stupid rich friends seems to be able to pick up any gun and just blow away the baddies like it's no big deal at all. Later some how you become the leader of a bunch of islanders and start a revolution, while also tripping major balls on drugs and fighting weird tiki monsters that look absolutely ridiculous. Oh and let's not forget all the while this story is happening you are killing hundreds of endangered species and taking their hides to make a bigger wallet to store the money you take off the bodies of the hundreds of mercs you laid waste to. If you weren't busy skinning a giant helpless tortoise or gliding around oddly placed japanese bunkers you were likely blowing up outpost after outpost slowly boring yourself to death. Overall the story seemed way far fetched and just ridiculous. Who will you choose at the end? Your stupid rich friends, or your new crazy islander wackos. The choice is up to you bucko! Oh boy it's over, thank you!So to conclude my review of this game. Thank you for a bad port to PC, again. Thank you for not catering to all drivers in the PC gaming world, again. And lastly thank you for wasting $60 of my hard earned money, again.			"

So overall the purchase would 10/10 on sale as i got it for a couple of bucks where i live!			"

												Far Cry 3 provides an epic story about a friendly vacation gone wrong. Jason Brody is your typical youngster who's only care is to party hard, but circumstance force him into a situation where this boy must jump on the fast path to manhood.The graphics of Far Cry 3 are simply stunning. This latest edition goes back to its original roots of lush island landscapes. The scenery is fantastic. As day changes to night and the rain starts pouring down, it provides a sense of realism that is rarely accomplished in many games today. Characters are amazingly detailed and the interaction with them add to that sense of realism. Vaas and Hoyt are two sick son of a ♥♥♥♥♥es that keep tensions high and continually throw unexpected twists your way. The different variety of vehicles like hang gliders, jet skis, and dune buggies make exploration fun, while sprinting is fast enough that it provides a reasonable alternative to using vehicles at all. The large variety of weapons allow for a full range of games styles, from stealth play to I'm here to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. I actually played very stealthily in the early parts of the game as the bow and arrow was probably hands down my favorite overall weapon, but later on I just overpowered my opponents with sheer firepower. I found both methods equally satisfying.Side missions are initially fun, but ultimately become repetitious after a while because they don't offer enough differences. Liberate enemy camps, expand your overall field of vision by claiming back radio towers, assassinate key figures, and hunt wild game. Hunting and skinning animals is necessary to upgrade your standard equipment. It goes well with the island paradise and doesn't heavily disrupt from the primary story.Three categories of character skills are available to promote stealth, firepower, and survival. Missions reward stealth gameplay with more XP which I don't necessarily agree with because it tends to steer your gameplay in that direction. I was able to unlock all available skills by the story's end. There's also crafting of drugs using flowers collected which can increase various attributes for a limited time.I found the menu system to be the weakest part of the game. It feels overly cumbersome since you have to escape out of the game to craft syringes or use skill points. It just doesn't feel like it was integrated well overall.All-in-all, Far Cry 3 represents a really fun open world first person shooter. Single player is genuinely fun, but I have yet to play the co-op or multiplayer elements.			"

												Nonserious review: Went flamethrower bear hunting. Died. 11/9Serious review: Far Cry 3. I've played Far Cry 2 before on Xbox 360 and liked it, but got bored since all the missions are essentially the same. Go somewhere shoot it up, occasionally die of Malaria. But this one I played every day since I had it download. Let's start with pros, neutrals, and cons.~Pros+Variety. The missions vary from hunting some animals to killing a bunch of dudes while ziplining to them, and trying to blow up a bridge with an RPG at the same time.+Graphics. Stunning graphics, even on the lowest possible settings.+Music. So much amazing music, specifically Beethoven.+GUNS! SO MANY GUNS! AAAAAAHAHAHHAAHHAHHAH!+C4. I could be registered with insanity the way I used C4. Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity, by the way?+Vaas. The big bad guy at the beginning. I love love LOVE his character. Too bad he dies. That's not a spoiler, we all knew it would happen. At least I'm not saying when.+Wingsuit. I'm not telling you about this. You get to find out on your own.+Vehicles. In Far Cry 2, the vehicles were smooth, but they were even smoother in this game.+Animals/Wildlife. So many plants and animals, ranging from Cassowarys, crocodiles, to bears.+Largeness. Agoraphobes would be terrified. I feel like I just offended a ton of people.+Other characters. All the OTHER characters are just so diversified. We got Vaas, the insano, Oliver the stoner, Nick the ""badass"" who really isn't at all. So diversified, I feel like that's the wrong term.Netruals:How hard it was to get the lowest possible settings. I had to look up so many tutorials to get to this, but in the end, I got a smooth 10 frames. Look, it's smooth in my eyes as long as it doesn't stutter. I GREW UP ON CONSOLE STOP JUDGING ME!Cons:-Jason Brody. Jason starts off as a cowardly whimpering baby who can't stand even an evil person dying, which I liked, but later on becomes insane and likes killing, which I don't. He starts out saying, ""Oh ♥♥♥♥! He's dead!"" to, ""HE'S MOVING! BURN HIM, PUT ALL THE EXPLOSIVES ON HIM, MAKE SURE HE'S DEAAAAAAAD! RAAAAA BLOOOOOOOD!""-The endings. At the very end you have the left click option and the right click option. They both give seperate options. Nothing that happened before matters, just which button you click.-OH GOD NO! I'M REMEMBERING THE BOSS FIGHTS! GAAAAH. But seriously. The boss fights, which luckily there are only 3 of, are QTE's not including Vaas. Vaas is different, which I like.-How hard it was to come by money. I didn't do the sidequests during my campaign play, so it was super hard for me to get money, which I needed.-Uplay. 'Nuf said.So, in the end, was it worth the ten bucks getting the Far Cry Franchise Pack? Absolutely. Is it worth whatever it's priced at? Definitely. What would I rate it? 9/10. Yep.

												I finished the game. I bought the game during a Steam sale. I definitely got a bargain and I highly recommend this game.I was pleasantly surprised that Far Cry 3 drew me into the story and sandbox game features. Although the ""trippy"" stuff was annoying, I could see the need for these ""trips"" to add to the story development.Some spoilers:- The radar towers were like jumping puzzles. Each unique, but not too crazy.- The safari hunts were interesting, albeit annoying. Bow and arrow to hunt down 1-shot kill tigers was irritating. At least rare animals could help build your character carrying capacity.- The combat was flexible and kept me interested. All of the camps/compounds were different in their own way. The takedown sequences were difficult to navitate due to guards no cooperating with my rock throwing. But overall, one of the best tactical semi-stealth combat games I played in a while.- Driving is fun and the terrain challenging. - The weapons were good, although I would have liked more silencer-type weapons near end-game.

												I love this game! more of an RPG than anything, overcoming obstacles, unlocking guns and moves. you kind of have to do all the missions to level up to over come the bad guys. I almost skipped this one, but it was $3.75, so why not? glad i never did, I am only a casual gamer, but this is a great way to waste my time. requires a bit of stealth and knowing when to run away and pick em off one at a time. highly recommended if you love RPG style FPS like borderlands.

												TL;DR- Far Cry 3 manages to improve on its predecessor without abandoning most of its basic mechanics. Does have a ridiculous plot that is terribly handled at the end. I had a love/hate relationship with Far Cry 2. I loved the weapons, the world, and the combat. But I hated the way the place was populated only by people who wanted to kill you on sight (except for in the closed cities). I didn't like the way enemies respawned automatically and the beautiful world was somewhat marred when I couldn't enjoy a senic boat ride without getting sniper fire, even though I'd crushed that outpost five minutes earlier. Unlocking weapons tended to be a bit tedious as well, though it was worth it to get some of the best ones. The mortar in FC2 is one of my favorite weapons in ANY game. It took patience to figure out, but once mastered it could be used to desolate an enemy encampment in dramatic fashion.FC3 keeps the nice variety of weapons, with the facepalming exception of the above-mentioned mortar. I guess it was unbalancing because of how useful it could be against outposts, but I still wish they had left it in somewhere. Vehicles are still fun, as are boats, plus handgliding is actually a bit more doable in this game- even useful when the game doesn't cheat and turn on the invisible walls for missions. Best of all, not everyone is out to kill you at all times. There are different factions in the game and only MOST want to kill you at any one time! You can actually see battles between the different factions where you can help one over the other. When you take out an enemy outpost, it stays down... unless you decide to revert them back to enemy control so you can have fun blowing them up again- a neat option by the devs to placate both sides of the 'respawning enemies' argument. Plus they've added carnivors. If you remember in FC2 they made some kind of hand-waving statement that they couldn't do that because it would wreck the simulation... or something. Well this time they said ""screw it, add more tigers!"" Bravo. There are a lot of gimmicks in the game. You can blow open the cages of conveniently placed animals to screw with enemies, use hand-gliders or zip lines that just happen to be near enemy outposts, or... all sorts of other stuff that sometimes gets a little old. But there's enough variety that the fun makes up for the head-scratching about why the redshirts don't learn not to leave a man-eating tiger around the middle of their base. There are plenty of unscripted surprises (the first time a croc tries to eat you, for example... happens to everyone) and the whole thing is just a fun romp. The plot... well, I don't really care much about the plot. They botched it a bit by having the sub-enemy be more interesting than anyone else in the game, and there's a lot of trippy psycadelic fight scenes. The free-form part of the game is the draw. There are some RPG elements that really don't need to be there and don't serve much purpose, other than to seemingly check off a box on the list of things every game is supposed to have... but it's not a big deal.Also a shame is the lack of a day-night cycle as in FC2. It worked so nicely and could have been used to great effect here with easier stealth at night and movement by day, or some other trade-off mechanic. Much of the plot is also nonsensical and a QTE torture scene is so hamfisted I had to roll my eyes when the protagonist looks at his hands afterwards. The whole plotlineis a contrived piece of garbage that could have been solved by your character or his combat-knife equipped buddy just killing the Big Bad who is sitting three feet away and jumping out a window... the same kind of thing you can do at every other part of the game that isn't a cutscene. But instead you have to wait until another QTE-ridden dream sequence... or something... to finish him off. Then have an awful on-rails sequence that, again, makes no sense and seems to be there just to annoy the player. Oh, and combine that with an escort mission. And the escorted person is a moron who seems to purposely get you shot down. The plot is a necessary evil. The way its handled is... well, an unnecesary evil. Frankly the entire last mission arc is crap. But FC3's island is worth the price of admission... maybe be smarter than I was and just ignore everything after the second island gets unlocked, plot-wise.			"

FAR CRY 3: HORY SHETIt's been a while since I've really gotten into a game. The last case of that was probably Half-Life 2, which we got our last bite of nearly 10 years ago. {insert obligatory half life 3 joke here}But having now finished Far Cry 3, with one of the toughest end-of-game desicions ever, one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard, spot on gameplay, graphics to make even the toughest console bigot consider switching platforms and characters that, while zany and in character insane at times (Yaas, vaas) seem real.Far Cry 3 is a Survival Adventure Exploration Collect-Em-Up First Person Mission Based Open Word Stealth Shooter based on a fictional archipelago overtaken by pirates and trafficers, forcing the natives into timid hiding. You play as Jason Brody, a rich tw@t who has a rich tw@t brother with a pilot's license who goes skydiving over said archipelago with his friends only to be captured by the pirates and sent to Vaas's camp. After a monologue from Vaas himself, which exists purely to set the plot and show how insane he really is, you manage to escape into the jungle, after Vaas kills one of your friends (Shut up, it's hardly a spoiler. It happens in the first five bloody minutes) You then find yourself in a hut with the Tatau, the game's major mechanic. As you gain XP throughout the game for progressing in the story, harvesting plants, gathering leathers, hunting, and taking over enemy territory you get Skill Points which you can then use to get upgrades for yourself, which ranges from things such as moving a bit faster when sneaking with CTRL to perfoming chained silent kills on groups of enemies in a few seconds like it's Arkham Night (but it isn't because nobody cares about that game anymore)You can craft equipment for yourself too, such as larger backpacks, larger wallets (because ♥♥♥♥ putting your money in, like, your bag or your pockets amirite) or questionably HIV-free health syringes from literally any plant as long as it's green. You can also claim enemy territory by liberating it's camp, which awards you with more XP for not being detected and not having the alarm sounded, and you can climb radio towers and activate them, clearing the map and unlocking/making free some of the weapons in the stores. You can buy weapons, equip certain loadouts and combinations for your play style, get upgrades such as larger magazines and sights, as well as camo for the discerning rebellius californian murderer.You can go looking for relics, treasures, ruins, tombs, and much more. The archipelago and it's inhabitants have a rich history, and the plot itself becomes immersive and deep, with more plot twists than M. Night Shyamalan with a cloning machine. Boss fights take place in what I often refer to as the Weed Sphere (weird psycadellic environments that are really hard to explain with text and text alone) and missions are sometimes addmittidley a little broken, buggy, or outright boring, but most of the time action packed, fun, and intuitive.Far Cry 3 gets a BUY THIS GAME ALREADY / 10.

												In the past, Far Cry's vision of a first-person shooter RPG where you explore, master and then control your environment has always been more seductive on paper than any of its developers have managed to deliver on disc. Far Cry 3 changes all that. For me, this is the new apex predator of open-world shooters.			"

												Far Cry 3 is an outstanding example of open world game design. Fuctioning both as a great shooter and a competant stealth game, it constantly finds new ways to excite and surprise you. The story can be hit or miss but it gets the job done. And really, when you're setting pot fields ablaze with Skrillix blaring in the background do you NEED to know why?			"

												Far cry 3 is a very good game in general and you can visibly see all the good game design decisions. Its setting is a strong point- showing off just how well the developers worked to create a living-breathing environment that you can become completely immersed in. Graphically, it is very aesthetically pleasing but can be very taxing on older machines.Gameplay-wise it mostly fluid and intuitive, with a good, solid movement system and shooting mechanics designed for fast paced but skillful shooting. However it came become a pain to quickly move in and out of vehicles and healing yourself can become a serious pain.Few games can claim to have a story I've given 2 half-baked waffles about but Far Cry 3 has quite a good story. With engaging charater arcs and plot twists that twist the plot for once. The story is all very tight and works well with the rest of the game.However, while I don't want to spoil the ending too much, it's one of the only parts where the game lets itself down.The final mission of the game is split two ways - Flying from the enemy base in a helicopter to 'Ride of the valkyries' in an epic mounted turret section- then going through some boring tibal love drama nonsence. Then you pick if you want to be with your friends and escape or with Citra- the tribe leader. Its a sort of moral choice sequence with no moral choice. The 'friend end' is the only real end as the other one just ruins most of the stories believeability.			"

												  Far Cry 3 definitely had some good things going for it, but it still was not without its faults.  Combat was fun, stealth play was done well enough for those that enjoy it, and I loved the open world.  Oh, and of course, the RPG elements were a welcome addition, even though choice is limited to unlock order and I reached the level cap well before the end of the game.  Unfortunately, enemy A.I. was mediocre, and when it came to stealth, enemies seemed either virturally blind or able to see through cover, depending on their type (pirates (red) v. privateers (yellow)).  Oh, and the boss fights kind of sucked.  My biggest complaint, however, would be that the game had a lot of filler content (Trials of the Rakyat, Tower Unlocks, Outpost Cleared, Supply Drops, Path of the Hunter Missions, Wanted Dead Missions, Letters Found, and Relics Found).  It was fun at first, but by about half way through, I was just doing that stuff to get the unlocks & experience (and because I'm kind of OCD about that kind of stuff).  It just started to get old by the time you've hunted down the 120th relic or did the 23rd Path of the Hunter.  I guess that's better than a short game or an empty world, but I would have like to have seen more variety with this content -well, assuming it was done well, of course; most of the side missions, were already rather forgettable.  Story missions, on the other hand, were varied and quite fun.  Overall, I'd recommend the game, especially if you can pick it up for cheap during a sale.  Combat is satisfying, the story missions are fun, and unlocking new weapons and abilities changes things up and helps to make you feel like a badass.  The a.i. could have been better and the filler content gets a little old after a while, but then again, you can always do as little or as much as you like.  I also had a few other minor gripes (like the ease at which to take fall damage, crappy inventory system, many npc's looking the same, etcetera), but I don't think they detract enough from the game to warrant getting into.  7 out of 10 stars.

												This game is one of the true cases of real freedom. Not just because it's open world. Not just because ther's lots of things to shoot. And not just because if you get bored you can hurl yourself off a cliff. No, the devs of this game really went the extra mile.For example, the hunting. Yes, you can slowly sneak up on deer before blasting it with a shotgun (if you're boring), or you can grab a flamethrower and molotov cocktails, light a section of forest on fire, and when a bear or pig runs past you trying to escape, you can stab it multiple times in the back.Also, there's a lot of side quests. From finding a missing suicidal teen to seeing how many komodo dragons you can kill with one clip of pistol ammo, there's always something to keep you busy. Also, certain non-essential tasks can help you in the long run. Sure, it may seem boring to climb various towers to reactivate old cell phone beacons, but it'll all pay off when the air fills with smoke and you can still see every one of the dudes you are about to terminate.Which brings me, yes, to the combat. The combat in this game is fantastic, and filled with variety. You can rip a dude's neck out and leave him out to be discovered by already terrified pirates; you can lure over a pack of wild dogs and let Mother Nature do the work. Hell, you can just run up to a guy and beat him over and over with a blowtorch, until he either dies of trauma or lights on fire.A personal favourite of mine was to kill a helicopter pilot while he hovered over an enemy outpost, causing the vehicle to spiral out of control, crushing both the pirates and presumably two or three tigers.Overall, this game gets a solid plus. It's Rambo, Terminator and Tomb Raider squished into one, and I love it.God help me, I love it.			"

												'Do you know the defenition of insanity?'You won't have until you play this game. It's honestly incredible. At the moment of writing this review, it's my favourite game. In my opinion, it's better than the entire Just Cause, Assassin's Creed, Halo, Call of Duty, HITMAN and the rest of the Far Crys' franchises.Characters: 9/10The Characters in this game are truly stunning. Vaas and Hoyt are terryfying villians who you won't forget any time soon. They both do thinks to you and their men which will make you wince. Jason Brody is also an intresting charcters who progresses throughout the game. Citra, Buck and Denis have great voice actors and intresting characteristics, even if they are not as fleshed out as tthe main villians and heroes. Plot and Story: 9/10The plot is pretty straight forward. It's a revenege thriller focused around a character who ,at the beginning of the game, couldn't even fire a gun. However, the story takes the plot and mixes it with great missions and intresting stories. Even though the game is a FPS, Action shooter, it's very much based around choices and philoshpy. The story is what takes Far Cry 3 to great heights.Combat: 8.5/10Combat may not be the best aspect of FC3, but it's still really fun. Liberating bases with a sniper rifle will never get old. However, combat becomes difficult with different guns. Assult Rifles do little to no damage, while a handgun kills the man instantly. Also, Headshots sometimes don't insta-kill, which is a big nusiance. Open World and Side-Missions: 9/10The Open World of FC3 is amazing. It's so vast and detailed it makes it feel like a 2015 game, not a 2012. There are so many things to do after completing the main campain; Radio Towers, Bases, Wanted: Dead, Path of the hunter, Trials of the Rakyat, Story missions, Relics, Letters of the lost, Memory Cards, Skills, etc.. And they are all really funDLC: 7/10Read my review here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/dank_coder/recommended/226459/Soundtrack: 10/10Just listen to this song from a mission where you get to burn down a Weed Field (yes a Weed Field!): Make it Bun - SkrillexYeah, it's great, right???Price: 9/10The Price is quite good considering how excellent the game is. Normal Pice: £15.99 ($20.00-ish)Sale Price: £5.59 ($8.00-ish)Overall: 61.5/70 - 88%Overall: 8.7/10Just get this game. It's amazingFavourite Quotes: 'Do you know what is the best way of keeping employees in check: Fear''His name is Buck, and he lkes to f-'''You are me. And I am you.'Are you F***ING DEAF?

												Apart Uplay annoyance and a lot of ""Downloading online data"", ""updating uplay"" and ""sinchronyzings"", this is a good game. At first time I thought about buy Deluxe edition, not for advanced weapons unlocking, but because I like to get game extra contents like soundtrack. But after visit game forums and knowing lot of people having problem with deluxe key activation or access deluxe content, I thought again and got the standard version just to avoid possible problems and frustrations. About Uplay, it's very annoyance, even it works for me until now, I didn't like that. Because this I have no plan to buy another game that uses uplay. Sorry Ubisoft, your games are great, but you need to improve your uplay/drm. If you're thinking about buy this game, it's a great game, it's worth specially if the game is on sale. But I recommend you visit the game forums first, cos' it seems lot of people have problems related to uplay, key adctivation, deluxe key and content. The feature of ""save game"", also, doesn't work well, or at least doesn't work as expected, or as work in other games.Far Cry 3 = great game, lots of fun, but Uplay = annoyance.edit after +70 hours: one of the best game I played. I think to play again from the begining, this game is awesome!			"

(personal opinion) maybe in the future i'll play it again.			"

												At one point I thought I would never actually finish this game because of how huge the world was.  I’m really glad I’ve changed my mind and decided to continue playing. The story is great and game-play is solid and versatile. I took me a while to finish every side-mission, to find all of the collectables and complete all achievements. It was worth it. I really enjoyed exploring the world and learning its history. Finding out what is happening around me, what I have been dragged in to - was the most satisfying part of the game.In addition to the single-player, Ubisoft have added a multiplayer and a co-op. I have really enjoyed them both. The co-op has its own characters and a brand new story. The multiplayer is fun a fast paced - the more you play the more weapons/upgrades you unlock.My verdict - Get it on one of the steam sales - you will not regret it. I haven’t. "

												Far Cry 3 Game is a tale of a small boy who goes to a big island, and ends up becoming a big island (boy) himself. In the beginning you are nothing but a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who likes to make whimpy noises during the skinning of a wide array of animals, including (but not limited to): goat and bear. When the game is over you still do that, so I guess Jason (character name) learned nothing. As the only white man on the island (except for a few crazy ones) you are naturally the hero, and your cool friend is black, so the game is not racist. Jason's girlfriend is pretty good looking but she is too annoying so I do not care about her. I give this game a ""pretty good"" out of possible ""extremely good"".			"

												Having never played any prior games in the Far Cry series, I wasn't sure what to expect when I first opened up this game and got stuck into it. My lack of experience with other games in the series probably made it difficult for me to begin with as  I wasn't sure what to do or the direction I was meant to head and hence after a few hours accumulated, I put the game away and tried something else.However, upon returning to the game I stuck with it and what followed was an exciting story line and great game play.If you like FPS, a solid and lengthy story line, good character progression and an open world experience that gives you the ability to do as you wish, I suggest you buy this game.I was pleasently surprised with this game and wouldn't hesitate to buy others in the series. You can rush the story line or you can complete other missions and mini games that the open world experience offers you. Rather than give a score out of 10, I merely suggest you try this game and decide for yourself. One of my favourite games to have played and indulged in.			"

												Far Cry 3 has many glaring issues. The most immediate is the horrific and broken Uplay DRM that is forced, despite this being the steam version of the game. The only upgrades in this game compared to it's predecessor are the graphics, voice acting, and general production values. The writing is simply laughable, quite possibly one of the worst stories I have experienced, the fact that Jeffrey Yohalem got nominated for a BAFTA for this game goes to show that becoming a writer in the modern video game industry requires only the bare minimum of credentials. I'm not even going to go into the plot because it's basically non existent beyond ""Uh hey he's bad, let's get em'! *takes shrooms*"" The only character that has even marginally interesting writing is Vaas, and they hyped him up so much prerelease that practically every single one of his lines can be found in a trailer, and without his VA's fantastic performance it would probably not be half as interesting. Jason Brody & Co. are so obnoxious, that they are for all intents and purposes, a parody of themselves. Jason Brody, whose name itself is cringeworthy, goes from sheltered rich junkie ♥♥♥♥♥boy to a v-neck and tribal tattoo-clad hard ""killer"" within the space of one mission and an overall story mode that lasts about two weeks in game time that is divided up into chapters, which we are greeted by with loading screens with forced ""Alice in Wonderland"" excerpts that aren't actually relevant to the story beyond ""Woohoo I'm wacky, crazy, and insane Haha!"". The game's theme of insanity is not explored or expounded upon, just stated over and over again, no really, they just keep telling you the webster-merriam definition of the word. The irony is almost next level.  The shooting mechanics are vastly improved in this iteration with a few exceptions. 1. There is virtually no recoil on any of the weapons 2. Most if not all of the gun sounds, are in fact, not gun shots. Which in this day and age for a AAA game with a massive budget, is simply not acceptable, the PKM sound is like a note from a skrillex song. Despite Far Cry 2's ""Heart of Darkness"" derivative story, and cheap voice acting, the choose-able silent protagonists of varying backgrounds including ex-KLA members and IRA insurgents is able to be taken much, much more seriously in it's African setting that is reflective of the varying local wars and conflicts fueled by ethnic and religious tensions, blood minerals, and separatist sentiments that are and have been occuring for the past 50 or so years in Africa. So basically unless you just really, really like playing as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ druggie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with tribal tats that changes personality traits more often than my insane bipolar grandmother, and having the NPCs color coded for you to Red = Bad and Blue = Good, pick up Far Cry 2 instead, it has many flaws of its own, but they are acceptable given the context that they are symptoms of its age and budget. Far Cry 3 does everything it does in the most pedestrian and shallow approach the devs could have taken from the UI to the story.			"

Kid (player) gets a magical tattoo ""Aztec sleeves"" from a crazy Bob Marley fan (Shortly after having escaped a lunatic with a mohawk). Overnight he learns how to skin animals and make crafting gear along with throwing knives and shooting multiple weapon types. Suddenly he becomes the islands first ever Rambo in Penny Loafers out to save his friends.Pro's: Excellent graphics and single play shooter. Semi-interesting storyline.Con's: Mature content with a very teenage style gameplay that takes, what could be an awesome boss fight, and turns it into a dance dance revolution button masher. ( I suppose it's to cater to people with consoles that need clear definition on how to win).I give it a 7/10			"

												Where do I start? To move forward, we'll have to go back to the beginning. I bought this game when it was first released in 2012 and played it on my PS3. I loved every second of it, and I'm not exaggerating. The most interesting thing about Far Cry 3 is that it puts the player in life or death situations, which, in turn, throw you down a deep rabbit hole of insanity. It's a really, really good game, if you can even get it to work. We all know the horror stories centred around Ubisoft's relentlessy game-breaking service, Uplay (cue the screams). I, originally being a console player who just recently got a PC powerful enough to run games like these, thought it would be good idea to buy this game again. It was on sale after all, and I thought I would be spending countless hours rediscovering the gritty, violent, and chaotic land of Rakyat. But, UPLAY GOT ME ♥♥♥♥ED UP. WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ ASKED FOR UPLAY? HOW WAS IT EVEN CONCEIVED? WHO IN ♥♥♥♥'S NAME THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD ♥♥♥♥ING IDEA TO ATTACH A GREAT GAME TO SUCH A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ SERVICE? WHO IN ♥♥♥♥'S NAME EVEN THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO CREATE THE DAMN THING?! SO MANY QUESTIONS WITHOUT ANSWERS AND I NOW WISH TO BE KILLED.			"

												This game... This game is one of the best games I have ever played.  I always find myself wanting to play this game.  The story in Far Cry 3 is one of the best stories that I have experienced in a first person shooter, ever.  It is very deep and well done and it requires you to make game changing decisions.  As you progress through the game, secrets of Rook Island are revealed and you can even find notes from World War II.  The graphics in this game are outstanding.  They still manage to compete with modern day titles, such as CoD and more of the less graphics intensive games of the modern era.  The controls are easy to use and very responsive.  The free roam in this game is extremely enjoyable.  There are so many activities you can do such as side missions, hunting, and even time trial racing.  On top of that you can reclaim the island by re activationg the radio towers and claiming pirate outposts.  The crafting system is pretty well made, allowing you to make syringes that enhance your skill in hunting, mobility, and swimming.  The multiplayer is not so great.  It kind of sucks lol.  It is dead and overall not very well made.  I look forward to Far Cry 4's co op campaign feature.  Overall this is a great game and I would reccomend it to anyone.10/10			"

When I was playing the game the Uplay client had a little trouble with the extra content not syncing in the game, but the ubisoft people fixed it for me quite efficently (ymmv, as some people in forums still trying to fix this), nonetheless the game is an insta-buy if it's on sale.

												An almost perfect Open World FPS with crafting and RPG elements. The story is amazing and the acting/voiceover work is probably the best I've ever seen in a game (the guy who plays Vaas is incredible. Best villain EVER). The thing that impressed me most about this game is, you don't have to spend hours of your time crafting an sorting through piles of junk, trying to determine what to keep and what to sell or discard. Junk is easily ""quick sold"" and is explicitly marked as junk so there's no need to feel like you should hold onto it until later in the game when it may come in handy. The only real items of importance when it comes to crafting are animal skins for capacity upgrades (i.e., how much stuff you can carry) and plants for crafting medicines and buffs.Leveling and stat trees are balanced and easily managed. It's possible to gain every skill in the game in a single run through so you don't have to feel like you missed out or ruined your game by taking one skill point over another. Just simply farm up some more XP and get that skill as well.Finally, the graphics are beautiful, even if a bit aged. It's very easy to get totally submersed in the game with the wonderful graphics and beautiful locations, especially considering how great the story is and how amazing the voice and acting talent are (did I mention that Vaas is incredible? Because if there were ever Oscars given to video game actors, he should be the first to receive one). The options menu is deep and extremely configurable, from key layouts to graphics and sound settings. I have a pretty basic bargain-bin laptop (Acer Aspire E 15) with no modifications running the integrated intel HD 4400 with 1792 VM and can get the game to run with a bit of lag at full settings. I run mostly on medium with a few settings set to high, however, and get a constant frame rate of ~30fps (which is great for my non-gaming computer).My only gripe with this game is the soundtrack. It's pretty bland and bear-bones and neither adds nor subtracts from the game. It's just kind of ""there"". It doesn't hinder the experience in any way but I feel with a stronger score or maybe even the addition of some licensed music added during key scenes, it could have added that much more to the submersive experience.Overall, this game is a 9.5 out of 10 which by my grading standards, is practically a 10. I save 10s for the absolute best of the best. Games that not only are damn near perfectly designed and executed and fun to play, but which have also changed the landscape of gaming in general and paved the way for others to follow. The only ""10""s I've played I can count on 2 hands (Super Mario 3 and Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time, Half-Life II, Tetris, Mrs. Pac-Man and maybe a few more I'm forgetting). Far Cry 3 is almost there but, there isn't much here that hasn't already been done before. That said, everything about the game that came from other games, Far Cry 3 put it all together and made it better as a whole than anyone else in it's genre. They took the best parts of games like Borderlands and Fallout and improved upon them in a way that's damn near perfect.			"

Seriously.For some ♥♥♥♥ing reason, this game's is framerate capped to thirty on the first mission. What a great start, eh? Well after that you can expect 20-30fps at any resolution, at any graphical setting.Oh yeah and by the way it appears that this game has some really quite terrible graphical bugs for both SLI and XFire systems, and single card systems. That's much more interesting than staring at your framecounter waiting for the game to become playable. That or staring at a blank screen because the game decided that it was going to♥♥♥♥♥♥itself and die during the first. ♥♥♥♥ing. Mission.			"

												A fun, exciting, and utterly stupid game. Firstly the story barely makes any sense. As a group of preppy rich kids go on an island filled with pirates, which is apparently also a getaway vacationing island, they skydive right into our lovable villian's lap, Vaas. I feel like when they were marketting this game, they made a right call on never showing the main character or his friends and all the advertisements were about the criminally insane Vaas. Everytime I play this game I always think to myself about how much I want to kill the irritating main character, Jason. What really makes no sense to me about this game is how the hell does Jason learn all of these para-military tactics within a minute, after his armed forces brother dies 5 minutes into the game, when he clearly admits that he has never done anything like this or taken a life before. And the whole concept behind a ""magical tattoo"" that gives you strange and mystical powers is just plain stupidity. However, I somehow still really enjoyed this game. The gameplay behind Farcry 3 is amazing. It's a sandbox sort of game filled with so many hostiles, including animals that you're able to hunt for materials. I like the concept of skinning the animals to further your carrying capacities, however I feel that it could've been a bit better. I really did enjoy the fact that there were multiple vehicles whever you went, such as Jeeps, Quads, MG mounted boats,  Jet skis, and sky gliders. Overall the gameplay is superb, but the main character and his story could've used way more help. Vaas is the only saving grace story-wise. Also, the CO-OP mode is essentially a Left 4 Dead copy, where there are 4 players connected to one server, and you get swarmed with hordes of enemies while completing petty objectives.I would've liked to see a better story, but this game easily gets 7/10.

												Lots of people are downvoting this because of uplay. Ignore these people. You can still use steam chat and community stuff in-game, like anything on steam, and especially after you've launched it the first time, it actually just takes you right into the game in all subsequent times. A little annoying? Sure. Reprehensible that a company would release on steam but force the use of a clunkier, in-house client? Definitely. Does it devalue the game experience? Absolutely not. Far Cry 3 is one of the most incredible games I've played in recent memory - it's right up there with Skyrim for me. The net impact of uplay is essentially closing one additional window upon exiting the game; if you let that stop you from enjoying such a phenominal achievement in game development, you frankly deserve to miss out.And trust me - you will be missing out.

No more buying Ubisoft games for PCGreat graphics, Great gameplay, Great story...Overall a great game. You might wonder why I do not recommend the game... The reason is Uplay.I purchased the game during the Steam summer sale. I installed the game, and launched it. I was told to copy a CD key to the clipboard, and I did. When the you click play here, it opens Uplay, (Ubisoft's stupid DRM) making Steam look like a glorified CD key retailer. It prompts you to enter the CD key. When I did, it said my key was already in use. I didn't freak out, I thought it was just a bug. So I tried again, but it still did not work. I was not able to launch the game, so I contacted Ubisoft support, they were not helpful, saying that the code was already redeemed to someone else's account. They suggested I contact Steam instead. I did. Steam told me to contact Ubisoft. None of them helped me. None.I ended up pirating the game to finish it.			"

I won't list the pros and cons, but one thing I know: good value for a very polished game in so many aspects. :)Go watch gameplay on YouTube and see if it is your thing. :DI know this is subjective, but UPlay worked for me when I ran it with GT 240 and now when I run it with GTX 970. :D			"

												Notice how most of the negative review reviews are about uplay? Yeah this is another one. You pay for game, get ready to play, and OOP! Now, you have to download another steam-like platform called Uplay. Except it's worse. It's constantly down, making it impossible for you to play a game that you've already paid money for. Sure, you can play in offline mode, but say goodbye to your saves because they are in the cloud. So I guess you could just try a multiplayer mode-oh wait, no. Nevermind. Uplay is down so you can't do that either. If you don't mind being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then get it. It's a really good game as far as graphics and content. But what would have been a 9/10 is a 4/10 just because of uplay. Don't think that's a fair rating? Buy it and try to deal with Uplay.			"

												Far Cry 3 was one of the top selling games of 2013, and for good reason.  Solid game play, gorgeous open world atmospheres, and beautiful graphics provide a strong base for some of the best acting gaming has ever seen.  There's one reason above all the enjoy this game, and thats for the solid 30 minutes of cutscenes with Michael Mando playing the fantastically insane villian. Game Play  - 9Pros: Fantastic open world, great combat, decent weapon selection, decently competent AI, RPG-like exploratory experience that almost never feels ""grindy"". Hunting big game is awesome, and actually feels like...hunting. Stealth game play is even solid, which tends to feel gimicky and slapped on in these types of games. Generic missions have enough variety to stay fresh. Although I'm focusing on other aspects of the game, this list can go on and there's no denying that the game play in of itself is stellar.Cons:  A few annoying features in terms of design (for example, sometimes picking up items is mixed with weapons switch out since they use the same hotkey). Occasionally weird physics can ruin some immersive moments (why is that giant dead bear rolling and bouncing down a realatively flat surface?). Some seemingly easy to add features were completely unavailable (why can I only move bodies on a special kill?  Why not after they have already dropped to the ground?)Story: 7While much of the story itself wasn't particularly revolutionary, the fact that simply playing the storyline alone can last over twenty hours without feeling repetitive, grindy, or contrived is a feat unto itself.  The motivation feels vague at times, but the clear conflict between the need for violence to save himself and his friends and the consuming negative nature of said violence becomes starkly clear by the final act.Mood/Atmosphere - 9Fantastic jungle renderings, gorgeous mountain ranges, and beautiful lagoons.  The soundtrack compliments the emotion of the landscapes. Certainly a memorable experience. Graphics - 8Solid facial and body animations. While the detail itself wasn't the best I've seen, the motion tracking worked well for creating believable body movements, which complemented the acting. Environments looks great , and the weather effects look stunning even on low settings. The grass effects are simple but effective for stealth game play and hiding the animals in the grass. Sound Design - 7One of my biggest pet peeves of Farcry 2 was the obnoxious looping soundtrack. Farcry 3's score was substantially stronger, and after the game I found myself relistening to the opening theme days later. The rest of the sound design erred on the side of subtlety, to the point that sometimes I didn't even noticed I had been injured because the character didn't make the usual borderline-sexual grunting noises when hurt.  While maybe detracting from some supposed ""realism"", it removed a lot of the audio repetitiveness of the last game which for me was a plus. Acting (special category): 10Few games deserve this as a category seperate from story, but this is where the game really shines. Particularly in the case of Michael Mando, there are arguably few better performances in gaming history. While the story may not be revolutionary, the implemtation of motion capture and performance certainly plays out in an incredible way.  That alone is enough to carry the game.  As a side note, a live action youtube video series was released with Christopher Mintz Plasse and Michael Mando.  You should check it out, its hilarious.Should I play this game?There are few FPS or RPG players who won't enjoy this gaming experience. There's a little bit for everybody, and it's worth the 20 hour play through on the incredible acting and cut scenes alone. "

												Where do I start? To move forward, we'll have to go back to the beginning. I bought this game when it was first released in 2012 and played it on my PS3. I loved every second of it, and I'm not exaggerating. The most interesting thing about Far Cry 3 is that it puts the player in life or death situations, which, in turn, throw you down a deep rabbit hole of insanity. It's a really, really good game, if you can even get it to work. We all know the horror stories centred around Ubisoft's relentlessy game-breaking service, Uplay (cue the screams). I, originally being a console player who just recently got a PC powerful enough to run games like these, thought it would be good idea to buy this game again. It was on sale after all, and I thought I would be spending countless hours rediscovering the gritty, violent, and chaotic land of Rakyat. But, UPLAY GOT ME ♥♥♥♥ED UP. WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ ASKED FOR UPLAY? HOW WAS IT EVEN CONCEIVED? WHO IN ♥♥♥♥'S NAME THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD ♥♥♥♥ING IDEA TO ATTACH A GREAT GAME TO SUCH A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ SERVICE? WHO IN ♥♥♥♥'S NAME EVEN THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO CREATE THE DAMN THING?! SO MANY QUESTIONS WITHOUT ANSWERS AND I NOW WISH TO BE KILLED.			"

												This game... This game is one of the best games I have ever played.  I always find myself wanting to play this game.  The story in Far Cry 3 is one of the best stories that I have experienced in a first person shooter, ever.  It is very deep and well done and it requires you to make game changing decisions.  As you progress through the game, secrets of Rook Island are revealed and you can even find notes from World War II.  The graphics in this game are outstanding.  They still manage to compete with modern day titles, such as CoD and more of the less graphics intensive games of the modern era.  The controls are easy to use and very responsive.  The free roam in this game is extremely enjoyable.  There are so many activities you can do such as side missions, hunting, and even time trial racing.  On top of that you can reclaim the island by re activationg the radio towers and claiming pirate outposts.  The crafting system is pretty well made, allowing you to make syringes that enhance your skill in hunting, mobility, and swimming.  The multiplayer is not so great.  It kind of sucks lol.  It is dead and overall not very well made.  I look forward to Far Cry 4's co op campaign feature.  Overall this is a great game and I would reccomend it to anyone.10/10			"

												Better than Far Cry 4No, really, this is one of my most favourite game of all time, the setting, the soundtrack, everything just done perfectlysure, co-op and MP is just decent, but its SP game. what do you expect?however, Far cry 4 just loses everything to far cry 3. Amazing soundtrack, intresting setting, great story, Far cry 4 dosen't have that. Highly recommend picking this up and wait for FC4 to go on sale			"

												You like survival games? You like sandbox games? Pick this up then. Although the story is a bit short in my opinion and the ending is kinda not satisifying, the gameplay is solid and the graphics is really stunning. When I was playing the game the Uplay client had a little trouble with the extra content not syncing in the game, but the ubisoft people fixed it for me quite efficently (ymmv, as some people in forums still trying to fix this), nonetheless the game is an insta-buy if it's on sale.

												I dont really understand why people disrecommending this game just for ""Uplay"". The game is perfect with awesome story to save friends. The multiplayer mode isn't perfect - it takes too much time to find all players to start a  match,but you will have an awesome funny experience in multiplayer. Co-op? Its really awesome,eventually if you are with friends. Its must have game l think. 10/10			"

												I think that my favorite part of this game was the wide ammount of exploration in ancient ruins and such, as it seems Ubisoft put a large detail into that, as well as the open world itself. However, after half way through the story I couldn't help but realize how stupid and cliche it was, and I was not really interested as much as I thought I would be. Vaas was practically the only interesting character in this game, but even he lacked depth.Otherwise its good "

												Uplay blocking game, I tried to make a uplay account when through, added my CDKey said my CDkey was already in use. dont waste your time. and straight up Uplay scam.FC3 is an amazing game the protaganist is the best badass villian you always wanted to see in a game the swave badness made you like to hate him. overall gameplay is pretty solid with some repetiveness but def a game to check out just not on steam. Buy it somewere else they block uplay and make it 1000% easier to deal with I might req. Humble bundle or other popular rising game selling sites.			"

												Really great game.  Immersive story.  I love the open world and is easy to play casually.  I really wish there were Steam Achievements and Cards and all the steam features since this series has always been pushed on Steam.   I don't know why these developers think anyone cares about their platforms.  Origin and U-Play are and always will be 'Steam Wannabees' and nothing else.

												I love this game. Awesome graphics and a decent storyline. Plenty of hours worth of playing. Lots of side missions to do if you want, or not, though some side missions help you max out your lootsack, wallet, ammo sizes etc so they're worth doing. This game ♥♥♥♥♥ all over Far Cry 2; it would be hard to go back to #2 after playing #3. FC3 has lots of fast travels so there's less driving around, and the enemies don't respawn in locations where you've captured the outpost. Also, no malaria tablets to worry about!!The co-op missions are fun too, though what would make this game massivly awesome would be a co-op version of it. Let's hope Far Cry 4 has the co-op we all love. Big thumbs up for FC3.			"

												Far Cry 3 has by far reigned among my top 5 open world games, every aspect of this game is great; from the story; to the gameplay; the action, world and its mechanics. You are Jason Brody, a young man looking for an adventure while vacationing on a remote island with your closest friends. Yet you get more than what you bargained for, when your group is kidnapped by drug pedaling pirates to be sold to the underground world of slavery.  Now its up to you to save your friends, bring peace back to this once pristine environment, and inspire hope to its native people. As you diverge from your expected path you become a true product of your new environment. You turn from a scared boy, to a ruthless warrior. Though be careful who you trust, for betrayal is lurking around every corner.This game is like no other, the story missions are long and tough and the side missions are a blast. You must climb to the top of hundred foot radio towers to acquire maps, radar and weapons; liberate pirate outposts; learn the lay of the land; hunt its native creatures, both docile and ferocious; find its most precious and scarce relics; bounty hunt for the islands most wanted; and test your skills through vigorous timed trials. This enormous world has more than enough ways to spend your time. If you feel like taking a break from the fighting, go play some poker, place wagers on your marksmanship, throw knives,  get laid, or race ATVs.As you delve in to this chaotic world, you find all resources at the palm of your hand. Customize your weapons by adding scopes, extended magazines and suppressors. You can pick someone off from a mile away, shoot them in the back with your bow and arrow, slit someone's throat, or blow it all up! Every desirable weapon is available at your disposal; hand guns, shotguns, assault rifles, SMGs, LMGs, RPGs, C4 explosives, knives, even a f**king flamethrower; everything your twisted heart could desire! The question is, how will you save this world? As a silent assassin, or a gun toting  juggernaut?Choose who you wish to become by picking skills from three separate skill trees. You can chose to become a stealthy assassin, a long range killer, an unstoppable killing machine or all three.  Will you learn how to shoot from a zip line, or how to silently ambush numerous enemies from atop and below? These skill will also help you become a better hunter-gatherer. Collect indigenous plants to craft potent remedies and abilities or learn to silently hunt a tiger or shark for its hide.Like any good contemporary game, there is multiplayer along with coop. Fight with or against players across the world to complete objectives, sabotage each other's bases, go on missions, or just shoot each other up in death match. Be careful though, for the losing teams best player is to be made an example of. The winning team can chose to show mercy, or beat him to within an inch of his life. So mount up! This world cannot be saved without your efforts. Just remember, trust no one. Not even yourself...			"

												This is a fabulous game. The setting is large, beautiful, and lively. Quite frankly, this is one of the better settings I have seen in a game. With that said, graphically the game is excellent. Everything from the animations to the textures to the models looks great. The game sounds excellent, and the music selection is superb. The weapons all have fairly distinct sounds, and there are no sound issues as far as I can tell.As far as the story goes, it's really engaging. I am not going to spoil anything, but it does get a bit hokey a few times. By the end though, none of this mattered. The story has a way of dragging you in and making you care, as any well written narrative should. To sum it up, this is an excellent game. I almost regret not purchasing it sooner. From the setting to the story, this is most definitely a worthwhile purchase.			"

You ask yourself why a game needs a multi million marketing budget if it is that good?All in all good fun but the tiresome cut scene  approach is painful at least but for me a a show stopper for a real gamer.

This game even had elements which I normally hate in a game,  like button mash action cinematic passages during the single player campaign at pivotal moments,   and for the first time I actually enjoyed them.Overall,  a very beautiful romp through a bloodbath oasis paradise in hell.   Well worth full retail.  This game alone is worth shelving your complaints about UPLAY if thats what keeping you from making this purchase.			"

												This game is an exact cross between Far Cry and Far Cry 2. For those that don’t remember, Far Cry was the first game (afaik) which allowed players to hide in shrubs on a massive tropical island with luscious green foliage. It used the first Crytek game engine. In Far Cry 2, you couldn’t really hide in shrubs, instead you were placed on a barren African landscape wearing a straw hat and on safari. This time the Dunia game engine was used which I’d personally say is more than just a heavily modified version of the CryEngine.Far Cry 3 uses the Dunia Engine 2. What this means is, the gameplay mechanics and overall feel of the game will be more like Far Cry 2. This is particularly noticeable with the shooting mechanics, the openness of the landscapes with trails/tracks/villages/compounds and even the driving of boats and vehicles will feel pretty much the same. Except the only difference is you’re on a luscious island where you have plenty of shrubs to hide in (or burn lol).What’s different? We get a pretty full on cinematic experience. It almost felt personal with the characters being so close and their faces taking up the entire screen. I thought they all wanted to kiss me. Aside from that, I thought all characters were standup comedians. Vaas in particular, but Buck as well. They have hilariously crazily loveably outrageous personalities.There is also an XP skill system in place. It didn’t bother me (see my Hitman: Absolution review) but after a year I’m now growing to hate seeing this in games. Not only is it a lame way to track progress, I reckon it damages the RPG genre. But like I said, it wasn’t much of a bother in this game.Overall Far Cry 3 in my opinion is for those that seek a very slow-paced game where you complete menial tasks on the island, but with the goal of exploration. Having said that, the island is a work of art, very detailed at every place. Not just a piece of terrain where they plopped buildings and 3D models on randomly.It’s interesting seeing how the land mixes in with the river banks, tree roots, erosion and sediments. Like you’ll see some tin shack on some beach in the middle of nowhere with intricately placed shore rocks, or you may walk through a plain field of grass with some oak-like trees during the night, or a lake in the middle of nowhere, it’s an experience to remember.I can almost certainly guarantee you that you won’t traverse the same spots on the island more than twice. This can be proven by purchasing maps to display the locations of all the loot chests. There’s a crap load of them! And for about 30 hours I was really nitpicky in the beginning opening those chests.The game was a bit buggy for me from time to time, but I always seemed to pull out of it without losing too much progress. Like sometimes you can bypass waypoints with ease which will break the mission. I also didn’t like long unnecessary animations like patting corpses for loot. Sometimes the game would just crash when I sell a lot of loot items in the store. I run an AMD 5000+ overclocked to 3GHz and HD6870. This is a pretty old gaming rig and I was able to play on high settings comfortably enough (felt like 25-30 fps when running).I prefer Far Cry 2, but Far Cry 3 is a very sophisticated game technology-wise. Definitely a step forward that newcomers can jump into without needing to play the predecessors since the stories and characters are all different.*note this review was cut down from 9000+ words.

												I didn't have high expectations of FarCry 3 after playing FarCry 2, and FarCry 1's story was a little far fetched for me. I was immediately engaged by the opening scene of FarCry3 and I had to play it a couple of times because of how the save points work. I was mostly engaged by the story, although there are some points you want to go WTF? But there is a really cool scene that blew my mind. While shooting bad guys is pretty repetitive, I had a lot of fun capturing Radio Towers and Bandit camps for the challenge of not being detected. I didn't spend a whole lot of time searching for relics or loot because it would never end, but the game is just gorgeous. The ""upgrades"" you can do to yourself are fun and add to the game and most of them I didn't find useless. Another nice feature about the game is the ending. Once you beat the game, you have the option to ""leave"" or continue on. I opted for continuing on, but all I have left is searching for relics, and there is about 300 in the game. Not really worth the time to me. I don't know about the replayability of the game, but it was worth the discount I paid for it. It's one of three or four games out of 90 or so that I've actually wanted to complete.I would recommend this game, even at the current regular price, but if you can find it on a discount, even better. I do have one complaint. I would consider my computer hardware to be above the norm, but the game sometimes would run great and then go down to 10 or so FPS, which when doing certain tasks (radio tower medical quests), it would make it extremely challenging. You may find other reviews complaining about how the game is not optimized, and I felt the same pain. Didn't detract from the game, but out of 5 stars, I would give it a 4.5 for this reason. If it ran well 100% of the time, I would have given it a 5.			"

Now I have a new computer that could feasibly run it quite well, but because I bought it several years ago, uPlay doesn't believe that I own the game, and won't tell me what account I used to register it.Anyway I hope you guys enjoy the game, I'll be over here in a corner.

												Fantasic game overall. The island is beautiful and it's the perfect blend for a first person shooter with RPG elements and a open world. The characters are fantastic they are all unique and have true feeling. Vaas by far deserves all the hype he gets. The only down side to the game is that it followed one of the filthest of filth games known as Far Cry 2. I give this a very high recommendation and a solid 9/10.			"

												The game itself is great but it does require installing and keeping uplay (which is another DRM) updated and logged in. Now, it's a particularly prickish move on Ubisoft's part, and it devalues the game to the point of avoiding the purchase. It's on the store front obviously, but it's quite an annoyance and a black smear for such a great game.			"

Posted: July 3, 2014
												I’ll probably never finish playing FarCry3.  The game suffered from front-loading all the best content.  The first half of the game was superb.  The second half failed to live up to what preceded it.  On almost every level – villains, objectives, scenery, atmosphere – the second half of the game was like a bad sequel.  But what finally drove me away was utter disgust for the character I was required to play.  Unlike a lot of games that try to implement moral choices and some sort of moral system, FarCry3 seemed utterly uninterested in whether what the character was doing was good or right or heroic, instead choosing to focus on other themes.  This was ultimately to the game’s detriment, as progressing in the game often required acts that were morally unpleasant – just because the game designers don’t particularly care if something is moral or not does not mean that the players won’t.  For example, the opening of the game did a wonderful job setting up the pirates as a force that I could wipe out in good conscience – they were horrible, sadistic and murderous men who made me feel like I was saving lives when I removed them from the gene pool.  Even those who may not have been so downright evil were enemy combatants in a war they had chosen to declare on me.  And the game did a good job reinforcing this with many of the random encounters.  Absolutely none of that can be said for the mercenaries introduced midway through the game.  I expect this was intentional.  The game makes a point of claiming it is about insanity, and this is a fair way of showing the character’s increasingly murky morality and perverted mentality.  But in choosing to do that, the game chose to create a protagonist whom I found progressively less enjoyable to play.   Inevitably, the game’s demand that I mass-murder a huge swath of these guys was more than I was willing to give it.I'll admit, my attitude towards wholesale slaughter of the mercenaries probably had a lot more to do with the game than an objective measure of their comparative evils.  Hoyt himself was certainly as bad or worse than any of the pirates; and the mercenaries were following his orders, right?When the mercenaries first appeared, I had no idea who they were.  It was a mission to provide sniper cover for my allies while they attempted to recover their people whom the pirates had taken prisoner... or so I was told.  Except the people who showed up weren't pirates.  All I knew about them was that they looked military -- for all I knew, they were the armed forces of a sovereign nation, or possibly even people sent in by the United Nations -- and that they decidedly weren't the people I was there to shoot at.  I didn't know these people, I had no grudge against them, I couldn't even be sure that they weren't the good guys, and I had absolutely no reason to declare war on them.  Except that if I didn't the game would not allow me to progress, so it was either murder these people for no good reason or quit the game.I continued playing, despite the really bad taste that left in my mouth, because the game had been amazing up until that point.  Next, I find out that instead of the allies I was told I'd be rescuing, the military men were transporting my enemy.  So either my allies had suffered a catastrophic intelligence failure, or I had been lied to.  Worse, I'd just declared war on an unknown group and murdered a bunch of their people in order to set a horrible, sadistic psychopath free... for all I knew, I'd just launched an attack on the good guys just as they were taking action against the pirates!  To say I was unhappy was an understatement.  I had lost every bit of faith in my ""allies"" and I really wanted to be given the option to tell them to go ♥♥♥♥ themselves.Of course, it turns out the military men were Hoyt's mercenaries.  But at that point, as much as I hated Hoyt, I was primed to want to give these guys as much of a benefit of the doubt as possible.  The first town was under their control, but they weren't slaughtering the civilians like the pirates would.  The first scenario where I really dealt with them had me sneaking past the first two mercenaries and listening in on their conversation.  One mercenary was reveling in psychopathic bloodlust.  The one with him was reining him in, telling him this was a job not a murder free-for-all, and that he was only to shoot where and when he was told to.  My reaction?  The first guy very clearly was a danger to society and needed to be permanently put down.  But the second guy?  He was working for a very bad person, yes; but he was actively preventing a bad situation from getting much, much worse.  I didn't want to put this guy down, just as badly as I wanted to take out the other one.  The islanders needed people like that in the enemy's camp.  Of course, the game had stripped away my ability to choose what to do in that scene; I couldn't kill either or the scenerio would restart.I ran into those two again in one of the next situations.  Only this time, instead of not being allowed to take out the homicidal psychopath, I wasn't allowed to spare the other guy.  In fact, I was required to abandon all common sense, not to mention my characters skills, stealthy play style, and impressive custom sniper rifle, and make an absurd, bombastic rocket-launcher attack on a bridge and then carve my way out through all the people I had just carefully slipped past.  I was supremely not impressed.Finally, I was taken to see Hoyt.  I was lead into his office fully armed for a private sit-down with the guy.  At which point, I killed him with my silenced SMG, then tried to sneak out the window.  A bit of a mistake -- the place was so crawling with guards that I really didn't have much of a chance the moment the alarm went up... made all the worse by there being only a single exit that I could use: the front gate.  But my brother was in the place, and thanks to my undercover ally, I was able to rescue him.  We got to the gate, and of course that triggered the final cutscene where I had to make a fatal choice... and I chose to make sure my ally got my brother to safety, making a last stand that left me a bullet-riddled corpse.  I have to say, though, a damn good ending......except none of that happened.  Because you can't shoot Hoyt even though you are alone in a room with him and you are fully armed.  But I was allowed (read: required) to ignore that the bad guys had video footage that would have told them who I was, blown my disguise and made (or at least should have made) everything I was told to do afterwords a painfully obvious trap.  Because the second half of FarCry 3 is pretty much awful.I gave FarCry 3 every possible chance.  I played the first island exhaustively, finding every treasure and relic, doing every side quest, exploring every inch of the island... hell, probably spent days worth of game time just having my character hang out and play poker with the guys.  But in the end, the strikes against the game piled up so high that I simply couldn't enjoy it anymore.			"

												I'm sure this is a fantastic game that I would greatly enjoy playing, however it gets a 0/10 in my books for including the horrendous monstrousity that is Uplay. I couldn't even start the game, as soon as the first loading screen appeared and the Steam overlay message appeared in the bottom right, it crashed with ""Far Cry 3 has stopped working"". Honestly? I purchased this game excited to play it, but it doesn't work at all.*EDIT 05-May-2015*I got it working, but the only way to do so is to permanently go offline through the uPlay client rendering any online features like multiplayer completely unusable.

												An engrossing open-world FPS, but not without its faults.  Beautiful graphics, intense gunfights, legitimately fun (if simple) stealth gameplay, and tons of content are the good parts. Like most open-world games, however, it becomes samey around the 20 hour mark and I started rushing story missions to get it done with. The not-so-good stuff: a) the storyline tends to pound on the ""You are just like the bad guys, GET IT?!"" theme in the dumbest ways possible; b) the people you are supposed to care about are aggressively stupid or bland, c) your character has the worst voice actor in the game, and d) the only memorable character (Vaas, who is plastered all over the marketing) is given relatively short shrift, but perhaps that's for the best - he's the best actor in the game and more exposure might have ruined his impact. That said, my gripes pertain mainly to the story missions (the majority of which are legitimately fun and/or exciting) and aren't enough to overcome its strengths; the game is definitely worth checking out and it's the best of the Far Cry games overall (I'm lying, Blood Dragon is the best).

												I've played the game before, but after spending around an hour I felt bored and quit. Now, after about a year I bought the game again and gave it a second try and to my surprise it's much better than I previously thought.FarCry 3 is an open world first-person-shooter with some RPG and stealth elements developed by Ubisoft. The game is set on a tropical island between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. You are playing as Jason Brody, after a vacation goes wrong, you try to save your kidnapped friends from pirates and escape from the island. While the island itself is huge, it does not offer you much variety if it comes to locations however it is graphically stunning and feels alive, populated by various animals, nothing is comparable if you hear a tiger roaring behind your back. Gameplay wise the game is very good if compared ot other shooters, you are given the choice how to approach the threats you encounter wheather doing it the sneaky way or the more direct one. The story itself is rather simple, yet it feels believable and the characters are amazingly executed, I'm refering to Vaas at this point. Also the soundtrack is beautiful, all in all the game is fantastic and is truly a worthy purchase if you ask me.Also some people may advise you to stay away from this game since it has 2 layers of DRM, one being Uplay, speaking from my own experience I had no difficulties at all. Similar to Origin or GFWL you register the key and just keep it logging you in automatically.			"

												Personal Rating: 5 of 10Its very difficult to review this game. The story and plot is good, the island is vast and combat is satisfying at times. However it falls really short on variety and many things don't gel together.Story is simple and straight foward but the plot did raise my eyebrows several times like the shocking kind which is good. The island is self is split into 2 part with the latter being revealed later in the game. The map is huge but I think mainly its because its empty and repetitive. The island looked the same everywhere with the same encampment, building, random places of small interest, mountain top and temples here and there but beyond that, the island is practically empty. For such a huge island there sure is no jungle. Don't expect different settings like snowy mountain, huge swampy area (there is a small and rather under designed one) or perhaps some remains of previous civilization. The reason I've said this is, there is proof of war bunkers, ancient temples and some large abandon facilities but these just isn't enough of other structures or towns to support it.Towns and encampments are plenty and scattered everywhere but they are really dead is coal. NPCs are decorations mostly that does nothing except for some that gives out quest. Not lively at all.Speaking of side quests, apart from collectibles, none of them span across a few series of repetitive quests like kill 250 of this and collect 50 of that but if you combine all of them together you get your fill series of repetitive nonsense lame side quests. Some side quests may obviously hide some meaning behind which others may find it funny or offensive but to me, I deemed them really unnecessary.Voice acting is alright but some NPCs voice record quality is clearly poor and bad also. Main characters are clearly stands out from unimportant NPCs as they are livelier and some are designed really well. Music is okay but it does gets on my nerve after a while because its so repetitive and some soundtrack clearly kills off the mood. Some main characters are overly done though which can be annoying. Thank heavens the interaction time with them isn't that long.The story mission is not really that long and the developers really hike up the challenge really really fast. Enemy A.I. is alright but once you find a flaw to exploit it seemingly easy. Weapons are plenty to choose from and yes they do have different characteristics which you can clearly feel but I feel they can be a little more hard hitting. You can customize weapons and even apply skin on them but its very limited. What surprises me the most is the animals. There is actually quite a few variety of them but lacked of characteristics.You can earn levels and money doing quests and looting but thats that. Collectibles unlocks written stories and provide nothing more. Each time, I was hoping the next collectible will unveil more location or puzzle but nothing really. Money allows you buy stuff. I was really excited at first but again dissapointed me as fast as it got me hyped up because you can only purchase weapons and customization. Ammos and med kit are practically useless as there are plenty around. Further more most of the weapons can be earned for free. Leveling up earns you a skill point and yeah the skills are quite useful nad gives you a sense of progression.You can also craft items in the game but personally I think it is a cheap gimmick. Imagine this, you needed leather to holster weapon. To carry more weapons you need more holster. But each holster requires different leather to craft. Its like her lets make use of the animals you know since its there but yeah its really redundant. You won't feel any sense of achievement there just finally I get more slots. You can also craft a variety of syringe that boosts/gives you certain ability for a short period of time. I only find 1 or 2 of them useful. In order to craft syringe you need to forage some plants. There are just too many of them lying around which practically makes them worthless.If you ever watched the trailer, it was really good. I thought that finally it went back to its root (Far Cry 1) but the actions you see in the trailer is more like in game ability kind of thing and not the actions you control of feel satisfy when you execute them. You only need to push a button at the right time. The antagonist that appeared on the trailer also sends shiver down one's spine. You hoped to see more of his insanity but no it doesn't really fills the expectation void. The character just don't expand.Overall, the game feels like it was designed by many department. Some did great while others pitched the idea, implement it for the sake of having the feature there in the game but these features don't simply cannot fit into the puzzle together and other aspects of the game cannot fully utilize one another to the fullest.Note that there are also some game breaking bugs too. Collecting collectibles doesn't save the game so if the game crashes (there are no quick save feature as I can't see the key mapping option), you need to repeat the process which is a pain. At times, if you land with the wingsuit you may clip through the ground. Missions contains plenty of unmarked checkpoint. If you somehow managed to bypass them you need to reload as the game won't progress.This game is good for casual open world game that packs some action. There are little things in the game that may surprise you or you may notice some small features that should be there.			"

												One time I ran into a glass door at full speed becauase I thought it was open. Funny how that happes you know? Kids don't really pay attention to their surroundings I guess. Makes me wonder what other stupid things I did as a kid. I knew this one kid who used glue as lipstick because he wanted to kiss this one girl forever. It didn't really work out for the guy obviously, I think he's into MLP now so yeah. Also the game is pretty good.			"

												It's More Than Skyrim With GunsI picked up this game recently with the Steam Summer Sale of 2014 and it is well worth a buy. Unlike Skyrim where the real fun of it is with the whole questing main story or side quests but in Farcry surprsingly enough the main story was THE most fun I had through the whole game. The side quests are lacking with the only options being kill this guy, hunt this thing, and a fetch quest style of quest from the natives. However there are parts of the world that make it feel alive and real, a good show of this is if you run around with a repair tool on you then locals will ask for your help reparing their broken down cars and such. The only faults I have with this game is that to me the sidequesting is dull and boring and that the stealth option does work untill near the end the game sky rockets in difficulty and using something like a bow becomes a burden and even before then when you get levels in caves or close quaters stealth gets hindered even more so.TL;DR Version: Game is good, main story is great sidequesting is dull. Doing stealth near the end becomes way to hard and even forces you not to. As of now off sale it is $29.99 USD worth a buy if your into it maybe wait for a sale to make it 20 or less if your on the fence.			"

												A stereotypical broseph, rich with daddy's money eats some psychedelic plant matter and gets heavily tattooed after his equally fratty friends are captured by modern day pirates while on vacation.  Somehow, this turns him into a perfect hunter and killing machine almost instantly, even if he does sound unsure of himself.  Sort of reminded me of that flick ""The Beach"", or maybe Lord of the Flies.That being said, it is quite pretty, it has some great action and a pretty good variety of guns and skill-builds.  Finding all of the side-quest-totem-things can be an interesting challenge.If you get it, get it on the cheap.			"

												I've played through Far Cry 3 multiple times, and each one was an adventure. I always find myself coming back to 3 because of the emotional ride the characters take you through, which sets a focused goal, but also letting you do whatever the **** you want during and after the game's story.I don't play a lot of games, so I can't really compare, I'll just give it a thumbs up lol			"

												My hours should show you my feelings about the game. But I'll expand:Negative points:- Weird glitches get annoying sometimes. I've had this problem where sometimes, completely randomly, my weapon will disappear for a second and then immediately come back. You can't fire during this time. That's one of a number of glitches, although small, that - The hardest difficulty isn't that difficult. I ended up using the Gun Realism mod so the enemies actually hit you with the same damage as you hit them with. It actually makes being faced with a car-mounted machine gun a challenge if you're not armed with an RPG.Amazing points:- Excellent gunplay. It's what I base my ratings of other games' gumplay off of. It's great fun and even more with the Gun Realism mod.- Good story. I don't play games for the story, but FC3's story was pretty good. I don't get the complaints about the fact that Jason acts like he's never fired a gun before in a mission after arriving with an LMG and a grenade launcher. It's a game and unless you wanted to be stuck doing stealth or something for the first few hours of the game that's what you've got to deal with.- For a game from 2012, it doesn't feel that dated. Probably not an issue for many, but for me it would be.Get it while it's on sale. It's so worth $7.48. Heck, I'd go to say that it's worth $29.99. Or the original $80 I paid at the start.			"

												Easily one of 2012's greatest games. Amazing gameplay, visuals and freedom. The story was quite underrated - possibly by those who rushed through the game too quickly, as Farcry 3 has a world you can (and should) get lost in. The multiplayer is also worth a strong mention and its separate capaigns will easily add another 20 hours on top of what is already a robust experience.  9.4 / 10.			"

												""Skyrim with Guns"" they call it. And how freaking right they are! With this being released just at the end of the year 2012 it easily makes for one of the best games of the year. Having played only Far Cry 2 in the past and having somewhat enjoyed some elements of the game but never actually got round to finishing it, I was in for a ride with Far Cry 3. The main selling point for me to picking up this title was Vaas. Plain and Simple. I loved Michael Mando's role as Vaas, It was absolutely fantastic! When I saw the Character Vaas, I knew this was a game I had to get in on despite my lack of interest from the previous Far Cry games. I absolutely loved every encounter with Vaas and easily one my favorite Antagonist's to date!Let's crack in with the detail. You play as Jason Brody. You, Your Brothers and some Friends go on a vacation in Bangkok as celebration of your Brother Riley as he obtained his Pilot License. Celebration is cut short after a Skydiving trip after having land upon a Pirate Island. You and your group get captured by the Pirate Lord known as Vaas, a Secondary Antagonist to this story. Shortly after your escape, you are aware of what goes on within the Huge open world known as Rook Islands. Slavery. Your friends have been taken captive and only you can save them against Tyranny of Slavery. You must adapt to your new surroundings or be consumed by them.How open world is Rook Islands you may ask? VERY open! The map is huge! Tons of exploration as you wonder through the Island discovering Historic Relics, gazing at Ancient tombs, Shrines and even weapons! Rook Islands is certainly a stunning place to be. With the vast amounts of exploration you will want to be doing deep in the Jungle you are going to be wanting to get around as running simply isnt fast enough to get from point A to B. There are various ways to get around Rook Island. Ground Vechiles consist of Jeeps, Quad Bikes and even Dune Buggies! With Aquatic transportation simply boats or Jet Ski's to get around, though preferably boats. Specially if your hunting a certain predator out in those waters... And last but not least is Air, no not Helicopters or planes but Hang Gliders! What a way to get from Point A to B... Glide to your destination and enjoy the sight bestowed upon you! Ubisoft truly went to town with the detail in Far Cry 3's enviroment and certainly wanted us to enjoy it, with the time spent in the Jungle hunting or in the air gliding across the Island, its hard not to appreciate Rook Islands Beauty and Ubisoft's hard work.Throughout your journey ahead you will require upgrades to make Jason a more efficient Warrior. This is where the Hunting kicks into play. While exploring the Jungle you will be sure to discover plenty of wild animals that you can kill and skin so you can craft new equipment such Weapon Holsters, Increased Lootpacks, Syringe Pouches etc. A very nice feature and certinaly one I enjoyed. Prowling through the jungle with my Sniper Rifle taking out wild beasts before being bested by a Tiger. Dang! Be aware of your surroundings, The hunter is also the Hunted.While exploring the Jungle you will come across Plants you can harvest for which you can make Syringes with to enhance Jason.  Syringes of the likes of Fireproof and the Ability to see Enemies through walls. Given that they are a timed effect but still useful. I havent crafted them all however the more creativity you have with Far Cry 3, the much better experience you will have.Throughout the game as you hunt, complete missions, discover viewpoints (Towers that expand the view of your map, similar to those of seen in AC series) you will earn Experience. The experience will reward you Skill points in which you can use to unlock new talents in three categories. The Heron, Shark and Spider. You are not devoted to one category, you can spend your points across all three Specializations. As you begin to build up your new found traits you will begin to build up whats called ""Tatau"". Symbolized on your Left arm, this Tattoo represents a Warrior from the Rakyat tribe in which you aid against Vaas and his Pirates. As you progress through the game and spend more well earned skill points, the tattoo will begin to expand along your arm.With alot of the single player aspects, what else is there to do other than explore and discover the collectibles of Rook Island? Far Cry 3 also packs in a multiplayer to boot, personally I have no interest in the multiplayer as I'm interested in the Single player mainly however it may be something to be explored in time of writing of this review however nice to see they had time to implement this in along side their Epic campaign. However it doesnt stop there! Oh no! They went even further and added a Co-op Story mode, seperate to the story of single player mode might I add! The story of the Co-op mode is set a few months prior to the story of the single player campaign and revolves around four characters, scammed out of their money by the pirates and they won't rest easy about it! Again having not played this side just yet, its still nice to see another addition to the package! More content!!!Having spent 25hours to finish the Single Player Campaign alone while doing some hunting, side objectives and sightseeing I still have yet much to accompish. Discovering all the relics, completing the rest of the side missions and fully upgrading my arsenal whether it be my weapons or simply hunting related gear. Theres still much left after your done in Far Cry 3 and then if your curious enough to try out the multiplayer or Co-op mode that will earn you even more hours upon your gametime. Far Cry 3 is worth your time and money! I would give this game a 9/10. A must buy, The single player alone was worth it for me but yet much more to be done with this title!			"

												So i yet to complete the game so i can't talk much about it. Here is what i like.Great graphics, yea the game looks really good, even tho the enemies do need more variety and the landscape may get bored to look at after 10 plus hours.The main missions are very good.Lots of things to do.Ecology and unpredictable creatures make the world come alive.Role-playing elements and difficulty curve make u play more than once.Good multiplayer for this type of game.Lots of weapons and ways to enjoy combat.Here is what i don't like about the game.Easy money, yea u get money so fast in this game that just 5 hours into the game u have money to buy the best weapons, money u don't really need since the game gives weapons for FREE.Generic side quests. One word, BORING...Enemy AI is laughable sometimes.Stealth is also not that well implemented which might lead to minor frustrations.Spawns and spawn rates are stupid. Kill all enemies in the area?, wait too long others will spawn and u have to do it all over again.Gunplay is not that good. U will notice this, if u play other FPS games like BF or COD.The wildlife is way too overpower, takes for EVER to kill animals.The main hero who is over sensitive to drops (you could literaly kill yourself by jumping from 3m height!)Also the game may get bored too soon if u get all weapons and done all the crafting upgrades.So, overall Far Cry 3 is a good game, but one that has a lot of things to work before it becomes great. There r just too many flaws for me personally to completely enjoy it, but enough to recommend to people that might like this type of games.			"

												It's time for a super serious review guysA Herd of Cassowaries rampaging through a pirate outpost. Sneaking through the jungle until a tiger decides to try to make you its lunch. Ramming a car bomb into a base and setting it off. A hot pink 1911.If any of those sounded appealing, then you’ll probably like Far Cry 3. To put it simply, Far Cry 3 is what Far Cry 2 should have been. Almost every aspect of it is improved. No more are there infinitely respawning checkpoints or enemies that can spot you out of nowhere. Far Cry 3 takes what was bad about Far Cry 2 out, improves on what it did right, and then sprinkles some komodo dragons and magic mushrooms on top.The plot starts with you, Jason Brody, and your fellow spoiled-white-kid friends getting captured by Vaas Montenegro, leader of the pirates on the unnamed island you have decided to visit. After escaping, you set out to save your friends, and get off the island. While your character, and the slice of the 1% that you came to the island with, are often insufferable, virtually every other character is fantastic. Vaas is a psychopath, and absolutely drips of crazy; Dr. Earndhart is fantastically creepy; and Willis Huntley may very well be my favourite character of 2012.But there’s far more to Far Cry 3 than the story. It’s set in an open world, letting you wander off and ignore the plot completely in favour of hunting animals, taking outposts and climbing radio towers if you’d like. There’s a crafting system, allowing you to upgrade how many guns you can have on hand, how many syringes you can carry, etc. You’ll get most of the upgrades quickly, though, since there’s plenty of animals to hunt and skin, and while the final upgrades for most things are part of hunting sidequests that unlock at conquered outposts, they’re all available on the first island. There’s also a skill system, giving you new abilities and upgrades. XP is easy to come by, but some skills are locked behind missions and won’t be available until a ways into the game.While the gameplay is a lot of fun, I was sometimes left wanting more. The one downside to having outposts not respawn is that you can clear out an entire island of enemies and then have nothing left to do but hunt cassowaries and mop up sidequests. If you’re lucky you’ll run across the occasional firefight between a washed up group of pirates and your native allies, but those are often over before you figure out where the gunfire is coming from.Side missions are a mixed bag, all of them are fun the first few times, but they rarely stray from their formula. Assassination missions make you kill a guy with a knife, supply drop missions make you drive through some checkpoints, et cetera. Fortunately the hunting missions have at least some variety in what kind of weapons and animals you are using or going after. Using an RPG to hunt down a pack of rabid dogs is a lot of fun, I assure you.While there is a finite limit to the content, it’s not like this is a short game. There’s PLENTY to do in the story missions alone, and if you add general island dicking around time to that you have a very substantial experience. Even the formulaic side missions are good for a change of scenery every few hours.Speaking of scenery, this game looks good. Really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. and getting a very smooth frame rate with some amazing visuals. The first island is mostly jungles, but there are plenty of beaches, rivers, bunkers and so on and so forth. The game is also really colourful. In a world if grey and brown shooters, it’s great to see a game set on a tropical island that feels, well, tropical. There are bright birds and plants everywhere, and with the wildlife system the game world feels alive. "

												WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THIS GAME? Already played it once, but bought it again on steam. This game is one of the greatest, massive map, visually amazing, one of the greatest antagonists ever in a video game (Vaas), a lot of content, solid story, great gunplay, amazing exploration. Plus there is one of the most memorable missions I have ever played in this game, burning weed crops to the music of Skrillex, I don't believe you can get anymore badass. In conclusion, I will alter an amazing quote from this game ""Have I ever told you the definition of insanity, insanity, is NOT HAVING THIS GAME""			"

												This review is for the game ''Far Cry 3'' a single player(co-op and multiplayer enabled),open world action-adventure,video game.The game was developed by ''Ubisoft Montreal'' and published by Ubisoft.Series:''Far Cry''Engine:Dunia Engine 2Platforms:Microsoft Windows,Playstation 3,Xbox 360Release dates:November 30,2012 for EU and December 30,2012 for NA.Genre:First-person shooter,action-adventure.Mode(s):Single-player campaign,Multiplayer,Cooperation (co-op)Distribution:Optical Disc,Download.PlotYou are Jason Brody,a young man in his mid twenties,on vacation with a group of friends in Bangkok.During their vacation the decide to take a skydiving trip.Little did the know that they would land on a pirate-infested island known as Rook Island.The game begins with you and your older brother Grant tied up in a hostage situation by a man name Vaas,the pirate leader.While you manage to break from captivity your brother gets killed by Vaas in the escape.Later,Jason is rescued by Dennis Rogers and the the Rakyat tribe,the island's natives.By that time Jason's adventure to find his friends and to extract revenge begins.Throughout the game Jason will have to complete quests in order to gain the confidence of the Rakyat,Citra(the Rakyat leader,Cia Agent Huntley,Sam Becker and other stakeholders.After gaining their trust and their respect each one of the will assist Jason into rescuing his friends and killing the pirates and the Pirate leader Vaas who later is revealed to be just an employ of slave trader baron Hoyt Volker.After Vaas' death the game's true villain is revealed,the slave baron Hoyt who resides at the southern part of the island.Jason is determined to kill Hoyt and save his little brother from his hand.So,with the help of Cia Agent Huntley and the undercover operative Hoyt's privatee Sam Becker,you manage to infiltrate Hoyt's camp,gain his trust and kill him after a lengthy knife fight.Shortly after Hoyt's death you save your brother Riley and escape from Hoyt's troops back to the Rakyat island.At that point of the game Jason has realised how much he has changed.From a good grade Los Angeles resident to a bloodthirsty,revenge seeking,pirate slayer.From an active athlete and a loving and caring boyfriend to an almost sadistic vigilante who hesitate in anything until justice is met,Hoyt and Vaas is dead,and his friends and family are saved.In the end Jason and Riley arrive at the Rakyat Temple where Jason has to make a tough choice.Either kill his friends and be free from everything in order to lead the Rakyat people alongside with Citra or save his friends and turn his back on Citra and the Rakyat.If you kill your friends you will make love to Citra,impragnate her and die from her after stabbing your chest ,apparently dying like a warrior.If you do not kill your friends and choose to save them Dennis tries to murder Jason who's saved from Citra but dying from the hit.After takign the hit Citra dies in Jason's hands whispering that she loves him.In both cases the ending cinematic is the same showing the ancient knife artifact stuck in the sand at the beach with a boat leaving in the island.GameplayFar cry is an open-world first person shooter with adventure and role-playing game elements.The world of Far Cry 3 is bigger than his predecessor offering more opportunities in terms of exploring.Also as far as for the rpg elements the game utilizes a wide variety of skill trees,a simple crafting system and experience points used to gain levels and points used in the skill trees specializations.In the end you have a wide variety of weapons to use with extended customization to choose from,many vehicles and water travel to use to get to places and lastly besides the main quests,you get to complet side quests,hunting quests,wanted dead,supply drops and gather collectibles like lost letters and artifacts.Co-opThe game also features co-operative mode too for 2 to 4 players.The characters are Callum,Tisha,Leonard and Mikhail who are scammed out of their money by Pirates and later decide to work together in order to pursue them and their Captain for revenge.The plot takes place 6 months before the single player campaign.MultiplayerMultiplayer consists of 10 different maps,incredible weapon and abilities customization options and require skilled players in order to take advantage of the game's full potential.Balanced multiplayer forgiving to the new player but deadly to the lazy cocky veteran.RecapI've finished this game over and over again more times than i can remember.In my list it's my number one game to play and recommend.Consistent plot,wide variety of customization,a jungle to hunt animals,pirates,privatees.What more can you ask for?By the way if you want to experience the island's locations and everythign this game has to offer do not use fast travel.Personally i hate fast travel and i do not use it.Pros+Exploration+Wide variety of customization+Plot+Warfare+Funny and competitive Co op+Active Multiplayer with numbers of players that surpass even modern call of duty and battlefield gamesConsNone that i know of.Well...Uplay is somewhat annoying from times to times but nothing muchSummaryMake sure you have this game in your library and if you don't buy it without second thought.A piece of art for gaming.Thank you Ubisoft Montreal and ubisoft developers,employeesand associates for creating this game.

												You need to buy this game for the following reasons:1. Beautiful Graphcs. (i know graphics dont matter and its the gameplay that makes a good game and all, but honestly, this game is gorgeous.)2. Amazing story following Jason Brody as he decends into madness3. The map is HUGE offering so much stuff to do. some of which includes; settlements to liberate, numerous caves to explore, hang gliding and tons and tons of side missions that are utterly worth your time.4. The island is full of wildlife, including; tigers, bears, buffalo, pig, and sharks. yes, sharks.5. the two villains in the game are fantastic. Vaas ecsecially is one of the best villains in any game ever in my opinion. He is insane.9.75/10			"

												The Far Cry series has done what so few others have in that each game has redefined our perception of what this franchise is. The first game had you blasting through a Island of Dr. Moreau-inspired landscape, the second brought us back to reality with a hunt for an arms dealer in Africa, and now the third installment aims for a more personal experience while drawing inspiration from films like Taken and Turistas.In the game you play as an American 20-something year old named Jason Brody who accompanies his two brothers and wealthy friends on vacation in Thailand. Being thrill seekers and adrenaline junkies the group is told about Rook Island where ""anything goes"" and they decide to blindly sky dive onto it. Shortly after landing the group is taken captive by pirates led by the clearly sadistic and violently insane Vaas who plans to collect a ransom but sell them into slavery anyway. After narrowly escaping, Jason is taken in by the local natives who inpsire him to take the fight to Vaas and save his friends.The story is beautifully crafted, the characters are vivid (thanks to phenomenal voice acting and animation), and the game's use of insanity as a focal point pays off brilliantly.Like the previous titles, FC3 drops the player in an open environment that's just as big if not bigger than Skyrim and all of it save a smaller island is available to explore from the get-go. Populating the game world are story missions, side missions, and hidden collectibles and transportation including cars, trucks, boats, ATVs, hang gliders, and jet skis. The combat is exciting and tense and a large arsenal of weapons is at the players' disposal covering handguns, SMGs, assault rifles, LMGs, sniper rifles, shotguns, and even a bow and flamethrower.  While the story missions are always varied and great fun the side missions are repetitive and lack luster after awhile. Tracking down hidden collectibles also becomes a chore pretty quickly as the payoff for doing so is limited. Lastly while the environment looks incredibly appealing it does become stale after awhile in its lack of variety. Additionally, some of the more detail oriented players have noticed that the game world lacks some of the awesome physics and destruction features present in the PC version of Far Cry 2.Overall though the pros greatly outweigh the cons. Far Cry 3 is a tense and brilliantly designed game that is totally worth picking up. If you're looking for something that seamlessly blends a fantastic narrative and addictive gameplay look no further. Personally I can't wait to see what they do with the next game and how the franchise will redefine itself again.			"

												By far the best game in the series, FC3 once again places you in an exotic location where nature becomes a powerful and sometimes frustrating character in the game. A world traveller and thrill seeker, your character is thrust into a struggle for survival when you are forced to free your freinds from local pirates on a tropical island. This time around, you must hunt wild and sometimes dangerous animals for skins and harvets local plant life to craft new holsters, medicines, and temporary stat buffs. With a large aresenal to choose from, enemies are fairly intelligent, and a large series of islands to explore and tons of side quests, FC3 has something for everyone. If you liked the Tomb Raider reboot, you'll enjoy Far Cry 3 as well.			"

												The best single player game that I've played in my life. Very immersive and the story keeps you feeling that you're actually this person (better with great graphics). Although you being near invinsable gets very old very fast because you should die in the cut scenes but however you do not. I understand it's to keep the story going, but it isn't very fluid. The last critism I have for this title is that the 'helpful' quest tracker reveals what's about to happen and is constantly ruining the story so I suggest you find a way to dissable this feature to create a better experience.Well worth what ever price it's at, even full. You'd have to be stupid not to buy this on a sale though, fantastic game.			"

												This game is tons of fun.  First run thru with some sidetracking from main story (side missions/exploring etc.) was roughly 30+ hours.  Graphics are great and look beautiful on max settings, runs well, and I had few to no bug issues other then you have to have a UPlay account as well (what's up with that?).  I feel FC3 took best of FC1&2 and then made it even better.  With only a few minor complaints from me (miss in game map from FC2/some side missions boring/had no reward for completing) but most were optional stuff that did not have to be done. On top that it has multiplayer and a really fun co-op that is 4  different people on a nearby island that are not part main story. So get this game and go swim with sharks, blow up jeeps/bases/crocodiles? and explore the islands.***9/10***			"

												The gameplay is descent, but the game overstays it's welcome with an overly long self-important story and campaign. The later bosses are tedious and frustrating, where they could have been interesting like the Metroid series bosses are. There's no pleasure, or sense of skillful mastery in beating them.It feels like a game designed by committee, with many missions that play great, with tense atmosphere and satisfying firefights, only to be ruined by inept level-designers on other missions.Overall a schizophrenic mess of a game, with occasional moments of brilliance.

												Far Cry 3 is a brilliantly executed open-world First Person Adventure. Many call this an FPS, but that’s only a small facet of this game. I enjoyed the first half of the game, but I had to will myself to cross the finish line.  FC3 has many “tacked-on” elements that don’t really add to the experience. It has “crafting” and a “skill tree” that could have easily been absorbed in to the games progression, as neither really changes your game experience beyond expanding your inventory capacity or adding a new way to take out enemies. A decent player will have both maxed out well before the end-game. The weapon progression was fun; especially the high powered weapons that send enemies flying on impact. The addition of weapon mods was nice, but arbitrary. The mods were only available on the higher tiers of weapons, and limited to an artificial cap. The mod categories are suppression, magazine size, and optics (in some cases you could stack optic choices, like adding night vision to a long range scope); unfortunately the designers chose to artificially limit the number of attachments and only allow them on top tier weapons. The result is a huge number of underused weapons. I might have experimented with more of the lower tier weapons if they were upgradable. This would not have thrown off balance since there was so much redundancy in weapon choices anyway.The story starts with strong conflict which cements you in to the mythos quickly. I enjoy hardboiled tales as much as the next guy, but there was very little foil to the darkness  and grittyness. For a 40+ hour experience, it would have been nice to have some humor and light hearted content mixed in to the hard hitting main quest. There were some likeable characters along the way – Vass was a good “bad-guy”, Sam was a lot of fun, and the deep cover agent straight out of Miami Vice was a nice touch, but I found I was less interested in the main story and more interested in my own exploration. The number of times I got shot, stabbed, drowned, and “left for dead” started to become an in-joke (they even mention it in the game).Overall I would lump this game in to the same family as Skyrim or Fallout 3, both of which far eclipse this game in story and progression. The area that Far Cry shines is in the gameplay mechanics, and the interaction with the world. I felt much more in control of my characters physicality which ultimately sustained my intrest allowing me to play through to the end. (The wingsuit is AWESOME!) I really did get the feeling of being a one-man-army action-hero without it feeling like I was dealing with idiotic AI. It’s worth playing and I look forward to seeing how they improve this franchise going forward.			"

												I played the original Far Cry and found it to be a game of lackluster storyline and glorious graphics. I player Far Cry 2 and found it to be annoying, repetitive and boring, yet nice-looking. So that's what I expected from Far Cry 3 as well.I was wrong.Far Cry 3 is pretty, that much hasn't changed. In fact the game was so pretty that all the pretty environments, visual effects and bright colours actually made me feel physically ill sometimes, which I guess has to count against the graphics, but other than that Far Cry 3 is a gorgeous game.However, unliked it's predecessors, Far Cry 3 has an interesting premise, that of young adults captured by pirates and struggling to escape with the assistance of native resistance warriors fighting the pirates. It has cool locations, characters and missions, and most importantly: it has an arc. The protagonist, Jason Brody, changes throughout the game. He grows on you in this weird way, and I found it unusually easy to relate to him.The voice actors are solid, the game uses original and lifted music effectively and most of the sound effects seem top-notch.And then there is the positive surprise! While most modern games give you something between 6-10 hours of gameplay, Far Cry 3 got me up to 22 hours, with easily 90% of the side missions untouched and much of the map still left to properly explore. If you are that kind of a person, you can easily get lost in this game and just roam the land, hunting prey, be it man or animal, and taking in the glorious scenery.I didn't expect to, but I truly recommend this game.Playtime: 22+ hours (single playthrough)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 8Audio: 9Story: 8Gameplay: 9Overall: 8			"

												Much better than Far Cry 2. This was a pretty good shooter all around, guns sounded great and the bigger and more powerful guns had a satisfying feel to them. The survival aspect was done nicely, you can use pretty much everything in your environment to craft useful support items or gear which you can upgrade over time. For example, you can upgrade your holsters with animal hides to increase the number of guns you can carry at once. One big improvement over Far Cry 2 is that there is tons to do in the game becides the main quest. Far Cry 2 sported a large open world map, but had very little to do in between missions. This one has camps you can take over, kill missions, hunting missions, challanges, and collectable items that encourage exploration. It also has a fairly interesting plot that keeps you engaged and has some pretty cool characters you meet throughout. I highly recommend this one, especially if Far Cry 2 left a bad taste in your mouth.			"

												Considering this game was hyped to all hell, I figured that I would at least kind of enjoy the experience. And to an extent, I did, but some horribly glaring issues with the game just ruined it all for me.Now the first thing I want to note before I go into any of this is that I played through Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon before this, and I loved the experience. That game was silly and marvelous, and I would recommend it in a heartbeat. This game, however, manages to be worse than the game that was done on a significantly lower budget running on the same engine. Here's why:First, the mission design is repetitive as all hell. For the most part your missions boil down to ""Go into restricted zone X to find/kill/blow up Y and then leave restricted zone X"". Practically every story mission is like this. And practically every side mission is like this as well, even the hunting missions. It turned into kind of a chore to do everything, and that's bad. It worked better in Blood Dragon because even though it had the same problem, it was on a much, MUCH smaller scale. You were a badass supersoldier who could zoom over to your objective in less than 10 seconds and it'd be done even faster. In Far Cry 3 it takes more time to get where you're going, and then more time to do what you're doing, which makes what used to be a niggling complaint a gigantic complaint.Second, too many turret sections. I should not have to explain this, but I will: game developers and designers, nobody wants to sit in the same spot holding down LMB for fifteen minutes while you scroll a background for us. It's not fun, it's not satisfying, it's boring, and it's tedious, and Far Cry 3 has turret sections out the♥♥♥♥♥ This is a crime against game design, and whoever's smart idea this was should be hanged upside down by their pinkie toes for even suggesting it.Third, crafting and RPG elements are super underutilized and feel utterly tacked on. If you're going to put crafting or RPG mechanics into your game, make it INTERESTING. Make it so you have to actually BUILD A CHARACTER, so you actually have to DISCOVER IMPORTANT CRAFTING RECIPES, not this. Far Cry 3's leveling system comes down to this: kill everyone in sight until you ding, get the next linear upgrade, rinse, lather, repeat. The skills you perk into hardly ever have an effect on gameplay, and when they do, all they are is another canned animation for your takedown that is hardly ever useful. I never used the grenade takedown, I never used the hanging takedown, I hardly used the double takedown, when I did it wasn't useful, I didn't use the chained takedown, I didn't use the knife takedown, and I didn't use the gun takedown. All I used were the vanilla takedown, the heavy takedown (which is just the vanilla takedown on big enemies), and the death from above takedown. Everything else was stupid and pointless. And the other skills were dumb things like ""Reload faster"" or ""Get more money from looting"" or ""Reload when aimed down sights"".Part deux of point three, the crafting is terrible. All you do is farm out animals to get bigger bags and then just get all the green plants for nonstop healing items. There is no reason to get anything except green plants after you acquire all the bag upgrades, and it could have been used for something interesting. Let me make special weapons, or traps, let me use all this stuff, let me fashion some jerryrigged armor SOMETHING, ANYTHING. Instead it's ""Got all the bags? Okay now all the animals are walking money go nuts."" Horrible crafting system, they should have just left it out altogether.And finally, the story is just absolutely pathetic. Now, before you jump down my throat about it let me make this perfectly clear: I loved Vaas and Hoyt. They were excellently written characters. Unfortunately, this game does not star either one of those characters, it stars Jason Brody, a moron who claims to have never shot a gun, yet guns down armies of pirates and privateers like he's been doing it since he came out of the womb, and is ""super serious"" about saving his friends, but can't keep himself from making stupid pop culture references every thirty seconds. This character ruined literally the entire story. The game can't decide if it wants to be silly or serious, so it tries to do both and it fails utterly. The ludonarrative dissonance in this game is just insane levels of bad, and you just want to murder Jason by the end of it all. I'll go so far as to say that this is probably the worst story I've seen in a game, not because the concept of the story is bad, but because the execution is just awful.All in all, I would say skip this game and just get Blood Dragon. Blood Dragon doesn't have any of these problems, even the turret sections are more toned down, and frankly they're actually well executed. Blood Dragon succeeds in everything Far Cry 3 fails in and more, and it's cheaper as well. So, yeah, just get Blood Dragon. Just get Blood Dragon. What I'm saying is buy Blood Dragon.			"

												The first half of this game is a masterpiece.  The second half is terrible.  But overall, I am very glad I got it, and I will always remember it.The first half of the game has very enjoyable gameplay, and I like that you can choose whether you want to be stealthy or just go full-on Rambo with guns ablaze.  Taking over strongholds were definitely the best part of the game for this reason - it's you, a bunch of bad guys, and it's all up to you how you deal with it.The missions throw this tactic out the window.  For the first half of the game, you are pretty much forced to use stealth tactics, and for the second half, it's basically Call of Duty type shooting.  Speaking of which...The second half of the game throws all tactics out the window, and in my opinion, it was thoroughly unenjoyable.  Whereas with any other part of the game, you can approach the enemies however you want, in several of the missions in the second half, they don't even spawn until you are about ten feet away, meaning if you were relying on the bow or the sniper (like I was), tough luck ya ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  If you insist upon playing the second part of the game, my advice would be to carry: a large machine gun, a shotgun, a rocket launcher, and one type of long range weapon.  Stealth matters no more.Obviously, Vaas is the best character in the game.  But after he's gone (don't think I'm spoiling anything there), the game just felt empty - you're only halfway done after that point, and Hoyt is not the same, not by a long shot.  I kept playing just to see the ending that everyone was talking about, and even that was pretty disappointing.So to sum it up: if you get this game, my advice would be to play the first half of the game and enjoy it to its fullest, then either go full-on sandbox and forget the story or drop the game altogether and just watch the ending on Youtube.  You're missing nothing between the two.			"

												Part of an already well-known franchise, Far Cry 3 holds no 'surprises': visual extravaganza combined with fast-paced gameplay. You and your group of friends are taken for ransom by a druglord. After your successful escape, you need to get yourself and your friends off the island... alive. I'll let you discover the rest of the story yourself.The open world is very large and offers hours of gameplay. Different mission types are available: story progress, scavenging, hunting (both human & animal), time racing, ... During the first hours of gameplay, this will surely keep you entertained. However, half-way through the game these missions become very repetitive. Especially if you like to explore everything and do all the missions before progressing to the next zone. There is also an abundance of money you can find to spend on weapons, ammo, ... You basically never run out of money.Only played a few multiplayer matches, so can't really comment on it: they were fun and fast-paced. Large maps, so only fun with lots of players online. Co-op uses a seperate storyline involving 4 people trying to escape a cruise ship hijacked by pirates. It was very hard to find online co-op matches, so I only did this twice. Would be fun to do this with friends.I got the base game during a Steam sale, together with all the DLC. I would advise to do the same, as the DLC holds little value if you start playing it after you complete the game. Both mission DLCs bring some diversity to the missions of the base game. Monkey Business was entertaining due to Hurk, who seems to pop up in Far Cry 4 as well.  Lost Expedition is also very nice as it provides some variety next to the base game missions. But the top reason for the DLC is the Predator weapon, a silenced sniper, which is available right at the start.Score: 8.5/10Pro:+ appealing visuals & sound+ massive open world environment with hours of gameplay+ nice DLCContra:- standard missions become repetitive halfway through- low replayability			"

												I loved this game.  However, the glitches created by Uplay have devastated my gaming experience.  When the game first came on sale, I had to deal with glitches that completely break not only single player, but multi player as well as coop.  Not only that, I have kept crashing for a while, even on a computer I have reformatted several times just to get Far Cry 3 to work, and then later realize that the game crashes at a certain point only during Full screen mode.  Other than these major problems that have kept me from playing the game, I will continue to finish this game and of course, I'll recommend it to those who will buy the game when it is on a sale.What are the good parts of Far Cry 3?-Amazing story with an amazing villain.  More than one ending, no spoilers though...-Craft several things, hunt down animals.-Amazing multiplayer with an amazingly detailed killcam.-Build your own maps... why not? FC3 has a map editor for you to create and share with others.-Single player story and coop story are totally different.What are the bad parts of Far Cry 3?-Once you start a mission, you can't free roam anymore.  If you try to, you will encounter a waring message to go back or else you will be automatically killed.-You can't explore the whole map, even if you are not in a mission.  If you try to, you will encounter a warning message to go back or else you will be automatically killed.-Multiplayer can be dead at times.-Uplay issues... game crashes as I mentioned above.  I couldn't play FC3 for months because of Uplay and their unnecessary updates.-Many multiplayer glitches especially when FC3 goes on sale and Uplay servers overload. Get rid of Uplay... NO ONE WANTS IT!My final verdict: 79/100Uplay really ♥♥♥♥ed up the awesome experience of this game. Stop using uplay... Just use steam servers. Then this game would've had a higher score from me.

												Really enjoyed playing through this.  The open-world island is beautiful and fun to explore, there's lots to unlock, and the guns feel great.  Ultimately, it's Far Cry 2 on a new engine, though the new engine is pretty great.  The story isn't particularly interesting; it has some fun moments, but suffers from some rather two-dimensional characters.  If you enjoy solid, open-world, mindless shooters (like I do), then you'll enjoy this one.			"

												There have been countless villains in games, but none so crazy or psychotic as Vaas. He takes crazy evil guy to another level. The team at Ubisoft did a truly fantastic job at making this psychopath, he will genuinely leave you in terror at how cruel he is, and that is saying something considering he has no special powers, he represents how evil we can be as human beings and truely shows you how much you can hate someone. Far cry has a beautiful open world environment with many side missions and a noble quest to save your friends. Help the natives fight for the homeland and gain upgrades in the form of awesome tattoos. Another great game by Ubisoft.8/10			"

												Single player seems great, multiplayer is a absolute disaster, constant host migrations while playing and bugged out lobbys. its a shame because multiplayer can be very good when it wants to work. i would definately buy it for single or co op, but if your buying for multiplayer matches steer well clear you will left dissapointed. Graphically the game is quite nice, if you have a reasonable spec pc and you crank them settings upto ultra you will see well detailed enviroments and nice lighting effects. its early days for me so far so i have a lot of exploring to do, feel free to add me if you would like to do some co op :).

												I love open world games and having choices.  This game is awesome!  I love the ability to spec out your guy according to your killing style.  The ability to fly a glider, ride a boat or drive a car is also great.  The choice of weapons is pretty good.  Personally I would like to see more options for them.  Before I was halfway through the game I had the choice of pretty much every weapon.. so maybe spread out the rewards a tad more to give you something to work for.  Worth $30 bucks.  And I plan on replaying it again.  The Uplay thing, although annoying isn't that big of a deal unless you got something to hide.  One last issue I had was the boat mission where you HAVE TO BE STEALTH, and at the moment I just wanted to run and gun...Take care and happy hunting.			"

The concept of ""farming"" for supplies to craft your items can be a bit tedious but overall the gameplay is very fun.  Multiplayer is addicting (earning decoding items) and co-op is a blast, although the story is very short.			"

												This was the not only was it the best free-roam i have ever played. But the gameplay was perfect (the stealth was amazingly fun). And the story was amazing it could be a book or a movie. But this only goes for the story. The multiplayer was alright, but if you are a multiplayer kind of person then stick to CoD, Halo, and Battlefield. My rating would give the story a 9.75 out of 10. I would only say this because the healing was very repetative and kind of gross and annoying; I know this sounds dumb but if you've played it then you should agree. And the multiplayer would get a 7 out of 10. I thought the co-op was pretty good if you played it with you friends, so 8.5 out of 10 so if these ratings aren't good enough to get you to buy the game then you are missing out on the best spent $30 dollars ever.

												The theme of a descent into insanity is nothing new to video gaming. But few games manage to properly juxtapose the senseless and euphoric ultraviolence of the standard gaming experience and the psychological decomposition that happens to real people in such situations. Far Cry 3 is one of them.You are just a regular college student by the name of Jason Brody who's on a tour of east Asia with a few of your upper-crust friends and your two brothers. On a whim, you make an excursion to an all but uncharted island seeking some easy, anarchistic thrills, and quickly find yourself in the lowest pit of hell.Your friends are taken hostage by drug-farming, slave-trading pirates, from whom you barely escape at a terrible cost. From there, you meet a whole host of world-class characters brought to life by brilliant voice-acting (Vaas and Buck especially) as you fight to survive and manipulate the living, open-world jungle.There's a small degree of collecting and crafting, but when it comes to upgrading it's very straight-forward. You gain experience from combat (more from stealth takedowns) through an arcade-like point system, and you gain weapons by looting them off dead foes. The combat is fluid and dynamic, as planted explosives, freely roaming animals, random NPC patrols, and your own mistakes can aid or hinder you in your quest to save your friends.Kills and gunplay are especially satisfying. Melee kills make your heart pound with their hectic but smooth animations and audio, making every strike feel personal. The gun porn is ramped up and though recoil isn't a major concern, the ballistics are very effective, and the animations match the beauty of the open world of the islands.As you progress the story, however, Jason Brody will have moments of recess where he confides in others who are justly becoming concerned about his having gone tribal. And you might need a little genre awareness to realize that the horrible things you watch your first and even your second major adversaries do are no worse than what you've been wrecking upon their hapless subordinates. Alongside the main story are some side-quests with a couple more hilarious and unique characters, as well as small missions for hunting, gathering, assassinations, deliveries, and so on. Or, you could just give in to your inner demons and prowl the jungle seeking out the poor souls who wander its depths.10/10 - Became what I ate, ate what I killed.			"

												Far Cry 3 Good Points:-Compelling story- Lots of activities to do- Stealth is an option- Destructable jungle- Variety of weapons- Lighting and surrounds- All main characters are beautifully voiced and you truly feel how they feel- Multiple transport options (Car/Buggy, Paraglider/Wingsuit, Jetski/Boat)- Sick, twisted tyrants that are unique and unlike any other bosses in games- Soundtrack is just.. Beautiful- Skill tree has varietyFar Cry 3 Bad Points- Poor sound quality from lesser important characters- Repetition of speech from enemies-  Depending on style of play, earning money CAN be an issue- Various bugs (Classic Ubisoft) But none that are too game breaking- When set on fire, you take a lot of damage before you can put out the fire, this can be annoying- Hills that seem like you can climb them, cannot be climed, this can make exploring a bit of a drag at certain pointsIn total, out of 10 I would rate it a solid 9. I have played this game more times than I care to remember when I played it on Xbox. On PC, it is even better. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique story that will keep you coming back for more, the main character is one of a kind, as are the sick tyrants that inhabit the island. I cannot stress how brilliant and uniqe the story is to this game. The theme of finding yourself and who you are (and what you will become) along with having to cope with people who you love and know that the island is taking away what you were and turning into the thing you decided to fight against in the first place is just amazing. Honestly, buy this game if you haven't already and plunge into the island of insanity that is Rook Island. Far Cry 3 is a must have...			"

												I hated Far Cry 1 with its eagle eye AI spotting you in bushes 100 yards away.  I skipped FC2.  I wasn't going to play FC3 until persuading by a few friends insisted I buy it during the Steam sale.I'm glad I listened.  Far Cry 3 was an awesome dynamic fps experience.  The exploration alone is impressively massive, and it's fun to watch all the AI animal life interact with each other.  It creates a living world that's constantly keeping you busy and on your toes.There's so much to see and do in FC3 from hunting game to poker games.  From climbing tower puzzles to camp liberating missions you do your own way (stealthy or guns blazing).  You'll never be without something to do.  This game has so many memorable moments created by some really cool story missions, but also in the dynamically open world environment.I'm now a Far Cry fan again.  Looking forward to FC4. "

												This is for sure one of the most enthralling game I've ever played.It can't be said that it's 100% original hence it merges aspects from various FPS, actions and RPGs, but the quality with it's done is beautiful.I really have nothing to complain about, maybe it's too cocky and for fully enjoy the ambientation you need an high-end computer and the menus give you this porting-feeling.The storyline is well studied and the characters are created in a way that makes you love them while at the same time you will hate them. Except Vas. As it seems, everyone loves him.The ambientation is beautiful, maybe too green and ""flat"", but every single corner of the island is different from the other with it's personal flora and fauna.And even if i hate RPGs when you have to spend hours to gather resources, I LOVED, seriously, I LOVED roaming the island to kill animals for their leather to make holsters, wallets or quivers. Except Cassowaries. I can't even think of a reason why they are so annoying and OverPowered.THEY ONE-SHOT YOU WITH A KICK! AND RUN FASTER THAN USAIN BOLT ON SPEED!Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ Cassowaries.9/10 "

												Far Cry 3 has got to be the best game I have ever played, no joke. When I was looking around for things to do on Steam, I found the ""Write Review"" button, and the game that instantly came to mind was Far Cry 3. This game is so good- the mechanics are flawless, the animations are the best ever, and by gosh, this game has got to be top 10 for best graphics in a 2012 game. All around great purchase, definitely would reccommend. Try it sometime!			"

												A truly interesting look into what killing can do to a person, Far cry 3 combines jaw dropping graphics and well executed first person shooter game play into an amazing experience that any first person shooter fan would be disservincing themselves to skip. Not only that, but it has one of the most convincing and insane villians in video game history, The multiplayer is kind of stale but the co-op offers and enjoyable prospect when playing with friends.9/10. A true acheivment in first person shooters.			"

												Best Far Cry ever. I spent many hours in the game to hunt down animals and driving.Melee combat and sniping are both enjoyful. I found myself taunting across the screen many times :DAt first, inventory screen baffled me but you keep getting used to it.Buy it. But don't let it just stay at your account. Play it, enjoy the island, enjoy the scenario. -By the way multiplayer maps are good, game-modes are better.-----En iyi Far Cry oyunu.Oyunda araba sürme ve hayvan avlamayla epey vakit geçirdim. Bayağı eğlenceli.Bıçakla dövüş de, keskin nişancılık da eğlenceli. Oyunda çatışmalarda, sızma görevlerinde coşkudan adamlara bayağı saydırdım :DBaşlarda eşyaların olduğu ekran çok saçma geldi ama sonradan alışıyorsunuz.Adam akıllı bir oyun arıyorsanız, bu oyunu satın alın. Satın alıp da köşeye atmayın, oynayın. Sindire sindire oynayın, adanın ve oyun senaryosunun keyfine varın. 30 saati harcadım, tüm yetenekleri açtım, bazıları oyuna ""eklenti paketi"" etkisi veriyor :)Çoklu oyuncu haritaları iyi, oyun modları daha da iyi.

												One of the best FPS single player campaigns I've ever played.Pros:- Very comfortable gameplay. Aiming, running and crouching transitions feels smooth. Stealth is one of the best parts of the gameplay for me. The FOV works better than other games.- Melee kills :D- The islands and the variety of environments, caves, interiors, exteriors, on the sea, on the air etc.- The vehicles, the fauna.- The tagging system and the multiple approaches to one situation. Curious how much ""MGS V The Phantom Pain"" ripped of even from the UIs.- 38 main missions. - Hard mode is well balanced if you like stealth.- Vaas Montenegro, Sam Becker and the other characters. There're no tons of cutscenes but you feel every single one of them had some good moments.- Apocalypse Now references and of course ""Ride of the Valkyries"" haha! (now I wanna play Blood Dragon again!)- I find the voice acting very well done and natural for the situations each character goes through- Visually it looks amazing for its time and even for today's standards. Again...the island the vegetation etc...The character facial expressions are the bests from all Ubisoft games. Even secondary NPC's have good care in details and it's nice the few different kind of shaders like the glossy ones for eyeballs, the more anisotropic looking for hair, bamboo etc and the standard ones. About Ubisoft...personally I hate the work about this aspect in Assassins Creed games. Of course is a different team but a different engine. In this case Dunia Engine 2 which is very optimized and works outstanding.It's not a con but...The only bad thing that looks completely horrible are the cloud and atmospherics facing camera sprites. The can turn 180° too easy if you break its axis.- Every time you take a screenshot DOF bokeh looks natural (one of the few games did this on the 7th gen).-  Oh! I forgot the OST  with In-Game tracks from Die Antwoord, M.I.A., Skrillex and Noisia, Losers and The Glitch Mob for the trailers among others. Also the incidental tracks are outstanding. Another good one ""I'm Sorry"" by Brian Tyler.- Now that I play all Far Cry 3 I can say the game is not that far from the retouched screenshots Ubisoft always make public before releasing a game (without mention the E3 demonstration)Cons:- It rainned only once during my whole playthough.- I would love to had better side-quests. They're not bad but more of those related to the main campaign.- Who mapped the skills upgrades button to a ""double click""? I thought the entire game skills were blocked and I ran through all the mess of explosions and bullets with only two health bars xD...in hard mode... OK, OK...mostly my mistake!- SPOILER ALERT! Killing Vaas before the end of the game and the lack of a cliche twist about him.- I can't confirm this but people say multiplayer is not that good.Is just will say that this game is very valuable. Don't miss it!			"

												Uplay first, then game review.As many other reviews pointed out, this game uses UPlay. I don't like that it uses uplay because I bought the game through Steam and would like to play it only through Steam. But as long as it's fast going through their servers and isn't a complete nuisance to sign on, whatever.However, the first time I tried to play this it took me a ♥♥♥♥ing HALF HOUR to get in the damn game. At first it said uplay's servers were busy or offline, which took a while. I thought ""Ok, fine, I'll play offline. No big deal."" Guess what?! You CAN'T play offline the first time you run the game. So I HAD to go through their servers. When they were finally accessible, I got the Uplay captcha puzzle, which involved putting a single set of numbers from a single picture into two boxes. The rules: One box cannot be blank. The number cannot be copied into both boxes. The numbers cannot be split up. Think the audio captcha will help you out? It specifically says not to put spaces in, then says one set of numbers. Refreshing the captcha didn't help, I kept getting the same damn problem until I found one that had a letter tacked onto the end of the numbers which I put into the other box, and it finally worked. At this point I was pretty mad, I just wanted to play my ♥♥♥♥ing game and instead I'm wasting time trying to figure out the impossible captcha.From this point on it was easy to log in, the only other problem I had was that at one point my game stopped syncing, so when my SSD got scrambled (uplay decided to install itself on my windows drive instead of my programs drive), I lost half my progress. I also didn't know it at the time, but I wasn't getting achievements for storyline events. When I played through them again, I got them. So back up your saves, guys!FINALLY, THE GAMEThe game feels very much like the new Tomb Raider except more open. I also got a few fleeting feelings of Assassin's Creed. Like how it feels to play those games? You'll probably like this one. There's a wide variety of weapons and I like that you can get a lot for free by unlocking towers. Going hunting is actually good for something, as you use it to craft holsters, rucksacks, etc.The story didn't impress me at first, nor the character development, but I'm liking it much more now. I only wish there were more conversation opportunities with your friends! They all seem very one-dimentional, with the exception of Daisy, who just seems much more nuanced in her words and expressions. I will update this as I finish the game, 3 missions to go.The graphics are great, albeit a bit repetative (but they are on an island, so... lots of palm trees are to be expected, I guess). A few problems where I see black/blue shapes but nothing terrible or constant. Sometimes characters vibrate, which makes it ridiculously hard to snipe.Controls are great for the most part, the problem I have is when performing special actions. When I'm climbing a radio tower, stepping onto the very edge, and see ropes where ""climb"" should appear...it doesn't. I can wiggle one way or the other and sometimes it shows up, sometimes not. So I can jump and sometimes have the game catch me and climb up, or I can fall to my death and start over. Annoying. More annoying is when I'm sneaking around an enemy camp like a boss, killing people, when I sneak up behind someone and the ""takedown"" option doesn't appear. Again, I move around, sometimes it works. Most of the time though they either turn around and alert the whole camp, or I slice but don't kill them and they alert the whole camp.Open world, lots of places to explore even if climbing towers and liberating camps gets boring. Can't wait to see how it ends.			"

												That's how real open world first-person shooter should be done! Beautiful jungle, beaches, mountains and rivers... Towns full of junk. Animals roaming the islands... And sea. Paradise lost in great evil - merciless pirates and even more dangerous Hoyt's army. Prepare to become a warrior - master your arsenal and jungle around you. Story is amazing. Characters are the best - none other game can give you such amazing characters like Vaas or Jason Brody himself... Becoming a killing machine from typical California's boy spoiled by his parents. You can feel how he becomes a warrior. You see how he change! Story is interesting from start till the end... And dont forget that amazing soundtrack too!What's bad? Multiplayer is CoD-wannabe and doesnt support dedicated servers. Doesnt even have a server browser. Stupid console like lobby thing only... Uplay is required.Game feels easy even on hardest master difficulty...This is great Singleplayer experience. Buy it now or die in flames of hell for missing this one out!			"

												In praise of the undying bearI really liked Far Cry but really didn’t like Far Cry 2, so I was hoping that FAR CRY 3  would put the franchise back on track. Thankfully it did. The Rook Islands are beautifully realised and provide some of the most impressive and realistic graphics I’ve encountered to date. The islands are lush and colourful and teeming with wildlife, all of which makes for a deeply immersive environment. Even if you ignored all the missions there’s a lot of fun to be had just exploring and hunting. But there are plenty of missions (almost 40 main story missions, a dozen or so side missions, plus a bunch of hunting and supply missions) to be completed. The main story is pretty good for an open world game. It’s not outstanding by any means but it provides sufficient momentum for your stay on the island and includes some pretty cool trippy experiences. Alongside the missions there are numerous items to collect, if you feel so inclined, and there are radio towers to activate and outposts to liberate. I had as much fun completing these tasks as I did completing the missions (although I didn’t track down all the collectibles -- there are just too many of them). It’s not all good however. The game has an incomprehensibly stupid save system. There is only one save slot and you can’t save at all during a mission. So if you have to leave the game mid-mission you have to start right back at the beginning next time you play. I know other games have employed similar systems but I just don’t understand why. The option to save should always be there -- you don’t have to use it if you don’t want to. I also found the looting mechanics to be annoying. Although you don’t have to wait for the prompt to activate the process it’s still too easy to accidentally swap weapons rather than collect loot. And finally, not enough dialogue was recorded for the minor NPCs, and consequently you here them repeating the same statements over and over again. These gripes aside, however, there’s little to detract from what is a great gaming experience. I haven’t tried the multiplayer options yet so I can’t comment on them. I plan on giving them a try later and will update this review if necessary. 4/5			"

												8/10, one of the most immersive RPG games I have played, with a shocking and nice storyline which gets you right in the action and fulfills the dreams of every guy who is bored with civilization and wants to become a dropout!The negative aspects are tha there is no way to actually view your character (who seems to possess no feet!) and thus the equipment upgrades have no visual impact. The weapon choices are a bit limited for each of the two phases of the game when you get to unlock new weapons, although those available are fully and realistically customizable. The non realistic component is the healing system, which showcases 1st aid and self crafted syringes capable of (in later level and the corresponding skills) almost fully heal you amidst a hail of bulets in a matter of like 2 seconds.Aside from that the game boasts excellent graphics, very good characters and voice acting, a good variety of side quests and achievements (the achievements are shown on Uplay, and extra program you install together with FC3) as well as a variety of rewards and extra content that can be unlocked for free by spending points you get while playing the game. Aside from questing, you are fully able to explore around the two available islands, make little safaris and pursue some extra adrenaline with activities like paragliding, base jumping etc (I even flew on a paraglider from one island to another just for the sake of it xD) !

												Sucks.Let me specify. Poorly optimized. Runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Couldn't caliberate it to a 1600 dpi mouse. Gunplay sucks. Stealth is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Sound design is weaker than necessary for game that's main mechanic is jungle survival. Overall, just sucks.What's worse is that I liked Blood Dragon more! In retrospect, the only things I hated about Blood Dragon were the setting (as a 90's child, I ♥♥♥♥ing hate the 80's), and the visuals of it. The game ran a hell of a lot better, the controls were tighter, and gameplay was all-around, actually fun.So ya. This game sucks.Weeks later: So, I still find the game boring as hell. However, a random recollection of a random comment by some game production moggle came to mind: the suggestion that if PC gamers would accept the 720 resolutions, they could guarantee 60 fps. I initially assumed this was a lazy programmer trying to take pot shots at the PC community, as is often the case. However, upon remembering this statement, I was tempted to retry Far Cry 3 in 720p. To my surprise, without even activating the fan on my GPU, I am able to run the game at the highest possible settings with well over 60 fps. Is this good: no. For the fact that, just before I ran this test, I was playing Skyrim, a similar graphical powerhouse at full capacity at 1080p. At 720, yeah it may be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of graphical presentation, but what good is it  to do so only effectively at 720p for most (non Titan and similar high-end) machines; it still looks bad. Especially when a rival and fairly contemporary game runs beautifully at 1080p at 60 fps. So still, don't bother, but if you are compelled and run into issues, try it at 720i or 720p.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic! An immense open world to play in, a well integrated leveling system and a pretty amazing villain, Vaas.There are a few minor glitches and hiccups, like birds getting stuck indoors, characters appearing to jitter on screen and some of the textures in places can look a bit off. But you have to expect these things in such a massive game like this. And they never really detract from the experience.The game is filled with so much to do that even after the campaign is done and dusted, there's still so much more to explore and play around with and enjoy. Definitely one of those games that is a must-buy.			"

												3 out of 5.  Fun, beautiful / repetitive, derivative.  The first few hours of the game were a blast to play.  In the beginning there are serious limitations to how many weapons, and how much ammunition you carry.  As a result I spent several boring hours hunting animals to make larger bags and whatnot, fun the first time, boring the tenth time.  Even after I was fully upgraded I still felt like I couldn't carry enough ammo to play the way I wanted to.  The story is alright, and the island is relatively fun to explore.  Many of the side missions are unoriginal, and the way you unlock parts of the map by capturing towers is soooo unoriginal and a chore.  I feel like the creators had a good game, then added boring filler (hunting, side missions, towers) to increase the play time.  You can ignore these parts of the game, but then your character will be weak in the late-game.  None of the vehicles were as fun as they should have been, mainly due to poor controls and poor physics.  I really wish I liked this game more.  I recommend playing it, but get it I on sale like me.  The guns are pretty good, and I loved how you could customize most of them.  I wish there were more customizations.  I didn't hate this game, but I didn't love it, I wish there was a sliding scare or a 5 star rating system instead of a thumbs up or down.			"

												Farcry 3 is a choose-your-own way open world shooter. The stealth is pretty simple and sometimes the AI is pretty dumb, However you can certainly play through the whole game as either a stealthy assassin or maniac with a shotgun. The game does shine in freedom of choice in the murdering department. Many of the weapons and vehicles are quite fun. In addition to the storyline missions there is a lot of collecting and upgrades to find. Unfortunely these are pretty basic and repetitive after the tenth time.  Character development has a few options, but by the end of the game you will pretty much have every skill anyhow. The story is pretty loose. You play a typical dude-bro rich kid who ends up stranded on an island with some less than reputable denizens. Without spoilers the first third or so is actually pretty good, but really falls off the rails hard and fast after that. The two avialable conclusions are downright stupid. Until it was patched, you couldnt even continue the game after the last mission, you had to restart all over.It definately yells straight console port, which isnt bad in itself, but while everything ran fine it did pull on my system way more than it should have.  Other than that it looks great. Forced Uplay added junk is not fun.The DLC is forgettable. A few unique weapons that dont change much and a couple ok side missions.Sale Buy. 6.5/10			"

												Far Cry 3 is a great game that offers a great storyline with fun game play. The mechanics in this game are not the greatest but the takedown mechanics are very fun and enjoyable because who dosen't enjoy stabing someone and throwing a knife at the next enemy? The hunting is satisfying because it serves a purpose by allowing the player to hold more money, more ammo, more C4, more carrying capacity, and more syringes; because drugs are your friend in this game. Finding loot and collectibles are good adding more hours of gameplay and playing poker fun as well giving players choices in difficulty that changes the price to buy in. The only gripes I have with this game are with some skills not being very useful, money being limited, limited encounters with certain animals, not being able to experience co-op because not a lot of people use Uplay, and Uplay. I recommend this game because it's fun, enjoyable, satisfying, and you get to enjoy being on drugs!			"

												Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?In the beginning of the game, I found myself hiding from the pirates and avoiding confrontation because I didn't know the island, the weapons, or the enemy. As the game progressed, I found myself actively seeking and engaging the pirates more and more, and using the foliage and the jungle to my advantage. After finishing the game and realizing that the islands, the jungle, and Vaas, which all tore apart Jason's sanity, made me a little more like Vaas.I became more sadistic, psychopathic, and ruthless to my enemies in the game.I used violence to end violence, but it only created a more violent me. The victim became the abuser. The game itself is a mind blowing experience, the graphics, the details, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the immersive story, it all fits in together so perfect it makes this one of the best games I have ever played. Literally.Your character develops his sociopathic traits as the game progresses, accepting violence instead of refusing it, eventually admitting he enjoys killing just for the bloodlust, turning himself into the reckless, sadistic and cynical man he once feared. Have I ever told you the definition of insanity?			"

												Sucks.Let me specify. Poorly optimized. Runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Couldn't caliberate it to a 1600 dpi mouse. Gunplay sucks. Stealth is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Sound design is weaker than necessary for game that's main mechanic is jungle survival. Overall, just sucks.What's worse is that I liked Blood Dragon more! In retrospect, the only things I hated about Blood Dragon were the setting (as a 90's child, I ♥♥♥♥ing hate the 80's), and the visuals of it. The game ran a hell of a lot better, the controls were tighter, and gameplay was all-around, actually fun.So ya. This game sucks.Weeks later: So, I still find the game boring as hell. However, a random recollection of a random comment by some game production moggle came to mind: the suggestion that if PC gamers would accept the 720 resolutions, they could guarantee 60 fps. I initially assumed this was a lazy programmer trying to take pot shots at the PC community, as is often the case. However, upon remembering this statement, I was tempted to retry Far Cry 3 in 720p. To my surprise, without even activating the fan on my GPU, I am able to run the game at the highest possible settings with well over 60 fps. Is this good: no. For the fact that, just before I ran this test, I was playing Skyrim, a similar graphical powerhouse at full capacity at 1080p. At 720, yeah it may be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of graphical presentation, but what good is it  to do so only effectively at 720p for most (non Titan and similar high-end) machines; it still looks bad. Especially when a rival and fairly contemporary game runs beautifully at 1080p at 60 fps. So still, don't bother, but if you are compelled and run into issues, try it at 720i or 720p.			"

												To begin with, it's only fair to say that there are things to not like about Far Cry 3. By no means is this a perfect game, nor is it a groundbreaking game. That, however, does not stop it from being a great game and a superb way to waste away many hours of your life.I'll try to break this review down into several main categories, namely: graphics and visual effects, sound, story/characters, gameplay and overall feel. Here we go:Graphics and visual effectsEven now, after more than 3 years since the release, the game looks great. There are games that will gve you better graphics, better effects, better physics but what the player gets in FC3 is more than enough. The game setting is amazing, the jungle, water, sky, beaches - it all looks beautiful and, most importantly, rather realistic. All the animations are solid and there were really no eyesores throughout the game. Really good effort! All things you see close-up, like faces of NPCs, gun textures and so on are just lovely.One thing the game kind of lacks in is a proper physics engine that would let you destroy at least some elements of the environment. As things are, even wooden boxes are impervious to an RPG-7 round. Good thing is that at least fire spreads nicely, after you use a Molotov cocktail of a flamethrower.SoundNo complaints here either. The ambient noises of the islands and their wildlife lets the player really sink in the game. The weapons have nice, juicy sounds that almost let you feel their punch. The voice-over is also good, the voices match their characters and don't feel out-of-place. The only complaint is the repetetiveness of 'catchphrases' of the NPCs. Hearing 'It was all me!' was worse than the arrow-in-the-knee bit from Skyrim... The music featured some nice bits (especially during the mission where you light up a whole plantation of weed was spot on! As for the engine noises of the vehicles available... well they're there and that's it.Story/ charactersThe story is rather good, actually. I didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised. The protagonist and his friends are nicely thrown into the game and some of their stories (the bits that happen during the game, not their background, that's just mediocre) really made some impact on me. Especially the bloke the player rescues from Buck. That was just sick (but good for the story!). Of course, if you've seen any materials about FC3, you know that the highlight is the antagonist, who really wins the whole game, as far as the story and characters are concerned. Vaas is just an axcellent character and even his backstory is worth paying attention to.GameplayAt first, satisfying and a little challenging, later got repetetive and too easy. First annoying thing about it was the crafting system. It's great that it's there and I like how it encourages the player to venture off the beaten track to hunt for animals. However, honestly without crafting at least 6 items the game just gets on your nerves. Unless you craft a holster, you can only have one weapon, the numer of carred ammo is prepostrously low, your inventory is always full and so is your wallet. I know, Jason is just a tourist at the beginning but even so, he could surely manage to carry both a pistol and a bow at the same time. I ended up ditching all main story missions and spent several hours hunting just to get rid of these nuisances. As for exploration and combat, there is not much to complain about - it's satisfying and fun. Somewhere around 75% of the main story you can acquire some skills thatk make you a bit overpowered, with the 'chained takedown' being a prime example, but most importantly it did not get boring. A great plus here is setting the game in an open world, where animals, especially predators can provde some really unexpected twists to the gameplay.Overall feel and the verdictOverall feel was very positive. There was hardly a moment when I felt that the producers took shortcuts and ran out of ideas. The game did not feel like it was trying too hard to be something it's not. It felt like a really well crafted product.And that's what Far Cry 3 is, in essence. A very well-made, solid game certain to bring the player hours of fun, without trying to fool you nto thinking that it's a new milestone in video games design. The game world is very well designed, the gameplay mechanics are satisfying, there is no unnecessary drama, there are some excellent characters and story elements. The audiovisual aspects leave very little room for complaining, even more than three years since the release.Would I play it again? Probably no. If I want more of Far Cry 3, I can always play Far Cry 4 (which is what I'm doing now, incidentally). However, would I recommend it to someone who has never tried it? Oh yes. Most certainly yes!And finally, for some pros and cons list:PROSgraphicsaudiosatisfying, in the long run, gameplayhuge map, great settingthe antagonistsurprisingly good storybig arsenalvery good optimisation and hardly any bugsCONSforced crafting systemsome secondary charactersrepetitivenessuneven difficulty levellacking physics engineA score, on a 10-point scale for Far Cry 3 would be a solid 9. As I wrote before, it may not be a revolution but it surely delivers on what it is.			"

												Coming from recently playing Just Cause 2, I didn't expect the length of this campaign. Especially if you take the time to do side quests, DLC missions, and take over all the outposts and radio towers. This game is fantastic. You can run around and go in guns blazing, or you can sneak up and take everyone out quietly with silenced weapons or the bow. However, my favorite way to play is probably by getting to a high place and picking off enemies one by one with a sniper rifle. The campaign in this game is a must.The co-op is OK. It's not amazing, and I was disappointed that the co-op wasn't really open world like the single player campaign. You can play with up to four people, but you don't get all the abilities you have in the single player. One of the most fun parts of the co-op are the competitions. In each mission there is a part were all players are competing for the highest score. There are jet ski challenges, sniper challenges, bow challenges, RPG challenges, and more.The multiplayer was surprisingly fun. Most games like this that aren't built with a multiplayer focus are not very good. I find this one to be enjoyable. However, there are only a couple hundred people who play regularly, so you cannot play most game modes.There are some things in this game that just make you go ""What?"" Because as realistic as it seems most of the time, sometimes there are just crazy things. I won't tell you any so it's not spoiled, but be prepared for some crazy stuff.			"

												Its really good. Almost great. I'll just leave a list of positives and negatives.+FOV slider* (see negatives)+Lots of guns and customization of weapons. +The game encourages creative combat and gives you plenty of tools to do as you wish. (I'm a stealth nut and I had a blast clearing areas without being detected.)+The island's characters are fun and memorable.+19 hours to complete the game from start to finish according to steam. I did all of the outposts except for two, all of the towers, and I upgraded my stuff to max by hunting animals. All of which is pretty much mandatory unless you want to make the game extremely difficult.+Graphics are pretty great. Bright and colorful.+Lots of wild animals really bring the world to life.+Vehicles galore. Boats, gunboats, jetskies, handgliders, wingsuit, cars, jeeps, bigass trucks, buggys.-*FOV temporarily zooms back to default during cutscenes and when your character does an action (i.e. opening doors, climbing towers, hacking towers, getting in vehicles, etc.) This caused me a bit of nausea and headache after extended playtime. (It goes back to your FOV setting once the action/cutscene is complete)-I am getting really sick of Ubisoft's trope of climbing a tower and hitting a button to reveal areas of the map. It was cool for the first few Assassin's Creed games as a gimmick, but please stop putting it in every single game you make. ugh.-Jason Brody is the most unlikable protagonist I've ever played as. I seriously hate him and all of his friends. -Story is... I don't want to say bad, but very inconsistant. Sometimes its good, other times its bad. -Music sucks, but thats just my opinion. I actually turned it off. Its either generic bland orchestra, meh tribal, or dubstep. -I hate mandatory side missions. Tower climbing to reveal the map. Hunting to upgrade inventory size, wallet size, weapon slots, etc. And taking down outposts to make it so you're not constantly being attacked at all times every time you step outside (I tried to not do outposts and the constantly being attacked started to drive me nuts, though I will say that I actually enjoyed taking down outposts).Tip: I was getting lots of framerate dips and crashes until I turned down the PostFX setting. Then everything else was pretty much at max and it ran smoothly after that. I don't know what that PostFX setting did that hogged up so much power, but turning it down to low didn't change much visually and greatly increased performance.			"

												An absolutely beautiful, dark, thrilling, and ocassionally even funny game. Even if Far Cry 3 doesn't do all that much in the 'open world' category, you are, technically free to go wherever and do whatever you choose in any order you choose. The dissapointing thing to someone who might buy this game solely for the open world could be the lack of DIFFERENT things to do. Don't get me wrong, the outposts were never repetitive, and I played my fair share of knife throwing competitions, but I always felt more inclined to continue the story than anything else. However, if you go into Far Cry 3 expecting a great adventure game, you will be very impressed. The story is incredible despite some obvious 'plot twists' and every mechanic in the game from pulling glass out of your arm to piercing an enemies heart with your machete feels epic, intense, and most of all, never boring. I could go on forever and ever, but I'll leave you with this. Far Cry 3 is one of my all time favorite games and I can promise that you will not regret buying it, especially if it's on sale.			"

												This game is definitely worth playing! It's a bit mature, and has lots of drugs and trippy moments, but it has a really intriguing story, surprisingly good characters, great conflict in the story, awesome gunplay and weapon options, an amazing open world, a good sense of progression as you explore and fight, very nice graphics, very awesome mechanics, and a bit of humor here and there! The villians are hatable to no end, and I love that! My only complaints are the lack of full control customization for PC and the voice quality for characters outside cutscenes can be really bad! I say that this game should be played by anyone who is okay with the mature content and is looking for an open world FPS with a pretty good story sprinkled in! Bruce Willis out of Ten!			"

												Far Cry 3 does a lot of things right.Open WorldThe Open World in the game offers a lot of content aside from the main campaign missions.Racing,shooting challenges with various weapons,capturing outposts and hunting animals.There are probably 30-40 hours worth of game play if you want to 100% the game.UplayI didn't have problems with Uplay aside from the occasional failure of the Uplay overlay to connect to the servers.There are fixes for every single problem that you may have regarding Uplay and you can also disable the in-game overlay.Or you can simply use the key that you get when you buy it on Steam and play it on Uplay.There is no reason to not buy this game just because of Uplay.GameplayIn Far Cry 3 most of the time you will kill endless waves of enemies.Which is fun because each mission is unique in it's own way and there are enough weapons to spice things up.When you are not following the campaign missions,you can capture rebel outposts.You can go Rambo style and kill everyone or you can try to do it in a stealthy way without getting detected.Hunting is another important part of the game.Without hunting animals,you can't improve your gear.It will be harder and harder to fight enemies so the game kinda forces you to hunt animals.Hunting for me,got boring fast.Most of your prey will consist of herbivores that will run once they see you,and you need to simply shoot them.Tigers,sharks,bears and so on are much more fun to hunt,but in the later parts of the game you can just snipe them from afar.Driving in this game is very well done and there is a decent variety of vehicles on the island.Storyline(Potential spoilers)Surprinsingly,the plot is the weak part of the game.You play as Jason Brody.An American tourist that spends his vacation on the island with a bunch of his friends and family.But something goes wrong and everyone is captured by Vaas and his pirates.You go from Jason Brody,a young rich American to a killing machine and expert assassin in about 10 minutes.Most of the stuff that happens,doesn't make real sense.The island natives trust you for no reason,Vaas keeps trying to kill you in weird ways only for you to escape over and over and some characters were undeveloped.Vaas,the best character in the game by far gets too little time on your screen but because he is such a good character you don't even notice that.Hoyt,the main villain after you kill Vaas in a weird vision/dream is undeveloped and is outshined by Vaas in every way.It's a shame both villains get to die in dreams/visions.Your allies in the game are not particularly good characters.Only Sam the German stands out but he too gets too little screen time.Your friends are boring and you only get to interact with them when you save them and they don't have anything good to say.Dennis is the friendly NPC that helps you in the tutorial but stays along for the ride until the end of the game.Citra is a decent character but the plot doesn't make sense with her in it.At the end of the game you can choose between two endings.Citra or your friends.Both endings are kinda underwhelming but one of them is particularly bad.TL;DRFar Cry 3 is a great open world FPS,with tons of content,a great villain in Vaas and a weird storyline.

												Contrary to my previous comment (Uplay is bad): the game is still very very good. It revives the feeling of Far Cry 1 when you had to explore marvelous tropical islands, where the sea was as pleasant as to make you weep with joy. Apart from that, the game has many ways to keep you busy: collecting relics, capturing outposts, collecting lost letters, crafting your gear, but I like shooting enemies best and the game definitely offers opportunities for that kind of pastime.

												Far Cry 3 has been a heavy step up from the 2nd on all accounts. The story is engaging, you as a main character go through a heavy metamorphose, there's a big update graphics-wise and the missions have so much variety it keeps things exciting at all times. None of the sidemissions, grabbing letters of the lost, relics and the like feel like a chore either if you do some along the way, whilst gettings animal skins to upgrade your ammo storage, or making your way to the radio towers and so on.The deluxe edition had some fun extra missions but it's not really worth it if you're paying the full prize. Shame it's Uplay but other than that I have no remarks. (choose wisely at the end)			"

												Imagine a water-down GTA experience on an island.  The nice thing this is not 3rd person.  Now is this game fun? Yes but you have to know what to expect.This is essentially a stripped down crafting system from Elder ScrollsA FPS done similar to COD, Battlefield etc but more realism oriented so you can see your feet and arms.  Heck when you cut animals open and take about a 16 oz steak sized piece of meat out your character EVERY TIME says ""ugh"" as if he wouldn't be desensitized the 100th time no.The game tries this thing called immersion or whatever to give you a sense of urgency to do things; like oh no I'm stuck here on this island with lots of guns and crazy people and animals and I can make drugs WHOA trippy. So here's what I did. I couldn't get over the fact the red bad guy dudes were driving on a road right next to the good guy casual hippy asian people with austrilian accents.  So I stole one of the jeeps and parked it across the road. Mind you this is in the tutorial section of the game where you are supposed to be all serious and low level (there are no levels sorry bad metaphor).  Anyways not a minute later some AI goons drive up and sure enough stop and get out ""OH MAN WHA IS dis CAR? Whooo Dare?"" in there most awesome Engrish.  So I stabbed them and took their AK-47s. Then it hit me: this is not a survival sandbox open world game on some island. NO. It is a can you figure out how to get rich and powerful like a african or south east asian warlord! Then omg I had so much fun! I started setting up road blocks everywhere and before you knew it crowds of bad guys would show up just so I could get their free stuff! LOOT PINYATA. (I dont know how to do that N with the ~ over it).So yes tho I've clocked a full 3 hours (ok rounding up) this game against AI is amazing.what about the co-op? Is the multiplayer any good? NO. Nobody plays this, its years old and frankly the survival go make a base kill your friends genre is way beyond this. However this is a very mild easy to play semi-story whatever you are the hero kinda guy so you save the day kinda game. I mean who doesnt love that? Ubisoft weekend $5. I mean can you complain bout that? really?			"

												Not for the faint hearted or those who prefer to just run into situations guns blazing.This game is a thinking persons game. You need to plan your tactics before entering most situations. Enemies are, mostly, smart and will not stand there for you to shoot them when you are in combat. Add to this an array of weapons big and small that would have John Rambo as excited as a kid in a candy store, an RPG like element which teaches you certain skills for various situations, a stealth system that actually works, and combat that never fails to get your heart pumping, you have a mix of elements that will have you getting really involved in the world.Tactics: You really need to plan your actions in this game. The health system is kind enough to give you a certain amount of survivability, but get caught in the middle of 10 enemies all packing big guns, and you are gonna hit the dirt faster than you can get more than a clip of shots off (and that is on easy mode). This game makes you think, and gives you options for how you take on enemies.Enemies: These guys have their flaws. But mostly they are smart enough to run for cover, aim properly, and use tactics of their own such as attempting to flank you. They tend to hunt you relentlesly if you run away, and will only give up after you have run a certain distance.Weapons: This game gives you an array of weapons that are quite extensive and suited to any tactics you want to use. Most of them come with modifications that will enhance their usefulness. Some weapons become free as you advance in the game. RPG Elements: This is kept somewhat thematic by the fact you are not a trained merc or anything like that. You are a civilian. So you need to learn combat abilities as you go. It uses the idea of you being initiated into the islands tribal warrior class using tattoos that mark your advancement in various areas of combat techniques. This element strongly has you thinking of the way you want to take on your enemies from the first time you get to choose an ability.Stealth: This relies on, mainly, cover. Cover includes the obvious, such as walls, structures, and vehicles. But it also expands to things such as trees, bushes and the like. There are a few stealth based weapons available, meaning that you can really use stealth to your advantage. And There are abilities which allow you to perform stealth takedowns.Combat: Fast paced, explosive and violent. Combat is very well implemented. Even when in combat with small groups of enemies. You will find your adrenaline pumping and your brain working overtime.All these elements need to be experienced to get an understanding of how good they make this game. If you want a game that makes you feel Rambo or Mclain style. This is for you.10/10			"

												This game isn't really the type of game I would play but after giving it a shot I was hooked and I HAD to try and finish it. You, your brothers and your friends are on vacation on an island and you get captured by pirates. They scatter you and your friends and you have to try to rescue them. There's a whoole more to it but that's the premises of the game. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking to play an action adventure shooter type game.			"

												This game made it into my Top 3 games of all time easily. Maybe even the number 1 spot. Cannot wait for Farcry 4. If it's even half as good as this game it will be brilliant. 12/10 would play again.			"

												Well.... 19 hours in.... and I still haven't done much in the storyline yet. I plan on getting to that though. Maybe around the 40th hour? I'm not sure. So many possible ways of killing. Plus you can reset enemies manually, +1. I've already played the game all the way through on the PS3, but it's 100x better on PC with max graphics..			"

												Coming from recently playing Just Cause 2, I didn't expect the length of this campaign. Especially if you take the time to do side quests, DLC missions, and take over all the outposts and radio towers. This game is fantastic. You can run around and go in guns blazing, or you can sneak up and take everyone out quietly with silenced weapons or the bow. However, my favorite way to play is probably by getting to a high place and picking off enemies one by one with a sniper rifle. The campaign in this game is a must.The co-op is OK. It's not amazing, and I was disappointed that the co-op wasn't really open world like the single player campaign. You can play with up to four people, but you don't get all the abilities you have in the single player. One of the most fun parts of the co-op are the competitions. In each mission there is a part were all players are competing for the highest score. There are jet ski challenges, sniper challenges, bow challenges, RPG challenges, and more.The multiplayer was surprisingly fun. Most games like this that aren't built with a multiplayer focus are not very good. I find this one to be enjoyable. However, there are only a couple hundred people who play regularly, so you cannot play most game modes.There are some things in this game that just make you go ""What?"" Because as realistic as it seems most of the time, sometimes there are just crazy things. I won't tell you any so it's not spoiled, but be prepared for some crazy stuff.			"

												I love open world games and having choices.  This game is awesome!  I love the ability to spec out your guy according to your killing style.  The ability to fly a glider, ride a boat or drive a car is also great.  The choice of weapons is pretty good.  Personally I would like to see more options for them.  Before I was halfway through the game I had the choice of pretty much every weapon.. so maybe spread out the rewards a tad more to give you something to work for.  Worth $30 bucks.  And I plan on replaying it again.  The Uplay thing, although annoying isn't that big of a deal unless you got something to hide.  One last issue I had was the boat mission where you HAVE TO BE STEALTH, and at the moment I just wanted to run and gun...Take care and happy hunting.			"

												An absolutely beautiful, dark, thrilling, and ocassionally even funny game. Even if Far Cry 3 doesn't do all that much in the 'open world' category, you are, technically free to go wherever and do whatever you choose in any order you choose. The dissapointing thing to someone who might buy this game solely for the open world could be the lack of DIFFERENT things to do. Don't get me wrong, the outposts were never repetitive, and I played my fair share of knife throwing competitions, but I always felt more inclined to continue the story than anything else. However, if you go into Far Cry 3 expecting a great adventure game, you will be very impressed. The story is incredible despite some obvious 'plot twists' and every mechanic in the game from pulling glass out of your arm to piercing an enemies heart with your machete feels epic, intense, and most of all, never boring. I could go on forever and ever, but I'll leave you with this. Far Cry 3 is one of my all time favorite games and I can promise that you will not regret buying it, especially if it's on sale.			"

												This game is definitely worth playing! It's a bit mature, and has lots of drugs and trippy moments, but it has a really intriguing story, surprisingly good characters, great conflict in the story, awesome gunplay and weapon options, an amazing open world, a good sense of progression as you explore and fight, very nice graphics, very awesome mechanics, and a bit of humor here and there! The villians are hatable to no end, and I love that! My only complaints are the lack of full control customization for PC and the voice quality for characters outside cutscenes can be really bad! I say that this game should be played by anyone who is okay with the mature content and is looking for an open world FPS with a pretty good story sprinkled in! Bruce Willis out of Ten!			"

												Singleplayer is brilliant, the storyline is full of suspense and great acting, along with brilliant cutscenes and characters.The graphics are literally 2nd to none, whilst the gameplay itself is engaging and satisfying; pummelling baddies with a machete, or laying down a fusilade with a PKM only to watch a Tiger burst out and maul your opponents is simply brilliant, it's random events like this that makes Far Cry 3 unique to other sandbox games.The multiplayer is decent, but other than the victorious team's MVP using a finishing move after they win a round; it doesn't really bring anything new to the FPS multiplayer table. Saying that it isn't bad either! Just don't go expecting a level of depth that equals Battlefield.Overall, I'd say, if you're bored of your collection of games and have a few coins jingling about in your virtual wallet. Go get. You won't regret it!			"
