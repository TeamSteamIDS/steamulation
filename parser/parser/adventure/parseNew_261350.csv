Early Access Review
								Beta0: 0.4.0.171 - 11/17/2014Time to really update this review!After the update I still keep my note of 9/10 and, but looks of it, it's going to be a 10/10 in the future. Considering it’s a small team, it’s a bit normal for updates to be delayed.Now, i keep all the pros from the old version, but I would like to add more to the list:-combat speed increased, but it’s a bit to easy-island development is faster; from 96 wood planks and 96 glass for the level 5 office it went to 15 planks and 15 glass (same with all other buildings, but the ratio varies)-character progress is faster-with these 3, it’s very easy for a new player to check the game’s content faster than before-extra story to fill in the gap-lowered phone requirements (~900 mb and a really cheap smartphone required)-it’s steampunk :DAlpha2: 0.3.1b.62:All I can say that the oct reviews are up to date. Don't know how the game was in the early stages, but now it's great! It is pretty linear until you hit level 10 and get yourself a jet pack and start sending captains on explore missions; these things can be easily obtained if you follow the quest line. Considering that it's an early version, I would give it 9/10! Pros:-lovely design-city building in a basic, but wonderful form-enough RPG elements to make you wonder what's next-option to play on PC and mobile (the phone requirements are really low excepting the ~1.8 gb required)-ingame button to send bugs which really speeds up the process-repeatable quests even if some are bugged; it can get you an extra daily hour for nice rewards-FF/Septerra Core combat style-option to explore different island (combat for XP and loot, resources, creature)-resources generate while your away; the bigger the level the more resources it can holdCons:-bugs (what do you expect in this stage?)-FIXED: combat speed, but it'll be changed with the next update-unbalanced captain missions (don't do the diplomatic escort!)-FIXED: lack of content after level 13 (except the few daily missions)-FIXED: takes some time to realize it's full potentialWith all this said, I would recommend the game without a second thought!

								Normally I do not purchase early access games, but I had been following this game for quite some time. When I saw it included in a bundle it was a no brainer, so I got it. This game alone has changed my opinion of early access games completely! This is a fun, light hearted, casual city builder/RPG. You build a city and collect resources every so often, adventuring to other lands inbetween. The graphics are great and everything runs really smoothly. Pros:Charming graphicsMultitude of things to docombines city builder/RPG really wellResource collecting/crafting implemented very nicelyCons:Combat animations are to slowNo world map for the different islands you visit As others have mentioned the combat can be agonizingly slow, especially against some enemies that heal every other turn and drag out the fight. So I would recommend some tweaking to the combat system overall! Also seems like no matter what weapon you choose, you do the same amount of damage. While combat is annoying, I am able to look past this for now.The other major downfall of this game is there is no world map for the lands you visit. I constantly find myself wondering around trying to find a specific person for different quests. This can be really annoying when trying to progress through the game.Overall it is a well polished game, and a steal for $15! In its current state I would rate it about a 7.5/10. I have faith that it will reach its full potential in the near future!			"

								When reading, keep in mind this is not a finished game! I am giving it a thumbs up based on the direction I see it heading and its potential. Never buy an early access game if you want a bug-free, totally polished experience. That being said, Steam Bandits: Outpost has great potential. It plays a like a mix between Kingdom for Keflings/World of Keflings and Torchlight/TL2, but with a good old fashioned turn-based fighting system. I like real time fighting as much as the next gamer, but it's been a while since I played a game with turn-based fights so it's a fun change. The art is lovely. The quests (past the tutorial) have a nice sense of humor. In fact, the whole game has a lighthearted feel that I enjoy. The writing, combat, and parts of the UI need some work, and sometimes it feels a little too much like a Zynga game (such as weird wait times for things to complete), but remember, this is still in beta. For things that need improvement, the dev team is extremely responsive to suggestions and bug reports. Do get this game if you like town-building and questing, and want to be part of the development process. Your feedback very literally will shape the direction of the game. That's pretty cool.			"

Early Access Review
								It would hardly be fair to review the game now properly, so consider this more of a ""How the game is"" on October 5th 2014. Good things -Art: Lovely art, gives off an easy for the eyes feeling with lots of visuals, artistic buildings and a theme that goes trough the game. Probably not for everyone, but definitely good enough for release here. Exploration: Gives a lot of freedom in exploration, at least after you get the jetpack and learn how to use your captains correctly. The incentive to explore and send your captains out constantly is stronger than the incentive to log off and simply check daily, which is also a plus.F2PLAY: Real free to play, no nonesense. I haven't seen anything which could remotely give an advantage over others in the game which is connected to cash, and from what I have heard the things which will be implemented for the cash will be purely cosmetic, my bet is on different building themes and such, which is 100% fine with me, hell, I'd even buy it.Developers: They put in the Alpha the bug thing on the top, so that whenever I came across a bug it was the easiest thing in the world to report it. I also see they are working a lot with their community, which is definitely a big plus. That alone makes me move the game to my special steam folder.Customization: You can build your town as you want, fix your captains as you please and even control your pet and missions. The game really hits the nail on the head here, without being overly agressive. More options would be fun, or at least the ability to get a really big island to build a whole town for others to explore. Though, that might already exist, the price is just too high for me to have been able to buy the island.Will work on several devices: Definitely a big plus, since it means I can enjoy the same game on a pc or my cellphone.NEGATIVES -Alpha and bugs: I have come across as expected several bugs, so if you are getting this don't expect a 100% smooth gameplay, it is far better than most beta's however in terms of stability, but a lot is either unbalanced or feels off.Balance: To elaborate on that, the game really doesn't reward YET progress in a proper manner, your attacks and new captains deal what feels like absurdly low damage in the start, even at high level without using skills and before you upgrade your blacksmith you can't even send them out properly on quests due to lack of engineers. The new weapons come very slowly and several places the cost is absurd to the payoff. Especially on a captain quest, where you pay 700+ gold and get 250 xp and 55 gold or so, which is the same reward as using 20 wood ( value roughly 50g ). So this part is probably the most annoying part.Multiplayer not fully developed: The game is online, and that part is great and all. But elements like trading, working together or teaming up are completely gone for now. I am not sure if they will be added, but at least the ability to maybe make quests in your own towns would bring this game a notch up on that aspect.Combat: Oh god, likely the biggest flaw of the game. The exploration part is glorious, and the quests are interesting and fun. But the combat feels slow, skills meaningless and no ability to skip animations or otherwise speed up / automate / skip it. Which is a joke since you simply wait, press your ability, and then repeat an infinite amount of times.  I even try to avoid non quest related monsters as much as possible, just to avoid another combat in its current state.Conclusion-I consider the game fun, enjoyable and definitely something you can just waste a few hours on if you got spare time. I recommend it if you want to try something new, but only if you are able to be patient and deal with the fact the challenge curve is upside down in the start and the horrible combat.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is honestly more fun than I was expecting for the development stage that it's at. Considering this is an early access build, there's a lot to do! No bugs I'm running into that make the game unplayable or intolerable; mostly just small cosmetic ones. I picked it up and played around for several hours. Still have quests to do but I figured I'd add in my two cents! Pros:-The art is gorgeous. Environments and assets are really pretty, the pets are super cute (I grabbed so many beacons in the hopes I could have a bunch running around my town but alas, need more berries right now).-OH MY GOD YOU CAN MOVE THE TREES AND PLANTS. I was so freaking happy when I accidentally scooted a tree out of the way while setting up stuff on the starter island. It's like setting up your town in Animal Crossing and not having to build your path around rocks cause you can just MOVE THEM. I love that SO MUCH. -That said, town building is pretty fun. I've enjoyed the sorta RPG-with-a-developing-storyline-but-you-can-sit-around-and-make-stuff-at-home thing. Personally I enjoy those types of games so I'm having a good time. -I like the COG system; it's a little bit like being able to change your classes ala Final Fantasy V since it grants you different abilities that let you battle differently. Being able to remove them is awesome for those who want to find the best set ups for their favorite captains. (I don't think I have real cons at this point, more like things for the devs to consider moving forward)Feedback: -I feel like the battle music could be a bit more hype, but that's just my opinion. -Certain gatherable items like berries seem to have a front face. If that front face is against a wall or stuck behind bushes, you sorta walk around it in circles and can't have it.-The battle system feels a little bit on the slow side; even an ""easy"" map seems to have long battles.  A ""normal"" map was difficult to the point that I KOed more frequently than I felt was right.-The walk speed is also a bit slow for my taste? But again, that may just be for my taste. -That said, being able to scroll around on your town and click things rather than walk across it from building to building might be nice. Could be offset if you walked faster though I guess.-An option to repeat a task after it's been completed would be nice.-There are some weird animations (the main character walk feels a little clunky), but nothing really distracting.TLDR I'm looking forward to where this game will end up in the future. It's already really promising and I'm gonna go back and do some quests now.			"

								Steam Bandits is a mix of classic turn based RPG, and townbuilding, set in a steampunk universe.  Did I mention everything is on floating islands?  There are many ways to play the game and advance your town and characters.  In the town you can craft weapons and armor, send other captains on missions, or go on missions yourself! As a fan of steampunk games, I suggest giving Steam Bandits a try!			"

								This game is actually quite fun.I read an article at Kotaku before buying this game and it is everything that article was about: taking an idea that could be the next farmville but fortunately turned into a simple RPG game. I'm only at the beginning but I already like what I see.The combat is turn based JRPG (like Final Fantasy), the city building is like Farmville. City building itself also has RPG elements: you designate a manager to each building and those managers gain experience from those buildings and be able to perform more complex tasks.I don't know how this game will end up but I believe in developers and I'm quite happy with what I have on my hands right now.

								Edit: I have since reported the game as broken and abandoned.At this point i cannot recommend this game at all. While it looks charming it feels like a half finished (to be fair the version is at 0.5) browser game and at a 20$ price tag you can get either more value or more potential. Its supposed to be F2P without the campaign at some point, but what i can see so far that campaign is not going to be worth 20$. Looking for some charming small studio game to support? Check out Highlands here on Steam.As a side note I paid less than 4$ for a key so i do not feel like i wasted too much money and if this game turns out to be awesome in the future i will buy a key at full value for a friend.And dont be fooled by the 22h it says i have played. Most of the time i was waiting for the Jobs to finish(1-2h) while playing something else. The game does run while logged off (just like the hundreds of free browser games of the same type), but i found it too much hassle to exit and to keep logging back in.			"

								If you spend less than a few hours in this game, you may quickly draw the conclusion that this game belongs on Facebook among the likes of animated farming simulators and kitchen-cookeries. However, like I have found - - you will reach the conclusion that this game is geared to have vast content and that between daily tasks, leveling, gearing, and keeping a tie-down on whats going on in your village you will have more than enough to do. The game is still in development, and there are bugs; some of which can be a bit on the annoying side. Combat is bland for the time being, and looks like something out of a flash game; but that is quickly being fixed. If you buy into this game you have to think of what it will be, not what it currently is; having said that i'm a few hours in and still having a good time.			"

								Steam Bandits: Outpost is a ton of fun already, and shows even more promise.  I've already accidentally stayed up past 2am twice on work nights getting hooked on this game; A++The core mechanics are a great mixture of Final Fantasy - style RPG (form a party, outfit your party, explore dungeons and do quests, etc.) and a city-builder without all the coercive and frustrating monetization mechanics that have given that genre a bad name recently.  Basically, the you build the city to actually provide a home base for your adventuring and support your team, it's not designed as a money sink.  In fact, there are no coercive monetization tactics employed at all - the only stuff you can buy is cosmetic.  This is extremely refreshing in today's game landscape, especially in this genre.  The developers are seriously committed to creating a game that players truly enjoy, and don't seem interested in trying to suck players' wallets dry using psychological tricks pulled mostly from slot machines.  The art and music style are wonderful and add a great ambiance, and the customization system is already very deep.  Combat is fun, and leveling up your city and characters is rewarding and engaging without being frustrating.  The game is, of course, still incomplete.  It has some bugs, and the content is incomplete (duh, it's in Early Access).  However, what is there already comprises a fun game, and inspires confidence that the full final game will suck up many dozens of hours of my life.			"

Can you give us some background on the new people?Jason Fader Lindsey Laney J.D. Cerince Brianna Garcia Liz Fiacco Alexia Fedail Matthew YaegerSure thing! Most of those folks were hired back on by Obsidian within the first year after the kickstarter. Matthew Yaeger still helps out, but is mostly part-time.

								Although I have only spent an hour with the game, I can already see a ton of potential. The game plays like any other facebook game, but the depth of this far exceeds expectations. This is a rare gem of a point and click adventure. The combat is awesome turn based style. If you like point and click adventures, buy this game. The customization is surprisingly ample. Give the game a try, i see alot of potential in this early access.			"

								I am enjoying this game more than I thought I would, don't be put off by the fact it runs on Android too its a great game, there is still a few issues but nothing major. It runs perfectly fine on Linux with just the odd graphical glitch. There is a major content patch coming probably sometime this week too, adding loads of new content and raising the level cap :D Also don't be put off by Free To Play its NOT PAY TO WIN! so its OK with me that there are in game purchases (just vanity items).  Sometimes there are periods when its seems there is nothing to do but just send your captains to find new explorable islands, those fill your time nicely, I am sure this will be less of a problem in the new patch anyway :D Combat is probably the weakest area, though there is some strategy involved, keep in mind that changing weapons, can change your secondary attack. Also don't worry about your island being a bit small, there are more player islands, you can keep building on and flying between them all :D			"

								EDIT [2015-06-04]: This review is out-of-date. The developers contacted me to tell me they've greatly improved the game and ask me to play and review the game again which I just haven't gotten around to.This game looks beautiful and I hardly ever encountered game breaking bugs, i.e. on average less then 1 in 10 hrs.The game starts of nice and smooth, pacing feels good but soon turns into tedium. Around player level 10 you rarely get the feeling of progression. Still the game is quite addicting. It scrapes facebook-ishiness but manages to keep the player occupied, i.e. you don't have to wait for some stupid energy bonus to pop up every X minutes.The reduction of player progress to a crawl is what makes me not recommend this game.Fortunately this game is still in development (2014-11-04: version 0.3.1b.62) so you don't really need my partial venting below. However here are some pointers as to pros and cons for Steam Bandit Outpost. The wishlist at the end may also give more insights.Pro:* Nice graphics featuring multiple biomes and a multitude of NPCs and support characters* Potential to be developed into a well-balanced game* Good enough story* Almost no game breaking bugs and only one so far a restart won't fix* Highly addictiveContra:* No character development, only new characters and new equipment* Combat disregards attack power and defensive capabilities* Next to no rewards for grinding which is still essential to game progress* Combat feels like stupendous clicking with unnecessary animation* Bad management of Captain Missions* Bad management of equipment (obvious tablet user interface structures)* Bad crafting management* Highly addictive* Upgrades are expensive and their respective usefulness not well documentedAbout progress:Outside the main story line which is bound to player level progress it gets pretty hard to acquire XP. For example, progress from level 13 to 14 needs 3,676 XP. The main story line provided something like 1K XP, don't really remember, let's say 2K. So you need over 1,5K XP to get to the next level. By that time I have occasional access to repeatable fights granting roughly about 8-15 XP. So in the unachievable best case that's 100 fights which you need to unlock as battle islands in repeatable captain missions - as opposed to player missions they need time to finish (10-20 minutes).About fights:Now, the actual bad thing here is that you need to go through fights and fights are boring. The standard attack does not develop yet, neither does defense - both are roughly fixed right now, i.e. a standard attack does around 10 damage except for misses or critical (x2). So you need to find weapons which have special attacks dealing triple, 10-fold, 14-fold damage. Those weapons are given to you at some predetermined points in the main story line and with them you have a good chance of winning a 15XP fight but the enemies may also just wipe the floor with your three fighters.So, apart from a few boss fights, the ""strategy"" is hit enemies indiscriminately with your strongest attacks until one party is defeated. This alone calls for an autofight feature - right now your click and confirm each attack, targets are auto-selected and can be changed. The battle animations are unfuriatingly slow or rather feel that way after hundreds of fights. This calls for a skip animations feature.Basic fights feel like obstacles rather than challenges. They require unending clicking and give almost no rewards - human enemies drop money (up to 8 gold; my next financial goal is 10K :( ) and the very rare random enemy may drop equipment. I almost want to request a throw dice option to just tell me if I win or lose simply in order to not have to sit through the fight.About resources:In order to progress you need resources of which there are 5 types which come in different qualities, e.g. Wood can be made into Planks which I guess can be made into Sturdy Planks. I know there are Sturdy Planks because I found them in a chest but I can not yet produce them. Why is this important? Because crawling progress. I can make Planks from Wood, i.e. 1 Plank from 28 Wood, a process which must be individually scheduled for each Plank and takes 10 seconds to complete without scheduling (which takes about 2 seconds). While a workshop produces nothing else can be scheduled. The last level upgrade for my main building, I think to level 4, requires 96 Planks. So whatever amount of Planks I don't find I need to schedule in a workshop. I can have three workshops in parallel (actually more but then on different sites switching between those being to slow to be considered feasable). The upgrade also needs 96 Glass which can be produced from 28 Silica (sand) each - again in 10-second individually-scheduled production cycles.This is fun for about 30 seconds.Wishes:* No Click-Through; clicking some UI elements also counts as a click on the terrain below deselecting buildings or resulting in unwanted movement* Easier Captains Management; If there is a picture of a captain have access to load-out* Easier Missions Management; Show all Captains with stats and all Missions as list* When equiping captains make other captains easily available* Have every time displayable on map, e.g. resource gathering buildings** Display progress bars in interaction UI (bottom right), maybe along the circle, don't forget actual time* Crafting queues** In Engineering have a slider to order multiple productions of the same higher-level resource* While equiping display in-battle skills (Heal, Smash, Poison etc.) with equipment* It's bad design to have equipment that is a wrench not affect Engineering* Have pets display required items before they are used* Have building extensions show what they do (harvester 20->30;tavern 50->70->100)* Have building show current stats, resources held vs max capacity* Auto-fight/deactivate combat animations* Remember starting settings* Toggle animation of essential action aka less animation, more effect			"

								The town building is great, the entire premise is great (Floating Crystal-Powered Islands?! :D :D ), customization is great, etc. This game is still in Alpha so there is stuff being added/changed all the time. It'll be really interesting to see what shape the game takes over the coming months as it goes into Beta and all the bugs are ironed out :)			"

								The game is absolutely delightful. Great turn-based combat that reminds me of classic Final Fantasy. Managing your town is pretty fun while you set out on adventures with your crew. Quests seem unique and well done. Can't wait to see what else is added in future updates.			"

								I've had a lot of fun playing this game. Yes, it is in alpha and every so often there are glitches and bugs, BUT the developers keep close contact with the players/guinea pigs via forums, so these issues are resolved very quickly. Even when there are character wipes (aka you start from scratch), there is so much more content added to the game that if almost feels like a sequel!Yes, there is a lot more work to do and the devs are working hard. However, there is plenty of ""finished"" gameplay/customization/quests/etc, to indulge in RIGHT NOW!			"

								At the time of writing, I would not recommend this game. I enjoyed the art style - thats all the positive things I have to say about it. Its not a PC game, unless you like playing smartphone games loaded with microtransactions on your pc. Controls are still a bit stiff, movement speed is slow (and moving around is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥, combat is painful. Might be worth looking at once its out of early access and theyve addressed some issues, but for now stay away, unless youre looking to give feedback on developement.			"

								I played this game between October 9th and October 19th, 2014. I encountered a bugged quest that doesn't allow me to proceed in the storyline any further. Bug reports have been submitted, and I said to myself that I would try this game again when the bugs got patched.Today is November 16th, 2014 and not a single patch has been implemented. All you get are empty promises. (October 25th: ""We'll have this patch out next week"" ""In the next couple of weeks"" November 5th: ""By the end of this week."")Don't bother with this company. The support level is zero.			"

								My original review was for the alpha version of the game I played over a year ago. Since then, the devs have made significant progress, listened to pretty much all of my negative criticism and made the necessary changes. Until I have more time to properly review the game in its current state, I'm changing my recommendation to positive because, in what little time I played the new beta, all my complaints from before seem to be resolved and it would be unfair to leave the negative recommendation up.The game has now gone into beta stage and many of the issues I originally had with the game are improved or gone. I've stricken these and added updates. Problems I originally had with the game in alpha/Progress that has been made in beta:Movement speed that would make you think the grass is not grass at all, but sticky green Jello. Movement speed seems to have been increased slightly. Running animations are still a bit clunky, which makes things feel slower than they need to. Click-to-move may also play a part and WASD movement is planned.Combat is an abomination: Do you like pressing a button, watching agonizingly slow animations for both you and the enemy, then repeating it many times over—half of them being misses? The combat system has been significantly improved since alpha. Attack animations are quicker, time between turns has been lowered and getting in and out of battle takes much less time than before. Accuracy isn't the issue it was and, in addition to basic attacks, a better variety of skills can now be used to do more damage at the expense of taking longer during your turn. These changes and the new ATB-like battle system have added some much-needed depth to combat.I originally found the game to be imbalanced, but have not had time to play enough to update this. The glacial movement and combat speed of alpha were a large source of the frustration of dying though, and those issues have been fixed. Progress in both questing and building phases seems to go much quicker now and is less tedious.The UI is giant and in-your-face, because lolmobilephones. The UI now adjusts its size based upon your resolution, so it is now less in-your-face.Single-player but always online, because of ""social elements."" You have to create an account on their website and sign into the game. Unchanged that I'm aware of. Asynchronous co-op seems to be planned.Facebook game, plain and simple.  The game still feels very Facebook-like and mobile due to the wait times, click-to-move and building upgrade system but, to be fair, it has somewhat more depth than these games typically do with none of the pay-to-win elements. I don't think there's any getting away from the casual feeling.Paced too slowly and not rewarding in general. Exploration must be fixed to redeem the game. The tutorial has been improved and exploration is more interesting due to new sub-areas to explore and better environments with additional interactive objects and rewards.No music. The game now has a soundtrack and sound effects.Town building still feels like the highlight of the game. If you enjoy casual town-building games you might want to give this a try. If you're looking for a grand adventure or something with exciting combat, you may want to look elsewhere. It does have RPG elements, but they're kind of lite (coming from someone who loves both JRPGs and western PC RPGs). The devs obviously listen to player feedback and make changes where appropriate. When it comes to early access games on Steam, this alone means a lot.  "

								(Re-review 26/06/1015)So the game has a couple display bugs but closing and reopening the page normally sorts it out - the game is in Beta so this is somewhat expected.Game has been sped up a lot which is a vast improvement! Nice going guys =)  So one can run in the game now so that's a great change; Combat is a lot faster - insomuch that you can do more damage and the animations are fast - also no longer mashing one key as the alternatives are worth it; tutorial is a lot better too.I like where this game is going so will continue playing it to see where it goes.I'm giving a tentative thumbs up as the Devs have made a lot of changes and fixed a lot of things up - there's still a way to go in terms of content and balancing.Pros:- The art is really nice.  Environments and assets are done well.- Pets =) (They could follow the player a bit more than chill out where you enter the island)- Base building is cool, and you have to (or can) upgrade buildings to get access to other craftables- COG system is nice too - makes it easy to mix and match abilities- Base building; can also put down trees which is pretty coolCons- Hugest, and is a game killer for me, issue is that one is currently stuck with being unable to do harder missions, big bug, stopping play until it's resolved- Unable to get to some clickable items/things, results in the char running funny loops - bushes, telescopes, barrles, etc- Pathing could be a bit better- Needs a bit more content but this is Beta so I presume more will be added- Icons are huuuuuuge (mainly the craftable items) and aren't really sorted properly (makybe they should be ordered or tabbed by tier)- Training your helpers' skills up is very tedious~~~~(This review was done on the 14t/12/2014)I found this game too slow, and not much direction to get started either as I just got killed repeatedly by some critters that I was directed to kill as a main quest. Yeah I didn't play very long but that was because I'd rather watch paint dry ;P... I really like the concept and really want to want to play - c'mon base building, crafting and going out for missions - what's not to like!? But yeah...With this game, I feel the only way to win is not to play it all... There are many other things I'd rather waste time doing like, errr, watching paint dry... Walking anywhere is slooooow, getting materials to build stuff is slooooow, combat is sloooow, I could go on, but I think I've enough already.I feel sorry to say things like this about a game that someone has created and put their time into, but really, the game needs to be a LOT more actionable. I could've and would've spent a great many hours into this game if it was a lot more fast paced but I'm glad I didn't as I'd be regretting a lot more than an hour...This is a game for people that have goldfish as pets where all you do is tap on the fishtank as interaction...EDIT: If the gameplay, and pretty much everyting about it was sped up by at least 50%, I'd consider giving it another go, but not until that point... And less Facebooky! (Just saw the full price, 15USD, which I was a bit surprised at considering the amount of content? Omg haha... If I paid that and didn't actually get it in a Bundle, I'd be taping my keyboard back together with duct tape.)EDIT EDIT: Will revise if necessary, as it is Alpha anol. But PLEASE please please, for the Love of Bohb and All things Holy, speed the game up!			"
