												Home is an intensely unsatisfying experience, because at the end it feels like the developer didn't actually have any idea what the plot was about himself.The gameplay mostly consists of walking around and finding vague, uninteresting clues to hint towards what's actually going on, as well as some very simple, very easily solvable puzzles. The focal point of the game comes at the end, wherein you're brought to a place where the clues of the game start adding up, forming the hints that start showing the big picture of what has happened.The problem with this is that the game's ending clues are determined by your seemingly arbitrary actions and choices. Even worse, the changes that are possible barely even change what the game's purported ending is supposed to be. To top it off, at the end, you're actually directed to an online forum where you're encouraged to share your ending and what you think it meant.This makes it feel like the game doesn't actually have any story at all. Nothing is resolved, nothing is explained, the game literally just gives you a few hints and goes ""hey you figure out the plot, because I sure as hell am not."" It doesn't feel smart or creative at all, it just feels lazy, like the dev wanted to make a game that has lots of interesting symbolism but isn't nearly creative enough to write anything interesting. If I'm just supposed to use my head and think up something myself, I see no reason to pay some pretentious dev money to do so.			"

												Welcome home, from the bottom of my heart... - Dave Dobbyn, Welcome HomeTHE GOODHome is a unique type of horror game. Focusing more on psychological horror and the fear of the unknown rather than explicit violence and disturbing visuals, Home draws you in with an mysterious if not interesting story which puts you in a house that isn't yours. The ambiguity is executed well but Home shoots itself in the foot by having Home TOO ambiguous and leaves you in the dark for no apparent reason. It also doesn't really give you any indication wheather or not walking through a specific door or interacting with a certain object will lead to you ending your time inside one of many houses, but this could be seen as a positive as it has multiple endings for multiple playthroughs.THE GREATThe atmosphere is so thick you could shoot at it and the bullet would get stuck. An eriee feeling persists for the entire game (Which previously mentioned isn't very long) and all throughout all playthroughs. Some of the events are unerving and give of a foreboding feeling as if someone, or something, is about to chase you through this pixelated nightmare. A climatic ending would've been satifying but would've also broken the flow, at least it would've for my playthrough.THE UGLYThis game is ambiguous to the point of being frustrating. Some of the options which lead to the end of the current house you are in aren't obvious which mean you have to replay the game up to that point just so that you can figure out what is happening. And about the ending, although it's not too climatic some closure would've been nice at least. Instead I was left with several murders unsolved, a bloodied knife, a recently fired gun, a bad leg and absolutely no clue of what had happened or how to figure out what had happened unless I replayed it again, and again, and again....Similar to Dear Esther, there's very little gameplay and an eriee feel to it all and some may hesitate to call this a game at all.THE VERDICTIf it were any more expensive than $3 then I wouldn't recommend it. There are other games like Lone Survivor which have a lot more to it and may seem more worth your money and time. But for my money and time, Home is an experience which is not terrible but still a way better game than Amy ever was.SIMILAR GAMES-Lone Survivor, in more ways than one-Dear Esther. What is it with indie games and an atmosphere so thick you can wrap yourself in it?For more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview "

												Starts out promising and goes downhill rather fast. Also there's no saving so you got to complete it in one sitting or you got to restart from the start and that gets tedious from the get go (game is about an hour to an hour and a half long). You basically get at the end of the game and decide what you want to believe happened which is just BS and leaves you feeling like its all a waste of time.Check it out if you already own it but with far better adventure games with an actual coherent plot on steam, don't bother picking this one up.

												The real horror would be if this weren't a parody/prank/troll game. Please tell me it isn't so!To sum it up; nothing happens. The entire game. Nothing. I could understand the notion of 'interactive sotrytelling', if it were actually a story. But stories need to have things like plot, themes, characters, conflict and resolution. This has nothing. You awake in a strange place and attempt to make your way home. Along the way you make some grisly discoveries, some of which are optional, and the game seems to be building quite an interesting little intrigue. But then in the climax and conclusion, not only is nothing revealed, but it becomes clear there is no possible conclusion to be reached.The first time through, I chocked it up as a failure; thinking this must be a kind of puzzle game, where you must take the proper course of actions to experience all that you should, and discover the truth by the end. There is even a small teaser at the end, seemingly intended to be interpreted this way. However, with subsequent playthroughs and some research online, the truth is revealed; this isn't an experiment in narrative. It's an experiment in not having a narrative.			"

												SPOILER ALERTHere is how I would best describe this game:You wander around a (mostly) abondoned landscape. The audio and visuals are both very compelling in the 8-bit realm that this game occupies. Your character doesn't remember what has happened, only that everyone is dead, and his leg hurts. You are searching for your wife, and immediately, you are led to believe that the character you control killed her in a drunken stupor. [I am very engaged]You arive at your house having been led to believe that your digital wife cheated on you, and you killed her for it. You are then asked to descibe what happened, based on what you have seen in the game. It concludes with a story of what ""must have happened"" based on your previous responses and actions.... except that the resulting storyline is contradictory and rediculous. Did you find your wifes body? No? Oh, well then she was just a figure of your imagination. Did a former coworker return to town for something? Yes? Well then clearly he was the one sleeping with your wife.Wait... was she made up, or was she real and triffling? Ugh.Best part of this game is it takes about 70 minutes start to finish and cost me $3. Save yourself the time and money.Disappointing.			"

												GET. THIS. GAME. Especially on sale.  You will buy silly little apps for your phone that you will use once and never turn on again that will cost more than this and give you NOTHING. This game must be played with headphones on, at night, when you know you won't be disturbed. It's brief, but somehow that plays right into the charm. This adventure will make you feel like you've been sitting at your desk for hours, and it's only been 30 minutes. You're never sure what's lurking behind the next door, but you know you'll never like it, and you will usually be right.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The sound is perfect. The story is devastating. No two people who play it will interpret it the same way, and that's just fine.  You can discover 50% or 100% of the paths, and it will not detract from how the game is played at all. So satisfying, so discombobulating was this game that after I finished it in one sitting, I've not opened it since.It's not bloody, and it doesn't use cheap scare tactics.  But it thrills you just the same, just like if someone tells you Slenderman is standing behind you.  You know he isn't.  You'll look anyways.			"

												Conditional recommendation. And it's pretty cheap.If you love those random story generator things, and mad libs, you'll probably like this game. If you love watching people and trying to make up wild stories about them from their clothes and mannerisms, you'll probably like this game. If you can look at a pile of action figures and dolls and make up a story about how they came to be lying on the floor in the exact poses they're in, you'll probably like this game.Otherwise, don't get it. The plot is basically non-existent unless you actively try and make it up yourself as you go along.			"

												Home is a uniquely told story where your simple decisions affect how the plot of the game unfolds...or it seems. We start with our nameless protagonist in an unknown house in the middle of the night with no memories how or why he got there. The story gets more interesting when he finds a dead body in the next room.The most engaging aspects of this game are how the story is told and the atmosphere. First, the story is never complete. As you make your way from the house to your home you can find clues about the events that have happened and piece together the murders. How much you find and how much you progress in being 'Sherlock' is completely up to the player. This ambiguity is the most sparkling and the most trembling part of the game at the same time. The conclusion of the game will vary based on what  you discovered and what choices you have made throughout the game. This undoubtedly will leave many frustrated and with a lot of questions after finishing the game. In this case a replay of the game is needed, but unfortunately it might not bring the resolutions players want to see.While the graphics and the music (there is no music) aren't the strongest parts of the game, the atmosphere is. It is highly recommended to play this game in one sitting, at night, with headphones on. The crackling  wood, loud thunders, footsteps with the visuals will pull the player in searching for answers. You will never be frightened, but you will always be wondering: ""what's in this next room?""Home is a very special meta-game, where its uniqueness derive from not what's happening on screen, but what is in the mind of the player. The story of the game might not get complete after several playthrough, because the events of the game have already happened, the murders too. It is not really important what happened, the important thing is how much you know about it and the ultimate goal is to know everything of course.Rating: 72/100; Replay Value: 4/5; To Beat: 1-1.5 hours; Played on: -			"

												It's a bit hard for me to form a certain opinion on Home, while certainly being a very interesting adventure, there's flaws that I can't seem to ignore.You wake up in someplace, and all you find is a flashlight. From here it's up to you to find out what happened. This is the first problem, I surely like games that based themselves in mystery and even those that leave some of the story open to interpretation, but Home relies HEAVILY on that certain aspect. While some people may like that, it sort of irritates me that I cannot find the true explanation of this game. There's 2 ways the story can go, it all depends on what you decide in the basement part of the game, but you have the same 3 endings if you choose one or another because in the end, they're both tragic as hell.The graphical setting of this game, while not being my favorite, it fits Home very well. What I liked about Home is that is relies a lot in describing what's happening with accurate words like when you're reading a book, and that really helps to set the seriously dark atmosphere of the game. And oh boy, what an atmosphere it is! The sounds are great overall (whose may scare if you if you're not expecting them!) and the music is almost non-existant but in the last sections it is creepy as hell, which fits the whole situation.Don't play Home if you're expecting the typical jump scares that seem to be what everyone cares about these days. Home's horror is entirely psychological, with a loud sound here and there but that's it. It's more about exploration than horror really, I wasn't playing this for the horror, but to reveal the truth in the whole plot. This is what led me to be a bit disappointed towards the end, because while being a very good story and all, it doesn't have a real ending. You're the one who makes up the ending, and I'm terrible at that to be honest. Now there is something that I think it MAY reveal which of the ""ways"" the game goes for the endings is the real one, based on the letter that is inside the safe located in the character's house. Again, it's really hard to talk about this without any spoilers so... moving on...Yes, I was going I bit off-topic with the whole non-conclusive story, Home offers a great hour and a half of mystery and lots of blood and death. It may be worth the price of 2 euro, I'd say yes if you're gonna hunt the achievements (they help you discover the ways the story may go, which I missed on my very first playthrough since there were no 'guidelines'). Although being very good, it's lacking some things, maybe a bit more story development, and not being so vague about it. Again I do say, it's one of those 'games', there's not much to it than walking around, inspecting objects and saying Yes / No to certain things, some people hate that, but I like it when a game is interesting enough, in whice Home did not fail me at all.Final Rating: 7/10			"

												Shortly after playing a wonderful little title called Lone Survivor, I stumbled upon Home.  It looked similarly charming, and both games obviously draw inspiration from Silent Hill 2.So, why is it that Lone Survivor plays out like a haunting love letter to Silent Hill while Home feels uninspired?   I think it is greatly because Lone Survivor smartly crafted its own story while taking on the mechanics and atmosphere of Silent Hill.  Home, on the other hand,  shoplifts nearly all of its parts from elsewhere but tweaks nothing in any interesting ways.  In short, Home sets itself up for failure due to a seeming lack of confidence in its own story.  What starts out intriguing, then swiftly becomes derivative and predictable.			"

												This game.It's been a while, since I played it the last time, but everytime when I get asked for recommendations for games - this just pops up in my mind. It is no masterpiece, but for what it is, it barely has any flaws.It is short, at times cryptic, at times less engaging than it should be - but it still managed to save itself a spot in my game-related memory. Why? Quite easy actually - I'm a sucker for interesting and novel ways to tell stories. Not just in games, but media in general. Home, however, is a game toying around with the very concept of narration.Is there a clear end to the story? A clear solution? Nah, not really. Is my story gonna be different from my friends story? Is he gonna play the same game, but get a different vibe, a different conclusion so to say? Yep, most definitely.In the beginning we all get the same set of jigsaw pieces, but we will transform them, cut them, add to them and put them together in the way we like to do - and there is gonna be a picture, that works for us - maybe only for us. And that's basically the whole kicker to ""Home"". The gameplay is simple, the graphics are simple (yet fitting) and the sound design is mostly basic, but convincing. It does the theme justice. And the story - for all it is - is quite simple as well, yet intriguing and novel in execution.The game does not say: ""There you go - this is it. You figured it out, bro."" And this is what I like and what others may despise. My recommendation: Try it, give it that well deserved one-hour ride and see where it takes you. You might be enjoying what your mind is developing along the way.			"

												Home is a 2D side scrolling mystery story based game. You'll walk left and right, open doors and find clues. The clues help you find out why you woke up in someone else's house and what has happened to your wife Rachel. Objects you can interact with will have an outline when you walk next to them. You will collect items, but have no inventory. The game spans a few locations and each location has several different rooms. Two houses, woods, a sewer system and a factory. There are locked doors and you'll need to find keys, hairpins and other ways to open them. After each location, the character will reference objects that you found and ponder what they could mean.The art style is very pixelated for better or worse. It doesn't feel too detailed. The only animation is the character's walk animation. Everything else is a static object. The game is very story based and you will be reading a lot. My only problem with the dialog is that it has its own screen. It takes me out of the game when it has its own screen. As game calling itself horror, it is all at night and your character is carrying a lantern. While you come across pixelated horror such as dead night watchmen and read about it, there is no threat. So its not scary. Nothing is out to get you. There is no pressure.As you search through the locations you'll tackle a few light puzzles to progress forward. You'll find dead bodies and read through text about how rancid trash is and some back story about your character. Even with no map, I don't feel like I ever got lost. Most things you find, you get a choice to take it or not. Find a bloody knife, do you take it or leave it? Normally the choice would be laughable. Of course people want to take it. Well everything you take leads up to something and what you take and the story molds itself nicely to what you have and don't have.That's really what this game excels at, an interactive story that molds itself to your choices. Do you uncover a pair of bodies? Do you take a video tape that is potential evidence? Do you read a letter that you find hanging out of a mailbox? Did you find a list of names or not?Home can be played in an hour or so. My second time through I speed ran it in about 20 minutes. There are many different endings depending on the choices you made. Even with different endings, I don't feel like the game is worth replaying. Its over too quick to give impact to any ending. The game feels like there wasn't much effort put in. Everything is text, no real animation. I'm reading emotions rather than seeing the graphics convey the emotions. Television and video games are visual mediums. I should be seeing things, not reading them. I wouldn't be so harsh on the text if it didn't have its own dedicated screen to take me out of the game.			"

												I think anyone who's ever played a video game has wished at some point to have some real impact on the story. That's why we make such big deals about morality systems and multiple endings, to feel like we actually have some agency in our pre-programmed experience. Home offers just that, the ability to shape the story through your actions, and decide the outcome.It's just so boring you won't even care.I don't want to get into too much detail about the gameplay because honestly, if you know nothing about the game and can immerse yourself in the experience, it's pretty effective the first time. The atmosphere is appropriately mysterious and oppressive, and there are a number of unsettling things to uncover. And there are a few scares to be had, but they're all just loud noise jumpscares that the game does not earn in the least. Aside from that, it's really just a low-res walking simulator. You walk right, you walk left, you go through doors and holes in fences and up stairs and down stairs, and you look at things. There's a lot of reading. A LOT.The variable elements of the story are based on what points of interest you actually examine during the game, and your responses to several Y/N choices upon finding certain things. At the very end there's a final sequence of Y/N questions that, unfortunately, kind of blows the entire premise. The first one has a right and wrong answer, and the wrong answer gets you a super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""I have no idea"" ending. The questions after that affect your own fate, but in terms of the overall story just give you a super vague rundown of how certain characters might be involved. I've played through a couple times, and if there's a way to get a more satisfying ending out of it I haven't found it.If you've got it in your backlog you might as well give it a chance, but outside of the decent atmosphere it falls pretty flat as both a game and an experience.

												The only reason to buy this game is its cheap price. However, just because it's cheap doesn't mean it's good.First things first, this game is not scary. At first Home feels eerie, but you'll soon come to realize that there is absolutely no threat in this game. Like, at all. There is absolutely nothing out there that can hurt you. The only time I ever got scared while playing Home was because one of the sound effects was way too loud. Other than that, there is nothing that should even remotely scare you in the game.Home is basically a game where you walk around, pick up stuff, and read in-game text. To mix things up, there are also a couple of puzzles that are fairly easy to solve. Home ends in various ways depending on what you do and what items you pick up throughout the game. So if you pick up weapons thinking that you might encounter some threat, you're going to get an ending that you probably don't want.And speaking of endings, they're dumb. I'm not going to reveal my ending, but mine just didn't even make sense. I literally facepalmed and shook my head after only ""playing"" the game for an hour, beating it, and then getting that ending. After this  happened, I decided to go out and read other people's endings to see if they were as bad as mine. They too, are dumb. Every ending I read either didn't make sense or was just straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or both.Just doing one simple thing can get you a dramatically different ending. This is usually a good thing for games with different endings, but the differences in Home are WAY too huge. They're night and day type differences for some choices. Usually for an ending to be so different you have to do a lot different from your previous playthrough. In Home, however, one change in the right spot completely alters the ending. Some people might play through the game a few times just to see what endings you get, but I usually don't do that. Reading suffices.Personally, I was fine with paying a few bucks for something so dumb. I'll play anything, and I would actually recommend getting this if you're bored as crap and want something dumb to play for an hour. But if you're a serious gamer that wants something good for the money, don't get it.			"

												Nice horror game.You play as some guy waking up in a place he doesn't know and tries to understand what happened in the past few hours.The pixalised graphics are ok, but would probably look better if the game wasn't totaly fullscreen.The best thing about this game is the way the story is narated by the character you control, and that what you do / choose can modify your character's thoughts and naration.Some moments are a bit annoying at first, since you want to explore everything and wonder what you missed, sometimes there's different paths and as soon as you choose one you're stuck in that direction. But in the end that's how you end up with your own version of the story, and own opinion about what happened. At the end, the game even lets you share how you interprete the story online, and can compare to what others have thought.Not really a scrary game, but an original experience for sure.			"

												Home is a weird game. It has an excellently creepy atmosphere, I'd say this game, for the first few minutes, feels more creepy than most horror games I've played. That is sadly where the upsides to the game end though.My issues with this game come from a few points. You quickly realize that you're alone in the game so there's nothing to fear. That wouldn't be an issue if the game's story was suitably scary and that's where the core of the game falls apart. The game is walk to the other end of the screen, interact with anything glowing, and then read the text. Now depending on what you interact with and how you answer questions, the story changes, but ultimately it ends with you finding your wife dead and you decide whether you killed her or someone else did. That's the biggest miss for me, if the game stuck to one storyline and worked on it a bit more then maybe it could have worked out better. It could have been the drunkard husband waking up from a hard night and needing to come to terms with his rampage, it could have been a jealous friend that tried to ruin your marriage, but instead the game decides to leave all it's plot threads hanging and even encourages you to post about what you thought the game was about. That's the sign of lazy writing, when you force people to write the ending for you.			"

												This was a fun little diversion. i think it is important to think of it as being a throwback to an era where games required a little more imagination to enjoy than they do today for the most part. That's not a put down of either old or new games, just an observation that I think applies to this one in particular.Some may feel it is laziness to leave so much to the imagination with the game's story but I found that a nice contrast to games that spoon feed you endings that often leave a lot to be desired. Of course, you may feel not being provided with a nice tidy well explained story leaves a lot to be desired but with this game it is on purpose. It is part of the design. Either you will appreciate this or not but it is what it is. I liked it myself.This game struck me as more of a mystery with horror elements. This isn't a jump scares kind of experience at all. With the right mindset though, there is a bit of tension at times as you wonder what is going on or what might happen where you are about to go next.If the above sounds interesting or appealing to you, my guess is you'll like it. Otherwise the above will have told you by now why you probably would not.			"

												I bought Home at the same time I bought Lone Survivor when they were both on sale. Lone Survivor was good, Home not so much. Once you start Home, the game informs you that it is best played in a dark room while wearing headphones and that it should only take an hour or so to beat. Suitably prepared for jump scares after the recomendation to use headphones, I dawned them and turned off the lights.You begin by waking up in a strage house with no memory of the events prior to falling asleep, so far so standard. After stumbling around the house looking at things, the game's first piece of horror comes in the form of a door slamming somewhere in the house. This did startle me and now made me feel unsafe in what I had hought was an empty house. For about the next twenty minutes the game makes me feel tense. The sudden noises and clostrophobic amount of light you have to see by do well to create a sense of atmosphere and tension.However, this didn't last. Around the thrid time hearing a noise I was on the edge of my seat; expecting something to leap out and tear my face off any second. By the eigth time I heard a noise, I realized 'any second' wasn't ever going to come. All too soon I realized that all the game had up its sleeve were noises, creating the illusion of being stalked by something that never shows up. Indeed nothing much happens at all in this game. Starting from the most generic opening, the game never solidifies. You are searching for a way out of you initial location and get home to your wife, stumbling through the wake of some monster or killer that is presumably present. Along the way you come across a bunch of seemingly unconnected murder victims and personal effects of your wife, all of it remaining a huge mystery up until the end. But instead of there actually being any form of resolution the game down right expects you to choose your twist ending; blatantly asking you which twist is the one that happens. Then you must choose how you rationalize the events with the ending you chose. This ends up creating a jumbled mess of meaningless atempts at symbolism and rendering pointless any build-up you might have felt as you are forced to choose the meaning behind every mystery in the game.Admittedly I missed one or two things. I never found out what was on the tape and I missed one or two rooms in the factory because I didn't realize the door that required a key card would lock behind me and force me to exit the level. But I don't feel like any of that would have helped. Even if the game weren't a pile of random environments and situations that might be considered spooky, anything they might have lended to the plot would all be rendered meaningless by choosing your ending anyway. All in all, both the horror and the story held no weight and left me feeling let down.			"

												The pitch of this game was admirable.  The execution gives a plotline that's a congealed mess of contradictory events, plot holes, inconsistancies and general nonsense.  The price is about right, but to quote one of the philosophers of our age ""Ain nobody got TIME fo' dat!""			"

												Now this is a fairly simple point & click story-based game. It's said to be a horror game, but steers more towards mystery. What bothered me the most was the lack of a cohesive ending to the story, it was left without a closure. But then again, reading other people's speculations and figuring out your own left the game in the back of your mind for some time.I can think of better and worse ways to spend 90 minutes.			"

												What could, and really should be an intriguning and atmospheric adventure through the tatters of a poor, confused man's life is marred by technical issues, poor execution, and a tired, cliche story that never fully resolves itself. Defaulting to controller with no options menu, the questionable decision to use down on the analog stick to advance dialog makes it painfully easy to skip important text. Given the way that the text slowly and agonising reveals mundane details about uninmportant objects, this may have been a blessing in disguise.""Atmosphere"" in this sense pretty much comes down to two things: It's dark so you have to use a flashlight, and there's a noise filter. Occaisionally music or ambient sound will help a little and it is usually to signify something that should be important and horrifying. Partially due to the presentation and your character's narration, events fail to have significant impact beyond ""oh, okay then"". I spent the whole game waiting for it to start in earnest.The story itself, and its ""big reveal"" is pretty obvious from the offset. I missed a few clues here and there due to the previously mentioned text issues, or one way doors that inform you that you have missed something and yet prevent you from returning. At the end, you are basically given the option to let things play out in the way you expect, or to have the horrible reveal simply not be there. This might have been a good element if it weren't for the fact that when choosing this option the plot simply does not resolve itself; the character is content simply to say ""there are still unanswered questions"" Maybe picking different options will give a more satsifying conclusion, but I have no desire to replay it.Home is very short, which is not something I consider to be a negative, especially when telling a short story with replayable elements. Even at its advertised playtime of 1.5 hours, Home outstayed its welcome. Puzzles that involved using things over and over until they click, mazes, and ""hunt the progression ball"" made the entire thing a dull slog to an underwhelming end.If you want a short, atmospheric horror game, play Serena, or Justine, the free story for Amnesia: the Dark Decent. If you want a 2d pixel horror, play Lone Survivor. As it stands, I cannot reccomend Home. It is a dissapointing waste of potential.			"

												Home is a difficult game to evaluate and I'm struggling to decide if I would recommend it or not. For what it's worth, it has a really pleasing visual style. I didn't come across any bugs while playing - the whole thing functioned pretty smoothly. It was atmospheric enough, sound design was okay, controls were intuitive despite minimal instruction. I really wanted to like this game and I was excited to play it.But - and this is a big but - the game was predictable and unchallenging to the point of being boring. The (potential?) twist was apparent early on, and the level of control over the outcome that was promised honestly amounted to little more than some contrived yes or no questions at the very end of the game, and a resulting pretty vague text summary. I wouldn't have minded this so much if the gameplay was interesting but it really wasn't much more than just walking from room to room. The puzzles were hardly puzzles at all, no critical thinking (or even just plain old trial and error) required. I spent the entire time feeling a little bit like I was playing a tutorial, just waiting for the game to start.Ultimately, it's an interesting idea, with great visual design, but the story needed more time to incubate and mature. I just didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't feel engaged at all; I didn't feel like the story was even really trying to engage me. Though I appreciate that this game wasn't aiming to be an amazing platformer or adventure game or anything, I still feel that better gameplay elements were needed to justify using this platform to deliver this story. I don't particularly understand why it had to be a game as opposed to perhaps a visual novel or a short story. I don't understand why the only thing I was given to do between tiny dribs and drabs of story was slowly walking through often repetitive environments. This game was purchased for me as a gift during a steam sale, and while I don't regret playing it, I'd hesitate to push anyone to spend money on it.			"

												I played Home last year and found it to be subtly creepy and maintain an intriguing story. I've replayed it and it still holds that spooky atmosphere and can see myself, coming back to it when I want a quick spooky game, in another years time. For something that is basic in the graphical department, it nevertheless is splattered with details you notice, like a creepy pair of eyes staring at you in the woods. The sound is very well done, especially that added little ""leg limping"" bit. It's easy to continue playing until you reach the ending, which can take just 1hr in a sitting.			"

												This game has a lot of things going for it which makes it good. Atmospheric, keeps you on edge and the old school graphics are really neat. I loved the idea that only a small part of the screen is lighted, to add to the already creepy mood. I'm an easily spooked person and scared of the dark, so my imagination went haywire. The problem though is that the game literally hands you a notebook and says ""Here, write something down"". You walk around, trying to piece the story together and basically depending on what you answer, your character will think that is exactly what happens. But there doesn't really seem to be any consequences or rewards to it. So technically, the game could end in many different ways, but when you've played it once, then you'll already know all the other options. Once you realize this, the game becomes a huge let down. I played it to find out the story, not just answer Yes or No to a couple of questions and then basically write a story myself. Everything is also thought out in a ""That probably happened.."" and ""I probably did that..."", which makes the answers in general seem like nothing really did happen. I guess the game is supposed to be thought provoking like the movie ""The Blair Witch Project"", and personally I don't like such stories. I want a solid story which you can follow, not just things that happen and then you have to make up your own mind as to what -really- happened in the end.			"

												When I played Home for the first time, I was intrigued by this little game where you have no memory of the hours that preceded your waking up and where you're trying to recontitue the story. In the end, depending on what you uncovered, your character recalled all your path. Between several bodies, an apparent serial killer lurking around and strolls through sewers, cave, forest or the plant where you worked, Home was made to experience several stories in an atmosphere of horror.Indeed, the goal isn't really to scare the player (though some sounds are unexpected) but to let him imagine the worst and to wait for something or someone appearing suddenly. It's kinda psychological: will you look under rags and decide if it's your wife or not? Do you want to see the reality or not?Home is mainly going from a room to another to collect things (or not if you don't want to include some parts in the story). You can also jump down or find another way around: in that case, you will advance at the same speed than with a leg that hurts. There are some occasional puzzles: find a switch to open a door, turn valves or restablish some power for example.The game is made to look like a retro one, which is something that I like because it's giving also a particular ambiance and less scary than 3D stuff. The soundtrack is composed of only ambient sounds: winds, cave echoes, doors, etc... It is sufficient.Why did I play it again so as I've played it in 2014? When I was looking at my library, I kinda thought that I didn't play it. I saw achievements not unlocked with 79 minutes of playing and looked at the news. They were added the 6th november 2015. Well, it's a nice discovering, prompting me to reinstall the game and to play it again.... with the controller too. The commands are smooth with it....In the end, Home gained a new interest with achievements, even if I reviewed it earlier, it would have still been a thumb up. If you like games like that (not many scares, ambiance leading you to ask if your character is sane, retro graphics), go for it. It's really a little gem.			"

												This game was ... interesting. The premise of this game is that you decide, via your actions, the plot of the story. However, the main issue with idea is that nothing get's resolved. Regardless of your choices, you will still be left with a story with multiple interpretations, where none of them giving a solid answer to the main question of what actually happened.  So, while it is an interesting concept, the whole affair just leaves you there scratching your head about what you were doing for the past hour as it dumps a large amount of exposition that relates to your actions during the game.With a solid atmosphere, sound design and art style that had me on edge at times I can only give this a tentative recommendation. If you happen to have a spare hour and want to see what you can make of this game, then give it a go. Otherwise, you can safely pass on this game and miss nothing.			"

												A very nice pixelated little mystery game, which have some replay value and easily worth full price, because of his quality and even his length. It tooks me 1.8hs on a first run, and i'll certainly replay it very soon to explore some possibilities.The story is good enough, giving you doubts from start to end. Although i easily guess what's going on from the very beginning, i finished this first run with some minor doubts and things not very well explored.Closer to the end, you're asked about what things you believe that happens, and these options may influence the ending. So, i have not confirmed my version of the story, probably because of these not explored things. But in the absence of at least one more run i can't say if it's one of more endings or just an open ending, i'll see it soon, but i think it worth the mystery and it's better to not talk about.Gameplay is very simple, and the atmosphere is just average to me. No scares or something like that, just a mystery mood.			"

												Home is a game in which you wake up in a house without any memory of how you got there. Through exploration, you unveil a myriad of clues and grisly scenes that raise an alarming number of questions. This is the game's theme -- nothing is explained. It really doesn't matter what you do or what choices you make, because in the end, the game simply asks you to choose the ending. Absolutely nothing is expanded upon, and all the clues you found previously have no significance. They reveal nothing. You're expected to use what you've seen to decide what ending you feel is most appropriate, but even when you choose, there's no real closure. The game starts intriguing and ends in a puff of smoke.			"

Confusing narrative? Limited scope?Home is one of the best indie horror games I have yet played. I like pixel graphics, but I was sceptical if a pixelated game could create a dense and frightening atmosphere needed for a horror game.It did. The game is short. It is kind of the whole deal. You are trying to get home and figure out what happened in the last couple of hours. The tension while you slowly uncover the last night piece by piece is amazing. The story plays out differently each time and it is cool to see what tiny little decision you made had an impact on the entire story.			"

Yes all at once, no breaks , It's like an hour long (Took me 66 minutes to complete , Explored everywhere and found everything) so it shouldn't really take you long to finish.So this end's the review of Home.I give it a 9/10.Really recommended for Adventure and Mystery game lovers.

												Home is an interesting little adventure game - its pixelated approach reminds us of the old days of point-and-click games. Many may just find it very ugly, still, it serves its purpose and it is nice to see that with such simplistic graphics comes a great atmospheric game that belongs to the horror genre.It is not a long adventure - the game tells its tale in an hour or so. This is a tale of an unnamed protagonist who finds himself alone in a house with just a flashlight beside him. Without the recollection of how he got there, of course. Then his journey begins and continues in the sewers, a dark forest and a few abandoned places only for him to be able to find his way - you guessed it - home.The game is really about immersion - we only interact with highlighted objects and make decisions as to whether or not a certain item should be picked up and / or used. I especially liked how most of the highlighted objects can be looked at twice (resulting in more than one monologue). I did not notice this during my first walkthrough then I was eager to hear what our hero has to say. He might just mention something for the 2nd time that brings us closer to the big picture.And what this big picture is? Naturally, I avoid spoilers here but I have to admit the ending is a bit vague - perhaps that is the intention of the developer. To provoke people into sharing their ideas and discussions on the story. And this is also the reason why this game is a great purchase.			"

												""Home"" is a short game about a guy trying to piece his memory together, amidst a horror backdrop.Home is meant to be completed in one sitting, and lasts around 1 hour. The game is pixelly and low res, a style it maintains throughout.The game is very heavy on it's story element, which is actually the only element. It's essentially a dynamic novel. I enjoyed my playthrough of the game, for what it was. My only criticism is that the game does not highlight strongly enough when you are about to pass through an unreturnable gate. When you move from one stage to another, you cannot return, even if you missed vital ""items"" or story elements. This fault led to me accidentally missing all the story from the first section as I unintentionally stumbled over the 2nd section gate. But oh well! Worth a look.Nilesy			"

The great thing about this game is that it keeps you wondering the whole time so you don't want to stop till you have reached the end.

												If disappointed was made with C++, there it is.Graphics are cool, like it or not, it's a choice, and I was glad enough to find a horror game in Pixel Graphics. Sound is gorgeous, I have no regrets in saying the audio is what they put most efforts into. Atmosphere is 10/10, playing it in the dead of night with headphones is a delightful experience.But. You have a heckload of choices, making you think the game as replay-value, and each one subtly influencing the progress and the ending of the game. But this is not a game with multiple endings, it's more like a game with multiple point of views, because there is no ending. By no ending, I mean no 'ended' ending. A strict ending. Everything in this game is speculation. I respect the will of the devs to make a game's ending blurry, but making ALL the choices and the paths and the endings of a game blurry, when this game is based on scenario, it's just wrong.""If you don't like it, you obviously don't know what's good"" said some reviews. Well, I too can put seven thousands hints in a game, change some sentences so you think it impacts your experience and then give you the most shrugged ending of video game existence. I only finished Home once, but after seeing the reviews and the official site, I realized you need to only play Home once to know all the endings. ""This game will haunt you for a long time because you'll going to make theories about its end for a long time !""Guess what ? It's because there's none.I give to this waste of time -1/10.			"

												If you want a short game (1.5 hours) with uneasy atmosphere and minimal graphics, this is a good candidate.  If you are expecting anything else, this will probably not deliver.  Although I applaud the game for being what it is, it lacked quite a few things to make it recommendable.In brief, the game was not engaging enough.  The horror atmosphere was the main drive for the game, but by the end, after seeing similar generic sets especially near the end, the effect had worn off.  The ""puzzles"" can barely be considered puzzles, no cognitive thought required.  And the story, I could not get myself to care about the main character or his lover or anyone else to care how they had died or if they were still alive.  There really is no satisfying ending to answer all the questions I had by the end (what was the shadowy figure in the forrest?), which is what I believe the devs intended to let our own imagination be the horror, but it just feels ineffective and lazy, especially if the ending is decided by a few promts at the very end, many of which I found myself not caring how I replied to.I don't regret my time spent in this game especially for the price I paid (mere pennies during a sale), but I won't try pushing others to spend money and time into this game.  If I were to recommend a game of similar style, I would suggest The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.  Same investigative theme shrouded in mystery, but it is georgous to look at walking between clues, it contains engaging story, and most importantly, a satisfying ending.			"

												While I don't necessarily want to talk too badly about 'Home', I don't know what good I can say about a game that at the ending screen, the most emotion I could dig up for it was to shrug my shoulders and say ""Eh.""  I thought briefly about playing again to pick up the handful of secrets I missed and to see what would have happened if I made the other choice at the end...but it was a thought I quickly dismissed.  The gameplay itself wasn't engaging enough for me to spend doing the same thing over again in the hopes that something different would happen.			"

												Horror is an interesting genre, both in the myriad of different ways it can be presented, and the inherent bizarre nature of existing to voluntarily scare us. But like any established genre, there are certain tropes and cliches that, while not necessarily problematic by nature have a tendency to stand out as lazy, boring substitutes for more creative writing like someone grabbing various pieces of other works to form their own blob of uninspired concoction.The reason this is at all relevant is for the fact Home, something of a horror/choose-your-own-adventure mashup, seems to exist almost as an example of how an over reliance on tired tropes can create something that's both immensely dull and almost laughable. With every line of dialogue it cements itself within an impenetrable block of ambiguous, derivative nonsense, substituting in player choice for a lack of any definitive answers and in the process creating an abundance of narrative dissonance.It's entirely possible I chose the ""wrong"" path, made inaccurate assumptions about what may or may not have happened by which to base my outcome on, but if so that doesn't dispel the issue of how easily it is to make said mistakes and thus wind up with a story that's so convoluted and full of holes that any answers you may be hopping to obtain might legitimately not exist. Perhaps it's a bit telling that the most interesting element of Home are the stories and explanations people have come up with to try and make sense out of the experience, though as far as I've read never quite being able to explain away all the gaps in a way that is at all believable.As far as I can tell those answers are by design nowhere to be found. Whether this is the result of over ambitious, disorganized, or just lazy writing (or some combination there of) I couldn't say, but the end result is little more than a mess that I'd be happy to never have to wade through again.

												This is not a game of visceral horror and jump scares.  It is not a game with a concrete path and definitive ending.  HOME is a game of elegantly simple design that creates a sense creeping, uncertain horror that haunts you after it's over because you are acutely aware of not having all of the answers.  It tells a story, but not by itself.  You, as the player, very directly decide not only what happens in the present, but also what happened in the past.  You choose the paths to trase, items to take, and clues to follow, all the way up until the end where you piece everything together as best you can to tell your own version of this dark tale.			"

												I thought this was a pretty good game.  The estimate of 1.5 hours to play through in one sitting is about right, so it's not very long.  Also, it's rather linear and there's not a lot of stuff to do; you walk around finding objects to solve fairly simple puzzles while reading bits of text about the story.  And I think that's the real draw here, the story -- your actions will influence the story and its outcome.  The ending seemed relatively open-ended to me, leaving room for different interpretations of what just happened and why.  I've only played the game once so far, but I think there is some replay value in making different choices to get different endings and see aspects of the story.  If you want action, this isn't your game.  But if you like stories, especially ones that give you the freedom to interpret them the way you like, I think you'll enjoy this.			"

												What an underappreciated little gem of a game! This is a dark, atmospheric horror story that makes you wonder what is happening as you go through it. The playtime is short, but seems adequate to the overall scope of the game. Home tries to tell you a story while making you involved in it, rather than being just a passive recipient. A part of the story is being left to your own judgment and imagination and I like it just the way it is. Definitely a must play for fans of mystery/horror games and literature. A pleasant way to spend an evening.Similar games: Dear Ester, Gone home, Vanishing of Ethan Carter, The Last Door, and The Charnel House Trilogy.			"

												This game is creepy, not the ""jump-in-your-face-and-go-bloogie-woogie-woo"" creepy, it's the kind of creepy that you get with the minimalistic graphic design and atmospheric ambience that makes you think something is going to happen, but nothing does. Home is a fairly short game that you can complete in one playthrough and probably never touch ever again, but the one time you do play it the experience sticks with you. The story is whatever you want it to be, so in a way it could be as creepy as your imagination can make it.I give Home a 8/10 for terrible replay value, but superb storytelling and sound design.			"

												I just can't recommend this. I like the aesthetics and the eerie feel of it all, but the game is just not good. Whenever you find an object or get to a door or something, the character asks you ""did I grab it?"", ""did I open the door?"", and you get the feeling that your decisions will be relevant during the game. At some point you can decide if you grab a gun or not, and at some other point, you can get or not get a knife. I thought ""nice; maybe if I grab the gun I'll be charged with a crime, but if I don't I could be assaulted"", and once I had the gun I couldn't care less about the knife so I just didn't grab it. Now guess what: none of my choices were relevant during the game. I suppose the kind of ending you get depend on your grabbing or not grabbing certain things, doing or not doing certain things... but by the time you finish the game you just don't want to go through it again. But here's the most ridiculous thing: you spend the whole game  going home to see what happened to your significant other, and when you interact with what seems to be her dead body, the main character asks: ""was it Rachel?"". I DON'T WANT TO DECIDE THIS! Why would I want to decide this? It's one thing to decide if I want to carry an object or open a door, but why in the depths of hell would I want to decide if the girl I live with is dead in the basement???  At that point (luckily almost the end of the ""game"") I gave up all hopes  of using the gun. Plus: it's not a horror game.			"

I even covered myself with a blanket to make it even more spooky. What caught my attention was the story. I think it was well written and kept the player involved. I explored most fo the areas, but I feel there are other endings to the story possibally because, 1. I had skipped over a few places where you could choose a path 2. I found a few items that never came to value throught the game such as a hammer ( I don't remember using it ). Otherwise, I recommend  this to most people who enjoy good storylines in video games.

												Hmmm...genuinely intriguing. I've had a few arguments with friends in recent years about just how ""deep"" one can make a video game story, and I generally take the side that while games have their strengths, they never seem to match the story-telling of the best films or books, etc, and almost always succumb to repetitive mechanics one would never tolerate in a more conventional story-telling medium...but this one actually DOES have a compelling story, and for once we have a game where the ""alternate endings"" shtick looks like it may actually prove necessary and truly rewarding, rather than merely gimmicky. Only repeat plays will prove this theory correct, but rest assured, I will be coming back...In short: ♥♥♥♥♥♥, minimalist graphics...check. Short singular playthrough length under 3 hours...check. But worth the mere $2.99 asking price currently on Steam...hell yes, check! Fascinating, and dark as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. A true ""detective"" story. Definitely recommended.Verdict: 8.5/10.			"

												Home is an interesting game because the ending is ambiguous. While it may appear that the player character is somehow the killer, he finds various clues on his path home that could indicate otherwise, including video tapes, weapons, blood, his belongings, odd rooms, dead bodies that scatter the forest and town.The player character is mysterious as well as he can't recall waking up in a strange man's home, whom he finds dead. Home is a game about choice, you ultimately decide the ending and that's why it's so ambiguous. It doesn't exactly clarify everything, specifically who the dead man is that you find once you start the game. But other details are cleared up, about Rachel and Norman, and other stuff.While all that is interesting, the game is rather basic. UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT and SPACE are your controls when walking around and looking at clues. The graphics are supposed to resemble retro games from the late 70's early 80's, but the pixels are so big that they're not retro, but are rather odd. The sound is nice and eerie though.Pretty decent game.7.5/10			"

Interesting path system that changes depending on the viewpoint you shape for your character. Simplistic writing conveys everything you need to know quickly and easily; I appreciate how straight-forward it is.CONS: A bit short, and the story is ultimately pretty boring. Once you look back at the game's story in hindsight, it's very underwhelming! For a fair amount of it you are constantly waiting and wondering for the big reveal, but all it is is tension. The moment you start to get confidence that this is just an art game and that nothing is going to to happen to you, the atmosphere completely dissipates.WORTH: This is a psychological horror walking sim for a fair price, but whether or not its worth your time is questionable.OVERALL: I personally found it needlessly tragic, a bit nonsensical and ultimately, anticlimactic.

												A decent short game with an interesting plot that propels you into searching for clues as to how you wound up where you did and why. This being advertised as a horror game is somewhat misleading... depending on how you define such a game. I was expecting to be afraid, or at the very least to feel on edge. Being the scardey cat that I am, I surprisingly never felt uncomfortable. It was somewhat of a letdown in that respect.What I did like about the game is that while finding clues, your character will sometimes propose questions that basically ask you how he should interpret them. You can make him start to feel guilty, as if he's done something wrong, or you can project that onto other characters. This seemed to play a big role in how your character inevitably decides how to handle what he's discovered, and inevitably deciding how the story will end.Like for many other reviewers, that still didn't feel like enough. You never find out the truth of what happened, only your interpretation based on what you observed. I admit, in retrospect it's clever and almost enough. But I wanted to KNOW what happened; so I was left feeling unsatisfied.I wish I didn't have to give a yes or no recommendation as I could see how some people would enjoy it for the very reasons others don't—and vise versa. I give it an apathetic 'eh'.			"

BUY IT!  I just finished! The game is wonderful, very in-depth and interesting. When you play, paying attention is a must, the story is well detailed and thought out. Graphics-10. With the shading, color coordination, and item details, the game's graphics are great. I will admidt, Home probably wouldn't be so interesting if it were anything else other than a pixelated platformer.Story-10. It's not worth playing if you don't do it in one playthrough. Some parts of the story are a bit confusing, but harder to understand when there are interruptions.Even though the game is quite short and simple it is well surpassing it's retail price of $2.99.  One great thing about the game is that, at some points in the story (depending on some of your own choices) the evironment will change a bit as you progress, and the main character will begin to see things differently from a mental view as you learn more and make decisions.

												[Spoilers in the review.]I played Home several times over to get the feel of different endings and each one I felt the same emotion - cheated.Going into Home, I really liked it. The ambience hit and the story-telling was both unique and interesting. I wanted to know what happened just as much as I wanted to play the game. Off to a great start!But as the game progressed, the scares weren't there anymore. It went from horror to a dark-style story-telling game. There's nothing wrong with that but if you're going to market a game as ""a unique horror adventure game"", it needs to be scary all the way through. It wasn't. It was eerie at best and even that might be an overstatement. Luckily the story was still interesting.Up until the climax anyway.After a long journey back home which is plagued with dead bodies, item collecting, and more mysterious than the game seems capable of solving, the narrator gets home, goes into the basement, and finds a sheet lying on the floor. Then the player gets to decide if his wife's body is underneath said blanket. If you pick the ""yes"" option, you get to decide if the narrator killed his wife or if someone else did it. It's pretty straight forward but disappointing. But if you pick the ""no"" option, suddenly his wife never existed (even though there's a note from her in the office still), he was sleepwalking the whole time, and the fact that she didn't exist is suddenly the player's fault. Yep, the player gets blamed for taking his precious wife away. Either way, after the anti-climactic reveal, you get the go through the house again and look at all the items you picked up along the way. As you examine the items again, you get to decide more plot points which are either not important or just plain silly. Then the narrator leaves the house, goes through a monologue, and that's it. Game over.Not only does Home fall short on the promise of horror, the story-telling is annoying and the plot, no matter what ending you choose, is flimsy and ill thought out. Home had so much potential at the beginning but it really just fell on its face. If you're going to promise something in the subtitle, make sure it delivers. Otherwise you're going to end up with something like this.			"

												Home is choice-driven, ambiguous, narrative-delivery experience that isn't really a game, but more a choose-your-own adventure that you're allowed to walk around in. I'd recommend it only for those who are interested in playing through what is essentially a short story where they are allowed to choose how the narrative develops. There is a generally spooky atmosphere, and the graphics are minimalist in their presentation. The story itself plays out slowly and the player is left to figure out, through interpretation and choice, how the events presented unfold.Ultimately it sets out to do what it tries to, and doesn't purport itself as much more, which is good because there really isn't a lot to it. There aren't any challenges to speak of, and the game is only enjoyable for one or two playthroughs, which are also very short. I recommend it only for those who want to experience a short story with a slight horror vibe.			"

												I recommend this game to people that enjoy text-based adventure games. The atmosphere is well-established as eerie and i recommend anyone who plays it to play it late at night for maximum effect. I would of liked a slighty more dramatic ending or twist because it was quite anti-climactic. All-in-all though for the price it's good to have a little throwback to old-school gaming.6.5/10			"

												Very boring game where nothing actually happens.  You get to pick your ending through yes/no questions and then it summarizes your story at the end.  halfway through the game I was asking myself ""how much longer?""  I couldn't wait for the game to be over.  there are no consequences or rewards for anything you do.  nothing you do even matters.  do not buy this game. do not play this game. if someone gifts you this game, reject it.

												Despite this game being quite short, I found myself wishing for it to be over sooner.The ""puzzles"" one has to solve are all the same: They aren't hard, they just take a lot of time where you walk back and forth between rooms.The story and sound design are pretty good, but not enough to keep me playing.

												A very intriguing game. Everyone should play it, at least once. Even though the story changes as you make decisions, so each play through will be different. The content is geared toward adults, but it never seems gratuitous--always appropriate. The shear experience of investigating this murder mystery is gripping. Text is very well written, and I only noticed one typo in the whole game. A must-play.			"

												Okay, there are a ton of mixed opinions about this game. And this game is not really horror. Sure it's scary at first, but the only thing to really be scared of is sudden loud noises. The game more focuses on the story. And while at some points I was too scared to go through that door. And since you torch only shows a small amount of room, I get really scared because at points like these I was worried if some monster was out to kill me. I do have another problem though, The story is quite short, and while it is well created, it really should have been longer. Overall it is something to try out. And like Year Walk, you may consider getting it on a smartphone. I personally liked it. It is a good game do play on your computer (like I did) or on you android device. But do as the rules tell you, turn lights of (in the evening or night) and wear headphones.5/10 Give It A Try!			"

												""Home"" is pitched as a short horror game, so I went into the game thinking it would be somewhat horrifying. It didn't last long until I realized that it wasn't horrifying at all. Sure, the controller vibrated at times and you could hear some sounds, but at large... nope.Short it was, took me almost an hour to complete. That was in one sitting as there is no way of saving, which is a con for sure. The story is carried forward by dialogue prompts which pop up whenever an object is being looked upon or if the character hears a sound or something along those lines. Those prompts are the only thing that keeps it interesting... for a short while. It becomes somewhat meaningless in the end when the game lets you decide whetever something happened or not. ""Did I do this? Yes? No?"", ""Do I find this in here? Yes? No?"". It felt like no matter if I chose ""Yes"" or ""No"", the outcome would be the same.Well... pros... cons.+ Short.+ The graphics are somewhat good looking.+ The sound is decent enough.+ The story is interesting...- ...for a short while. Feels meaningless in the end.- No way to save. Have to play the whole game in one sitting.I can't recommend this. Although, it usually is cheap so if you want to give it a go, feel free to do so. No bigger loss when it comes to money or time.			"

												(Warning: I discuss spoilers. Play the game first if you're interested,  it takes 90 minutes.)My approach to this game was wrong.I had a restless night to kill, I had only my Macbook, and needed something graphics-lite I could play with my keyboard. Home seemed like the perfect fit.It seemed set up as an adventure game with an easy interface. Great! I found myself quickly analyzing clues, trying to piece together what was happening. That being said, the game doesn't challenge you to *actually* understand much of anything - and so my character's frequent questions about what he was looking at just fed the sense of mystery.I was expecting answers. That's not a good start.The atmosphere is generally unsettling because the game teaches you very early on that the game's volume is on 5 and the game's audio jump scares are on THIRTY MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING TWO. I turned down the whole thing and ruined the atmosphere just to save myself a heart attack. But it's a cheap parlor trick - nothing ever comes out of the shadows, it's just noises.There are many choices you can make. Do I pick up the bloody knife or leave it? Well, I seemed to be an amnesiac in an unknown environment with dead bodies everywhere, so yeah, I'll take the knife. I'd hate for something else to take the knife and kill me with it. My character then muses, ""Did I really need this knife?"" ..... Well now wait a minute, I thought I was being practical. Am I just being paranoid? Does the game think I'm a violent person now?I picked up the knife, I picked up the gun, I picked up most objects that seemed useful. And some objects I decided seemed pointless wound up being typical adventure key items. Why am I given the choice to pick it up or not if I need it to progress? Seems strange. What do my choices even mean?So I get to the end, ready for the story to come together. The game asks me if I find my wife. For some intuitive reason, I just don't get the feeling I do. So I answer no. I'm comfortable with that choice. But then the game asks me another 15 questions about the items I've collected and everything else that is going on. Well I mean, I'm not sure, I've only been playing for an hour. Is there a right or wrong answer? If I'm not sure, do I really have to pick yes or no?I didn't have any solid understanding of what was happening throughout what I was experiencing, and I'm sure most people would agree with that - it's designed that way. So why then is the game quizzing you on this understanding at the end of the game? I never answered yes or no - I only answered, ""Um...yes?"" or ""Grrr, pff, I dunno, no?"" It would take a clearer narrative to expect any clearer reaction, wouldn't it?I mean, what arrogant self-assured idiot would go through an obtuse series of unrelated mysteries and think, ""Dude, I know EXACTLY what's going on here""? There literally is no right answer, so attempting to decide what your choices meant within a meaningless context is itself an utterly meaningless action.And of course, the few paragraphs of text that serves as the game's recapitulation and conclusion was the confirmation that I didn't know what I was talking about, because my choices as a whole didn't make any cohesive narrative sense, even for the ♥♥♥♥ing narrator. I remain just as confused now as I did while I was playing. Actually, more so.I suppose that's the risk of an open-ended story, but it would have been nice to see the developer take the time to script his endings a bit more to ensure that most or all players would reach a conclusion that makes sense. I understand that western storytelling relies too heavily on clear denouements, but when it's the player dictating the storytelling, the ending feels more arbitrary than artistic.So just to be clear, my recommendation is based on the fact that it's a cheap, interesting, and unique experience that you might not enjoy, but that's okay. It wasn't my cup of tea, but I'm glad I played it.			"

												Overall, Don't buy it unless you review bad or lazy games.At first this game seemed scary and interesting, but after a while, I realised the game was all pixels and the choices meant nothing because: Spoilers/twist: The game in short tells you to make up what you think the ending is and then sends you to its website to post that you think the ending is.When is the last time you saw a movie that had many different clues but Sherlock turns to the camera and says ""What do you think happened?"" And then it goes to credits.			"

												Got $2? Buy this while it's on sale. Much like a chose-your-own-adventure, part of what makes Home great, and frustrating, and enjoyable, is that there's a kind of finality to your decisions. Go through the wrong door and you might get trapped, leaving questions unanswered later on. After realising this on my first playthrough I began to make decisions based on how I wanted the story to play out. The protagonist is immediately endearing, which causes mixed emotions as the story comes to life. Definitely worth taking the devs advice and playing with headphones in the dark for a richer experience, and aim to playthrough in one hit.			"

												The beginning and atmosphere is good but the end of the game is so horrible that you don't get any satisfaction. There are choices in the game, but you cannot be able to move forward in the game if you don't accept it. For example, there is a key on the floor and the game asks if you want to take it. If you don't get the key, you can't open some room which contains small pieces of the story. So basically your choices does not matter at all. In the end, the game lets you choose your own ending which is absolutely garbage. It fells like the writer of the game tried so hard to make a twist in the story, it blows up all the story and the mystery of the game. When you finish the game you feel the same way as when you watched the last episode of Lost.			"

												If there is one thing that Home knows how to create, its mystery. With its simple presentation and gameplay, that is really all it has going for it. The game gives itself the horror tag, including a suggestion to wear headphones and turn off the lights like many recent games have done. However, the game isn't intensly scary at all. If there is one lesson to be learned from Slender, it is that sound design can make for very terrifying and suspenseful situations. Home didn't apply this lesson (though it could have been due to fiscal restraints. They credit freesounds.com as where they got some of their samples). THe atmospheric noise isn't all that tense, and only twice does a loud noise occur that gives me a small jump. More like a bounce actually. Sounds also abruptly stop like when the door animation finishes, or if you suddenly stop your character moving. Its sorta nitpicky, but it took me out of the game. As well as the audio, the aesthetics are just nothing to write home about. It has very plain looking pixel art, and nothing truly looks grimy or dusy or anything that the character narrates. One doesn't need immense graphical fidelity to make an image foreboding or creepy, but rare spatters of pixel blood just don't do the job.The actual gameplay is simple point and click adventure fare. You interact with objects, and the player character has text describing what it is, or if it can be used to proceed through the game. There aren't any puzzles, just you traversing through these semi-familiar locations.Whether or not you choose to do certain things in the game (e.g. pick up a gun, go to certain places that may contain extra information) will lead to a different ending. Home plays with the idea of player choice, and makes the mystery turn out however you feel it is going while you make decisions. I can't elaborate too much for fear of spoiling anything, so I have to leave this part thin. There are multiple endings from reading the forums for the game, but I am content with taking the one I ended with. In the end, the game is very underwhelming. This is clearly an early attempt by a new designer, so it is flawed. I think I just wanted this to be something more. As a horror game, it fails. As a story, it is just interesting enough to recommend, but nothing so thought provoking as a new insight on narrative through play, or even as a mind bending thriller.			"

												I really want to start with what I feel about Home, does well. It’s a game about exploring a small town after some sort of event has left it empty, a ghost town if you will. Part of the charm is learning what happened here. The music and sound effects do a nice job of accopaining the mystique of it all.It also has a nice neat art style. It’s not like it’s the most amazing thing you’ve ever seen but it's not different enough to be something memorable (To most people the worse thing you can accuse art style  of being is bad, but to it's worse to be forgettale).  Then there is what I don’t like about it. First off, it breaks the cardinal rule of gaming, it’s not really fun to play. In fact there isn’t much to do except wander around scene to scene (read; rooms/areas) getting snib bits of information on what the hell is going on. That’s it. That's the whole game. I had the same issue with “We’ve all Gone to the Rapture.” It’s a 2D walking simulator with virtually no puzzles at all. And by the time you get to the end, (I’m not sure many of you will bother to play it that long), you’re sort of done with it. Keeping in mind this game is only 2.99 and goes on sale sometimes. For what it is, it’s really not bad. Which as my father would say, ""Not exactly a compliment."" I give it a luke warm 5 out of 10 for trying to do something cool but missing the wow factor that would’ve made it a must play that I would feel better recomending to people. This being said though, if you like peaceful creepy games, Home will be fun for you.  "

												TL:DR Has a promising start setting up a potentially intersting story and atmosphere but never delivers on that potentialHome starts off really well. Your character wakes up in a room with a dead body and no idea of what happened or how he got there. The atmosphere feels really tense at the begin with you only able to see within the circle of light from your flashlight as you explore the otherwise almost completely dark surroundings. However as you play you'll find there isnt anything that will attack you or present any danger to your character and this sort of kills the tension a bit. You spend the game just going through doors and reading the snippets of text when you interact with glowing objects. There are some light puzzles but nothing that will challenge you in the slightest. You are expected to piece together what has happened from the bits of text you read when you interact with objects however the end of the game (without spoiling things too much) makes this redundant by asking you to make your own conclusion. This would be fine if the stuff you learn throughout the game added up to a intriguing story but it doesn't. Instead its all vague and a bit cliched and it feels more like laziness on the part of the devs to come up without a good story with a great conclusion.Good points:- the beginning is quite good even if the rest of the game doesnt fall through.Bad points:-boring gameplay its just mostly running from one area to the next  while clicking on objects as you go-very unsatisfying and almost lazy conclusion			"

												Although I didn't mind, it seems from the mixed reviews that it may be useful to know what you're getting into with Home. You, the player, play an integral part in how the story unfolds and unltimately ends. These choices are yours and if you'd rather not make them, which is fair enough, then Home is not the game for you.If you quite fancy a choose-your-own-adventure (and ending) with a darker theme, then Home may be the game for you. In terms of horror, it's more horror story, or psychological, than actual scares. It takes about an hour and a half to complete, but has replay value given the choices (though I do wonder if your progress may be barred by choosing not to do things, which would lead to a frustrating experience - might be something to test out on a replay).If it sounds like it might appeal, then I'd recommend giving it a go.

Nothing scary happens either.At first the feeling is unsettling, the ambience and tone of the first room is pretty good, but it just keeps that tone for the whole game, No good moments, no bad moments either, just, oooh, better look out, somethings coming for you. But it's not, and you realise that by the second area.Just a boring experience that challenges you too come up with what you think happened.

												This was a game I've been meaning to play for a while now. But it turns out that the plot wasn't really even that ""bumpy"", if that makes any sense.. If the game's gonna leave us hanging, whoever wrote the game should've at least taken more time to spice it up a bit. I mean like it's a typical early 2000s/80s movie, guy wakes up in a coma, finds clues to who he really is, and blah blah twist ending blah blah and a lot of games actually do follow the theme of this, although this game really did not do a very good job. And this seems like a game you can play on a website for free, if anything putting it on steam is basically just donating to the author just hoping he'd make it better.But honestly, this game is alright. But if you're looking for a spiced up, adrenalline rushing, and an actual good game - this game is not for you.			"

												It's sad to see this game sitting at a ""Mixed"" rating. It's not perfect but all the subtleties of how the game reacts to the player's choices make it actually a pretty impressive as well as immersive experience. The little world bubble seems to be living in it's dead state and the main character's mind is visibly evolving throughout the game. I don't mind a few quirks and mistakes along the way.It was fun. It should be shorter, though. I'm pretty sure the whole factory section could be omitted and told only as a text-based lore in some places.			"

												I was really intrigued from the get-go, drawn into the mystery of what the hell is going on--immediately, unfortunately, a lingering suspicion on the story's outcome came, and clue after clue seemed to point to the same conclusion, which at about the two-thirds point caused the game to become a bit tiresome. And then the ending happened, and I was told to choose how it ended, what all the clues meant....It's not a prospect I found attractive in execution, and ruined much of the story for me. (N.B. Most clues pointed to the ending I figured, and one you'll likely see, as well, but there are some contradictory suggestions that point elsewhere...but they all feel like red herrings (unless I was following the red herrings all along!!!! (then again I choose the ending so whatever)).)In regards to gameplay, it does as promised. Play in the dark, put on those headphones, turn the volume up: Best way to enjoy this game. It's not scary, outright, but when things go ~thump~ they really get you. Sound and score are used exceptionally.It's worth the buck I paid and the hour I spent, but the game has its failings, and those failings lie in its storytelling: Ambitious, but unmet, I feel.			"

												This is essentially a choose your own adventure walking simulator and not really a game. It's also not scary at all after you realize nothing really happens throughout the game. Once I figured out the ending is going to be determined by a series of simple yes/no questions it was hard to maintain interest. I couldn't be bothered to play through it more than once to experience a different ending since it's an overly linear game regardless of your choices. Neat idea but needs more substance.			"

												Ever been to the movies, to watch something you normally wouldn't watch, and at the end said ""Hold up, I need to gather my thoughts.""?Home is an open ended game that, in all aspects, works like a movie. Gameplay seems to be just a linear exploration and interacting with stuff that gets highlighted. You are then prompted for your thoughts on some interactions. You say whatever you want/think about it from the given options.You basically are fed ambiguous information that your mind tries to decrypt. You always have the same basic path to reach the same end-point. And you always have to make one fundamental choice.Without giving any spoiler, since this game is all about the experience, the ending ruins everything. Not because there is an ending, but because basically you answer some relevant questions and are given an akward explanation that goes with whatever you answered. This is crucially flawed, in my opinion, since ""every run will be different"", but not by much: there's one critical event at the very end that is foreshadowed throught the irreversible middle-sections that the narrator uses to conveniently sum up the important things you perceived, and the rest is pretty much meaningless. The ambience is pretty much all this game has going in its favour.Should you pick up the knife on the floor, covered with what appears to be blood? It depends on your current view about yourself, a guy that seems to know very little about himself. Does freeing the rat from the rat trap in any way change the outcome of it all? I don't know, and I don't care enough to find out. Is it that the list of girls you run into twice mean that you murdered them? You can see where this is going. You, the player, are the one that is putting meaning into the things you find. The one and only thing I was curious about while playing the game was whether or not you did have someone watching you, which would either be your criminal partner or the real killer, and if I decided to have found the dead body at the end would have actually made anything happen relevant to most of my actions through the session, but even that isn't enough to make me want to go through playing the game again. The reason I have 2.1 hours on record is also because when I first played the game there was no autosave mechanism implemented and had to quit at about 40 minutes in because of stuff in the real world; the game is that short.Also, I don't consider this to be a major spoiler, but Home is absolutely titled the way it is because a) you find yourself initially in someone else's, and b) you end the game at yours.The game has a metascore of 69 out of 100: I guess it's a fair value. I personally got Home at a big discount, and I'd advise you to do the same if you really want to play it. If you want something with a little more gameplay and can handle the horror genre, try Lone Survivor since it's an overall better investment.			"

												The game has an overall creepy atmosphere, but it's pretty simple and dumb. What you get is a straightforward storyline that asks you pointless questions such as ""do you open the door"". Well, uh... Yeah, I guess I am going to have to open the door, huh. How about that. The story shows some potential, but it's painfully obvious that John, you are the demons. And while there's some mystery to solve, there's no real intrigue when it's shoved down your throat and the game constantly bombards you with questions like some needy kid: Who's the real murderer? What's your theory? Do you like the game? Mom, did you notice that thing in that one room? Moooom! Stop it, you're not playing right, you're just trying to get yourself killed so you wouldn't have to play my game!It's boring, but it's alright if you're easily scared and you get it for free.			"

												I don't know how to write this in any other way then to sound shallow but Home is supposed to be a narrative murder mystery with multiple endings. And it accomplishes just that. Only it is boring as hell. In order to solve the mystery you are required to grind and read a lot. You must search every room to unlock the truth. And it gets to the point where walking around back and forth in areas is just tedious and boring. Plus the text reads one letter at a time and there is no skip to fill the textbox button so I found myself accidentally and intentionally out of boredom skipping entire paragraphs of dialog. My ending was pointless and unfulfilling the whole game is low budget and doesn’t utilize its attributes to make something engaging. BOOOOOO!			"

												I can recommend saving your $3 for something else. It's such a short game that there wasn't even a save feature on launch, and the whole draw is supposed to be that it's a suspenseful story, the ending of which is determined by the choices you make along the way....Only it makes no effort whatsoever to connect the dots in any meaningful manner at the end. I gave it 5 playthroughs, attempting each time to steer it more towards a climax that actually makes some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense, but every time it ends up reading like a drunken session of Whodunnit Mad Libs that was wrapped up halfway when everyone passed out.(also it sucks at being suspenseful)			"

												At the beginning of the game when you have the option to look at something or not, if you click on it again, it says that maybe you shouldn't have done that because you now have your finger prints everywhere. When I first read this, I thought this meant that whether I touched and interacted with anything in the game would affect my ending because I might get arrested for instance if I touched the wrong things.In the end all I got was a main character that had no idea what had happened because I had not actually interacted with anything except what was needed to progress the story. And the worse part was even when I played through and had found everything... I still didn't know what had happened for sure.I replayed the game a few more times, and while the atmosphere and art are nice, I feel that game is not worth it except at a cheap price.The endings aren't that different and that's where it failed.The only majorly different ending is the one where you kill yourself if you have picked up the gun or knife. If the endings had more variety such as you getting arrested because you left evidence at a crime scene or SOMETHING different than just killing yourself or wandering off into the distance, then this game would have been worth it.Also this game REALLY should not be advertised as a Horror game, because while the atmosphere was absolutely fantastic it is not scary at all except if you bought this game for a high price.

												Don't buy it. I really like horror games, but this one isn't scary at all. Not even psychological scary - not even a thriller. Story wise, it's just a very cheap Silent Hill 2 copycat. If you have a bit of experience with horror games, you can guess the plot of Home from the start. There is no plot twist, no suspens, nothing. There is no ending, only a long and boring summary of what you did. Gameplay is hideous : it's linear with a fake sense of choice.Maybe worst of all, in my opinion, is the sound design. Sound is of primary importance in horror games, and audio in this game completely throws you off the game. Soundscape elements are redondant, mixed too low and all in all not immersive at all. Event sounds are ear-splitting and ultra-cheap. You absolutely can't play this game with headphones if you value your ears.Don't buy it.			"

												Wasn't too ecstatic upon completion,Gonna talk spoilers here, nothing super specific, but more just my impressions as I played. I like that it went for an open-ended style, and maybe I just didn't play the game close enough to a solid conclusion, (I picked up certain things, left others, thinking some items would lead me to get a more incriminating ending, not as though I knew what the game actually had planned or how picking up those items affected my playthrough).My main problem is that the game sets up a pretty obvious twist that your character is probably going to end up being somehow responsible for the disturbing discoveries he keeps making (and enthusiastically questioning as though he's never seen them before since he has amnesia/sleepwalks). Then the game just throws the choice to you in the last minutes of gameplay as to what happened. As soon as it hit this point I thought maybe the ending would be really dynamic, and hey, it's cool that I'm taking a small hand in the storytelling, but the choices it gave me were actually pretty unsatisfying, they changed some of the main elements of what transpired but that just made me feel like it didn't really matter much what happened, anything could've happened, there's no shocking reveal, I'm just writing the ending and then it ends, which as a mystery just doesn't work well. The ending was nothing more than a bunch of text boxes explaining my playthrough, and really hazily describing some of the decisions I made along the way. I just played the game, Home, this is old news to me and your summation doesn't make the story any less asinine.As a Horror game it really doesn't succeed in much. There's some small amount of atmosphere but very little ever happens. I experienced a single jumpy moment when a very loud spout of steam came from a pipe in the sewers, and then nothing else happened the entire playthrough. Discovering bodies here and there was not very impactful, and I'm not even saying subtlety is bad, it can be very good, but at no point was I really given incentive to care, more often I just thought to myself ""Is there going to be a cheap twist ending where it turns out this guy I'm playing is the bad guy?"" and just because I can Choose My Own Adventure (Ending) so that he's not, that doesn't make the ending any better, it just makes it so neutral that I could hardly be arsed to even try to be invested in what was going on. I would try playing through again once or twice to get different endings, but to be honest the amount of walking and mind-numbingly simple button pushing puzzles and item-fetching bouts are too monotonous for repeat trips. I'm gonna call it here and say I don't recommend this one. It's a promising concept, but I'm pretty sure much more could be done with it than this in terms of storytelling and delivery.			"

												This is a brilliantly designed game.  As you progress through the murder mystery environment, you are left always wondering: What happened here? and Who is to blame?  The game never answers these questions.  It leaves you to decide how the story ended.  This is the best part.  You can never be wrong, and you decide what happened based on the evidence you uncover.  The developers don't want there to be a diffinitive, ""Correct"" story, so that each individual can decide and interperet from the events what the story is.  The other big seller for this game is after you complete the game, you can share your interpretation of the story on their website, and then read other people's experiences and stories.  You'll probably spend an extra hour or two seeing how other people interpreted from what you saw and didn't see along the way.   For just $3, this game is completely worth what you pay, and provides an experience that stretches beyond the 1 hour - 90 minute gameplay time.			"

The game is designed to leave the player thinking of what truly happened, but whether it does or not depends on the player. The game lasts for about the duration of 1-2 hours. Even though the game is only 3$, I would still recommend it only on a sale. You will get a short, 2D ""horror"" experience that is aimed at those who enjoy thinking on multiple ""artistic"" levels and those who are interested in mystery.

												sooo, just finished the game, which has an pretty much open ending, what some people might appreciate and many will find rather unsatisfying.Dont expect a horrifying atmosphere alá Amnesia or shockmoments in yo face alá Resident Evil. Its more like in Memento, u find yourself in a situation and try to figure out what happened, based on the clues you find. There are no other characters to interact with. Gameplay contents of walking around, looking at things and trying to solve the puzzle. Some parts of the (possible) story are contradictory to others, so you cannot find out what happened consequentially, so you have to prefer your imagination.  I found it realy interresting to read what other players thought what happened and compare it to my version.Overall its a innovativ but short little game-novel.Recommend to people who like books without pictures in it.

This game is probably a good bet if you: - are comfortable with unreliable narrators- are comfortable with your decisions influencing how the story plays out- can tolerate an unresolved story- like heavily pixellated art- like games that are psychological- understand the difference between a ""game"" and an ""interactive experience""- don't like spending a lot of money :)I did enjoy this game.  I thought it was interesting to be put in the position of a main character dealing with some kind of psychosis.  I also liked that the game tried to get me to reflect on why I had made the choices I made for the main character.  The atmosphere and especially the sound of the game were compelling.  The pixel art was a little too rough. Take the game's advice and play it in the dark with headphones on if you can.  I'm sure others have said this but there's an obvious similarity between this game and Lone Survivor.  For my part, I enjoyed LS more.  But they are different games and both have merit.  All in all, an interesting experience and for me, worth the $3. "

												Home. Yes, you start in a house, you move to a not house, and keep moving to not houses, till you get to a house. The game is linary and moves you from point a to b over and over. You will slowly start to realize you should have clicked that object twice so you could grasp more of the story. Unfortunately it's already too late and you now walk slower through the rest of the game. You will continue wander the same place over and over thinking you missed something, when you actually didn't.In the end the game makes you choose your own ending. You begin to wonder if that how it's suppose to go, and to find out the devs want you to choose your own ending.I was so unhappy with the ending that I was pretty much like f__k it and closed it instead of going for another play-through.I liked the game, but not enough to see what other things I could do with it, I just don't care about the character that much, to be honest, he's a p__sy.

												Home has a story which gives answers in the end (at least, in my version of the ending). It leaves a lot to your interpretation, not only that, but in some way, you get the create the story of the game through your very own choices and actions.Home wasn't too big of a challenge and it was easy to draw conclusions on your own without the game actually telling you anything. Which, the game never really did in the end.The gameplay hasn't much to offer, it's moving around with the arrow keys and picking up, activating and using items with the spacebar. But this game isn't about the gameplay, the game features a story (which you create bit by bit) while the atmosphere takes you in. I listened to the developer, plugged in my headphone and turned off the light. The atmosphere gets to you in a heartbeat! (Which you might skip once in a while).But that's all you need in this game, you interact with your enviremont, in order to analyze your surroundings and solve the story at hand. The suspense will kill you and the questions keep piling on, this game will keep you invested until the very last second!And as a good-willed hint, I advice to use multiple enviremont/objects more than just once. ;)			"

												Just the other day, I grabbed a Humble inDIE Bundle for Halloween, which included ""Home"".  While the game is fresh in my mind, I decided to write a review.  ""Home"" is a simple, easy to play, yet complex horror adventure.  There may not be goblins and monsters, but the 3D sound and plot twists are sure to scare you. Now, before you play, here are a few tips on how to make the best of this game:1. Play in one sitting (the game is about an hour and a half long)2. Play with headphones3. Lights off4. NEVER assume you know what's going to happen next. I'd give this game:5 out of 5			"

												A short, 2D side-scroller ""horror"" walk-a-thon that toys with the mind and raises fear until you learn there is no way to fail the game. The game is designed to leave the player thinking of what truly happened, but whether it does or not depends on the player. The game lasts for about the duration of 1-2 hours. Even though the game is only 3$, I would still recommend it only on a sale. You will get a short, 2D ""horror"" experience that is aimed at those who enjoy thinking on multiple ""artistic"" levels and those who are interested in mystery. If you don't enjoy thinking heavily on a mystery, you will probably be disappointed.			"

												sooo, just finished the game, which has an pretty much open ending, what some people might appreciate and many will find rather unsatisfying.Dont expect a horrifying atmosphere alá Amnesia or shockmoments in yo face alá Resident Evil. Its more like in Memento, u find yourself in a situation and try to figure out what happened, based on the clues you find. There are no other characters to interact with. Gameplay contents of walking around, looking at things and trying to solve the puzzle. Some parts of the (possible) story are contradictory to others, so you cannot find out what happened consequentially, so you have to prefer your imagination.  I found it realy interresting to read what other players thought what happened and compare it to my version.Overall its a innovativ but short little game-novel.Recommend to people who like books without pictures in it.

												While the auditory experience of this game is palpable to say the least, the story leaves a vast amount to be desired. Certain key elements are left to the player to decide, and while I am usually of the camp that claims that player-choice can never go wrong, this game proves me incorrect, when I actively start breaking the storyline by deciding something other than what the story was building to. While it attempts to recover, I can't help but feel continuity here would be best preserved by limiting the amount of player-input into the actual storyline, and just finishing the game.			"

Regardless, when on sale, I recommend it for everyone. And if you beat it once, I recommend researching the ending and playing through again, to be SAFE (hint, hint, capitalized word).			"

												This isn't an easy ""game"" to review.  This game is probably a good bet if you: - are comfortable with unreliable narrators- are comfortable with your decisions influencing how the story plays out- can tolerate an unresolved story- like heavily pixellated art- like games that are psychological- understand the difference between a ""game"" and an ""interactive experience""- don't like spending a lot of money :)I did enjoy this game.  I thought it was interesting to be put in the position of a main character dealing with some kind of psychosis.  I also liked that the game tried to get me to reflect on why I had made the choices I made for the main character.  The atmosphere and especially the sound of the game were compelling.  The pixel art was a little too rough. Take the game's advice and play it in the dark with headphones on if you can.  I'm sure others have said this but there's an obvious similarity between this game and Lone Survivor.  For my part, I enjoyed LS more.  But they are different games and both have merit.  All in all, an interesting experience and for me, worth the $3. "

It claims itself to be ""Horror"" yet there is nothing either scary or unsettling (Apart from the one jumpscare with the bats). And on top of that, there no real 'ending' as nothing properly happens, there's no actual outcome other than suicide or walking away with no closure.All in all, I say this game is a bit of a waste.

												Good atmosphere and a decent play, possibly even worth a couple of plays for people that might have missed something and want a different ending.  However, there is no real ending, just a recollection of your experiences and what you previously selected as being the truth, everything is interpretable - for better or worse - and while never being able to know everything does leave the game to linger in your mind a while, perhaps prompting a replay, ultimately feels a little lacking.  This is a very short game, which can be done in 45 mins even when exploring everything.  The intro of the game recommends 1 1/2 hours, but with the limited areas to explore and even accounting for getting lost a little, I really fail to see how so much time could be spent on one playthrough.Home has the feel of point and click adventure games (without the point and click), but is too shallow to really fit in this category, and as it can be finished quite quickly, can be consumed quite adequately via a Let's Play on youtube.  I ended up both watching a Let's Play and buying and playing the game myself, just to see if I can change the ending, and while choosing different options and exploring a bit more thoroughly, ended up with an extra couple of sentences in my ending.   I bought Home on a 99p sale, and feel this was a fair price for feeling like I'd done my best to get a different ending, and also to contribute to supporting the developer a little.The best thing about Home is the nostalgia that comes with playing it, reminding me of the games that first introduced the gameplay elements that Home uses, such as the slow opening of doors, and descending stairs like Resident Evil.  Home doesn't rely on Jump Scares or Gore in the same way as modern horror games tend to now.I just hope that Home inspires more classical suspense horror games.  To me no game comes close to capturing the depth and suspense from the first few Resident Evil games, and even in the 8 bit style of Home, I'd be happy if someone put in the time to give a really rich and deep suspense/survival horror game.Sadly, all the deep puzzle games of old, like Resident Evil, and Tomb Raider, have evolved into action games rather than puzzle games, and while I enjoyed the Tomb Raider reboot a lot, really miss the games that require some planning, and problem solving.  So here's hoping Home maybe inspires some in the future.			"

												In this game you guide your character through a very linear environment and occasionally make decisions. Depending on the decisions you make, the text based story changes (sometimes dramatically). Unfortunately you're the only character in the game: you never encounter another living person or any kind of scarey creature. So it's basically a ""choose your own adventure"" book dressed up in some 8-bit graphics. The graphics are nicely stylized, but since you'll only ever be walking around them they really don't do much for the game. The writing is poor and the plots available are on par with ""choose your own"" adventure books too.Skip this one and read a book instead. Even at half the asking price a used book will offer more choices to make and a more satisfying experience since you'll imagine what's happening instead of being dissappointed that it isn't shown in the game. Or skip this one and instead play a game that does horror or mystery well.			"

												I should probably preface this by stating that I'm not really a big fan of horror media in general...But all the same I don't feel like Home really has all that much to offer. It tries to run solely on atmosphere, with story delivered through pages of text. I actually quite like this approach, allowing the player's imagination to really shape the story, but what plot DOES exist is sparse and ambiguous. It's supposed to be, but even so, that also makes it incredibly unsatisfying. The gameplay is just walking around, finding keys to open doors. With a bit more depth to that, combined with the atmosphere (which is admittedly pretty good) the game could have been really good. It's an interesting diversion for an hour or so if you can get it really cheap, but for the most part there are better games doing similar things.			"

												As an experiment in interactive narrative, Home is mildly intriguing; it succeeds, at times, in subtly handing storytelling agency over to the player. This it accomplishes through the power of suggestion. The player is confronted with persuasive, yet oftentimes conflicting information: a multitude of narrative threads leading to the illumination of the final mystery. Where Home fails is in that resolution; rather then offer the player a satisfying bookend to their personalized experience, it merely poses more questions on top of half-answered ones. The prose is passable, though familiar and spartan in metaphor; however, the host of jarring shifts in verb tense seem owed more to an amateurish command of English than any intentional obfuscation. Home is a case of the unusual medium being the message; it is all the more unfortunate, then, that the message offered here is not very compelling.			"

												""Home"" is completely lacking in substance. Whereas games like ""Thirty Flights of Loving"" or ""Gone Home"" present stories which may not be immediately evident, stories you may have to work to uncover or contemplate to unravel, there is at least an understanding between the creator and their audience that a story exists.""Home"", on the other hand, is like a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book in which every page reads, ""I dunno, make something up.""We already have a game that does that.

												A very interesting game.  Some may choose to argue over the definition of ""game"" here, but who cares?  The question you should REALLY be asking is ""will I get something out of this?""  Do you like mysteries?  Do you like interactive fiction?  Do you like creepy atmosphere?  If you can answer yes to ANY of those, this game is probably for you.  What seals the deal for me is that the story actually changes depending on what you've seen and done in the game.  This is a technique I keep hoping will make it into AAA titles.Important to note, this is NOT a horror game.  While the atmosphere feels scary at times, the game never does anything to frighten the player.  If you are looking for a horror game, look elsewhere.			"

												I got Home on sale for just a couple of bucks and played through it once and was not intrigued. I understood the concept: based on what you think the clues mean will determine the outcome of the story. I was not impressed with the writing and I was not spooked out by any of the descriptions or depictions. Contrasting this game to one I remember playing in the 80s on the Amiga called Uninvited, I'm still freaked out by it when I give it a whirl on an emulator. I give the developer kudos for trying, but the play through did not persuade me enough to try it a second time to see if I could change up the outcome.			"

												It isn't amazing, but it's pretty good and very atmospheric.  The endings are a little strange, mostly because your decisions are really black and white and are based on things that you'd think are beyond your control.  The gameplay is essentially really simplified adventure game puzzles, with no item combination or anything.  The game takes about forty mintues to play, so pretty short, too.  Still, this game is like 75 cents when it goes on sale, it's totally worth that price.  I probably wouldn't have payed 3 dollars for it.			"

												Pretty good adventure game with an amazing atmosphere, considering the retro graphics. There's no save option so you have to finish it in one sitting, which can take anywhere between 45 and 90 minutes. You make the choices and the game creates a story around that. It's done very well. The story is open for interpretation and encourages multiple playthroughs, but in the end you'll always be the one who decides what happens. It's a cool experiment. Bravo.[Rating: 78/100]			"

												Home is an extremely short adventure game with a fairly interesting story and retro 8-bit graphics.  The writing is well done and the audio effects in particular really standout.  Unfortunately the Steam Overlay is not supported correctly, and screenshots taken in game will be reduced to a very small resolution.  Where Home disappoints however, is in it's length.  Based on the presentation of the game it appears that multiple playthroughs may yield slight twists in the storyline, but from start to finish the game can be completed in 45 minutes.  For the price, I think this is too short for a completion and I would caution other gamers to take note.  Unfortunately, this title is so short that I cannot give it a positive recommendation and  suggest that other gamers give it a pass.			"

												So.... Survival horror! I'll admit, I haven't played any games in this genre since Silent Hill was released on Playstation, and I wasn't too keen on the genre as a whole. Nothing has changed since those days, so I wasn't expecting too much when I decided to get a copy of Home.When I first played Home, I was left with a feeling of what I like to call "".... Really?"" So I decided on a second playthrough, and that's when things got a little more interesting. The main hook for me was the pixels (always a winner for me.) Graphically the game is good, and the overall aesthetics are brilliant. The 2nd thing that caught me off guard was the ""you decide the outcome"" factor, again this adds to the replay factor and it was something I didn't know about (I should really read about these games before I try them.)What bothers me about Home is that everything is there, but it all just seems kind of obvious, at least plot wise. The atmosphere that the game is trying to portray is completely absent, and I really just didn't click with the game. I think Home deserves a couple of playthroughs before it's judged though, because it is trying, and it shows. If you like Survival horror or you want to get a hold of an interesting indie game then it's definitely worth looking into. I'll give Home a recommendation, but don't expect too much.			"

												Hmm... very torn about this game. (Relly wish there was an option for that, dang it!)On one hand gives a very good spooky vibe of suspense that something may be coming after you at some point. The story throughout the game changes depending what you find and if you decide to pick up certain items or not. Trying to figure out what happened, what lead up to it, and if the decisions you make have an impact on the storytelling. May require you to replay it a few times to understand what fully happened, or if you may have overlooked something.On the other, short and eventually the suspense dies out about a 1/4 way. Granted the dev team did recommend you play it throughly in one sitting, and they did say it would be 1.5 hours long at the start of the game. But for a $3 game, it's a very good price for it.I do recommend this to those that may get easily spooked and new to horror games, as this is just a small taste of it but without the frosting on the cupcake. You're only getting a muffin, and those are good too!I don't recommend it to veteran horror gamers and fans as this would bore them quickly and feel they wasted their money, which isn't much.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												Let's get the flaws out of the way first: There are a few spelling errors and there is no save system at all. That means you have to start from the beginning and play to the end in one go each time. Given that you have to play it in one sitting, it's pretty short, but well worth the money because there is a very interesting story being told here. You get to make a lot of little choices throughout the whole thing, and they influence what story you are presented with. Because of that, a lot of different things can be interpreted from the story and there is no definite explanation for what's going on. That makes this game truly outstanding.So to summarize, it has a great story, GREAT atmosphere and suspense, and can be replayed for different experiences. I also really like its look. And it is very simple to play, so you can show this to all your non-gaming friends and family and they will enjoy it too. This was a very memorable experience, and worth way more than $3.			"

												Home is a very simple and fun indie horror game that isn't scary in the usual sense. Its not graphics-intensive, and the gameplay isn't very intricate either. Its strengths, however, lie within its superb narrative and the sense of dread and foreboding that occur as you progress through. The objective of the story is to find your way home, after waking up in a house that isn't yours, while uncovering some disturbing and haunting secrets along the way. Its easily played through in at least a half-hour, but the replayability comes from multiple endings based on how much you explore and what choices you make with key items and events. There's a surprising amount of hate on this game, but to me, this seems likely because people are comparing it to something its not. Its not Slender, its not Amnesia, and its not intended to be. Go play those if you want a more intricate horror game, but Home holds its own as a title that brings something different and unique to the table.			"

												This game starts out good, giving you a nice atmosphere with suspense. It raises several questions and makes you want to continue playing to find the answers. The thing is, I don't recommend this game because the ending is terrible. Sure, there is more than one ending but the ending I got was so bad and poorly written that I can't imagine the other endings to be better. It was a real let down.			"

												I'm all about 2D games and love all the indie stuff that comes out, but this seemed to go out of its wait to make bad 2D graphics - Double Dragon almost looks better graphics wise and on top of that there is so many graphic repeats where it would not have been much work to make a couple different kinds of bookshelves (for example).I don't know if I played it wrong and didn't figure it out right (though I don't have the interest to play it again even though it was short) I swear I had it figured out in the first 15 minutes of the game or so, but the ending didn't confirm that or not as if the game wanted to hide it from me or make my character truly dilusional in his role in the game.Further, the very subtle effects like music (there was a little only at the very end) are really effective even when they're simple... this could have been a lot better with more of that.In conclusion, I'm glad I played it, but there are too many negatives to me to recommend this to anyone. Despite that, I will be following this developers work and hope to see his future projects increase in quality.			"

												An intriguing, slow, minimalist and moody horror game. You wake up in a strange house next to a body, you want to go home.At only an hour or so long you can play the game in a single sitting, which the game suggests. Whilst the game is linear (to be expected for an 'adventure' game) you actually have some amount of input in the final outcome. The clues you find and the way you choose to interpret them has some bearing on how the story ends.The interaction is fairly minimal, but it felt effective as I played, choosing whether or not to disturb a body, touch a murder weapon, peek into someones drawer or take a discarded photograph. The art style leaves the environments sketchy, with good use of sound and text building immersion. In fact, sound is a very key part of the game and heightens the experience considerably.Whilst the game is generally quite slow, the atmosphere is well achieved and there is a feeling of mystery and elements of dread throughout. You feel like you're stumbling over questions and possibly answers as you explore, gaining insight into what has happened.If you do commit to playing the game, do it one sitting, play it with headphones on, in the dark, as the game suggests. Interact with everything you can, watch for clues in the environment, listen carefully and try to piece the story together. At the end you'll shape the ending to reflect your take on the story.			"

												Home начинается как каждый второй хоррор: мы просыпаемся в мрачном незнакомом доме, на полу лежит изувеченное тело, а в трясущихся руках — только фонарик. Что произошло и как он здесь оказался, наш герой, естественно, не помнит. Но уже через пятнадцать минут блуждания по пиксельным коридорам начинаешь замечать, что в привычной формуле что-то не так, ведь вокруг нет ни души. Предчувствие скорой беды, неизменно присутствующее в завязке любого ужастика, в Home растянуто до финальных титров.			"

												I began to play Home with little expectation...and was more than pleasantly surprised. This game is very inventive with the genre and really tests the limits of its minimalistic style. The horror is more psychological, and creeps up on you gradually. I love how cerebral the experience becomes, as opposed to a typical blood and gore, jumpscare kind of horror game. The game allows a lot of freedom, and every decision you make eventually has an effect on your character and his psyche. Unlike most games, where you HAVE to find a certain key to unlock a certain door to even move on...this game gives you choices. Sure, you can find the key and discover more secrets...but if you choose not to, other opportunities present itself. Essentially, you create your own story of what happened here in this mysterious situation. Your character actually tells you how they would feel about certain decisions and will react according to your choices, adding to the dilemma. You can really empathize with him, or you may even become suspicious of him...The narrative style is very atmospheric and well written, playing out like an engrossing book or well made horror film. My experience in the game was extremely grim, and it made me curious to start a new game and try again, to see what I could do differently. It was that good.			"

												Something like an hour and a half to beat the game for me. I fell asleep an hour in- the game has some interesting ideas, but without any danger, there's not much of a ""game"" element to it. It's more of a choose-your-own-fate visual novel. There's no set ""story"" for the game, just different potential paths. It has some unique ideas, but it's hard to care when it's a struggle to pay attention to what's going on because you're so bored. Wow, that sounds like such a jerk thing to say, but...

However, I can't reccomend this game because there really isn't a payoff-- my ending was the character giving a summary of what happened, asking questions, and then I get the ending that I <i>made up</i> and then the credits. Really? That's not a proper ending at all. I could have started at the very end and known as much as I did as playing through it. ""Don't write a story about the twenty years after a dragon war.

Now before you say, ""This isn't a review, this is just a video lol"". Imagine me as Steve Carell and the other person being Home. It's THAT bad. Home is a indie horror story made by Benjamin Rivers, and I can tell you by far, this is the worst horror game I have ever played. Imagine putting a ""Then a skeleton pops out"" anticreepypasta and making it into a game. It's not scary, the atmosphere didn't give me spooks, even when I was supposed to be scared, I wasn't. The plot is way too easy to figure out, game is incredibly short, and just a bad game. I have warned every single one of my friends to never get this.And I hope this will help you too from making a bad purchase. If you got 2.99 and want to spend it on something, please, for the love of god, don't buy this.			"

												This is purely my own feelings towards this game, which may not be the same of others.But even just costing $2.99, I still have buyers remorse.This game just felt like 1 hour of filler, walking around for no point.Nothing happened, and when it was over I didnt care that I just played a game for an hour that just involved walking back and forth with nothing to show for it.I was just relieved that it was finnaly over.2/10, I do not reccomend this game, If you would call this a game.

												Well... the last thing I expected from a simple retro game like this was to have it crash to desktop 20 minutes into the first time playing.  It was somewhat compelling before that but I'm not motivated to keep trying if I know that can happen.			"

												Some seem to be complaining about the convulted plotline, but honestly it's rather clear. The game relies on what you think happened and what actions you take, whether that be deciding to pick up an item or not or investigating certain paths or moving forward. Near the end especially is when what you think and say matters, as it will change how the game ends quite a bit. I've only played through once so far, but I definitely noticed certain items I ignored or alternate paths I could've taken and plan to come back to it and see what else I can uncover. Overall a great game with a creepy atmosphere and certainly a great value considering the low price tag.			"

												Home takes the simple “choose your own adventure” formula and twists it around to make something strangely intriguing.It allows you to shape your ending based on the decisions you had made in your play through. It’s not groundbreaking but for this particular game, its execution was marvelous. You would have to truly invest your attention to the game if you want the full effect of the game to work. Play it in the dark, alone and with headphones. It's worth the set-up.Be warned though, it is a fairly short 1 hour game but in fairness, it has a lot of replay value especially when you are trying to figure out the other endings. Don't let this little gem pass you by, give it the 1 hour chance!			"

												If you're looking for a game that you can invest dozens of hours in, Home is probably not it. But if you're looking for a fun, short  mystery to solve, Home is for you! It was great to play a game that is more about interpreting the clues and less on gaming skills. I played the game twice within 2 hours and enjoyed that I got a different ending both times. I will likely play it a few more times and make different choices to see what will happen. I bought Home during the Steam holiday sale, which means I snapped it up for next to nothing so I could hardly say it wasn't worth my cash. Don't let the low-tech graphics fool you - there is a great story to be unravelled. (Or will it unravel you?)			"

												GAME HIGHLIGHTS :1. Retro Pixel based Style, exploration mystery solving. 2. Amazing story. Multiple endings. Good for 3-4 gameplays.3.Somewhat Dynamic level generation. You find new stuff in each gameplayMY 2 CENTS:If you lovegames for their stories more then mindless shooting and violence. Go ahead and buy this... Leaves you in such an awesome hangover that would keep you thinking hours after you finish it.Here is something really awesome about this game, when it ends it doesn't tells you what happened finally and how all the things fit together. It asks you questions and you answer Yes or No. Effectively it is making you tell a story to yourself. and that is the absolute brilliance of this game.It just takes over an hour to finish the game, so you can play it multiple times without committing too much time. For a dollar a piece this is just a steal for having an out of the world experience in gaming.			"

												7/10A very good horror game. Albeit extremely short, it's fulfilling throughout its entire duration.If you're looking for a long game full of jump-scary moments and situations involving dealing with monsters or enemies, this isn't for you - but if you're looking for a extremely deep and tense game that makes you think in order to understand what the hell happened, then Home is definitely for you.The ending can be different in many ways, depending on what you choose throughout the game - and not just in a ""it changes what happens after the game"" way, but it actually changes what happens throughout the game according to your decisions.

												I hesitantly recommend this one - it has good points. I like the art style, the few jumps. the element of choices affecting the gameplay, and a lot of the puzzles and overall storyline really left me hungry for answers. I love that in a game! But by the end I felt deflated - I sort of get the lack of closure, but found it a little disappointing. Definitely a game with replay value, but only if curiosity pulls you more than the lack of substance. It felt a bit too floaty for me, with a lot of potential for more that just didn't deliver. Still a good game overall, a fairly enjoyable way to pass an hour, and it has left me eagerly awaiting  the upcoming new game by the same developer.			"

												Not as interesting as i thought it would be. Good on creating a stressful and threatening, disconcerting atmosphere, but since it never delivers on that threat it creates a sense of security that undermines the whole thing.Several passages prevent you from returning to previous areas and exploring more, effectively stopping you from uncovering more secrets, and there is never really a definitive answer to the mysteries you do uncover, making the choices you make important. I guess how that might have been the point all along, but the story wasn't interesting enough to make me want to go back do make different choices.			"

												I didn't expected this much ""horror"" when I bought this game - the creepiness kinda builds up with its ambient sounds and slightly disturbing sounds at times. The good thing is that It doesn't have any of those cheap scaring tricks. As you play, you will slowly learn more about the protagonist... and the story is what you think it is. It's interesting to read about how other players interpret the story and how different it is from mine - based on the different choices we made and the different things that we encounter. I recommend this for players looking for a short game with a unique story.			"

												Home is a weird game. Don't be mistaken by its ""horror"" label, it's nothing of the sorts. Just a creepy atmosphere, but there's nothing horrifying about it (except what it may make you imagine, which is good). The premise in essentially that you're a man who wakes up in an unknown house...seemingly with amnesia. From there, you look for clues wherever you go, and according to what you look at, and even pick up, the game gives you clues about what may be happening. This is awesome! Seriously, it makes you change up your ideas during the whole game! Even if you have an idea about what might have happening, your next action might very well change it completely. Or it might strengthen it. This leads to a lot of replayability, and many different ways to interpret the same story.It's great! And yet, it's also pretty bad. Why, you ask? Its core ideas are really great, and, most of its execution is as well. However, due to the many, many branching paths, it sometimes get confused, and manages to screw it up a bit, mostly at the end.My big complain comes from the lack of a warning about the actions you can't undo. Some paths you take don't let you go back, and don't tell you that either, which leads to imense frustration when you're like ""Oh, I'll explore this room first, and then get back here..."" Well, no. Sometimes, it simply assumes you chose to progress with the game through that room, and it leaves you thinking about that one area you skipped, since you're unable to go back. And there is no save system, so you can't just go back, unless you want to play it again, doing everything in the same way, changing your pathing choice.This made my second playthrough very frustrating towards the end, specially since I chose not to read the very important clue and the end, to explore the rest of the house, and then go read it. But it simply didn't let me. And that completely ruined the ending for me, it really did. I'll have to go through it again, from the very beginning, which is NOT a bad thing, if you want to try something different. In this case, I'll have to go through it in the same way, merely changing the ending.This issue aside, my views on it are mostly positive. Its minimalist sound and graphic design work really well, and I love the way the story is presented, really great work. This is a game that even if it's short (about 1hour and a half for playthrough), it leads to a few playthroughs, which makes it very worth your 2€.I would have appreciated some music and not just ambient sounds, but it's not a big issue. Try it out! It will not disappoint you (mostly, since you might get frustrated if you ""miss"" the ending you were aiming for, but that is easily fixed with another playthrough).I'm certainly playing it at least a third time, maybe a fourth. Also, it gives interesting insight into game design and a different way to approach story telling, even if it needs some refining. Enough ranting now. Buy it, it's damn worth it.			"

												this game is one i found equally parts nerve racking and interesting. the whole game is played completely alone as you travel home after a night of sleepwalking, only to discover several dead corpses. most of the game is wandering around eerily quiet buildings, finding peices of information about people you know and the situation your in. the best part of the game is that when you find this information around it lets you decide how you interpert it and so it lets you create your own story in this tiwsted night. it really does feel like someones always watching you and it gets you to jump at shadows often, even though at the end of the game you realize that there was no real threat throughout the whole thing, and thats the kind of atmosphere that i love, oppresively paranoid but hollowly lonely at the same time			"

												I cant tell you wheather or not Home is a good game. You need to play it for your self. You might love it and think its a unique narritive masterpice or you might hate it and think its a empty, shallow game that fails to deliver what it promises. Regardless of what you'll eventually think, its dirt cheap. Especially on sale (which is when you should be buying it, like any other game). So what do you have to lose? Nothing, thats what. Now buy it already so you can join in the arguement over its qualaty.			"

												The pixel art made me feel comfortable. The story depends on your actions: everything you've done in the current and previous areas seems to be taken into consideration when generating the next one. It's an awesome, one and a half hour build-up of questions, with some suspense, a couple of simple puizzles and one hell of a lot of possibilities. The tension builds-up all the way to the end... only to have it all blow up in your face. Turns out the game fails to take some decisions into consideration for the ending, and you get absolutely NO answers to anything, ever - you're left with even MORE questions. An awesome build-up to a horrible anti-climax. I've paid less than a dollar for it, so I sort of should've seen it coming. With that annoying bug and no ending, I don't think you'll like it. Not in it's current state.			"

												I got this in a bundle and wasn't expecting a ton from it, but it turned out to be pretty good. What would otherwise be a fairly standard old school adventure/horror game (which at times telegraphs a bit obviously what's going to happen next) is saved by subverting a couple adventure game conventions. For one, instead of requiring you to collect every item and examine every pixel and ""do ALL the things!"" to progress, it gives you the option to deliberately NOT do/get things, which changes the dialog/story. It also has a mechanic for not only making plot decisions but allowing you to interpret the story in-game. It's flawed, but it's not a bad way to spend an hour.			"

												Home is an experimental game in which you help shape the story: how you react to the environment and how you interpret certain events will change the ending . It's similar in style to Lone Survivor, although there is no combat and neither an inventory. It's short, ~1 hour long, but for just $2.99 it's very worth it for those interested in an unique experience.			"

												Home is rather strange. You literally determine the ending of the game based on the vague clues and plot the game gives you.  Did you get dragged into this mess by accident or did you go on a homicidal rampage? The ending will be determined by what you take with you, and what you leave behind, and what you find.  Certainly a more psychological game: it plays a lot more like a story than a game in a sense. Get it on sale, as it's a rather small game.			"

												Home is a psychological thriller where every decision you make from what things you inspect through to where you choose to explore add up to give you one of multiple endings. ""The protagonist"" is trying to find his way home, but as you lead the way as ""the narrator"", our main man finds out just how much trouble they're in.For a cheap game that lasts exactly an hour and a half as the developer claimed, it's amazingly effective. I played it after midnight in full darkness with headphones on as requested at the start of the game and it made it a very eerie playthrough. It'd be nowhere near as effective if I played it during the daytime, but I could probably have gotten away without the headphones given I've got a surround sound set up.It's not the perfect game because one of the endings basically is a cop-out, but the other endings are much better. But again because this is a cheap game clearly made by a solo indie developer, I can forgive the minor flaws. It's a good thriller.EDIT @ 2014-02-23:More than a year since my original review date, I have not played this game again. Buy this game when it's cheap for a thrill, but I add the additional warning that the replay value of this game is very low.			"

												Home is a experimental horror game, and when they say ""experimental,"" they mean it.  The narrative, while still falling into some of the more traditional tropes of the genre, throws the user a very mean curveball toward the end of the game, and I'm about to spoil the heck out of it, so turn away if you don't like spoilers.  Actually, I'm going to do the exact opposite of spoil the ending, because that is  the same thing the developers did.  The spoiler is that the game never spoils anything.  Nothing is ever revealed.  Was there a monster?  Was there a serial killer?  Were YOU the serial killer?  Did you kill your wife?  Did you even HAVE a wife?  Was it all in your head?  The games gimmick is that YOU, the user, get to figure out the story, and there is no wrong answer.  After the game is completed, you are prompted to go to the games website and input your own interpretation.  While a cute idea, it didn't really work for me, and took me out of the ""scared"" mindset.  That, on top of the fact that the game itself isn't that scary (You cannot actually die) made me really unimpressed with the game.  The gameplay was one-dimensional, and the story played out like a choose-your-own adventure novel.  I'm just not really sure that style of storytelling works in the horror genre.			"

												Home is pretty neat! It's an atmospheric side-scrolling horror/adventure game. You can interact with a ton of stuff, and the things you see/touch influence the rest of your playthrough and the potential endings you can get. There are no enemies, but the game's fluctuating narrative should definitely keep you engaged. Oh, and it's only about two hours long, which is good, because this game is a straight shot - no saving. (That's why it says I've played this game for a good 24 hours - I went to work and ran errands during a playthrough.)It says you decide what happens, and that couldn't be truer. At the end of the game, you're left with your experiences - the things you picked up, the things you saw, the things you did - and you actually decide what you think happened (I pretended that absolutely nothing happened - it made so little sense that even the MC was confused, lol). There is a TON of replay value; almost every outcome you can think of is possible. I liked it!			"

												Home is a great little horror/lite adventure game.  A play through only takes roughly 30-45 minutes but it's designed to be played 3-4 times to see how the story plays out each time.  A lot of the plot points are up for you to decide based on how you interperet the evidence you were able to find during the murder mystery.  The game is as much about what you clues you didn't find as to which ones you did.  There are plenty of points in the game where you will make one choice or forget to go back and check on something that you will want to revisit on subsequent play throughs.  The creepy atmosphere the developer was able to achieve was quite well done through sound, text, and pixels.  It is best to do each play through in one sitting, with the lights off and with headphones.  It was a really nice change of pace for an evening and I highly reccommend it for anyone looking for something a little different in between more time consuming games.  Also, it is super cheap so the short length shouldn't be a deterent to anyone.			"

												I hesitantly recommend this one - it has good points. I like the art style, the few jumps. the element of choices affecting the gameplay, and a lot of the puzzles and overall storyline really left me hungry for answers. I love that in a game! But by the end I felt deflated - I sort of get the lack of closure, but found it a little disappointing. Definitely a game with replay value, but only if curiosity pulls you more than the lack of substance. It felt a bit too floaty for me, with a lot of potential for more that just didn't deliver. Still a good game overall, a fairly enjoyable way to pass an hour, and it has left me eagerly awaiting  the upcoming new game by the same developer.			"

												It bills itself as a horror game. It does not manage to instill horror once, it's just too slow, janky and boring for that (especially since it's told in the past tense so you know the protagonist is still alive). Worse, it is made by either a bloody newbie and ignorant in horror, or by someone actively trying to capitalize on markiplier and pewdiepie. I say this because it contains a number of very egregious jumpscares. As in, it tells you to put on headphones and plays quiet sounds so you turn them up, then slams doors or explodes pipes next to you entirely out of nowhere. Don't spend money on it. Don't spend time on it.			"

												As of this writing, Home has been available to purchase on Steam for exactly one year. Yet typographical errors and bugs continue to plague this game. For instance, every locked door you come across triggers its ""this door is locked"" dialogue twice. Every. Single. Time. There is also one single part of the game where, after having used a gamepad for the entire journey, I was forced to use my keyboard. Quite confusing.The story comes of as a simplistic ""choose your own adventure"" format. Home is comparable to a 2D, side-scrolling Dear Esther, except you also have a very basic inventory system and the sound design is severely lacking.Even though it was somewhat enjoyable, I can not recommend Home to anyone knowing what I do now. Buying Home determines whether or not you reward lazy and incompetent game design.			"

												clever narrative, and contextual choices change the outcome of the story. it's up to you to decide what has or hasn't happened. it's very surreal, and at times sinister, but on the whole it was worth the cheap price. I would just wait for it to go on discount if you want your money's worth. There's even a warning to set aside 1.5 hours  to play the game, put on headphones and turn off lights. It doesn't work as a horror, but it does work as an interesting experiment in gaming narrative.			"

												Firstly It isnt a horror game but its a murder mystery game so if anyone who expected a horror dosent get dissapointed. The game isnt one of the best games I've nor one of the ones I will probably remember after a few years but the gradual revelation of the story and of the mind of the character is a really good experience to have. The dev's want us to have our own stories but sorry to say the story is pretty predictable if you have seen any mystery movies or read any book of the sort but again I would tell other people to have this experience on their own and see how far can they solve this mystery.

												Nope, nothing to see here. You are this pixelated guy who literally just walks around opening doors, flipping a few switches, and picking up random things. That is the entire game. You have to do so much reading, but the texts comes up 1 word per minute, and if you press a button to speed it up it just skips the entire thing. I missed tons of things because I don't have a reading problem but didn't want to spend 20 minutes for him to finish his text thought. There is no horror. I finally gave up because there is no direction and I turned random valves and nothing seemed to happen and I had nowhere to go and no idea what I was supposed to do. Game is not ""Horror"" its just a boring pixel game with nothing to do or see. 3.5/10.			"

												A 2D walking simulator where absolutely nothing scary happens. You walk to the left, sometimes to the right, open doors, and press A next to things with a white box around them.Everything you examine and/or pick up is presented as some kind of ""clue"" that potentially explains some aspect of the aftermath in which you now find yourself, so for the whole game it seems like you are piecing together some kind of mystery. Usually in a mystery game you put together all of the clues and evidence and ultimately conclude what happened. But HOME just shows you a series of items in a sequence and then asks, ""What do YOU think explains this item? A or B?"" There is no way to honestly know the answer one way or the other, so you just pick one at random. It really doesn't matter what you pick, because the game just says, ""That is an interesting theory.The end.""REALLY?The game is essentially a 50-minute long opinion survey about itself. It takes a sharp turn away from being a pretentious indie game and instead veers headlong in the direction of being an oddly narcissistic one. Can a game be narcissistic? I wouldn't have thought so, but HOME has made a persuasive argument that it can.Also, there was a point in the game where the controller vibrated non-stop for ten straight minutes for no apparent reason. I almost quit there just to maintain feeling in my hands.The only positive things I can really say about it are these:1) The game does have a pretty good atmosphere.2) It's an interesting narrative experiment, even if I personally consider it a failed one.

The only problem I had with this game is the 2D landscapes were a little cumbersome in that I almost got lost a couple times. The doors/trees sprites all looked the same. It's meant to be played in a single sitting, and can be played differently each time with a *slightly* different result. Emphasis on *slightly*. The writing style is thought provoking.			"

												Home is an interesting case. It's certainly not great, not even good, but as an experience, is worth a look. The game doesn't tell you where to go, there's no music, and has no other gameplay besides collecting different objects and simply looking around. It could have worked better if it was more psychological about it, by adding a monster to get you, but plays on the part of that says that there is something out there after you, even when you know there isn't. Your simply a child running away from the mystical boogeyman that trying to get you and don't know when. The environment and sounds are well-crafted and quite subtle. Pick it up if your looking for an inexpensive, tense experience, pick it up.			"

												It was pretty good in my opinion. It was intresting enough to make me want to finish it.Easy to get 100% achievemnets if you're a completionist.It's a cheap game at $3 so why not. Also my first game on Steam so maybe that's why I liked :P			"

												I usually give games a few days of play before reviewing them. But I think I've seen enough. Home is an 8-bit looking pixel horror adventure game. It pretty much operates like all the old point and click acventures of old. It tells you on boot to turn out all the lights...and put on headphones. Fair enough. I do agree that games which favor spookiness need to be played in a certain way...at a certain time. This one does it so it can clip-clop loud footsteps and doorcreaks at you. Pretty much insistently and annoyingly. It does so so in-your-face that when you click on a door to move through it it shows you a pixelated door opening in full screen with accompanying LOUD door creak. Same with going up and down stairs. That...really...makes me laugh after awhile. But not funny haha. Funny as in...I can't believe they thought this worked. You start off in mystery house during a rainstorm without knowing how you got there. You do the same point and click searching and picking up and using things you always do in these. But nothing happens. Nothing is scary. In the occasional room there is a noise, a slamming, mysterious whisper but at this point I don't really read it as having anything to do with the story or the game itself. But more oooooo dev is trying to scare me with spooky sounds. Not thrilled by the puzzles thus far. And really not thrilled that once I got past a certain part, it won't let me go back and check out a door that I missed. Isn't a big point of adventure games that they are freeflowing? YOu can go visit and explore places? Read their descriptions? Enjoy the atmosphere? Well here is another fact of this game. It has laughable bugs. When I got bored I saved the game. WHen I started it up again and hit continue...TWO of me were on the screen. That's right. My character (the protagonist) is on the screen normally but since I restarted it had two copies of it. Once I went into the next room it went away. So like I already was thinking this didn't have someone helping with content. NOw I know it didn't have anyone testing it either. The story is what could have saved this. Events could have saved this. But neither have occurred.Edit: I've now finished the game...one run thru of it. I have to correct myself. The save bug does NOT go away. It is revealed when you use the mouse to move. You will always have two of yourself walking around the room once you restart. Now let's talk about the writing. Let's just drop this logic problem...At the beginning...you are trying to get out of the house. You come to a front door and...you can't leave...because there is furniture stacked in front of it! Why can't you just move the furniture like everyone else would do? There are lots of things like this. Also this game is written as if it was written in the past. This gimmick does not work. At all. It makes the game seems wishy washy. Makes it seem like nothing you do matters and that you aren't really trying to solve anything. Which I guess you aren't. It is telling the story and whatever you do is fine. That's the story. So there is no emotional impact for anything at all since you take it where you want. Someone also mentioned the achievements. Yes...the achievements also make no sense. And many bits at the end don't really make sense either. This needed so much more polish. It really is a grind.			"

												Simply chilling and thrilling, Home is a pixel horror that is not about running away from monsters, but doing so in your head. It is a mental game with many puzzles and although called a walking simulator, it is much, much more...Grapics- 8/10 Why so high you might ask? Well the atmosphere of the game is great and it ties in with the graphics.Controls-10/10 Simple. Easy.Handling- 9/10 You can feel yourself in the characters shoes.Story- 3/10 Not much here. If there was more meat on the bone I would have loved it but i cant say I knew what was going on at one or two points, basicly you are just trying to get home at night.Gameplay- 9/10 The reason for this being so high is that your character will have thoughts about your choices, and not even major ones. If you take the gun he is scaired because he think he will kill himself, or drop it/give away his position, etc.Creativity- 8/10 Done before but never like this.Price-10/10Hype-10/10 Better that expected.Overall- 8/10 The choice is your's to make, but for real $3 bucks is like a gallon of gas, just buy it!

												Can't really recommend.  The transition animation from room-to-room was irritating enough that I won't even attempt to play through the game again to try for a different ending.  When the animations between rooms, which are basically all the same, account for nearly 10% of the game play time, you're trying too hard to fill out the game.Also, the ending I got was ... really uninteresting.  It couldn't have felt like more of a let down without actually not having an ending.  I did like the concept and I think it was mostly there, but the annoying room transitions, the ending let down, and yet another blah pixel look game just keep it from being worth a buy.6 of 15 muffins.

												While I had heard of Home, the ""unique horror adventure"" released by Benjamin Rivers in 2012, I hadn't played it until September 2016 (part of a Humble Bundle). Let's not mince words here, calling Home a ""unique horror adventure"" would be like calling Super Mario Bros. ""an epic tale of a humble man that battles the forces of evil in the name of love"", which is laughable. Homesucks as a game and sucks as interactive storytelling medium.From the start, it did not endear me to it by requesting I turn off the lights, use headphones, and play the game in one sitting. In fact, it seemed to imply that I had to play the game in one sitting, which would've annoyed me any further. But still, I felt annoyed it had the gall to tell me all that.Listen. You do not tell me how I play my games. If you have to tell me the lights off and use headphones to create an ""atmosphere"", you're doing it wrong. You can leave the lights on and the jump scares in FNAF and it can still scare the bejeezus out of you and I'm not missing out on anything.The pacing of the game plods along. Apparently you can't walk and hold the flashlight up at the same time, and the little guy you control moves extremely slowly with no run button in site. The latter is explained in-game as the main character (""Sweater Vest Guy"") gets hurt and limps along, but unless Sweater Vest Guy has some sort of crippling neurological injury that disallows him to walk and hold the flashlight up at the same time, it's a horrible design and one of the things that harms the game.From the beginning, you can already guess that HE was the killer all along (and references to the character's job loss and alcohol-induced sleepwalking seem to support that), but there's also some sort of contradicting ""death list"" found in underground tunnels just to mess with your mind and introduce some further fake ambiguity, all of which leads nowhere.At the end of the game, Sweater Vest Guy will likely commit suicide (whether or not the player character really believes it was he who committed the murders) instead of offering a choice like running away or turning yourself into the police (there is a way to just ""slip away"", either by a complicated process of picking up and not picking up certain things...or by just quitting during the credits and continuing there). Not that such a choice had a lot of emotional impact. It's hard to feel sympathy for a goofy-looking ginger with two pixels for eyes and a sweater vest, but that only makes presentation even worse--I say the death of Sweater Vest Guy is meaningless based on the way he looks, but keep in mind I also was moved to tears during Final Fantasy VI, and that was sprite art as well.I don't know Benjamin Rivers. I have no idea if he's a pretentious hack or a halfway decent guy who made a game that I just didn't really like. But if I ever meet him in person or online and voice my displeasure about the game's poor ""storyline"", I would be irritated if he said something like, ""But ambiguity is the NATURE of the game!"" then I would tell him this: ""If you introduce disparate plot threads and then refuse to wrap them up or try to connect them in a logical sense, then you are not a genius, you're just lazy."" But to be fair, Ben Rivers never actually said that to my knowledge, so until I have it on record that he said this, then it's still 0-0, he still may be a pretentious hack, but he at least hasn't directly insulted my intelligence.If you have hopes for a good solid storyline, then forget it. Benjamin Rivers has a middle finger toward you if that's you're thing. I'm feeling charitable enough to say that it is okay enough for the 90 or so minutes it runs, but it was a time in my life when I was unemployed and played video games all day. I wouldn't waste time with it today, especially how slow the pacing is. Yeah, it's only $3 on Steam, but that's still far too much for what he's asking. Your money is better spent elsewhere.			"

What was up with the yellow eyes that watch you outside the train station and the claw marks on the tour?? They seem to have nothing to do with anything else in the game but were just 'scary' effects. I get that there was no music but the sounds they used were terrible.. I'm beginning to rant not because I feel like I wasted money, rather that I wasted time on this cheap game. Cannot recommend.			"

												Home is a game meant to be played in one sitting. It takes around an hour to complete (longer if you enjoy exploring every nook and cranny). That being said I think it does a wonderful job of keeping the player intrigued and involved throughout the entire game. The story paired with the retro graphics keeps the player on the edge of their seat, and thus makes the game that much more enjoyable. If you are looking for a way to spend about an hour and you enjoy suspensful stories, then I'd certainly recommend Home as it is worth the price.			"

												It's a murder mystery without the things that make murder mystery fun. The only parts left are the scary parts, but theres nothing that can actually hurt you so whats left is ambience. And the game does ambience pretty well for a sprite based game. The game has a lot of mystery, but it doesn't matter because you decide what happens. Your head canon is now the regular canon. So no real point to doing anything other than seeing the different endings you can get. Its only 1 hour long though and I paid 50 cents for it so I guess its worth the price.5/10 its not a bad game but I wouldn't ever seriously recommend paying for it.			"

												I was surprised by this game. It started out as a bit of an underwhelming experience, where I felt like my choices weren't as impactful as I thought they might be. I thought that my ""choices"" were simply revealing more or less of the complete story as I went on. But it turns out, your choices *are* quite relevant, and become more and more impactful as the story progresses, to the point where you doubt and second guess yourself. The second guessing and uncertainty really helps build the suspense, and helps the player to develop their own questions. That's the beauty of this game. It's an experience designed not only for suspense, but for curiosity and doubt and fear, as one would expect for something of the genre. As a $3 hour to two hour experience, quite provocative, and quite enjoyable.			"

												Okay, I'm going to give this game a reccomended thumbs up HOWEVER! It just barely does it for me.Spoilers!!! Maybe? Beware nonethelessWhile I didn't really find this game to be the horror-esque it claimed to be, I did find it was a nice quick play through that involved some exploration and a classic, choose your own adventure style. I had some trepedation at first, as always with games that claim to be horrors, wondering what kind of jump scares awaited me on the other side. Home offered no jump scares really... and as I played I found out my character, though he came across death multiple times, had no possible way of dying... so that was a disappointment at first... and although it let me take my time and start to explore a bit... it actually took away from the whole feel of it in the end.I went about exploring the first area entirely, the house with the dead man, trying to find what I could. I took some papers, left the gun... and found a video which I never really got to see the outcome of... I missed a point in the home where I could've viewed it I guess... but as the game progressed I found myself enjoying the exploration and the possibility of finding more clues as to why your character awoke where he did.The time flew by and before I knew it I was at the end. It was a very short game though but having bought it on sale for 75 cents I really can't complain.By the end I got to choose how I interpreted the clues I had stumbled upon, kicked myself for missing a few pieces of the story and found myself kinda, just a little bit... wanting to play it one more time just to see what kind of ending I could get the second round. However I have still yet to play it again and unless the mood really really REALLY strikes me to, I most likely won't.So, with that said...Story: 7/10I enjoyed it as I started to get into the game. I liked the choose your own adventure style of it and the whole mystery aspect. However I was very disappointed with the horror aspect the synopsis claimed this game to have. It left much to be desired.Replay Value: 5/10I might replay the game once more to figure out what I missed and what else I can get, but as for that I think this game would be retired from my shelf.Graphics: 5/10Wasn't much of a fan of the choice of graphics this time round. While the developer did a good job overall with his choice... I felt the game could've used more detail that doesn't come with the old pixel-style graphics. It left much to be desired.(Sale)Value: 6/10I mentioned I had bought this for 0.75 and I found that to be worth it. It gave me enough entertainment for the time the game lasted.(Full) Value: 1.5/10I wouldn't have bought this game had it been the full 2.99. Granted its only three bucks but seriously... I've seen much much MUCH better games go on sale on Steam for 5 bucks... and that 3 bucks would've been better invested towards those games.Ambiance/Music: 8/10This is what helped the game move along for me. Ambiance alone can help make or break a game so I applaude the developer in this aspect.Overall... out of 10... I would give this game a 5.5/10 good for the quick hour or two you may play it, but then shelf dust after that.			"

												Home is an interesting story. From the first moments when you wake up in an abandoned, derelict, house all through the rest of the game there is a definite feeling of being chased by something. The various choices your are offered in the game skew the game towards one of the multiple endings. The nice thing about a large number of the choices are that they are optional. Some areas, and thus options & backstory, of the game you can bypass completely simply by not exploring and taking the direct route.The game comes in at about an hour's game play per sitting, which some will find horrendously short but I found was about the right length for the story that was being told. As stated above the game has multiple endings depending on the choices made throughout the game so the replayablilty is good trying to get all the various endings.Overall, I enjoyed Home and the story that was being told.

It's up to you how he remembers his life, what happened, why and how and what he did or not did and how it ends altogether when he finally reaches his home . . .Great suggestive atmosphere and a story that has an ending depending on the the choices/actions you made.

												Here we go with another old styled type game. I know your sitting there saying dont tell me its good cuz it look liek♥♥♥♥♥♥n stuff man. >:I No only idiots think like that. Anyway this game is very well put together has some admittidly creepy moments. And has a very good atmosphere you dont get from most games. And this game ACTUALLY MAKES YOU THINK and no not with horrifyingly easy puzzles but with what is happening in the story as you progress. The story is good but its something you have to put together as you go the game is not going to set you on one path of story and tell you everything thats going on. So yes I did really enjoy this game. I found very little wrong with it. The only thing I possibly could have asked would be to make it a bit less of a run around and grab♥♥♥♥♥♥sort of deal in some spots but other than that very fun and definitely worth going and buying. Especially since it's only $3-4 dollars cant remember. But yes thanks for reading and ttyl.			"

												A side scrolling mystery game where you wake up in a strange place, amidst strange circumstances, and must discover what has happened. With 'retro-styled graphics' and a simple interface, Home essentially lives and dies on its narrative and atmosphere.One of those is better than the other.Let's start with the atmosphere. Very little of the screen is visible, relying on your flashlight to illuminate your immediate surroundings. I think this works well, and helps build tension -- especially in new areas, or when the (sparse) sound effects kick in.At the beginning of each area, there's a moment of unease as we -- like our protagonist (?) -- don't quite understand what's happening. Unfortunately, the longer we spend in one place, the more the reused environments and lack of interaction exposes the threadbare locations. Honestly, each screen has maybe one thing to examine, or interact with, and the whole thing is stretched longer than it should be.That is the perfect segue back to the narrative. The mystery is pretty standard, and depending on what items you pick up, or how you answer the binary choices (Blablablabla. Yes or No?), things will change, but not nearly as much as I would like. Furthermore, some of the choices clearly align with the developers' intended canon, and others are likely to illicit a ""Really?"" response from gamers.To be frank, I would have preferred a smaller, more focused game with a dedicated narrative and more interaction (see Gone Home, or at least improve the branching paths like in Telltale's games). As it stands, it was an interesting experiment but not one I'll dwell on, or recommend.			"

												A very nicely designed, atmospheric game, easily worth the price of admission. An interesting, minimalist approach to the indie horror genre, in which the player's actions and perceptions directly craft the narrative. Allowing the story to be ambiguous permits the observer to fill in the blanks themselves, which might leave some feeling cheated, but which I think is a wonderful design choice if done well (and it's done quite well here). That's just my opinion -- individual responses may well differ, of course. I've played the game a few times now and have enjoyed each runthrough.			"

												I did like the ambience in this one, the sound was well done which made up for the grphics, but it's way too short, I've got 70 minutes play though and I've done it twice, I only went back because I'd missed a room or two to search. I was expecting more puzzles and for it to be a bit more like a point'n'click game such as Kings Quest or something like Broken Sword, but it's very straight foward. Bought it on sale, its not worth 3 quid :P			"

												This a strange game that isn't scary buy feels real. Its atmosphere is fantastic and its story is well thought out with many different ways to see things. It isn’t your typical horror game but it’s not trying to be at all. It’s just a good 2D adventure that makes you think about what is going on. It’s only 1 hour long but for the price it is asking that is ok with me. Just try it and see why games are best when they are close to home.			"

												I was surprised by this game. It started out as a bit of an underwhelming experience, where I felt like my choices weren't as impactful as I thought they might be. I thought that my ""choices"" were simply revealing more or less of the complete story as I went on. But it turns out, your choices *are* quite relevant, and become more and more impactful as the story progresses, to the point where you doubt and second guess yourself. The second guessing and uncertainty really helps build the suspense, and helps the player to develop their own questions. That's the beauty of this game. It's an experience designed not only for suspense, but for curiosity and doubt and fear, as one would expect for something of the genre. As a $3 hour to two hour experience, quite provocative, and quite enjoyable.			"

												Home is what Dear Ester should have been, a dynamic narrative that can subtly change for each player. Unlike Dear Ester, Home is engaging. The closer you get to the end, the more tension builds in the game and in your own head, and your experience comes closer to mirroring that of the character you play. In Home, atmosphere is the star and it gets so thick you can cut it with a knife. It's one of the few horror games that really filled me with a sense of dread and unease as I moved cloister to the end. I had two issues, you can't save and one flawed puzzle at the end. The game is an hour or so long so I had to abandon my first attempt at about 30min in. One of the final puzzles requires an alt+tab out of the game to play an ARG or just google the answer, breaking the experience either way. Overall an excellent experience, double so given the low price of admission. Also, the developer seems cool, he answered my question about a mac version on twitter :P			"

												This title is an absolute joy. I played and completed this game back a couple years ago but just recently played and beat it again. It's a great story. It's not for those who don't like slow games or games where you just basically walk around and investigate. Choices don't seem to matter but I've only played through twice. This game is very short, about an hour and a half. At the begginning of the game it tells you it's best to have headphones on and an hour and a half of free time to finish it in one sitting to get the full effect. This I absolutely recommend doing. With this game a lot is left up the the imagination of the player which I love but many people who need hand holding or have never enjoyed a good cliffhanger in a book do not appreciate. It is a great game for what it is and it has psychological elements although very subtle. The story feels slow but in fact isn't. The game itself is 1 1/2 hours. Depending on how you play and if you're a completionist or have to explore everything the pacing is basically based on how you play. I enjoyed this title and highly recommend. I mean, come on, $3 bucks. It's great.			"

												I finished playing this game about an hour ago and I'm still not sure what to think, although I am still thinking about it, which must be a good sign. The gameplay is simple but absorbing and the use of sound makes it one of the most atmospheric 8-bit games ever. It's just the ending... There are obviously multiple endings dictated by your choices throughout the game, it's just that the ending I 'chose' wasn't very satisfying. Knowing what I know now I could play again and choose a different ending, but I don't feel compelled to right away. That being said I can definitely see myself picking it up again in a few weeks/months and giving it another go.Overall it was a fun but slightly anti-climactic 90 minutes, with the potential for multiple play-throughs.

There is more than one ending and there is no right or wrong ending.   You can also share yours and view what other folks interpretation of the story was.   Such an original game of its kind.

												About half of any good horror story will be a mystery.  The best of those stories let the reader infer what has happened behind closed door, instead of directly stating it.  Usually, around the time readers piece together the puzzle to solve the mystery, they start to realize the picture they're putting together is about something terrifying.  ""Home"" realizes this, and capitalizes on it in a superb way.  It must be noted that this game is not for everyone.  There is no action present on screen, and there aren't even any enemies to fight directly.  Some people may not even want to classify it as a game in the traditional sense.  In fact, they may be right.  Among other things, this is a story that is being told, and the player takes the role of one of the story tellers.  The best horror stories let the reader infer what the author meant, allowing the individual reader to fill in the gaps with things that unnerve them specifically.  ""Home"" takes the next step by letting the 'reader' decide how their own interpretation of the past events will shape the future of the story.I recommend this game to those who enjoy a good slow-burn creepy story.  However, if you're looking to romp around and blast heads off of zombies, then this game will not satisfy you.			"

												Wow, I love this game. I have played through it 3 times now and I still git the chills, there are no jumpscares, no horrible gory scenes, its just the feeling this game gives you, it keeps you on your toes. If you want to compare this game to anything, its 'Sonic.exe'. Overall, great game, great story. Hope this review was helpful!  "

												I received this game as a gift from another friend a while ago.  I never finished it the first time and I've switched computers since then, but I came back to Steam and decided to redownload it and give it a play.  This game has a very rich, complex story, and some events within it are obvious, while the rest of it leaves you to ponder.  I like the interaction you get within the game and your impending sense of ""aloneness.""  It makes for a spooky game you can get immersed into.  The sound effects are subtle, but creepy.  I think they work well with the pixel graphics, and a few of the noises legitimately made me jump (I'm easy to scare when I'm engrossed in these kinds of games, so it probably won't scare most other people.)  The game isn't a jump scare game like you might think or expect, though.  The story is what keeps you up thinking at night.My only complaint with this game, is that you don't get true closure in the end after you have supposedly ""solved the mystery.""  It leaves the ending open and squirming in your own mind.  I think some aspects are painfully obvious (i.e. the character had something to do with the killings in his temporary mental state, which he talks about.)  Some, on the other hand, don't give you full closure.  Why was he in the strange house?  (aside from it being necessary for the plot)  Who was the other man who had ""killed his wife"" and why was it important?  How long was the character unaware of the time frame in which all these events happened and he began to backtrack once he was awake?  Etc., etc.The game is great if you're looking for story driven.  It has an Amnesia feel to it in terms of the mystery of ""what happened"" although it might not have the solid answers you might be looking for in the end.  However, I do think the players who enjoy this will enjoy the overall mystery of the game as well as the mystery when the game is finished.  It's worth the one sitting play-through (which they do recommend you set time aside at the beginning to do.)			"

												I felt it was less of a horror game and more of a mystery game. Your choices can affect how the game changes for you. In the end you're left to think about what happened in the game and depending on the choices you made your take on the game will be different than other people. I think I enjoyed the open ending the best when I got to come up with my own take, and then see how other people thought about the events that happened in the game.I recommend this for those who enjoy coming up with scenarios or theories, but do not recommend it for those who want a set in stone story or who like closure for mysteries. This game starts as a mystery and definitely ends as one. The soundtrack and ambient noises of the game provide the sense of ""horror"" and sudden noises might give you jumps, but even for the most scared players this is at a level that is something that can be handled.

												Pretty cool game. I've played through it a couple of times to get different endings. There are entire things in the game that appear/disappear based on choices to even just pick things up or not. Very creepy atmosphere that translates to the player, the soundtrack has some sudden noises in it, a couple made me jump, which is hard to do, I play a lot of horror games.			"

												key points for tl;dr:-Not strictly a game, rather a narrative-simply picking something up changes the story-vague do-the-math plot-not scary at allHome is an odd one. First thing to look for is the stupids calling it a walking simulator or more likely not knowing what the word ""pretentious"" means. Now, the way the narrative works is a sort of unspoken agreement between the developer and yourself; the yes/no question/answers leading to the maker putting words for the plot changes into your mouth. Largely, this fits okay, butsuddenly ""realising"" it's all a dream was a little odd. The open interpretation AND the choice to change the plot allows for a strange and dynamic relationship between the two is ultimately a fairly unique feature if one that's a little bit subtle to mention. It's certainly not lacking a plot despite how much some may say. This is not a game to play as a speedblitz or one to play to win. It's closer to Gone Home than most exploration/adverture games. Maybe not even a game, but there's nothing wrong with that. It is cheap as chips and pixel games are lovely to play, especially when they're in this style.The ultimate issue would be a slightly meh ending and not being scary. The odd sound is a little jump-rousing and the atmosphere is rather dank and uncomfortable but it is not scary. But neither are 90% of supposed horror games. There's also the attempt to give it replay value but if you play it No Stone Unturned on the first playthrough then the exploration element is largely done with.Oh, and there's no Vsync. It bugs me, anyway. Hey, it's £2 and not bad. Certainly a good first effort. Give it a go.			"

												It's a fascinating take on narrative.  That's the most I'm going to say to avoid spoiling anything.  Suffice to say, if the storytelling aspect of games carries any interest to you, this game's worth a shot.The game is very brief; it even states that it is best experienced by setting aside an hour and a half to complete it in one sitting.  Consider that as a factor before you buy.  I also don't expect much replay value due to the narrative system used; in fact, multiple playthroughs would more than likely detract from the overall experience, not enhance it.If, however, you don't care to play it, I have an experimental playthrough below.  It _will_ spoil the game, however, so it is absolutely not recommended to view more than 5-10 minutes unless you plan on skipping the game.

												I read that the ending is based on your choices, but i didn't think the ending would literally be based on the choices i made at the end of the game.Example, if you picked up an empty soda can your character might ask, ""Wait, was i really the one that drank this?"" -and then the game lets you pick the answer and the story concludes with that notion.""Was i the killer?"" lol. Short, but too dynamic to make someone care. Skip.			"

												I found this game to be unsatisfying. I am completely for player choice in games and I can see what this game was trying to do, points for trying. But I felt I had no guidance to ensure a coherent narrative. By the end of the choice section, the story summary I received was nonsensical and ridiculous. Otherwise, I thought the game was okay. Good looking game, good sound, plays smoothly. The atmosphere started out creepy, but I quickly got accustomed and the game made no attempt to intensify things. For most of my playthrough I was bored and then I finished up as very confused. It's only about an hour long.			"

												I finished playing this game about an hour ago and I'm still not sure what to think, although I am still thinking about it, which must be a good sign. The gameplay is simple but absorbing and the use of sound makes it one of the most atmospheric 8-bit games ever. It's just the ending... There are obviously multiple endings dictated by your choices throughout the game, it's just that the ending I 'chose' wasn't very satisfying. Knowing what I know now I could play again and choose a different ending, but I don't feel compelled to right away. That being said I can definitely see myself picking it up again in a few weeks/months and giving it another go.Overall it was a fun but slightly anti-climactic 90 minutes, with the potential for multiple play-throughs.

												This title is an absolute joy. I played and completed this game back a couple years ago but just recently played and beat it again. It's a great story. It's not for those who don't like slow games or games where you just basically walk around and investigate. Choices don't seem to matter but I've only played through twice. This game is very short, about an hour and a half. At the begginning of the game it tells you it's best to have headphones on and an hour and a half of free time to finish it in one sitting to get the full effect. This I absolutely recommend doing. With this game a lot is left up the the imagination of the player which I love but many people who need hand holding or have never enjoyed a good cliffhanger in a book do not appreciate. It is a great game for what it is and it has psychological elements although very subtle. The story feels slow but in fact isn't. The game itself is 1 1/2 hours. Depending on how you play and if you're a completionist or have to explore everything the pacing is basically based on how you play. I enjoyed this title and highly recommend. I mean, come on, $3 bucks. It's great.			"

I enjoy this style of horror way more than anything FNAF or any other big-name jumpscare horror games bring. I'll give it a worthy 10/10. Solid spooky atmosphere in a place you don't know anything about and while the pacing of the game isn't very quick, its slowness complements the game's atmosphere perfectly.

												Home is a 2D Horror Game that proves you do not need realism in a horror game to have it be terrifying. You see, Home works on the same principle that many early horror movies did: Horror becomes more horrifying when you cannot see the threat. When it lingers around the outskirts of your vision, when you feel surrounded by darkness and evil, but it never actually steps in to harm you.This game is an example of atmosphere done right.Its controls are simple, its gameplay is easy to understand (if you're stuck, just go do everything that you can Interact with, that you haven't done yet) and there are branching story choices that for some people will dramatically change their interpretation of the game's ending.I warn you, this is some dark, dark stuff - especially as you near the game's conclusion. Home preys upon the pitch-blackness within your own imagination.Above all, its strengths are Atmosphere and a Staggered Breadcrumb plot. You will not find revolutionary gameplay here - this is a game whose gameplay serves its story and atmosphere, not the other way around. It is very cheap, and it should be experienced. You'll probably have a better time than with many more expensive games.Home is a bite-sized look at Atmospheric Horror that'll stay with you for a while; and you'll probably want to recommend it to your friends too - if only to hear their interpretations of the ending.

												""Home: A Unique Horror Story"", is a game that doesn't play off the standard definition of horror being something to scare you, but rather something to shock you. This is a game like no other game I've played before (keep in mind I don't play a lot of indie games) and I walked away from it pleased with the gaming expereince I had. I'm a gamer that loves rich stories, and while this is a short game, taking me only 2 hours to beat at a leisurely pace, it definitely succeeds in being a game with a story I won't forget. You're thrown into the story head first as you wake up at night in a strange house you don't remember entering, with a flashlight by your feet, and a throbbing pain in your head. You must find your way home, and as you do you discover more and more about your character and the life they live. What's really cool about this game is that the information you learn as you go along doesn't necessarily define the protaganist, but rather helps the player create an opinion of who they might be. Each player can interpret what is going on for themselves to create their own ideas of what is happening in the story and how it really ends, which I think is what makes this game really unique and fun. With classic pixelated graphics I feel this helps the gamer focus more on what's happening to them in their story rather then how the game looks, which I really liked. I did a full let's play of this game in only 4 episodes on my YouTube channel, so if you're unsure if this is the kinda game you wanna buy hop over to my videos here on Steam and give the first episode or two a look.

												Home is alright, but nothing spectacular by any means.  A mystery is afoot, and you have to decide which clues are relevant, and which ones are not.  Choosing which items you pick up (or don't) decides the fate of the story.  There are multiple possibilites of how the conclusion is drawn, and there are no good or bad specific endings.  There is no way to die in the game, which eliminates a lot of tension as far as making mistakes go.  The low quality graphics also encourage one to exercise their imagination a bit.  The sounds do raise the tension quite a bit, so I have to recommend head phones for full effect.  The length of the game (play through) is supposed to be about 90 minutes, but my first run was 75 minutes, even with my need to deeply explore.  All in all, this is a great ghost story for casual gamers, but the hard core crowd won't be very wowed by this one.			"

What is really neat about this game is that there is no True ending.  Based on your findings, YOU determine what happened in the story. There is more than one ending and there is no right or wrong ending.   You can also share yours and view what other folks interpretation of the story was.   Such an original game of its kind.

												About half of any good horror story will be a mystery.  The best of those stories let the reader infer what has happened behind closed door, instead of directly stating it.  Usually, around the time readers piece together the puzzle to solve the mystery, they start to realize the picture they're putting together is about something terrifying.  ""Home"" realizes this, and capitalizes on it in a superb way.  It must be noted that this game is not for everyone.  There is no action present on screen, and there aren't even any enemies to fight directly.  Some people may not even want to classify it as a game in the traditional sense.  In fact, they may be right.  Among other things, this is a story that is being told, and the player takes the role of one of the story tellers.  The best horror stories let the reader infer what the author meant, allowing the individual reader to fill in the gaps with things that unnerve them specifically.  ""Home"" takes the next step by letting the 'reader' decide how their own interpretation of the past events will shape the future of the story.I recommend this game to those who enjoy a good slow-burn creepy story.  However, if you're looking to romp around and blast heads off of zombies, then this game will not satisfy you.			"

												I felt it was less of a horror game and more of a mystery game. Your choices can affect how the game changes for you. In the end you're left to think about what happened in the game and depending on the choices you made your take on the game will be different than other people. I think I enjoyed the open ending the best when I got to come up with my own take, and then see how other people thought about the events that happened in the game.I recommend this for those who enjoy coming up with scenarios or theories, but do not recommend it for those who want a set in stone story or who like closure for mysteries. This game starts as a mystery and definitely ends as one. The soundtrack and ambient noises of the game provide the sense of ""horror"" and sudden noises might give you jumps, but even for the most scared players this is at a level that is something that can be handled.

												If you know what you're getting into (lo-fi psychological narrative experiment, with adventure/horror elements), then this is a gem for $3.00. Especially since you can play through it multiple ways to arrive at different endings. It's a little like a ""choose your own adventure"" book, although there's a unique twist: because of the character's amnesia and unreliable memories, a lot of the choices aren't about actions or decisions, they're really interpretations of an ambiguous scenario. This is actually rather original and brilliant. Also, pretty neat how such a seemingly ""simple"" game tracks many minor decisions and discoveries and item pick-ups throughout a playthrough, then in the finale asks how you want to interpret it all.The mixed reviews I feel are mostly due to one reason only: people don't like to feel confused. The plot, however you choose to progress/interpret it, is kind of convoluted, and you will probably feel confused at different points (its ok). Important thing is, the game is not nonsensical. It would've been nicer if at the end, once everything is being rehashed and tied up and re-interpreted, if there was just a little bit more detail or clues provided by the game (especially re: how that ""first man"" could possibly fit in), if it was a little less the player's responsibility to figure it all out. Hope that's a fair critique, because I do understand what the developer was going for.Once you beat it, check out: http://homehorror.com/whathappened/whathappened.php. Major ""spoilers.""PS: I think I overlooked another reason this great game got mixed reviews. It was/is misrepresented. The top tags for this game are Horror and Adventure, whereas it would be better tagged as Story-Rich, or Story-Driven, and as a type of Interactive Fiction. The developer himself acknowledged he was inspired by the Visual Novel genre. Yet he also wanted to create a great deal of ""hype"" and player investment in the game and its universe, so he really stressed the ""horror"" element. Not that there aren't some nice scares and plenty of general spookiness/dread/unease throughout. But it all boils down to this: this game isn't about ""horror"" and it isn't about ""adventure"" ... It may not even be a ""game,"" exactly - it's an experiment in narrative form, and it's about the fallability of memory, and fatally subjective interpretations of events. It all boils down to the final few questions where you're asked to decide what you/your protagonist believes went down. The ""boss"" in this ""game"" is basically your own mind/conscience, and, surprisingly, it can still kill you. 10/10 Would be confused/uncertain/delluded/quesy about my own actions again.			"

												You wake up in a strange room and find a few dead bodies. Bad thing is, you can't remember anything and the murderer could still be around. Well... not really... I think at this point it is clear that you are the murderer. But okay, let's pretend we don't know. You start waaaaaaalking from room to room just to discover more dead bodies and personal items of your own. A lot of personal items... It's like you walked through your house the night before, filled up a big bag of random stuff and spread it all around town afterwards. And now you've got to pick all the stuff back up. At the end your character is drawing some conclusions probably based on the stuff you've picked up ealier. And THAT IS ALL.1. Walk around.2. Pick up any random item. (Confirm the hell out of your Y-Botton)3. Get confronted with dead bodies and names you have never heard of.4. Repeat.Boring as hell. Almost at the end of the game, you are confronted with the first real riddle. It's a safe and you are literally getting no hints whatsoever how to unlock the damn thing. Frustrated, I looked the combination up on google and you know what? You really don't get any hint, it's just written into the game's manual. Btw it's 4R3UHER3My very first review.

												[WARNING] This review is basically a breakdown of my playthrough/experience of this game. Therefore, it's pretty lengthy and contains spoilers, but it's worth a read if you don't mind the amount of reading, I'm sure a good portion of people who have played this game already can relate to what's written below.After sitting untouched in my Steam Library for awhile, tonight I finally decided to give it a go. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but with lights out and headphones in, I booted the game up and began playing.As I wandered about the starting house, I already became pretty interested in the premise. Exploring your mysterious surroundings in search of clues in order to piece together a dark narrative brimming with secrecy and murder seemed right up my alley. I made sure to search every room, check things multiple times so I didn't miss a helpful piece of dialogue, and made sure I picked up anything I came across in case I needed it later. I couldn't wait to begin unraveling this story.Then, I left the house, and appropriately ended up in the sewers.From then on, the game started to fall apart for me. Once the character started dropping comments about the handgun and knife I picked up as I searched through the tunnels and sewers, it was pretty easy to figure out what was really going on. But I brushed those thoughts aside and pressed on hoping that something ahead would add a new piece to the puzzle that would make me completely rethink my theories up to this point.Then, after completing a few more areas, the tedium began to set in. I was disappointed with the lack of complexity, the only puzzles being turning a valve a few times until they opened or navigating a ""maze"" of pathways to find more clues. At this point the main character has already beaten the fact that everything seems oddly familiar over my head too many times for me to really question anything about the story anymore, which made me wonder why I was even bothering trying to find all of these different pieces of evidence. But there was one major problem I had that seemed to keep reoccurring throughout my playthrough:The game faltered between rewarding and punishing you for exploring. While some areas rewarded a little back-tracking with a new key item you found for some more narrative, others decided that your curiosity should cut you off from everything else. The biggest example of this was during my time in the old factory. After coming across a door with a card reader, I remembered a note in the first house cryptically mentioning a key card and locker, so I quickly searched the different floors until eventually I found the card. I hobbled back to the locked door, and opened it to find... a hole in the ground, which served as an exit. A little disappointed, I went to go see what switching on the power would do... but couldn't. The game had locked me in that room and forced me to leave. I felt rather cheated; I didn't see any reason why I shouldn't be allowed to go back.Yet I still played on, just hoping that I didn't miss out on anything important.And after picking through the shop, I finally arrived home. This was it. It was the moment I had been waiting for, the big reveal of this tragedy. I pretty much knew what was going to happen at this point, but a bit of intrigue sprung back up from the interest of seeing how all of my previous choices and the discoveries I made would impact the ending. It was a rocky trip to get here, but I was here now. I scavenged the entire house, picked up that crowbar and ran down to the basement, ripped down that wall and carefully approached the pile of rags. The main character was quite nervous now, bracing himself for the horror he was about to witness... but then, something unexpected happened.He asked me if Rachel was in there or not, with a simple Yes/No response.Well... I don't know game, you tell me. Did the game really just blatantly ask me to choose what happens? I didn't really know how to respond. I decided to spare him the shock and chose 'No', to which he passed out from confusion. Once he gets up, I notice a bunch of the items I came across on my journey here are now scattered about the house. I go to examine the objects... each one asking if a certain event happened or not. With each one I examined, I couldn't believe it. After all of that, I was basically choosing what actually happened. I left the house, he rambles on about the decisions I made a minute ago... and the mysteries that were never solved? He basically shrugs them off, then rolls the credits. I sat there watching for a few minutes before I closed out completely.Now, I get that I could play through the game again to get the full story. There were probably a few things that I was missing that might have revealed something more substantial to me. But after beating the game, all replay value plummeted to zero. The fact that every decision you make during the course of the game is basically meaningless once you get to the end and basically write the ending yourself makes the whole process seem pointless. It just feels like lazy writing to build up a narrative for the entirity of the game, only to pass the reins to the player and have them create the conclusion instead without much closure. The fact that replaying a game that only took me a little over an hour to complete seemed like way too much trouble and tedium speaks for itself.All in all, this is a game that shows a lot of promise, but falls flat on its face and delivers only a tiny fragment of what it could have been. I'm sure a lot of you have already purchased this game from a sale like I had. In that case, you might want to leave it sitting in your Library in purgatory like it probably already has been. If not, then I'd say you're probably better jamming those dollar bills into a vending machine for a snack or a drink rather than dropping them on this game.It'll take a little less time to get through it, but like this game you'll only use it once before tossing it aside.And at least it'll be satisfying from start to finish.

												Home is a game meant to be played in one sitting. It takes around an hour to complete (longer if you enjoy exploring every nook and cranny). That being said I think it does a wonderful job of keeping the player intrigued and involved throughout the entire game. The story paired with the retro graphics keeps the player on the edge of their seat, and thus makes the game that much more enjoyable. If you are looking for a way to spend about an hour and you enjoy suspensful stories, then I'd certainly recommend Home as it is worth the price.			"

												If you are wanting a horror game with many scares, this probably isn't the one for you. There were about two parts, that I experienced, where I jumped a little, but that isn't what matters. This game is great at providing a terrifying atmosphere, and keeping you on edge at all times. The storyline is cool, and includes a lot of dialogue. There are also multiple endings. If you love games with atmosphere and suspense, I would recommend ""Home"" to you.(Spoiler... kinda) The game really makes you feel like something terrifying is about to happen and attack you, but from how I played through it, nothing did really. But I still love the way it did that, because it made me uncomfortable, at times.			"

												Home is an atmospheric adventure game with a concept clever enough that it makes up for a derivative setting and plot (or, more accurately, possible plot): you make the decisions about what actually happened before the game begins.  It's a safe bet that Benjamin Rivers is a fan of psychological horror games like the Silent Hill series and films such as The Machinist, and players familiar with such material will find nothing to surprise them. But the somewhat unique freedom that Home grants players to determine the story's details makes at least one playthrough worthwhile, especially considering the quality of the game's script and the low price.

I give an A for effort and an idea that had alot of potential but how it was delivered honestly kindof bored me.play this only if you have played every other worthwhile game on steam and absolutely must have something new to do for the next 1-2 hours, otherwise, move along.

												I had bought this game in a bundle awhile back, and have finally gotten around to playing it.This game isn't entirely deserving of all the negative reviews that it has received, although this game does have its downfalls.Judging from the in-game instructions, this was made for the XBOX controller, and does work well with it, except during dialogue. The dialogue advancement is broken. It requires you to press down, and sometimes it will advance right away, while other times there is a long pause before it will recognize the down key. This can be bypassed by pressing the down key on the keyboard, but jumping back and forth from controller to keyboard breaks the immersion a good bit.This game is also fairly linear with simple puzzles - if you can call them puzzles - that consist of no more than ""flip all switches in building to open locked door."" Or in one case you flip all valves to drain some water in order to advance. The game instead focuses more on finding objects that tell more of an implied story, as the character tries to piece together what's happened and why he's where he is in the situation that he is in. It actually has a very Silent Hill feel to it, although, aside from a few dead bodies, you'll never encounter another person to talk to. And with its linearity, it only took me exactly an hour to have explored every single room in one play through.The story gives no definitive answers either, and at the end encourages you to visit the developer's website where you can write about your own theory of ""what happened"" - or rather, ""who dunnit."" This is a murder mystery, and it is a nice touch that the developer tried to include the player in the storytelling process, but if you're a seasoned horror fan like myself, you'll probably figure out ""exactly"" what's going on half way through - and on the website, it seems almost all the other players came to the same conclusions.Graphically and aurally, I really enjoyed this game. Kind of reminded me of an amalgamation of some old Commodore games I used to play, if they'd had a much wider color pallete. The use of the low contrast black with the digital grain was nice too; it gives the game that ""camcorder"" look. I was amazed to see how many people worked on this game, as nowadays games of this caliber tend to be made by much smaller teams, however it is apparent that  a lot of work went in to the backgrounds and sound production, so it's not too hard to see where all that manpower went.Overall, aside from the dialogue box problems, this game can be an enjoyable hour long diversion. However, $2.99 may be too steep for most wallets, considering other games available at this price point, so I'd recommend waiting for a sale. But $2.99 isn't an outrageous price though, although it does seem a little high ( .99 to $1.99 would be more like it!)			"

												In terms of gameplay and player interaction, this game is quite minimal. This is most certainly an interactive story, and you should take the advice of waiting til dark, shutting off the lights, and playing for a little over an hour, just to beat it. It adds a lot to do it in one sitting. For the three dollar asking price, I most certainly recommend Home.			"

												Very cool game with an interesting changing storyline.  It's basically a choose your own adventure book with game like visuals, and I'm usually not into these kinds of games, but this one kept me interested.  For the price it's worth spending and hour on and then checking your ending with all the other endings online.  Still, it's worth the price of admission.  Check it out, preferablly on Halloween.			"

												An attempt at bringing horror and suspense but ultimately falls flat due to being not very interesting. A great pity, the format had potential but it is not fufilled and lacks variation or interesting things to do. More akin to a story than an actual game and no  real choices that lead anywhere interesting. Too short and not that interesting to play.			"

I didn't, at least not until this creepy little game.I did as told -- set aside a little over an hour, plugged in the old headphones (pretty adequate soundtrack I must say) and turned off the lights.

												This is the sort of game that wants you to wear head phones and play in the dark. Yet after about half an hour I was no longer scared, just bored.Now, I like games with stories and so I really want to like this game but the plot is just... [SPOILERS AHEAD. SPOILERS!]I appreciated that you get to kind of pick your ending, in the way that I appreciate it almost any time a game gives me a decision, but since it wasn't as free roaming as I would have liked (I can't solve a mystery until I realize there is a mystery game) and the fact that I was continually nudged along, the huge plot twist being up to me made the game feel... pointless?Like, if I wanted to write another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ psychological horror about an insane alcoholic I could have done this myself.I think the game would have been vastly more interesting to me if it weren't just another white man with problems who is trying to rescue a woman (plot twist being either that he killed her or she was made up in his head wooo boy wow such twist much psychological). It's a stupid cheap game, so I guess I recommend it if you really like stories about white men gaining agency. But otherwise, even at this price? You can pass.			"

												This is one of those indie retro-horror games -- steam is full of them. This is definitely a game. Basically has decent atmosphere for what it is and takes about 1 hour to win... if you define winning as ""What the hell just happened?"" I played through twice, and the game's charm is that it records everything you choose and spells out a (ideally) different chilling outcome based on those choices. In one playthrough I thought my wife was cheating on me, but it turns out I never had a wife -- I was crazy. In my second playthrough a murderer killed my wife and coworker, but I never found out who it was. Neither ending was very satisfying. I wish I could give this a better review because I love raising awareness of good indies... but really, not much to say.			"

												It's a fascinating take on narrative.  That's the most I'm going to say to avoid spoiling anything.  Suffice to say, if the storytelling aspect of games carries any interest to you, this game's worth a shot.The game is very brief; it even states that it is best experienced by setting aside an hour and a half to complete it in one sitting.  Consider that as a factor before you buy.  I also don't expect much replay value due to the narrative system used; in fact, multiple playthroughs would more than likely detract from the overall experience, not enhance it.If, however, you don't care to play it, I have an experimental playthrough below.  It _will_ spoil the game, however, so it is absolutely not recommended to view more than 5-10 minutes unless you plan on skipping the game.

												This feels like the first draft of a good idea. There's a good core concept here, but it hasn't been polished enough to really feel finished. As a result the gameplay doesn't really create an effective story or experience of choice as the writing and mechanics haven't been adjusted and redone to fit each other. Instead the sequence of choices and the end result of your particular ending feel nonsensical and very disconnected. The game also needs an effective sense of rythm as well as a more concrete narrative framework of rising actions, climax, and resolution. As it is now it feels unfinished, clumsy, and thrown together but with a good idea beneath that. I feel the developer might be able to make something really interesting with more experience and time devoted to their next project.			"

												This game was okay, but by no means perfect. I think it definitely justifies its price tag, but I wouldn't buy it again given the choice. THe game plays out like sidescrolling text adventure, to be honest. There's a lack of any type of puzzle, and the focus is on the story. Which was probably a good decision because the story is... decent? It wasn't mind blowing, but it worked for what the game was. I'll admit Home had me backing away from my computer (in fear) a few times, but there weren't any huge scares. The biggest scares came from jump scares in the background, cheap grabs done to make you jump. All in all, this game was an okay playthrough, but I doub't I'll ever touch it again. 5/10.			"

												This is a little Indie game that is only so-so in my opinion.  There's definitely an atmosphere here with a decent story but even at almost 2 hours of gameplay (1 hour is you're just blowing by) it does get tedious towards the end.  If you've seen the description, you definitely know what the graphics will look like so I won't even get into that.  This game actually asks more questions than it answers.  I still don't know what happened.  The game did crash for me on my first playthrough which made it a bummer to have to start all over again.  Not sure that the different choices made actually made much of a difference in the end (some things were different, but nothing substantial).  I would give this game a 4/10. "

It's just an interactive storybook - which, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing, but there's barely a story here and what little there is is never really fleshed out. The ending changes slightly depending on your actions, but you never get any real explanation or even real closure about what happened.			"

												Home is an atmospheric adventure game with a concept clever enough that it makes up for a derivative setting and plot (or, more accurately, possible plot): you make the decisions about what actually happened before the game begins.  It's a safe bet that Benjamin Rivers is a fan of psychological horror games like the Silent Hill series and films such as The Machinist, and players familiar with such material will find nothing to surprise them. But the somewhat unique freedom that Home grants players to determine the story's details makes at least one playthrough worthwhile, especially considering the quality of the game's script and the low price.

I turned off all the lights, put on my headphones and set aside and hour and a half to enjoy what would be a spooky, artistic adventure.  In turn what I got was an interactive story without scares or resolution.  Typically I'm fine with having the gameplay take the backseat to a good story, but this game was just so boring and all the plot points were purposfully ambiguous.In the end, what should amount to an intruiging little ""who done it"" fell flat on it's face when the game actually asks you ""so what do you think happened?"".This is not good storytelling.

And this game ACTUALLY MAKES YOU THINK and no not with horrifyingly easy puzzles but with what is happening in the story as you progress. The story is good but its something you have to put together as you go the game is not going to set you on one path of story and tell you everything thats going on. So yes I did really enjoy this game. I found very little wrong with it. The only thing I possibly could have asked would be to make it a bit less of a run around and grab♥♥♥♥♥♥sort of deal in some spots but other than that very fun and definitely worth going and buying.

It's up to you how he remembers his life, what happened, why and how and what he did or not did and how it ends altogether when he finally reaches his home . . .Great suggestive atmosphere and a story that has an ending depending on the the choices/actions you made.

												A very spooky adventure game. Don't let the graphics bring you down. The sound in the game gave me some jumps here and there, and the story had me guessing and kept pushing me forward. Multiple endings depending on your choices. Great game for the price. Though i wouldn't call it HORROR. More a story driven, spooky adventure. "

												A newage Film Noire title inside of a low res minimalistic visual. With text based story telling and many choices throughout the story, you can alter and change the final outcome of what takes place. A false sense of danger is constant, but it never arrives. Everyone should give this game a shot on a late night when it's raining.			"

												This game is truely unique and you should follow all the recommendations that come at the begining of the game when opened. However, this game its much more of an interactive choose your own story. There are a series of yes or no questions that will change the outcome of the game, causing a different story each time through. The ending I got on my first run through was quite the twist and I'm still trying to truely understand everything that happened. While I don't want to give away what type of horror game it is, all I will say is that the ambiance in the game is truely amazing and the pixel art platformer is a very unique take on this genre. I snagged this game for 98 cents on a sale and that seems well worth the money.			"

												I liked the game telling you about what you missed at the end of each section because it means you can play it again and have a clue of what you're looking for to make a change. Unfortunately that's the only thing I liked and have no intention of coming back to it.It describes itself as a horror game but the only horror comes from the occasional incredibly loud sound effect, knowing you'll have your volume way up because the rest of the game is super quiet. And the gameplay is too shallow to really make up for it. The camera is zoomed incredibly close to your character so you can't see more than 10ft ahead of you, every room of the game is as dark as the last, and you walk so slowly that even when you can unlock a previously locked door its hard to justify taking the time to go check it out. The worst part is that for such a simple game the controls are pretty bad. Using the keyboard you have to use wasd for movement, space to enter doors, up to raise your torch, down to scroll text, and Y/N whenever you find a new item. It would be so much more convenient if the button to raise your torch (nearly useless) could be used to enter doors and if you could hit left or right to pick an option. The mouse controls are a little better but not much because you're constantly accidentally raising your torch which roots you in place.			"

												I liked the atmosphere of the game and what it was trying to accomplish.  However, the gameplay itself was far too slow.  The graphics/music weren't good enough to hold my attention through a lot of very slow walking. You can tell the team put a ton of work into nailing the look they were going for, but I wish that more attention had been paid to making the gameplay actually fun- or at least quicker.  I was very interested in the story though. Good one to watch a stream of.			"

For it's cheap price, there is a lot the game does right in terms of atmosphere and it's experimental take on narrative. This game doesnt deliever on scares, and neither does it want to, for the hours duration, you are sucked into the dread of situation suprisingly easily (even better if your wearing headphones in the dark). As a great way to spend an hour for a couple of quid, I recomend it, esspecially as the discussion about the games narrative begins at the games end.PROS:Great SFXExperimental narrative hits the markThe story is your own, encourages discussion.CONS:Slightly predicatable towards the end.

												Kind of interesting story-thriller. I bought this 1. Because it was on sale and 2. Because it was billed as a retro styled horror game. The sale was good because if I paid any more for the game I'd probably be pretty upset. I completed one playthrough, it took less than an hour. Calling this game a horror game is a big stretch. You play a guy with a flashlight and interact with nothing but inanimate objects the entire game, making simple choices, pick this up? read this? turn this on? It's story driven. You do a lot of reading but it's not a lot of tedious reading, a couple sentences at a time. The good news is your choices effect the final outcome of the game. The bad news is, it  wasn't nearly interesting enough for me to play through again any time soon, maybe at a later date.			"

												Going onto this game, I expected jumpscares and cheap thrills. I have recieved quite the opposite. Home is a game that doesnt rely on loud noises and pop-ups. It uses subtlety and emotions to make you feel uncomfortable the whole way through. The whole playthrough I felt off and as if something was going to happen at any moment. The suspense was killing me and I feel that it worked greatly. The game delves into psychology and picks away at your defenses slowly until you aren't sure what's going to happen anymore.I understand that a lot of people don't like this game and have given it terrible reviews. However I insist that you consider playing it for the above reasons.			"

												The art alone is worth more than the price tag, it has great ambiance especially for a pixel game. The story is well paced, even if you're like me and have to stop and poke every single thing. Admittedly, it is pretty easy to trip over - miss one crucial clue, and you've lost a good chunk of the storyline - but I thought the meta-conversation was very interesting. After trying so hard to immerse you in being the main character, it's an interesting tactic for the game to suggest that maybe you never were.			"

												It was okay. Maybe I just didn't make the right choices, but I didn't find this game particularly fun — I got pretty bored, to be honest. Nor did I find the ending satisfying, interesting, or impactful.I also didn't appreciate how they executed the choices that determine the details of the ending. Asking the player what to have the player character do is one thing. Asking the player what the results of those actions were, or what someone else did — which is what it started doing near the end — is something else entirely.There are many doorways and branching paths, so I got lost a lot, which wouldn't have been so bad if I'd been given the freedom to explore fully. But sometimes I would go through a certain door only to be told that I couldn't go back, or that the character didn't want to go back. That would have been nice to know before I went there, that way I could have gone back and explored the rest of the area. I understand that a story where your choices determine the ending is one where you will have to forego one path in order to take another, but I would have appreciated some warning before the game made those decisions for me. Otherwise I'm not really the one choosing what happens.The game did not make it clear when my actions had been effective. An example: Turning a valve. If it needed to be turned again, I'd expect the character to state this out loud, without my needing to examine the valve again. I don't think I've ever played a game where this wasn't the case. But in fact, it wasn't until I went where I was trying to make the water level descend and saw that it hadn't worked, then went back and examined the valve again, that the character told me that there was still water running through the pipe.Lastly, as I approached the end, the game made sure to make me regret my choices by bringing up things I could have done but didn't. It felt like the game was giving me the finger for not doing ""the right thing"", which feels unfair when the point of the game is creating your own journey. What's worse is that one of those things that I didn't do, was not because I didn't want to do it, but because I didn't realize at the time that I could do it. The game didn't make it particularly clear at the time that it was something I could do there, and I had been under the impression I had to find another place to do it. Nope, apparently not, and by the time I discovered this it was too late.But, I won't say you shouldn't play it. It's only $2.99, it's a nice time-waster whenever you have an hour or two to spare, you might like it better than I did, and I'm sure it might be fun to play it several times and see what other kinds of endings and details you can get. But I personally don't have much interest in doing so.P.S. The only technical gripes: 1) The cursor didn't disappear the entire time I was playing, which got pretty annoying. 2) The game doesn't tell you at the beginning that you quit by pressing Q. Esc did not work, so I had to use Cmd+Q. I thought this must be a bug, until I finished the game and it told me to quit by pressing Q. I guess I should have thought to try that, but the game also should have told me at the beginning. Not to mention they might want to consider having Esc also quit the game.			"

												Despite how much Home markets itself as a horror game, it really isn't. Home is better described as a murder mystery adventure with a psychological thriller bent. Outside of the eery atmosphere and fake shocks sprinkled throughout, there isn't really much in the way of actual horror. Actually there isn't much in the way of actual Adventure gameplay either, most puzzles are easily solved by just looking through the environments for items to pick up while the game takes care of everything else. However, this isn't the point of Home. Home's selling point is that each playthrough (clocking in around 90 minutes) is different than the last, inviting players to play multiple times to dig into the mysterious narrative. At its best Home is an intriguing experiment in the flexibility of interactive fiction, but it outright denies investing players with actual gameplay. Home isn't a failed experiment by any means, it's worth a look for those interested in gaming as a means of storytelling, but those looking for skin-crawling horror or puzzling adventures need look elsewhere.

There are a lot of different choices to make which lead to different endings which results in quite some replayability. One Playthrough takes approximately one and a half hour as stated in the intro scene. 8/10			"

												This is one of those indie retro-horror games -- steam is full of them. This is definitely a game. Basically has decent atmosphere for what it is and takes about 1 hour to win... if you define winning as ""What the hell just happened?"" I played through twice, and the game's charm is that it records everything you choose and spells out a (ideally) different chilling outcome based on those choices. In one playthrough I thought my wife was cheating on me, but it turns out I never had a wife -- I was crazy. In my second playthrough a murderer killed my wife and coworker, but I never found out who it was. Neither ending was very satisfying. I wish I could give this a better review because I love raising awareness of good indies... but really, not much to say.			"

												Not a bad game. It was a great concept with less than satisfying execution. This is a horror game that is designed with some very good elements of level design, music, art style, and atmosphere.However, the game at it's core is just a simplified point-and-click adventure.**SPOILERS**There is no true element of danger in any of part of the game. The only thing that possibly serves to hinder your progress are one-way doors that progress you through chapters(for lack of a better term). There are many optional clues to be found which keeps the player engaged and motivated to search everywhere. However, the ultimate downfall of the game is that NONE OF IT REALLY MATTERS. The ending of the game literally asks you to determine what happens at the end. Depending on your choices, the game retcons details and clues and the layout of your house in order to conform (mostly) to the conclusion you draw. But inconsistencies still exist, and no matter what permutation of choices you make, it still doesn't deliver a compelling or conclusive story. This game would be salvageable if the clues you found determined the ending rather than asking you to do it. It's an interesting experiment in storytelling to involve the reader in choosing the story path rather than the actions that should determine the story path... but in my opinion it is extremely unsatisfying. Please abandon this line of thinking and tell a story through the actions of the character you're attaching the player to rather than asking the player directly for input.			"

												This game is very unoriginal and feels like a rehash of Silent Hill 2.  The pixelized graphics are not an appealing style in this game's case - they only distract.  The writing is appalling.  ""I could almost feel the notebook in my shirt pocket as I thought of if the names could have any meaning.""  Encore, Shakespeare.  The same sentence could have been written ""I wondered if the names in the notebook in my shirt pocket could have any meaning.""  The past tense is broken, and sometimes ""almost"" broken, fairly frequently, as if the ""storytelling"" style was forced for no compelling reason.  Finally - black cats, murder, scary noises, glowing eyes in the dark (that serve no purpose and make the game feel like a haunted house attraction), oh and asinine writings on the wall - is that all you got?  I was expecting more - but this game for all its flaws is not even scary.			"

												This game was okay, but by no means perfect. I think it definitely justifies its price tag, but I wouldn't buy it again given the choice. THe game plays out like sidescrolling text adventure, to be honest. There's a lack of any type of puzzle, and the focus is on the story. Which was probably a good decision because the story is... decent? It wasn't mind blowing, but it worked for what the game was. I'll admit Home had me backing away from my computer (in fear) a few times, but there weren't any huge scares. The biggest scares came from jump scares in the background, cheap grabs done to make you jump. All in all, this game was an okay playthrough, but I doub't I'll ever touch it again. 5/10.			"

												This shouldn't be called horror, and that's its biggest mistake, if you ask me. For many, I suspect, horror involves more explicit terrifying elements than corpses and the shifting sounds of buildings. In this respect, this game is far more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror game. Perhaps, it might be said, this is one of the very few thriller titles to be found in games, since it makes the decision to exclude both combat and any direct enemy confrontations. As other reviews indicate, despite mentioning that you choose the ending, the absence of any indication of whether you truly confront the cause of all the events led them to disappointment.However, while I can understand this perspective, I think that the game stands up well enough on its own, with the interesting use of interaction with objects influencing the narrative, to get by with this. In fact, the very real recognition of your presence at certain points makes this an especially interesting title to me, whereas for others it seemed a copout. It wasn't the most graceful integration of the player's involvement, admittedly, but it was closer in tune to what I had hoped Deadly Premonition would do, if familiar with that title. Either way, for as cheap and short as it is, and for what seems to me very decent quality (sound design/writing/artistically), I'd say this title is a steal if you're interested in games that experiment with interactive narratives.

												""Home: A Unique Horror Story"", is a game that doesn't play off the standard definition of horror being something to scare you, but rather something to shock you. This is a game like no other game I've played before (keep in mind I don't play a lot of indie games) and I walked away from it pleased with the gaming expereince I had. I'm a gamer that loves rich stories, and while this is a short game, taking me only 2 hours to beat at a leisurely pace, it definitely succeeds in being a game with a story I won't forget. You're thrown into the story head first as you wake up at night in a strange house you don't remember entering, with a flashlight by your feet, and a throbbing pain in your head. You must find your way home, and as you do you discover more and more about your character and the life they live. What's really cool about this game is that the information you learn as you go along doesn't necessarily define the protaganist, but rather helps the player create an opinion of who they might be. Each player can interpret what is going on for themselves to create their own ideas of what is happening in the story and how it really ends, which I think is what makes this game really unique and fun. With classic pixelated graphics I feel this helps the gamer focus more on what's happening to them in their story rather then how the game looks, which I really liked. I did a full let's play of this game in only 4 episodes on my YouTube channel, so if you're unsure if this is the kinda game you wanna buy hop over to my videos here on Steam and give the first episode or two a look.

												Home is a 2D Horror Game that proves you do not need realism in a horror game to have it be terrifying. You see, Home works on the same principle that many early horror movies did: Horror becomes more horrifying when you cannot see the threat. When it lingers around the outskirts of your vision, when you feel surrounded by darkness and evil, but it never actually steps in to harm you.This game is an example of atmosphere done right.Its controls are simple, its gameplay is easy to understand (if you're stuck, just go do everything that you can Interact with, that you haven't done yet) and there are branching story choices that for some people will dramatically change their interpretation of the game's ending.I warn you, this is some dark, dark stuff - especially as you near the game's conclusion. Home preys upon the pitch-blackness within your own imagination.Above all, its strengths are Atmosphere and a Staggered Breadcrumb plot. You will not find revolutionary gameplay here - this is a game whose gameplay serves its story and atmosphere, not the other way around. It is very cheap, and it should be experienced. You'll probably have a better time than with many more expensive games.Home is a bite-sized look at Atmospheric Horror that'll stay with you for a while; and you'll probably want to recommend it to your friends too - if only to hear their interpretations of the ending.

												Home is what Dear Ester should have been, a dynamic narrative that can subtly change for each player. Unlike Dear Ester, Home is engaging. The closer you get to the end, the more tension builds in the game and in your own head, and your experience comes closer to mirroring that of the character you play. In Home, atmosphere is the star and it gets so thick you can cut it with a knife. It's one of the few horror games that really filled me with a sense of dread and unease as I moved cloister to the end. I had two issues, you can't save and one flawed puzzle at the end. The game is an hour or so long so I had to abandon my first attempt at about 30min in. One of the final puzzles requires an alt+tab out of the game to play an ARG or just google the answer, breaking the experience either way. Overall an excellent experience, double so given the low price of admission. Also, the developer seems cool, he answered my question about a mac version on twitter :P			"

It's only $3 and if you get it on-sale, that's not bad at all. the game is only about an hour or so long, but you can replay it and try to get different endings. So if you're into odd point-and-click horror games I would say give it a go.			"

												I don't generally enjoy horror games, but I enjoy this one. It's one of the psychological horror games that lets you imagine your own horror rathan than showing you monsters or gore or trying to get you to jump. It's good stuff.			"

												+ An atmosphere fit for a mystery-suspense game -- unsettling background music, dark tones, strange sounds, etc+ No cheap scares + Multiple endings+ Short (had it been any longer, I'm sure my opinion would be more negative)- Incredibly vague story; too much is ""left to the imagination""- Having a few endings does not make up for them all being dull- The game doesn't fit the horror genre -- there is nothing scary, just a bit tense- The gameplay consists of running back and forth (especially toward the end) and a couple ""puzzles"" -- easily boringIf you want a good scare, I do not recommend Home. If you want an intriguing, intricate story, I do not recommend Home. This game is one to be borrowed, not owned.			"

												I bought this game quite a while ago. For some reason that I can't remember, I stopped playing the game after ten minutes. I picked the game back up, many moths later, and am wondering why I didn't finish the game sooner. I found myself pulled into the world of the game. The graphics went really well with how the game was executed. Anyhoo, I found myself to be tense and on edge for most of the game. There was definitely a creepy scary vibe to everything. Not everyone will like this type of game though. If you don't like games or movies that leaves the story to your interpretation, then this game isn't for you. I personally love when games do this, it is a breathe of fresh air. The game is short and worth the money, from my experience. When you get to the end, you can follow a link where you share your story and see what other people think happened. It is really interesting to read the different ininterpretations of what happened.			"

While 'horror' is hard to pull off in an animated, silent film, pixel, side scroller(... say that a few times); the game does try, and a couple times I really enjoyed the experience. It's the type of game where you need to REALLY get your head into it. If you can do that, then the game should be a good choice for you!			"

												The art alone is worth more than the price tag, it has great ambiance especially for a pixel game. The story is well paced, even if you're like me and have to stop and poke every single thing. Admittedly, it is pretty easy to trip over - miss one crucial clue, and you've lost a good chunk of the storyline - but I thought the meta-conversation was very interesting. After trying so hard to immerse you in being the main character, it's an interesting tactic for the game to suggest that maybe you never were.			"

												I liked the game telling you about what you missed at the end of each section because it means you can play it again and have a clue of what you're looking for to make a change. Unfortunately that's the only thing I liked and have no intention of coming back to it.It describes itself as a horror game but the only horror comes from the occasional incredibly loud sound effect, knowing you'll have your volume way up because the rest of the game is super quiet. And the gameplay is too shallow to really make up for it. The camera is zoomed incredibly close to your character so you can't see more than 10ft ahead of you, every room of the game is as dark as the last, and you walk so slowly that even when you can unlock a previously locked door its hard to justify taking the time to go check it out. The worst part is that for such a simple game the controls are pretty bad. Using the keyboard you have to use wasd for movement, space to enter doors, up to raise your torch, down to scroll text, and Y/N whenever you find a new item. It would be so much more convenient if the button to raise your torch (nearly useless) could be used to enter doors and if you could hit left or right to pick an option. The mouse controls are a little better but not much because you're constantly accidentally raising your torch which roots you in place.			"

												A good point and click game and with what I feel as a semi-choice dependant game. The description of what ""you decide"" changing the outcome of the game makes it sound like all your little choices make huge differences. They don't. However, depending on what you choose to see/pick up/to do does effect the ending slightly, which is pretty neat. I did like that your choices effected what your character thought of what happened. The game is really short (I fall into the habit of leaving my game running, so ignore my total hours played). I'd say about 2-3 hours tops to get all the achievements. This isn't really a horror game so much as suspense. So, don't expect to be getting scared while playing this game. I'd say the $2.99 is a reasonable price for this game, but if you have other games you'd rather play, I'd wait until this one goes on sale to snag it.			"

												I liked the atmosphere of the game and what it was trying to accomplish.  However, the gameplay itself was far too slow.  The graphics/music weren't good enough to hold my attention through a lot of very slow walking. You can tell the team put a ton of work into nailing the look they were going for, but I wish that more attention had been paid to making the gameplay actually fun- or at least quicker.

I'm gonna give Home a high rating because this kind of game, even though brief and with only 5 bottons, shows us that games can be more than just long-winded first-person-shooters with over-the-top graphics. Home pulls at the heart strings in a simple and creative way, using only 8 bit graphics and good-old-fashioned who-done-it storytelling - 9 out of 10.			"

												Respecting Your IntellectIs this game great? I'd answer that with, it's what you make of it. Most have played games that have multiple endings, and this one tries to have a story-line that jumps from the screen to your mind.What would be a short description of Home?A game that respects your intellect developed by an independent creator, that is a BIT weird and creepy, ahem, not the creator, the game. It shows creativity and atmosphere, but I'm not willing to play it multiple times; I take the ending I get with the choices I would've made had it been real life.If you lack an imaginative mind, which many games cater to these days, you will find the storyline isn't that deep. You NEED to use your imagination to fill the gaps. Games that are so dark you need to squint your eyes to make things out do not appeal to me. Short sequences yes; but the whole game no. If you take the advice on the opening screens, you will find the game is somewhat hard on the eyes.Nice sound effects and concept, but at the end I wasn't sure if I had finished the game. To put it mildly, throughout the entire game I was left wondering what it was all about.New things are good, and this game is GOOD. However, it needs bigger doses of strangeness, interaction with consequences, scary moments, and a decent voiceover (instead of all the text).If you're looking for a game with a big story you will be disappointed. If you're expecting a horror game you'll be horribly deluded. At first there's some fear but after 10 minutes the dial goes to zero. At the end I felt it was a game just to get me onto the designer's website. So although it is a nugget you'd be pleased to find, as you examine it closely you'll find it's not pure gold; at least not as pure as it could be.			"

												To be honest i don't think i should waste my time by reccomending this but to help other people buying this game i have two words , don't buy. i got this on sale at 60p and even at a price like that i regret it , the horrible storyline , and terrible graphics with many other things wrong all add together to make you want to kick your moniter, burn your harddrive and forever hate indie games , but this is an exception most indie games are awsome so dont think im insulting all indie game because i love them , its just this one; if you want to think about buying after all i said i guess i can't change what you want to do but just watch some gamplay on youtube before buying and make your own choice. 2/10 ( the only reason i havn't voted 1 is because the game producer who made this has skill; that just needs to be put in another project).

												Home reminds me of the games I played on my uncle's computer as a kid back in the 80s and that isn't a bad thing. Back before games became all about high poly counts and over the top action, there was an elegance in their simplicity. Obviously this wasn't always the case. There were plenty of terrible games back then as well but there was something about the style of video games back then that made for a memorable experience. Much like a good mystery novel leaves you with more questions than answers and doesn't give away the entire story, the video games of my childhood were entertaining during play but often left you with plenty of things to ponder long afterward. You'd wonder about that one-off robot with one line of dialogue and where he came from. You'd lay awake in your bed trying to figure out if there were more secrets hidden in that dark cave you just finished passing through. Home feels like an homage to that era of gaming... an era where one's imagination was as much a part of the experience as the production itself.I'm not surprised to see a fair number of people giving Home negative reviews but I hope the developer doesn't take them to heart. I've read several of these negative critiques and to be perfectly honest the bulk of them simply have no appreciation for games that aren't multi-million dollar titles produced by teams numbering in the hundreds. These are the same folks who can't appreciate most indie films because they don't know how to process a movie that doesn't spoon feed them the plot between explosions. I don't fault them for it. They simply don't know any better. I tip my hat to you Benjamin Rivers. Well done. What we have here is a unique piece of retro-styled choose-your-own-adventure story telling and it is beautiful in its simplicity and originality.			"

However, this game its much more of an interactive choose your own story. There are a series of yes or no questions that will change the outcome of the game, causing a different story each time through. The ending I got on my first run through was quite the twist and I'm still trying to truely understand everything that happened. While I don't want to give away what type of horror game it is, all I will say is that the ambiance in the game is truely amazing and the pixel art platformer is a very unique take on this genre.

The writing is appalling.  ""I could almost feel the notebook in my shirt pocket as I thought of if the names could have any meaning.""  Encore, Shakespeare.  The same sentence could have been written ""I wondered if the names in the notebook in my shirt pocket could have any meaning.""  The past tense is broken, and sometimes ""almost"" broken, fairly frequently, as if the ""storytelling"" style was forced for no compelling reason.  Finally - black cats, murder, scary noises, glowing eyes in the dark (that serve no purpose and make the game feel like a haunted house attraction), oh and asinine writings on the wall - is that all you got?  I was expecting more - but this game for all its flaws is not even scary.			"

												This is a little Indie game that is only so-so in my opinion.  There's definitely an atmosphere here with a decent story but even at almost 2 hours of gameplay (1 hour is you're just blowing by) it does get tedious towards the end.  If you've seen the description, you definitely know what the graphics will look like so I won't even get into that.  This game actually asks more questions than it answers.  I still don't know what happened.  The game did crash for me on my first playthrough which made it a bummer to have to start all over again.  Not sure that the different choices made actually made much of a difference in the end (some things were different, but nothing substantial).  I would give this game a 4/10. "

												A kreepy, brooding, eerie, and haunting experience. Although nothing abysmally horrifying jumps out at you, and is no where near the horror level of say Amnesia or Penumbra, the chilling atmosphere, and the very interesting story, will keep you playing this artful adventure to the very end. I loved it.			"

												The game seemed pretty interesting to me at first but utter inability to save your progress (there is NO saving in this game) made me stop playing it. I wouldn't mind it as much if the game experience was randomized but, with a linear story and linear levels, not being able to save is inexcusable. In contemporary gaming there is no reason why a player shouldn't be able to save his progress at some point.			"

												I liked the game telling you about what you missed at the end of each section because it means you can play it again and have a clue of what you're looking for to make a change. Unfortunately that's the only thing I liked and have no intention of coming back to it.It describes itself as a horror game but the only horror comes from the occasional incredibly loud sound effect, knowing you'll have your volume way up because the rest of the game is super quiet. And the gameplay is too shallow to really make up for it. The camera is zoomed incredibly close to your character so you can't see more than 10ft ahead of you, every room of the game is as dark as the last, and you walk so slowly that even when you can unlock a previously locked door its hard to justify taking the time to go check it out. The worst part is that for such a simple game the controls are pretty bad. Using the keyboard you have to use wasd for movement, space to enter doors, up to raise your torch, down to scroll text, and Y/N whenever you find a new item. It would be so much more convenient if the button to raise your torch (nearly useless) could be used to enter doors and if you could hit left or right to pick an option. The mouse controls are a little better but not much because you're constantly accidentally raising your torch which roots you in place.			"

												To be honest i don't think i should waste my time by reccomending this but to help other people buying this game i have two words , don't buy. i got this on sale at 60p and even at a price like that i regret it , the horrible storyline , and terrible graphics with many other things wrong all add together to make you want to kick your moniter, burn your harddrive and forever hate indie games , but this is an exception most indie games are awsome so dont think im insulting all indie game because i love them , its just this one; if you want to think about buying after all i said i guess i can't change what you want to do but just watch some gamplay on youtube before buying and make your own choice. 2/10 ( the only reason i havn't voted 1 is because the game producer who made this has skill; that just needs to be put in another project).

												I liked the atmosphere of the game and what it was trying to accomplish.  However, the gameplay itself was far too slow.  The graphics/music weren't good enough to hold my attention through a lot of very slow walking. You can tell the team put a ton of work into nailing the look they were going for, but I wish that more attention had been paid to making the gameplay actually fun- or at least quicker.  I was very interested in the story though. Good one to watch a stream of.			"

												Respecting Your IntellectIs this game great? I'd answer that with, it's what you make of it. Most have played games that have multiple endings, and this one tries to have a story-line that jumps from the screen to your mind.What would be a short description of Home?A game that respects your intellect developed by an independent creator, that is a BIT weird and creepy, ahem, not the creator, the game. It shows creativity and atmosphere, but I'm not willing to play it multiple times; I take the ending I get with the choices I would've made had it been real life.If you lack an imaginative mind, which many games cater to these days, you will find the storyline isn't that deep. You NEED to use your imagination to fill the gaps. Games that are so dark you need to squint your eyes to make things out do not appeal to me. Short sequences yes; but the whole game no. If you take the advice on the opening screens, you will find the game is somewhat hard on the eyes.Nice sound effects and concept, but at the end I wasn't sure if I had finished the game. To put it mildly, throughout the entire game I was left wondering what it was all about.New things are good, and this game is GOOD. However, it needs bigger doses of strangeness, interaction with consequences, scary moments, and a decent voiceover (instead of all the text).If you're looking for a game with a big story you will be disappointed. If you're expecting a horror game you'll be horribly deluded. At first there's some fear but after 10 minutes the dial goes to zero. At the end I felt it was a game just to get me onto the designer's website. So although it is a nugget you'd be pleased to find, as you examine it closely you'll find it's not pure gold; at least not as pure as it could be.			"

												I've never been this scared by a game before.This masterpiece is not about stupid screamers and typical horror sounds, which make everyone annoyed.No, Home is about the atmosphere. The strong wish to discover every part of the epic storyline was desperately fighting with not the weaker constant feeling that something terrifying must happen the very next second during the whole game. To make matters worse, the low visibility because of the giant pixels make your imagination play a bad joke on you, which keeps you scared all the time.I was literally nailed to the screen, trembling, but eager to visit every single room and to read every single text, just because of how exciting they are.Anyways, so far I haven't seen a better way to spend one of your bucks on Steam!

												I couldn\'t get in to this game much. I really did try to get in to this game. I shut the lights and possible distractions off and everything. It has some spooky atmosphere, but I was more conditioned by this game\'s disposition as a horror title rather than the atmosphere of the game itself. The light space you\'re confined to in a TV static-like darkness is pretty effective, and the ceiling\'s lack of visibility until you shine the flashlight upwards is an effective tool for creating paranoia, but you are never once actually required to look up at the ceiling from my experience. The story changes on your playthrough because of vague conditions and I have yet to figure it out. It is overall decent, but you really do need to play it several times over to fully understand what it\'s going for. Though, I got this game on sale for literally less than a dollar so I can not complain much I guess. This is a cautious recommendation.			"

												While home is certainly an ambitious little project, I can't say that I enjoyed much about it. Billed as a ""horror adventure,"" Home feels like an Edgar Allen Poe short story with minor interaction. This is a 2D game where you have very few actions: move, investigate objects, and chose Yes or No at some points. In that regard it feels more like a visual novel than a game, and that's where my problems stem from. The story itself might be a bit unique in the realm of gaming, but it feels like relatively generic territory for horror as a whole. The story feels somewhat predictable from its opening frames, taking away from the game's eerie mystery.My main problem here is the game's lack of tension, which is crucial in horror. Other than a few sound-trigger jump scares, nothing in here is particularly frightening. Part of that is due to how often the game is broken up by text pop-ups. Essentially, every few seconds you stop to read a text bubble, which stops the game from being too immersive. It's possible for text to be scary on its own, but it just feels like an interruption here that breaks up the flow of the game.From what I've seen, it looks like this game has a dedicated fanbase, so there's certainly an audience for it. But after my first play through, I felt no reason to fire it up again even though I hadn't fully solved the mystery. The thought of treading through the same pixelated rooms and hearing the same sound cues just to hopefully learn a bit more just seemed boring. Even at one hour, Home can feel like a chore to get through, and that's sort of the opposite of how effective horror operates.(I also want to point out a quick technical bug I experienced here, which negatively effected my experience. Every time I clicked 'Yes' or 'No' at a decision point, my character would get locked into walking whatever direction he was facing. I had to click to make him stop moving and regain control. A minor annoyance, but one that happened quite a lot over the course of 1 hour.)			"

												Okay, I'm going to give this game a reccomended thumbs up HOWEVER! It just barely does it for me.Spoilers!!! Maybe? Beware nonethelessWhile I didn't really find this game to be the horror-esque it claimed to be, I did find it was a nice quick play through that involved some exploration and a classic, choose your own adventure style. I had some trepedation at first, as always with games that claim to be horrors, wondering what kind of jump scares awaited me on the other side. Home offered no jump scares really... and as I played I found out my character, though he came across death multiple times, had no possible way of dying... so that was a disappointment at first... and although it let me take my time and start to explore a bit... it actually took away from the whole feel of it in the end.I went about exploring the first area entirely, the house with the dead man, trying to find what I could. I took some papers, left the gun... and found a video which I never really got to see the outcome of... I missed a point in the home where I could've viewed it I guess... but as the game progressed I found myself enjoying the exploration and the possibility of finding more clues as to why your character awoke where he did.The time flew by and before I knew it I was at the end. It was a very short game though but having bought it on sale for 75 cents I really can't complain.By the end I got to choose how I interpreted the clues I had stumbled upon, kicked myself for missing a few pieces of the story and found myself kinda, just a little bit... wanting to play it one more time just to see what kind of ending I could get the second round. However I have still yet to play it again and unless the mood really really REALLY strikes me to, I most likely won't.So, with that said...Story: 7/10I enjoyed it as I started to get into the game. I liked the choose your own adventure style of it and the whole mystery aspect. However I was very disappointed with the horror aspect the synopsis claimed this game to have. It left much to be desired.Replay Value: 5/10I might replay the game once more to figure out what I missed and what else I can get, but as for that I think this game would be retired from my shelf.Graphics: 5/10Wasn't much of a fan of the choice of graphics this time round. While the developer did a good job overall with his choice... I felt the game could've used more detail that doesn't come with the old pixel-style graphics. It left much to be desired.(Sale)Value: 6/10I mentioned I had bought this for 0.75 and I found that to be worth it. It gave me enough entertainment for the time the game lasted.(Full) Value: 1.5/10I wouldn't have bought this game had it been the full 2.99. Granted its only three bucks but seriously... I've seen much much MUCH better games go on sale on Steam for 5 bucks... and that 3 bucks would've been better invested towards those games.Ambiance/Music: 8/10This is what helped the game move along for me. Ambiance alone can help make or break a game so I applaude the developer in this aspect.Overall... out of 10... I would give this game a 5.5/10 good for the quick hour or two you may play it, but then shelf dust after that.			"

												Home reminds me of the games I played on my uncle's computer as a kid back in the 80s and that isn't a bad thing. Back before games became all about high poly counts and over the top action, there was an elegance in their simplicity. Obviously this wasn't always the case. There were plenty of terrible games back then as well but there was something about the style of video games back then that made for a memorable experience. Much like a good mystery novel leaves you with more questions than answers and doesn't give away the entire story, the video games of my childhood were entertaining during play but often left you with plenty of things to ponder long afterward. You'd wonder about that one-off robot with one line of dialogue and where he came from. You'd lay awake in your bed trying to figure out if there were more secrets hidden in that dark cave you just finished passing through. Home feels like an homage to that era of gaming... an era where one's imagination was as much a part of the experience as the production itself.I'm not surprised to see a fair number of people giving Home negative reviews but I hope the developer doesn't take them to heart. I've read several of these negative critiques and to be perfectly honest the bulk of them simply have no appreciation for games that aren't multi-million dollar titles produced by teams numbering in the hundreds. These are the same folks who can't appreciate most indie films because they don't know how to process a movie that doesn't spoon feed them the plot between explosions. I don't fault them for it. They simply don't know any better. I tip my hat to you Benjamin Rivers. Well done. What we have here is a unique piece of retro-styled choose-your-own-adventure story telling and it is beautiful in its simplicity and originality.			"

												Interesting game I loved but that could give some players mixed feelings, thought. It succesfully manages to build suspense and a unsettling atmosphere. The horror is mostly psychological and is slowly built across the 1-2h of gameplay. You must play it completely to have a global vision of what happened. Don't expect jumpscares or screamers, the story is more about slowly growing misgivings and sudden morbid realizations, and it's very good at it.			"
