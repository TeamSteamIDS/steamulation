												This game is a mixed bag of a few funny parts but the rest boring. I will review this from a perspective of a loyal Monkey Island fan that has played and owns the first three.A. Story - The story from Telltale games is okay but is kind of stupid is some parts. It does not flow as well as the first three nor does it feel engaging. B. Canon/Lore of Characters - Telltale creates characters that are like a spinoff and not true to their original personalities.1) Guybrush is now some heroic pirate who is known all over the Caribbean. Guybrush normal goofy childish side seems to have been minimalized now. He is mean and cynical in some parts of the game which is not like the original Guybrush we knew.2) Voodoo Lady is now some manipulator of the entire story. In the originals she was like a helper/advisor only. 3) Stan - The voice of Stan is totally different than the originals and personality is totally different. Stan usually was funny and tried to swindle some money out of people, with arms waving everywhere through any dialogue. In this game he is not funny.4) Elaine - She is somewhat of watered down version than her former self. In previous games she was more independent and strong.5) LeChuck - Turns into some nice guy through most chapters then becomes evil again. The concept of him being nice is so outlandishly stupid or odd, that it just doesn't seem like the LeChuck we knew.C. Consistency - Telltale does not follow previous lore or rules that the first three games set. An example is the Voodoo Lady mentions ""You cannot get rid of pure evil"" in Curse of Monkey Island. Being able to kill LeChuck in the end of this game doesn't truly fit. Another example is the contradiction when Guybrush gets his hand chopped of in Ch. 1 but magically gets it back in the end. That makes no sense.D. Graphics - Telltale invented a more 3D interface. This gets really confusing and annoying because you easily can miss things. The original pixelated or even the special edition allows for a better visual point and click interface because the screen is more 2d and flat. The 3D characters look kind of ugly. The special edition of 1 & 2 and cartoon look of Curse of Monkey Island fit the characters and the story great. The 3D view of these characters makes them look odd.E. Dialogue - Numerous times you are given a choice on dialogues and which to click, BUT frequently Guybrush will not say what you click. This only happened a couple of times in the first three because the dialogue would have been super rude or inappropriate.  In the 5 chapters here, it happens way too frequently so the choice you have on what you want Guybrush to say is already programmed in the game to say something else.F. Interface - The first three games had choices like a) push b) pull c) pick up d) use e) talk etc. etc. This game you only just click on an item. You click an item and it automatically picks it up. It's like a toddler could play the game almost. This takes away from the game making it less engaging.  There are a few actions in your inventory but the amount of actions is reduced.Overall, it depends on your expectations. I played the original Monkey Island 1, 2, & 3 over and over numerous of times in my childhood and introduced them to my wife. She likes 1, 2, & 3 but for both of us Telltale Tales of Monkey Island does not feel like the original characters and story we enjoyed. I would not recommend it at full price nor do I like it. If you want to purchase it, I would suggest do it only when it is on sale like we did during the summer sale. For us this was just disappointing and felt like a new artificial story that was not consistent with the original series.			"

Tales of Monkey Island (all 5 chapters)I thoroughly enjoyed Tales of Monkey Island, I simply couldn’t put the games down and finished all chapters within a few days. First off though I’ll say that I can’t recall if I have played the old Monkey Island games, and if I did it was when I was too young to remember the game’s title! So I won’t be basing my review of this game off of comparisons with previous games.PuzzlesThe puzzles are really well done, definitely what you’d expect from a good adventure game. Personally I enjoy puzzles that lean towards being logical and not being pixel hunting, and this game definitely satisfied me on that department. Usually when you need to find an item/ have found an item while exploring, you can pretty much imagine what you’d be able to do with the items. That doesn’t mean the puzzles are flat out easy though, it just means that you can fuzzily see how the solution would come about, but would need some more exploring or twists and turns to complete each step. ControlsThe controls are something I didn’t really like, you have to drag your mouse in the direction you want Guybrush to move, so it’s not as easy as clicking a point on the screen and having him walk there (certain highlighted areas excluded). Most of the time was spent “swiping” my mouse to and fro while holding down the left mouse button, which really gave my hand and wrist cramps (well, I was playing for long periods too, but no thanks carpal tunnel)! I tried using the keyboard arrow keys for a bit, but as they usual in 2D/3D games it’s clunky so I stuck with using the mouse.StoryStory is good enough, none of it seems like filler, just quality swashbuckling pirate adventure! I really liked the character Morgan LeFlay, badass pirate hunter, and hope to see her around more! Other characters like the Voodoo Lady appear again and they are well developed as well. Bonus: so many innuendos!Other aspectsPlaytime for me was roughly 4 hours per chapter, which pretty much corresponds with the time on HowLongToBeat, totalling slightly less than 20 hours for me. Voice acting and soundtrack wise, they’re both great especially the voice acting (as expected), though I wish they could have some more loops for the background music.			"

												in 2009, telltale and lucasarts crafted a fitting conclusion to the monkey island series with Tales of Monkey Island and i personally think that if there is never another MI game ever made, Tales is a good way to end things on a high note. while the first two episodes are kinda hit or miss, the season starts to pick up steam with episode 3 and continues forth into a pretty great (and auctally pretty dark) conclusion with episode 5. some of the jokes might be a bit dated in 2015 (OH I GET IT. YOUTUBE) but corny humor has always been a hallmark of the series, and at least it's nowhere near as bad as EMI's *relentless* references to 2000's pop culture.if you like the monkey island series and want to see what Guybrush and crew are up to lately, i highly recommand it.

												It's sort of surreal to be playing what is essentially a spiritual successor to what is essentially a spiritual successor, but the game's alright, even if it feels like a charicature of the previous iterations.I like the game. The 5-part episodic structure seems silly and always feels to me like a cash-grab. Each of the 5 episodes is tragically short so there aren't too many puzzles, but  their solutions are as obtuse, but obvious as the older ones so at least it's being done right. The mechanics try to dumb-down the nature of point-and-click adventure as it forces the 2D characters into a very rough 2.5D/3D interpretation. I am quite unfond of the character models as they make it look poor, but that's because it's the same version of the game that was dumbed-down for mobile. The audio leverages references to the remarkable (not for sale) soundtracks of the originals so it's pretty good. The writing is adequate and brings in some really interesting characters, situations and concepts, although some of the older characters certainly don't seem like themselves, but that's the cost of being so far removed from the source. If they cleaned up the pointy-clicky bits and made the characters not look like beginner's guide to 3D, I would love this much more than I do.			"

												I LOVE the Monkey Island series. I started playing from Escape (bad start, yes). Then I tried out the 1st and 2nd games went they went on the iPad App Store. Never tried the 3rd one, but I heard some good stuff. So after finishing Tales of Monkey Island, I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. The characters are still as funny as they were in the previous games, and the story, while a bit weird and confusing, was still enjoyable. The humour was still excellent, even thought they did get new writers for this one. Many references and small homages to pop-culture, and even the older Monkey Island games too.And to all of you Mac users, don't worry, the game works fine. In the amount of time I played the game, I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches.It's a shame they won't be making a sixth game, since all the characters only agreed to a five-game deal with LucasArts (Escape From Monkey Island joke, look it up). But to me, this was a pretty fitting end to Guybrush's piratey adventures. I'd say that this game is absolutely worth it's full price.Before I end this review, let me just say this one sentence...Oh, how appropriate, you fight like a cow.			"

												The Monkey Island Series was and still is my favourite series of games to play.  This does not disappoint.  It has the humour and puzzle fun of the Original series. It also has a much better interface and graphics.  Oh and Elaine, Guybrush and Le Chuck, still the three greatest games characters  ever created.The end credits for each chapter should not be missed, they are hilarious and contain old favourites and nods to the original games. I just loved each chapter of the game.  Oh and no glitches.  Take note you other games developers, this is how gaming should be done.			"

												I cannot really say 100% if this game was worth it or not. I've played all the other Monkey Islands in the past, and besides Monkey Island 4, I enjoyed all of them. I will review this game from different points of view:1) CHARACTERS: Guybrush never gets boring, he is still able to make you laugh and give some funny commentaries on what is happening to him even if the situation seems hopeless. His wife Elaine is even more annoying than she ever was, and also this time she's one of the main causes of Guybrush's trouble. Le Chuck is seen for the first time as a human, and the Vodoo Lady has some nice corpse paint on her face. Even some old acquaintances have found their place in the game. There are a couple of good characters which worked well, like De Singe and Morgan, and the side characters also were well thought and hilarious (like the sailors belonging to De Cava's troupe). All characters were well thought and well designed. 2)STORY: The story is ""innovative"" and well thought, and has some nice little twists in it which keep you interested. The fact that it develops over 5 episodes, though, makes it sometimes ""slow paced"", but overall the whole idea works very well, and keeps you wanting to know what happens next.3)GAMEPLAY: that's the main point which ruined the whole experience for me. Until the 4th episode I was able to manage everything by myself, without getting any ""help"" on the internet. Starting with the fourth episode, I had some troubles understanding the map the Voodoo Lady gives you to make the Esponja grow, and after some failed attempts I had to look it up to continue. The game also had a bug I could only solve thanks to a German blog, and some of the stuff I found in the fourth episode was pointless (the liquid glass, the wax, etc.), and made me loose a lot of time trying to find out how to use it. In episode 5 I got REALLY frustrated and had to look up for a solution too many times. I can say I am an experienced point&click adventurer and always manage to solve everything by myself, but this time the connections between objects and effect was ""absurd"" at times, so that I would never ever have thought about the combinations that were needed to go on. The whole going back and forth through the Crossroads was kind of an annoying time loss I would have avoided, and the ""advises"" the Voodoo Ladies gives you are not really helpful in finding out what to do next. So, overall, the game was well done (even if there were some mistakes in the German synchronisation, and sometimes you could even hear the same guy giving voices to two different characters, which is never good), the story was nice and worked very well, but the Gameplay ruined my overall experience, so that I just wanted the game to finally be over in the last chapter.

												Tales of Monkey Island does not skip a beat.  It's as if the Monkey Island series never stopped.  The graphic style, the humour and the storyline are all what one would expect from a Monkey Island game.  Telltale does it again with a fantastic series that you can't miss.  Great graphics, great voice overs, fluid cartoony animation, and some of the funniest dialogue since..........the last Monkey Island.  Can't miss this wonderful series.  Grab it now.			"

												This is a franchise that I had grown up playing. It holds a really, really special place in my heart and I was so afraid of playing this game.Prior to playing this game I had had no previous exposure to any Telltale games, little did I know that not only was this game in safe hands but it was in caring hands.Yes the puzzles might be a little simple, but the soul of the game is the same, this is a Monkey Island game in everyway that it should be.A more detailed review can be found here on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2012/11/tales-of-monkey-island.html.

												If you are a Monkey Island fan, this game will not disappoint. The episodic way Telltale put it out on is a little clunky on Steam, but totally fits in with previous titles in story progression. It's interesting, wacky, puzzle-solving piratry at its finest. I highly recommend burning a few hours on this game. It's full of twists and turns, love triangles, and multiple surprises. You will enjoy this game if you liked any of the previous Monkey Island titles.			"

												Welcome back to the hilarious pirating world of Guybrush Threepwood. Aye, Matie - the nostalgic, comic, misadventures continue in this throw back of days gone by.Fantastic point & click adventure from LucasArts. Great purchase on sale and highly recommended for fans of the genre. I remember this debut in 1990 on an old 386 SX 16 MHz. This return has much improved graphics, great storyline, clever puzzles and the fun escape that video games draw us to. Highly recommended after finishing Chapter 1. I will indeed complete the series in this one. "

												A perfect follow-up to the legendary Monkey Island series. Hits all the right notes in terms of typical Monkey Island humor. Graphics might be jarring for some but it's better than EMI especially once you get used to the style. The first episode is the weakest but it gets better as you play. Puzzles overall are simpler compared to earlier titles but this also means they are not frustrating, so it's well-balanced. Absolutely recommended for MI fans.			"

												A fantastic few chapters in the continuing story of Guybrush Threepwood - Mighty Pirate TM. The chapters were each surprisingly long, taking my wife and I about 5hrs per chapter making 25hrs of gameplay time.I originally played The Secret of Monkey Island 1 years ago as a child - before any voices were added (the game intalled from 3x 1.44mb disks I think), and The Secret of Monkey Island 2 a few years later - also on 1.44mb disks if I recall correctly. I never played number 3, and was there a number 4?? Either way, this has plenty of great tie-ins with the original games and was good for a few laughs. My wife had never played any of Monkey Island, but she picked up on the general idea soon enough and enjoyed the series and the ending.Puzzles were very well thought out and often needed different perspectives and logic and plain old trial and error to figure out what the whacky item combinations were. Playing with the wife was great for the second opinions and to introduce her to the childhood that was Monkey Island!Great value at $5, especially if you've played any of the old games of the series!

												A nice ending to the 5 part series of Tales of Monkey Island. I had previosuly played Curse of Monkey Island, and there were a couple things to get used to. The some-what awkward camera changes, the saving lag spikes, and some of the REALLY random puzzles I admit to looking up.By no means is this a bad game, I loved the game and the story. You may not want to buy it at full price though, I bought it at 75% off, so for 5 episodes at around $8.75, that's a pretty good deal. Each of the tales are funny and challenging, and just like in Curse of Monkey Island , ask ""What's Sharper, Your Sword or Your Wit?"".I played this alongside one other person, and I found it more enjoyable, as two heads trying to solve the logical puzzles helped when I couldn't solve something or vice versa. Fans of the series will enjoy this game! "

												Obviously I love Monkey Island. It is one of the first computer games that I played, and have played every entry into the series since. Telltale does a pretty good job of staying true to Guybrush and crew. This series is thoroughly entertaining to play through and I'm yearning for another adventure with Guybrush Threepwood!			"

												Ever since The Walking Dead series came out of Telltale Games, I had to force myself to consider that some of their games weren't complete tripe. With the rather disappointing Back to the Future and Sam and Max series behind them, they somehow managed to produce one of the best films/choose your own cutscene adventures of the year. So just recently I thought it was high time to get over myself and come back to play the Tales of Monkey Island, which was released after the two other abysmal series, but before the brilliant TWD. And to my complete surprise, it also didn't suck.The issue with the previous games was this. There were very few environments within each puzzle segment, and the puzzles were so insipid, that a mere clicking on everything to find all the items necessary to complete the puzzle, and then clicking on all the remaining things with all the things in your inventory was not only efficient, but bore little difference to the puzzle solution itself. Basically, everything was too easy. And the parts that weren't easy were only that way because the relevant solution items were too small or otherwise hidden in the environment. Finding the solution items should never be the tricky part of the solving process. The trick should be in the deductive process.But in this series, the Monkey Island series, it was. There were enough dead ends and pure logical puzzles and random red herrings that thinking was rewarded. The answers were always obvious when revealed, but not so obvious as to just be an issue of item acquisition. There are several aha! moments when the sufficient items in your inventory are used in unique ways to solve a puzzle which seemed impassable. And that makes the entire game worthwhile.Also the source material is dutiful taken care of. The game maintains some of the charm of the original Monkey Island games, not just through references to the previous games, or attention to character, but through the style of humour and the use of narrative trees to expand on that humour. These trademark trees, where back and forth witty banter occurs between two characters without reflecting on story consequence or requiring progression at all, pop up from time to time and are the best source of laughs in the game. They don't occur as frequently as in the originals but they're still worth the price of admission. The game is not without its flaws though. I found the last episode weak and unconvincing especially the final confrontation's conclusion. Not to mention it's completely missing the traditional ""Guybrush kicks butt"" penultimate chapter that was the final payoff to the puzzles in all the previous Monkey Island games (aside the story resolution). The second chapter was marred by hiding an island in the borders of the map, and the fourth by unlocking items in a previously explored location without due notification or prior signposting. But for the most part it steers completely clear of these standard annoying adventure game errors, so it is to be commended for that.My only real complaint is that this was episodic. Because of this, there is this pre-baked structure in each episode of framing the big interesting puzzle with two smaller ones to ease people into the game, and then speed up the action at the end. Playing straight through two episodes or more, this puts quite a bit too much downtime between the larger puzzles, and that is unfortunate.But overall, this is a good Monkey Island game. The puzzles were solid, the humour in consistent tone and quality (if a bit sparse) and the plot reasonable (or good up until episode 5). Still Monkey Island and Monkey Island 3 were great games. Monkey Island 2 dragged on a bit, was admittedly too hard for me when I played it and suffered at the end as well. And Monkey Island 4 was abominable for reasons I have repressed. So when I say this game is good, it doesn't hold a candle to 1 and 3. It beats out 2 in my book, and no-one chooses to remember 4.So as an adventure game, buy it.As a Monkey Island game, don't expect too much from it, but then buy it.4/5.   May replay on occasion.(Monkey Island 1 and 3 get 5/5s, Monkey Island 2 gets a 3.5 and 4 gets 2 or something).			"

The 3D characters in this game are done well, unlike the horrible job that was done on Monkey Island 4. Compared to the old games, a lot of the puzzles are very simple. Overall Telltale Games did a good job and I hope we see more of these from them.			"

												When I was a kid in the early 1990's, I got the original Monkey Island for the Amiga 500 one Christmas. I remember it being one of the best games I have ever played, and I still do. I was only 8 or 9 when I played it, and it enchanted me. The story was great, it was genuinly fun and the puzzles were very clever and took me a long time to figure out.THe same can be said for the sequel Monkey Island 2. Monkey Island 3 was good, but nothing on the originals.Monkey Island 4 was a travesty.The remakes were good, but to be fair they were nothing special.This....is just bad.Seriously disapointed. The graphics are awful, the art work is laughable, the puzzles are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and it is about as funny as child death.For a Telltale game I was expecting a lot more. "

												This game is a new edition to the Monkey Island series, but not a direct sequel to Escape from Monkey Island (the 4th game in the series). Don't expect amazing graphics, but I will say that they still stand out nicely because they have a nice bright hand-done feel. The dialogue and jokes stand true to the originals, as well as the voices. Guybrush's voice hasn't changed, and Murray's as well hasn't changed. However Elaine's and LeChuck's characters seem slightly mellowed down in this new edition.			"

If you're thinking on playing this as your first point and click, please turn around and take a look at far better options. Perhaps the first games in this series :P They were even remade and upgraded with fancy new art. If you played the others in the series, well, this is a fun and ok game, but nothing exceptional. But since you are a fan of the series this probably won't make you quit, but this isn't a old LucasArt game :)It's still fun though, so HAPPY GAMING!:)			"

												This game (and every other Monkey Island) is not worth the full price tag.It is however worth at least £5.Which is why whenever any Monkey Island is on sale for very cheap, I say WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOT BUYING ITSeriously, these games are the funniest adventure games I have ever played. Also the only adventure games I have wanted to complete when I got half way through.			"

												TL;DR version: Chapters 1-4 were fun games with a few moments of tedious repetitive walking here and there, 5 was a horribly drawn out game with too many cut scenes and too much walking back and forth between point a and point b (with a point c thrown in from time to time for 'variety').I hate to give a Monkey Island game a thumbs down, I really do - but overall, this game left me feeling unsatisfied.  Which is a shame, because the first four chapters actually built up quite nicely.  I was entertained by chapters 1 through 4, and I was looking forward to the final chapter.  BUT that final chapter - ugh!  Before I go on to a part that's spoilery, I'd like to mention my two big non-spoilery complaints, which both boil down to: movement!First: you can only move by holding down a mouse key or by using awsd - and you have to keep your finger on the key/button or he'll stop moving.  Boy is THAT fun through 5 frigging games.  Oh wait, no, no it's not.Second: like every five feet you walk, the screen changes to a new viewpoint.  And that new viewpoint frequently ends up being from another perspective or angle.  And when that happens, here's what MAY happen with your movement:- keeping your finger on the button you had it on may keep him moving in the direction you had him walking in this first place.  This is disorienting when you were holding 's' for down and suddenly Guybrush is walking right.  Removing your finger and re-pressing s will make it down, but that gets annoying with a lot of screen changes.- keeping your finger on the button you had it on may start him moving in the wrong direction.  You are walking down on one screen, you move to the next and he's still moving down, only now there's nowhere to go.- keeping your finger on the button may do nothing.  You move to the next screen which (miracle of miracles) still has you facing in the right direction, and yet you suddenly stop, and have to again remove and repush the button to make him walk again.- moving just a LITTLE too close to certain areas may end up with you walking into them, frequently interrupting your (six thousandth) walk from one end of town to the other as you try and complete a questIf there's any rhyme or reason to when each of the above happens between screens, I never found it.Dear game makers: if you absolutely MUST pad your game's playtime by making us go over the same territory again and again and again and again AND AGAIN (I'm not kidding, the final chapter is almost entirely made up of trudging back and forth between 2-4 points) - the LEAST you could do is give us back the option adventure games used to have of being able to choose faster or slower walking paces.  Remember Space Quest?  Yeah, I know you do.  Sure, you'd murder yourself a few times walking straight into something horrible, but at least you could speed up and slow down as necessary.And now for the complaints about the final chapter, which is wholly responsible for my reluctant thumbs-down of this game as a whole.PLEASE DO NOT READ ON IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL CHAPTER. PLEASE DO NOT READ ON IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL CHAPTER. PLEASE DO NOT READ ON IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL CHAPTER. PLEASE DO NOT READ ON IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL CHAPTER.Okay, ready?  So, the whole Voodoo Lady thing - what was up with that?  Oh, she's using us all.  You know what, let's just keep listening to her advice!  Well... okay, I guess it doesn't make a lot of difference, in that she doesn't really give any advice.  She either speaks in riddles that never actually mean anything, or outright says ""hey take that thing, you need it, it does such and such.""  And now that Lechuck is (surprise) vanquished (temporarily (surprise)) AGAIN, let's forget about going after the Voodoo Lady and like... killing her to stop her from doing all this♥♥♥♥♥♥again!  The whole idea of making the Voodoo Lady into some sort of quasi-villain without a MUUUUUCH better job of explaining it, or dealing with it in the end, was a terrible, terrible idea.  I don't mind the repetitiveness of Lechuck as a villain, he's funny, and that's great, but the Voodoo Lady thing just left a big weird unresolved mess at the end of the game.  Between that and retracing my steps about a billion times - oh! and staring at the screen waiting for Lechuck to punch me to the next place where I had to do something a billion times - it ruined my impression of the game as a whole.

												This ""game"" is a SCAM. All the dialogue options that seem like they could alter the story are always the same one, no matter what you choose. So, for instance, someone who you are talking to mentions a pirate named Deep Throat. Your options go something like this:""Deep Throat? What a stupid name for a pirate?""""Deep Throat? Is my wife's mother visiting?""""Deep Throat? Isn't the throat wider than it is deep?""Whichever one you choose, the main character answers ""Deep Throat?"" and the NPC tells the only scripted line that is possible in that conversation. This is not an adventure game. Thos is hardly even a story, as the lack of context, apart from the seemingly imaginary answers that the main character gives out as options, make it a dull hand-holding technicolor 3D experience. DO NOT BUY			"

												Quando eu joguei o primeiro capítulo dessa série, eu recomendei, mas acho que foi muito por causa de nostalgia pelo primeiro Monkey Island, de tantos anos atrás. O roteiro do capítulo 1 é até bom, lembrando o original da série, mas enquanto eu jogava o 2º, 3º e 4º eu percebi uma decadência brusca do roteiro, com umas piadas que me deram até uma certa vergonha de estar jogando isso. O 3º é até mais ou menos, mas só por causa do final. Bom, se você não conhece a série mas acha graça em piada com gordas, vá em frente... senão se faça um favor e vá jogar outra coisa. Em relação ao gameplay, também, existe uma decadência no sentido de que o jogo ficou mais fácil, mas também não é fácil demais. Bom, quem é fã da série pode se divertir, mas para quem não é eu não recomendo.			"

												Tales of Monkey Island was such a brilliant work of art. I will admit I was really scared and skeptical about how it would turn out, considering it was made by TellTaleGames (SHUT UP NOT ALL THEIR STUFF IS GOOD) and the fact it took about TEN YEARS for a sequel from Escape from Monkey Island, the fourth game in the series. If you aren't familiar with TTG's previous work imagine The Walking Dead, but kinda ♥♥♥♥♥ier, and of series you've never heard of like BONE and Sam and Max.The visuals were phenomenal and had the same art style used in Monkey Island 3. I think only maybe once did I see Elaine's hot ginger pirate body skid across a room without a walking animation like a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag on a segue. Maybe another couple times the lip syncing was off, but who cares? The voice Acting was just what I wanted, using the original cast and the same witty talk back attitude between all the characters. The dialogue was perfect. GuyBrush comments on everything he sees with the funniest puns such as "" You Fight Like a Dairy Farmer"" and ""How Appropriate, you fight like a cow"". You'd never hear that coming from a modern day game unless it was followed by ""GRENADE!"". I did not feel as though some of the characters were appropriate for the game. The first three chapters seemed very kiddyish and I believed that's what I would be playing, a game without LeChuck. It♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off at first because it seemed as though they threw the biggest meanest villain of all 4 prequels away and replaced him with a ♥♥♥♥♥ with a French accent who isn't even French (kinda like those Minecraft players who fake British accents to gain popularity on YouTube). But by the end of the 4th chapter LeChuck shows his true colors (being an aqua green) to have been, and always will be THE VILLAIN. I really felt actual emotion when I saw my favorite pirate...I won't spoil it. If you love the series you're first instinct will be to cry, before you realize ""Wait, there's another chapter"". And If you don't know the games all too well you'll be sitting in your chair ranting about how TTG stole your money, rather than just buying the last damn chapter for like 4 bucks to set your mind at ease. Anyway, the puzzles stayed true to the other games red herrings, humor, and creativity. It will take alot of brain power at times to catch the play on words and hints. You call it Dumbing yourself down, I call it comedy. The Easter eggs were fantastic. They were smart and subtle. References to the previous games and their run on jokes and apparently like a thousand others I didn't even get til I researched the game more. It wasn't just like ""HEY LOOK POWER ARMOR THATS A HALO THING! LOOK ITS DEAD SPACE GUY"" ( SHUT UP DUKE NUKEM I'M SORRY YOUR SEQUEL SUCKED). The point is, I actually felt like I was GuyBrush ThreepWood. I believed I was him. I laughed at every joke, I chose every dialogue option, I felt sorrow for every characters misfortune that wasn't ridiculous, and I felt genuine anger and confusion at LeChuck for what he does.Tales Of Monkey Island is by far one of the greatest adventures I've seen in a long time. I give it a 9.5/10. I realize this came out in 2009, But It's MY FAVORITE GAME OF THE YEAR! -nathan https://www.facebook.com/BelowAverageGamingShow?ref=hl "

												Although far from being perfect, this 5 chapters adventure is a solid experience.The music was okay - unremarkable at points, which I consider a good thing, because it let me focus on the plot and the puzzles. Great voice acting, though!I liked the graphics, and the recycled faces and body types didn't bother me too much. The camera was very cinematic, a problem, when you are controlling the character and get lost because of it.The puzzles were great. I admit I had to look up some, but the majority of them was a nice combination of logic and lateral thinking, in the spirit of the series. Inside jokes and references were abundant and really fun!Moving to plot and characters. Spoiler alert!This Guybrush is definitely more mature than in the first games, but he's still a big softie. The Voodoo Lady still rocks. LeChuck had a couple of great moments, although in the end it boils down to 'he's evil because he's evil'.I have some major complaints regarding the character of Elaine, which is kinda there in all the 5 chapters, in the background and in need to be rescued--twice! (What has she done to the Elaine of Secret and Revenge?) The new character, Morgan, kicks♥♥♥♥♥-except she doesn't, really. Her whole reason d'etre revolves around Guybrush. It partly makes sense because of her job, but really. She feels down because of him, fights with his wife because of him, gets killed because of him, is cheered up because of him, sacrifices what is important for him... gimme a break. No, I don't think the hole 'childhood hero' thing justifies all of it. I just hope we will see more of her in upcoming games, she's promising.And for the love of God, the Guybrush/Elaine/Morgan triangle was so weirdly orchestrated. It felt awkward. I saw it as forced.Considering the media today, Elaine and Morgan got a decent treatment, but I still consider it below average for my tastes. These two points affected my liking the most.tl;dr solid game(s), treatment of female characters could have been handled better, 8/10			"

												I've alway sbeen a big Monkey Island fan. I grew up playing the originals on PC and on the Sega CD. I can honestly say that this series did not disappoint. The puzzles were awesome -- they actually forced you to think and the story was entertaining. It was nice to see the return of a lof the characters I grew up seeing and how they had evolved over the past couple decades. Having said that the game was enthralling from start to finish. I would recomment this game to anyone. The story is self contained so if you have not played any of the previous Monkey Islands you would not be at a loss starting with this series. I can only hope with LA disolved that we can someday get to see more Guybrush Threepwood, Mightee Pirate in the future!			"

												I love the original Monkey Island games and was estatic to hear another had been released. This game did not diappoint. It brings back all of my favorite characters (except Wally - would've liked to see him again :( ) and throws them into yet another crazy quest. The puzzles are great and seem to be easier than previous games in the series, or maybe I'm just used to coming up with crazy solutions by this point. It's a lot of fun and I highly recommend it, but, as with all Monkey Island games, be prepared to think outside the box.			"

												Playing through all the episodes of Tales of Monkey Island was a complete joy.As a fan of the Monkey Island series, I have always been very skeptical of this release; so skeptical, in fact, that I refused to even give this game a try until now.First off, If you are not a Monkey Island fan... I don't know if this is the right game to start with. There are loads of inside jokes and returning characters that the game expects you to know, and the dialogue (as always) does reference previous events in other games. This is definitely the one Monkey Island game that wouldn't stand on its own! Some parts of the story won't have the same impact on you if you haven't lived through at least one other Monkey Island adventure. The more games you played in the series, the more enjoyment you'll get out of this.With that in mind, it's crazy how good this game is. My expectations were low, but this game should not be as good as it is. What you are getting with the Complete Collection is five episodes, each lasting about 2-4 hours depending on how long it takes you to figure out the puzzles. Generally speaking, the puzzles are pretty easy. You'll definitely not need a walkthrough to beat these episodes, but there's still enough challenge to get you stuck for a few minutes... Still, I wouldn't mind some harder puzzles. Don't worry though, the wacky Monkey Island style is still present, so don't expect any real-world logic to apply here.I also think that the writing in general lives up to the Monkey Island name, as well! I was surprised by how engaged I was and how much I wanted to see the story through. Good thing all the episodes are already out, because I would have gone crazy if I had to wait for a new episode to be released due to the cliffhangers. Make no mistake, this could have easily been a normal Point and Click adventure game rather than an episodic release. It's not one of those 'separate stories that just kind of fit together'-kind of episodic releases, and playing just one episode wouldn't leave you satisfied.Seriously, I have no complaints about this game at all, other than the fact that the ending felt a bit rushed. I won't say anymore than that, but you'll see what I mean. It's not terrible and definitely not a game-breaker, but... Yeah.			"

												Tales of Monkey Island is the last and most shocking chapter of the saga of Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate. The game presents new characters, including Marquis de Singe and Morgan LeFlay, and gives a satisfying ending to the history of the mighiest pirate of the seven seas. Everything starts when Guybrush fails to properly prepare the cursed cutlass of Kaflu, used to kill LeChuck. Instead of killing LeChuck, he turns LeChuck human and releases a powerful voodoo curse on the seven seas, know as LeChuck pox. Now, Guybrush must sail the seven seas to find the mythical ""esponja grande"" so he can clean the mess he made himself.			"

												There isn't much too review here - if you liked the old Monkey Island games, this will scratch your itch. It's a comedic adventure game with puzzles that are not too hard, and features a slightly unusual control mechanism (WASD). It's also interesting to see the hints of what Tell Tale games would grow up to be in the long but well-directed cutscenes. It's reasonably entertaining and worth the cash these days, though to be honest i didn't really get into the story and was disappointed by the ending. A better modern adventure in the same vein is The Journey Down, in my opinion, but this is still worth a playthrough if you are an adventure fan.			"

Likes  Hilarious writing and voice-acting, as always.  While the graphics weren't true to the ""traditional"" style, I didn't find it so off-putting that it took away from the game. I am nostalgic for the old 2D, but I can't blame a franchise for wanting to try something different. I think they pulled it off okay.  Length of episode was appropriate, I played it in short bursts over 4 or 5 days. Opportunities for Improvement  I am playing on a Macbook Pro Retina running Yosemite. I could NOT for the life of me get this game to play fullscreen. I couldn't even get it to play at a decent resolution, it would just flicker or be unreadable. Also, the game crashed on boot up every so often. However, I did manage to get through the game fine once I pressed command+F to shrink it back to windowed. Overall, I would recommend this game for previous Monkey Island fans. It feels right to hear Guybrush's voice again and be immersed in that world for an episode. I would be hesitant about introducing it to those not familiar with the earlier games.Edit I did just read that it did not recommend the game for Macs with an integrated graphics card... my bad.			"

												If you've never been either a fan, or even interested in Monkey Island, Tales still makes a pleasant introduction to the series. Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate, is played over five episodic adventures. The gameplay involves pointing, clicking, laughing, and doing many interesting puzzles as you go along trying to solve the mystery of the Pirate Pox. The Tales games remember what it is to be humorous and how to paint a world of colorful characters. Guybrush offers commentary throughout the entire game, and in a way serves as sort of a companion with the player rather than the player merely assuming his position. If you've ever wanted to evade a French scientist, challenge a pirate to a mean face competition, or create counterfeit action figures, this is the series for you.			"

												Monkey Island is one of my favorite video game IPs of all time.   The Secret Of Monkey Island was the first game I ever pirated.   I have played them all, I even played the SegaCD port of MI.    So when I heard they were making a whole new series, I was so thrilled I nearly made water in my pantaloons.   Then I got ahold of it, and well...I didn't hate it.   The problem is (and it's the same issue I had with Telltale's Sam & Max stuff) it doesn't feel like a legit Lucasarts Monkey Island game.   It feels like a fan-made game.   It's really close, and it was made with a lot of love by people who obviously adore and respect the series, and they even got all the voice actors!   But it just doesn't feel right.   It's like a cover band of your favorite band...they might rock out the hits and sound dead on, but it's still not the real thing.			"

												This is a great series of chapters that constiute an entire game, and pretty dang fun. It still manages to keep you playing through at least once more, if just to choose different dialogue choices or check things out in more detail.. Even though it will almost always turn out the same every time you play it. Witty, zany, and pretty much an un-doctored and un-marred Threepwood experience. Definately worth a get, but play it after you play the originals as they're considred prequals to this story-wise. Downsides are that the modeling is just barely enough to get it by.. they're certainly not pretty and it could have used some cell shading or something. The scenes are usually gorgeous though. Also the puzzle aspect and the varied scenes ventured seem a little watered down. It feels like, throughout the chapter, you end up visiting the same places over and over. Especially flotsam island. This is probably more of a limitation of making the environments 3d and detailed vs 2d backdrops. The puzzles also seem.. less, for some reason, but still maintain that whole leap of logic thing that point and click adventure game authors seemed to love making so you'd call in for hotline help because of some vague thing you didn't catch. Overal, a great addition to the monkey island series, but don't play it alone. Play it with the other monkey island titles before it first.			"

												CONCLUSION ~ 7/10 Monkey Island is back with well thought out and coherent story, trademark humor and quirky dialogs! It is a nice continuation of the series with a major flop - quality of the end product from graphical and technical perspective is on a shameful level. PROS+Monkey Island humor+fun and quirky dialogs+all chapters well connected+overall nice storyline with wacky ideas +general Monkey Island atmosphere+Murray CONS-graphics and technical side (even thought it gets better through chapters)-models of characters-mechanics of moving through field-ending is unsatisfying and finished in a hurryPERSONAL OPINION*should have stayed 2D hand-drawn*sometimes puzzles are predictable*game should have evolved some more. The general formula is still fun and tempting to play, but it would be interesting to see some new elements explored between characters and story. Deeper motives, reasons, background stories that could be intercalated into MI world, more cognitive or empathic approach to some problems that are just hinted in the game. This way it is just black and white- good and bad, love and hate. Obviously, the game creators didn't took into account that most of the fanbase playing this game is ranging from 20-40 (or more) years old.			"

												It's monkey Island. What more can I say?  The utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keyboard controls from ESCAPE FROM MONKEY ISLAND are, thankfully, dead and buried. You use the mouse, Sadly, the guy who rembered what 'Point-and-f#$!@#$-click' means was out sick the day they were deciding on movement control, but, you get used to it.   Great mood, laugh out loud funny, and no matter what Yahtzee says, it's worth the price tag.			"

												Monkey Island is one of my favorite video game IPs of all time.   The Secret Of Monkey Island was the first game I ever pirated.   I have played them all, I even played the SegaCD port of MI.    So when I heard they were making a whole new series, I was so thrilled I nearly made water in my pantaloons.   Then I got ahold of it, and well...I didn't hate it.   The problem is (and it's the same issue I had with Telltale's Sam & Max stuff) it doesn't feel like a legit Lucasarts Monkey Island game.   It feels like a fan-made game.   It's really close, and it was made with a lot of love by people who obviously adore and respect the series, and they even got all the voice actors!   But it just doesn't feel right.   It's like a cover band of your favorite band...they might rock out the hits and sound dead on, but it's still not the real thing.			"

												This is a great series of chapters that constiute an entire game, and pretty dang fun. It still manages to keep you playing through at least once more, if just to choose different dialogue choices or check things out in more detail.. Even though it will almost always turn out the same every time you play it. Witty, zany, and pretty much an un-doctored and un-marred Threepwood experience. Definately worth a get, but play it after you play the originals as they're considred prequals to this story-wise. Downsides are that the modeling is just barely enough to get it by.. they're certainly not pretty and it could have used some cell shading or something. The scenes are usually gorgeous though. Also the puzzle aspect and the varied scenes ventured seem a little watered down. It feels like, throughout the chapter, you end up visiting the same places over and over. Especially flotsam island. This is probably more of a limitation of making the environments 3d and detailed vs 2d backdrops. The puzzles also seem.. less, for some reason, but still maintain that whole leap of logic thing that point and click adventure game authors seemed to love making so you'd call in for hotline help because of some vague thing you didn't catch. Overal, a great addition to the monkey island series, but don't play it alone. Play it with the other monkey island titles before it first.			"

												CONCLUSION ~ 7/10 Monkey Island is back with well thought out and coherent story, trademark humor and quirky dialogs! It is a nice continuation of the series with a major flop - quality of the end product from graphical and technical perspective is on a shameful level. PROS+Monkey Island humor+fun and quirky dialogs+all chapters well connected+overall nice storyline with wacky ideas +general Monkey Island atmosphere+Murray CONS-graphics and technical side (even thought it gets better through chapters)-models of characters-mechanics of moving through field-ending is unsatisfying and finished in a hurryPERSONAL OPINION*should have stayed 2D hand-drawn*sometimes puzzles are predictable*game should have evolved some more. The general formula is still fun and tempting to play, but it would be interesting to see some new elements explored between characters and story. Deeper motives, reasons, background stories that could be intercalated into MI world, more cognitive or empathic approach to some problems that are just hinted in the game. This way it is just black and white- good and bad, love and hate. Obviously, the game creators didn't took into account that most of the fanbase playing this game is ranging from 20-40 (or more) years old.			"

												There isn't much too review here - if you liked the old Monkey Island games, this will scratch your itch. It's a comedic adventure game with puzzles that are not too hard, and features a slightly unusual control mechanism (WASD). It's also interesting to see the hints of what Tell Tale games would grow up to be in the long but well-directed cutscenes. It's reasonably entertaining and worth the cash these days, though to be honest i didn't really get into the story and was disappointed by the ending. A better modern adventure in the same vein is The Journey Down, in my opinion, but this is still worth a playthrough if you are an adventure fan.			"

												I'll write the same review for all 5 episodes since the gameplay is the same in each episode.The game is good and funny, I enjoyed it, but not as much as the original series.  Some puzzle are really hard to solve without hints.  I recommend it for fan of the series, but wait for it to be on sale or you might be disapointed.			"

												It's Monkey Island. And Tell Tale. And Lucasarts. And brilliant. Some puzzles are head-scratchingly stupid, but never too frustrating. VO, music, audio, art, humor, and story all top-notch.			"

												What can I say; it's Monkey Island. I had a few doubts at first, being a diehard fan of the original games, but Telltale has been able to capture the heart, humor, spirit, and charm of the original games perfectly while still providing its own unique spin. If you're a fan of the original games, a fan of adventure games period, or just want a game that can tease your brain just as skillfully as it splits your side, this is a game you can't miss.			"
