												I honestly havent played a game like this before. It's kind of an action adventure with one of the strangest settings I've seen in a game. The biggest plus in this game is the humour. The game is one big joke (in a good way ;)  ). I've been laughing out loud a few times while playing this game, and this doesnt happen often to me. Does Adult Swim ring a bell? Do you like absurd humour like Robot Chicken? Then you should really check this out. Oh, and it has one of the coolest intro's I've seen in a game. Who needs cinematics when you can make something like this?Finished it in about 3.5 hoursThere's not much to say else then spoilers, so I leave it at this. It's definately worth checking out!			"

I recommend purchasing this title on sale, due to the short play-time and limited content.+ Quirky and over-the-top sound effects+ Interesting and surreal character models and design choices+ HIlarious abstract humor; some of it is really quite clever, and I've found myself brought to tears with laughter on several occasions+ There are myriad extras, minigames, and funny activities scattered around the playable areas+ Has a sense of charm and humor reminiscient of The Stanley Parable, and should resonate well with fans of the game+ Littered with clever references+ Minigames introduce a variety of playstyles and visual effects- Unforgivably short playtime (1-2 hours), especially for what is otherwise such a unique and underrated title- Little practical replayability, save for the achievementsLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												This is the ultimate comedy game. Don't let the short length of the game fool you, take your time and explore, there is spurts of comedic hilarity everywhere. If you're a fan of games like The Stanley Parable and Conkers Bad Fur Day Jazzpunk is right up your aisle. Gameplay is great as well!I have a first look review as well as playthrough below if you're interested.

												Jazzpunk is a unique game with a style all its own that feels like a surrealistic 1950s retro spy meets Ren and Stimpy cartoon silliness. You play in a first person perspective, interacting with several things, exploring rich, colorful, living, breathing surrealistic areas. The surrealistic art style blends with the humor really well. The only controls are jump and action buttons with left stick to move, and right stick to look around or keyboard controls to do the same things. You can get items and switch between them. There are plenty of mini games that feel more like diversions to keep you engaged. Its parodies of other games and media, yet it feels distinctly like its own product.You work for a spy agency that sends you to far away locales with serious objectives, things like infiltrate a USSR building, follow a cowboy in Japan to get his mechanical kidney, infiltrate a criminal's lavish retro penthouse and you'll even be sent on a Polynesian vacation. There are spies, madmen, robots, crazy bums and women around every corner.The big feature here for me is the interactivity and exploration. You can interact with boxes, newspaper machines, spray pigeon perfume on NPCs to see pigeons carry them away, drink mouthwash only to discover its chlorine, use a master baster on a turkey, freeze a frozen meal in a microwave, scribble lipstick on your face, collect spiders in a jar to throw them at people, break every vase in a shop trying to swat flies. It all feels so interesting and engaging to do what I want to in this crazy world. While NPCs are faceless box people (or robots) with circle heads, NPCs say several things, most of which are hilarious and I don't usually like comedy in games. The eccentric off the wall comedy and parody really hit the mark for me, when most comedy games feel forced.Jazzpunk parodies several games like Frogger, Wave Race in a fountain of gravy, mini golf with pool cues, virtual tennis, Wedding Quake against a bride, groom and priest, a zombie pizza game, a high score game where you play a cat ripping things to shreds, a game of Twister, finding prizes with a metal detector and so much more. It all kept me playing, even if it all was just easy fun.It is definitely worth a playthrough, I found myself taking far too many screen shots at the crazy things I'd see. Things in the background, men in cullender hats with wheeled pigs on the background and my radio tooth on the floor. Its never in your face, its all just there for you to find it.There is no death in the game, even if you plunge off of the fourth floor of your Polynesian hideaway, you still bounce on the ground. With that being said, you can still fail the mini games. Frogger took quite a beating and I lost a lot in Wedding Quake before I realized the rose rocket launcher was win. It is an easy game, again, the point is to explore, interact and laugh.Is it worth the $15? Maybe and I'm surprised to say that, even if its only 2 or 3 hours to complete. The ending came pretty abruptly and even the credits have their own flare to them. I can imagine its not for everyone and I never thought it would be for me. I am shocked at how much enjoyment I got from Jazzpunk and I might have to play through it again.			"

												The 1960's were a strange time, atomic paranoia fueled the cold war as the space race allowed mankind to make monumental leaps forward technologically. Global espionage was the tool with which the cold war was fought as agents from both of the world's super powers battled for information and technology. Amidst all of this, counter culture exploded and use of psychedelics became a new past time. Jazzpunk uses this period of time as an aesthetic springboard for it's comedic hijinx and in doing so plays out like an episode of Saturday Night Live with an overarching theme to it's skits.  It would probably be most appropriate to categorize Jazzpunk as an adventure game, as players are placed in the role of Polyblank, a secret agent who is dispatched from an abandoned subway station on various missions by a character known as The Director and each one of these misadventures is kicked off by swallowing a pill. The narrative is flimsy, and each mission plays out almost like a skit. An antagonist is introduced in the later missions and helps provide some closure to the game's events. Jazzpunk focuses more on humor than plot and it makes this the kind of experience that you turn on, tune in and drop out of. It assaults players with non sequiturs and irreverent easter eggs. Players can expect to stumble across a frogger style mini game, wander around in an Evil Dead inspired setting made out of pizza, play mini golf with a James Bond style villain and beat up a passenger car Street Fighter II style. It's a tribute to all things nerdy with plenty of tech based humor and refrences to other games. The Adult Swim style humor, a style that makes it seem like being in an altered state of consciousness is a prerequisite to enjoy, is likely to put off many. Also potentially off putting is just how easy the puzzles are in Jazzpunk. Most players will find themselves progressing unopposed since most levels are as simple as following the instructions laid out in the objectives screen. There are a handful of side quests but they have no bearing on the proceedings and generally exist to provoke a few laughs. Some of the diversions like Wedding Quake, a wedding themed spoof of the classic arena shooter may hold players attention for a decent amount of time but the whole of Jazzpunk lasts a few hours at most and offers little replayability. Think of Jazzpunk as more of an alternative to watching a comedy film than a game poised to occupy a dozen hours of your life. It could be argued that Jazzpunk is most rewarding when you are avoiding the critical path since interacting with random objects and poking your nose around generally uncovers the best easter eggs and gags. The aesthetics of Jazzpunk leave a favorable impression. Seemingly modeled after Thirty Flights of Loving, it employs blocky characters with simple animations and cell shaded styling. The funky soundtrack adds to the unique flavor of the game making it feel like nothing else as well as helping sell the off beat humor. The aestetics, soundtrack and gameplay click together like legos, delivering a unique experience that in spite of the fact that it borrows liberally from other works. Jazzpunk is kind of a nightmare game for reviewers... To describe it in terms of the quality of it's gameplay, visuals and the amount of time players can wring out of it simply misses the point of the game. Potential Jazzpunk players should think of it instead as an interactive comedy experiment. An off beat experiment. While it may not stand out as a great game it is a little experimental indie gem that may have an impact on the humor and style of other titles. Turn on, tune in and drop out.			"

												It's really funny. Like genuinely funny. Not ha ha video game funny. It's over very quickly though. If you don't enjoy exploring worlds and poking around corners, you will not enjoy this game. If you have a bad sense of humor, you will not enjoy this game. If you make long posts on internet forums about how games aren't about deep mechanics anymore, you will not enjoy this game. You will enjoy this game if you like movies like Airplane! or Naked Gun and view this in a similar way. A couple of hours with some absurd humor.			"

												Created by Necrophone games and in assosiaction with Adult Swim, Jazzpunk is a schizophrenic mashup of arcade gaming, excellent comedy and a twisted story of spies and subterfuge. And let me tell you something that you can bank in the Kremlin – THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC and I fully recommend you get this with all the speed and grace of a methadrone addict with a pad of empty prescription paper.The art style of the game is delightfully toony with blocky characters and colourful levels aplenty. In this Alternative Cold War world, everyone is a robot and everthing is vibrant and full of energy. It’s a very simplistic style but everything is delivered in such a tight manner that it still manages to ooze style.I actually find it hard to describe what Jazzpunk actually is as it exists as a pastische of many other gameplay styles. First Person Shooters, arcade games, golf games, tennis, survival horrors, all fall together like an Andy Pollock painting and it just...works! What could be shallow gameplay expereinces as bolstered by dialogue that is so hilarious it could make Rob Schneider actually appear funny. The dialogue is hands down some of the best I have ever heard. I wouldn’t be able to fit in the amount of jokes and sight gags that made me really laugh as that would basically be the entire game, but trust me when I say that you will WANT to talk to all of the inhabitants in each level as each reels of some excellent quote fodder.I fully recommend this title and anyone looking for a fresh experience filled to the brims with laughs will not regret picking this up. Jazzpunk is alone in what it is and therefore the best at what it doesFULL VIDEO REVIEW HERE -

Game DetailsGenre: Adventure, IndieDeveloper: Necrophone Games Publisher: Adult Swim Games	Release Date: 8 Feb, 2014Completionist Gameplay: 2 HoursJazzpunk is a very difficult game to explain. You are introduced to its Adult Swim-esque humour when your Director requires you to sit on a whoopee cushion in his office that is situated in an abandoned train cart before he explains your first mission to you. Jazzpunk gives you the feeling when you find a secret room or an easter egg in other games, except this time it lasts the whole game.You’ll pillow fight a girl out of a window. You’ll be kissed by a homeless guy. You’ll dig up Han Solo, squirt pufferfish poison into people's faces, shave a man with a weedwacker and have to make your way through a crocodile person’s digestive track. The game seems to be set in an augmented reality based in the 1950’s, an odd and never done before combination. Each chapter of Jazzpunk is fairly open world and requires you to complete an assortment of random tasks using your creativity in order to progress. While these tasks do push the plot forward, they seem only to motivate you to explore and find the secrets and jokes that Necrophone Games have hidden throughout the game.The gameplay is simple and you cannot lose, even when you actually are. After you finish the game you get the option to replay each chapter separately if you’re looking to get those achievements without having to repeat the entire game. In a game dependent on the ‘wow factor’ keeping you entertained the first time you play through it, it’s a wonderful option and certainly is a positive.We all know that achievements games are sometimes tedious and boring. Jazzpunk has somehow managed to make theirs funny and worth playing through the game again to achieve them all. One of them requires you to dial certain four letter words into a phone booth, while another requires you to paralyze yourself after jumping from a diving board.There are multiple mini games you can complete ranging from zombie pizzas, a cat simulator where you need to destroy expensive items to Wedding Quake (where you kill brides and grooms in order to stay single and collect powerups like a pre-nup) that will keep you on your toes and entertained. Although the last chapter of the game falls short and feels a little disappointing, Jazzpunk is still overall a hilarious game, and everyone should give it a shot.If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!

												A psychedelic drug trip through the 50’s or so it seems, Jazzpunk is packed with many little humorous things to discover, weird people to meet, and fun levels to visit. So put on your crazy hat, sit back and enjoy.You are Polyblank who is sent on missions to recover some stolen goods and discover some things are not what they seem. There is voice acting while words are projected onto the characters and areas around the screen. You can do weird things like clean out a guy’s bat ears with a giant q-tip you find on the ground. Many funny stuff happens in this game that had me laughing many times. My kids watched some of it too and really got a kick out of it. Why not get in a pillow fight and knock the girl out the window or spray pigeon perfume on someone and watch the pigeons attack. These are just a few funny things to see.The game is short though and can be finished in about 3-4 hours but that won’t take away and fun or experience. The $15 price tag is a little high but if you catch this on sale pick it up because it is a great game to experience. I would have loved to play more and hope maybe the devs will put out some add-on content or maybe a sequel. Probably won’t happen but I can always dream. It reminded me of Thirty Flights of Loving with its art style and somewhat similar story telling. Also if you are an achievement hunter they are all pretty easy to achieve and also fun to earn. Don’t miss out on this must play game.Bear Rating: 9/10			"

												What did I just played..Jazzpunk, it's a game that... eh. Is it a game? Let me explain.You're a special agent, and you get missions to achieve. Until stuff happen and you have to save someone (I won't spoil it).Yea, the story is pretty weird and not much clear, but it fits into the game perfectly.The style its pretty simple and cartoonish, but really original and good looking, the settings its like a 60s spy movie, with all the prerecorded sounds you have heard in a lot of classic movies (yes, they have the Wilhelm Scream).The humor is great. I love it. It kinda feels a little bit like a Monty Python adventure. It's all set up to take you by surprise, and it works super-well.The gameplay itself it's pretty easy, a sort of first-person adventure game. Even tho looks easy, it's a lot of fun to play. Expecially if you have to pick a nose to open a door or stuff like these.The music is probably the main problem. I mean, it works a lot since it all sounds like a 60s movie, but it's way too ripetitive and loud.Also, it is pretty short. It only took me 2 hours and a half to finish it 100%. And that's a shame, I was seriously hoping to last at least around 5-6 hours. Oh well, it was all fun.Final rating: 7/10Great game, you you will love it if you have a sense of humor that doesen't stop to poop jokes.			"

												Jazzpunk is...well it's...umm...hmm...Sitting here having finished the game, I haven't the least bit of an idea how I'm supposed to describe the bloody insanity that is Jazzpunk. I could say it's a psychedelic love letter to obscure references; an outrageous consolidation of ridiculous moments and hilarious dialog, brought to life with a bizarre art style and deadpan delivery. But what is Jazzpunk really? Well I guess it's all of these things and so much more; an barrage of creativity held together by forces beyond our understanding. It's insane and absurd, and I love it so much.Set in an alternate history Cold War era Japan, you take on the role of Polyblank: espionage extraordinaire, who has been contracted to obtain confidential information from a top secret soviet headquarters. Utilizing prescription medicine and his many skills, from being able to speak to inanimate boxes to throwing popcorn on fellow theatergoers, he's the obvious man for the job and perhaps the only sane person left in this world (assuming he even is).From the opening moments (which are absolutely brilliant, I might add) Jazzpunk pulls you by the throat down its rabbit hole of computer puns, pigeon degaussing, stick people, and Hunter S. Thompson. It's a mad, mad world that revels in its own absurdity and pulls it off with a consistency and potency that defies reason, but proves nonetheless hilarious and even nostalgic, pulling and referencing things I thought I'd forgotten so many years ago.Jazzpunk exists in a vacuum of its own insanity; a colossus monument to the sheer power of imagination, and perhaps the closest thing to a videogame cult classic I've ever seen. I have no doubts that there will be people that ""just don't get it"", find it too simple a game, or otherwise fail to appreciate its genius and that's fine. It isn't a game for everyone, but for those that harbor a love for technology jokes, deadpan humor, and the plain bizarre, Jazzpunk's surreal brilliance is hard to miss.			"

												An excellent first-person espionage adventure game kinda thing. Though there's lots of self-aware comedy and surreal interactive weirdness thrown in too, kind of like the movie Top Secret or The Naked Gun meets the games Panic! and The Standley Parable. Sort of. Honestly, Jazzpunk is unlike just about anything I've played.You play Polyblank, an agent for some kind of agency, based in an alternate-universe cyberpunk Cold War. Oh yeah and there's some random jazz thrown in there as well, hence the name. Random seems to be a word thrown around a lot when describing this game, and for good reason: it's all over the place in its references and absurdist humor. And while it feels a bit ham-fisted at first, like it's trying to set a world record for most pop culture references per square meter, I found the experience to be thoroughly enjoyable after I completed a mission or two. So yeah, what happens is that you'll be given increasingly bizarre missions every so often, which is done in increasingly bizarre ways. Sometimes it'll be as simple as infiltrating a soviet installation or tailing an American, other times you'll have to do something like catch and roast a robot pig or exterminate rogue microchips in a kitchen. While you can just go from point A to point B completing your objectives, you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice, as it's all the stuff in-between that really makes Jazzpunk a worthwhile experience.Being in a cyberpunk world filled with robots, the references to nerd culture are all over the place. Gaming culture as well, with minigames like Wedding Quake, an homage to Quake III Arena where you shoot wedding party members with champagne and collect prenup agreements. And a reference to Street Fighter II's car-smashing sequence, but done in the first person and with just a bit more humor. Things like this are every few steps in this game and it just put a huge grin on my face. Most of it's not laugh aloud kinda stuff, but I can't help but love bits where you find a 3DO console in the sand, or have to pour coffee onto a Commodore PET to proceed. Granted, it risks alienating some players if they're not familiar with these in-jokes, but with as wide of a spectrum as the comedy covers, chances are you'll find something in here to make you laugh, or at least exhale sharply and chuckle to yourself. I honestly don't have any noteworthy complaints about the game, just a couple minor things like some objectives being a bit obtuse to figure out and the humor being hit or miss depending on individual preferences. Also, there's the game length. You can complete it in about an hour if you just speed through it, but you'll miss a ton of awesome stuff. It takes two and a half to three hours if you take your time, so Whether or not the game is worth the asking price of $15 is up to you. Personally I found the game to be a breath of fresh air and I had a blast just wanting to see what absolutely freaking strangeness was coming up next. So if you see anything you like here, why not give Jazzpunk a shot, especially if it's on sale.			"

												Jazzpunk is a very fun game, chock-full of references and jokes. The gameplay is very simple however. You just walk around and click on things mostly. The people in-game will give you a lot of cheesy lines and funny comments.This game is very short and doesn't have that much replayability if you ask me. Only if you wanna go for all the achievement and maybe see some things you missed out on the first time. You can run through the game super fast if you don't explore the levels fully, however you should do that because it's very detailed and fun. I laughed a lot while I played this and I really like the soundtrack too. You should absolutely play this game at some point, but you might want to pick it up on sale because it's short and doesn't have much replayability, or anything else you can do besides the singleplayer story either.

												Jazzpunk is a fun game, but after playing through and analyzing my 2 hours spent playing it, no, I wouldn't recommend it.You'll have a few consecutive thoughts while playing this game:1. Wow, what a silly, quirky and unique game. 2. This is getting kind of repetitive, but the NPCs say amusing things.3. How long is this game?4. Oh good, it's over.The game started off well but quickly fell into a funk of bland.  It's good that it's short, but that hinders the idea of paying $15 for this. If given a chance, I wouldn't have paid more than 5.  Also, I ran into a few bugs. Stuff like getting knocked off the map, having to restart a chapter because I did something out of the linear order, and the game completely locking up.			"

												Went back and finished Jazzpunk today. This game...is...a....trip....super bizarre. Funny as hell as well. Kind of buggy, but not game breaking buggy. Sort of a Hunter S Thompson novel as interpreted by Adult Swim...sort of. I would absolutely recommend this for people who want to experience something completely unique and interesting. I suspect every experience playing this game will be fairly unique given all the various things available to experience during a play through. I think my own weighed in at around 3 1/2 hours or so, but I also didnt do everything in the game. You could literally take in the visuals for a couple hours if you really wanted to.So, definitely play this, but also track the technical issues thread in this games community hub. There definitely are some. For me however, they weren't that big of a deal, and the game was such a rewarding experience that they were easy to overlook.			"

												Jazzpunk is one of the funniest things I've ever played. Its humor is very unique, and it always makes me laugh, and to be honest, that was the main reason I kept playing. The puzzles, while simple, were great, but it was the comedy that kept me going. It is like that friend who goes ""I'm sooo random"" except this game actually is. It is lovely, and I suggest you try it if you need a little lift me up or just love funny games in general.			"

												Jazzpunk is a short, but compact experience. It reminded me a lot of those games like Gus goes to cybertown I used to play as a child, where you would see a screen and click everything to make funny things happen. Only in this, you're exploring a 3D space in the first person perspective and the humor is more adult.I definitely liked exploring all levels and ""clicking"" everything to see what would happen. Sometimes you click something and a sperarate minigame with a twist starts. At one point you open a pizza box and start a kind of survival game with pizza zombies. Some might say that they throw those in your face too often, but I liked it. When I finished the game, I went through it again to get the achievments I hadn't yet gotten and discovered a lot of small things I didn't even think to do on my first run.The only reason someone might not like this is if it's not their humor. I guess you could just look up gameplay of the very beginning, and if you even have to smirk about it, you should get this game.			"

												No idea where to start when it comes to describing the game as its very very weird, mostly in a good way. Guess I would describe it of an action adventure of sorts with a lot of quirky humour and a big dose of pure insanity. I know that this game wont be for everyone and a lot of people will straight up hate/dislike it from the get-go. Personally I had a great time and would play a DLC/expansion/sequel to it in a heartbeat.The achievements for this game are for various misc. objectives for either just progressing in the game or exploring the levels and find certain things to do. You might stumble across some of them by just playing normally and testing everything you encounter, but would recommend taking a look at the achievement list and try to figure out what you need to do (which can still be a challenge).Time to 100%: 3-4 hours			"

												Jazzpunk completely flew under my radar back when it came out. I got the game and it took me almost a year to go and play through all of it and I was missing out on one of the craziest most bizarre games I've ever played. In Jazzpunk you play as a spy who goes onto different missions all around the world. Each mission takes place in a different location. Each location has a different set of goals for you to achieve also it has a bunch of side stuff and each location is packed with a lot of with stuff to see and interact with.Each missions has mini games ranging from a race game to a quake type of shooter. It's all incredibly funny and enjoyable and the constant jokes and awesome moments make you keep playing until the credits start rolling.Graphically Jazzpunk has a really bizarre art style. It's hard to explain, but in general the game looks pleasing to the eye. Audio design is also really good. I love the music and the voice acting for the characters even though you can't understand what anyone is saying most of the time.The game isn't hard what so ever. You can't fail, so players looking for a challenge will have to look elsewhere as there's no challenge what so ever in this game.It took me 2 hours to finish the game and get every achievement. After doing everything there's no replay value, but I would come back in the future to the game and play it again, cause it was so much fun.Overall Jazzpunk is a great game, it's funny and it's a great time. If you're looking for a game to play and a have a good time look no further Jazzpunk has you covered.Final Rating:8/10Pros:+ Funny+ Different gameplay elements keep you playingCons:- Too short			"

												So I played through this game, got all of the achievements, and I'm still at a loss of what it was all about. Jazzpunk is a cartoon. There are games with cartoony graphics, some that are actually based off of cartoons, but Jazzpunk is straight-up Tex Avery. If you've never heard of the guy, you're missing out. He directed a ton of hilarious shorts back in the mid-20th century that still hold up today. His directorial style resulted in wacky, off-kilter, crass, and sometimes totally ridiculous cartoons.There is a plot to Jazzpunk, but it's designed solely to set up as many gags as possible. Apparently you're a spy, and your mission is to infiltrate various locations and steal super-important stuff. I can't say much else because, since this is an interactive-adventure game, it'll ruin a lot of the jokes & surprises. I can give you a vague idea of what to expect though. Almost every chapter consists of an area you can explore. There are objects and citizens you can interact with, and there's some very light puzzle-solving as well. Everything is set up as part of the experience, so whatever happens you just roll with it.  It's impossible to die and there are no fail-states for your mission, so there's no sense of danger or urgency. It's important to note that this is a very short game. Anyone should be able to get all of the achievements in less than two hours. There are plenty of secrets and things to try at least, but that's still less than four hours of game-time. If we're speaking strictly in terms of value, you don't have to look hard to find titles with more game for less money. However if you, like I, happened upon this game due to its appearance in a bundle, then I definitely recommend exploring it.			"

												Jazzpunk starts off strong and remains strong for about half of the game, but it only takes about three hours to play.  It's got some good laughs and a fair amount of entertaining minigames along with a few sidequests that (sort of) impact the main story.  I enjoyed it; I can't recommend it at the current price tag of $11.99 and it's insane to pay $14.99.			"

												I first i was taken in by the colorful world and the cliche spy setting. But after the first mission, it became clear that the game is just a bunch of random places that is just a pretense to make a lot of jokes on the side. The actual ""game"" and ""fun"" of Jazzpunk is to check every object and NPC in the game, to hunt for all the jokes the developpers added. Though some of theses jokes did made me chuckle, none of them stick as particularly witty or worth remembering. Also, many of the jokes are a reference to something else (most notably 90s video games), so are only funny if you actually share the same reference. I suspect people younger than 20 years old will actually miss many of the jokes, just because they don't share the same references. The overall story and the missions you're supposed to do just feel like a todo list to complete and unlock another place full of side jokes. Since you're eating hallucinatory pills to get from place to place, anything is ""acceptable"", and the overall world is mostly a bunch of unrelated places strung together. The first level is probably the best one, and the more crazy the game gets, the less interesting it is.Thankfully, even if you spend time trying to find as many of the hidden stuff as possible, the game shouldn't waste more than 4h or 5h of your time. I was very glad it was finished, and i don't plan on coming back at all.PS : Warning, i got motion sick while playing this game (especially during mission 1), and after checking the forum it seems that I'm not the only one : several people experienced the same thing. I don't know exactly what causes it, but it's probably due to how the character moves in a very colorful world.			"

												It’s a pretty fun and quirky little game.I’m fairly sure I either got this game as a gift or traded for it, as I’m far too stingy to pay £10.99 for an indie game. For that much I think that it is a little too short maybe. I don’t really have a problem with short games if the quality exceeds the quantity of time you spend playing it. This game however, despite how charming and amusing it actually is, is probably lacking a bit on the content side for that kind of price range. With that said I really enjoyed this game. It’s random and wacky and I love seeing more surreal takes on video games like this. This is something that is just light hearted and fun.You start with an interesting, almost movie-like, intro and then you generally do various little missions for your boss on a chapter per chapter kind of basis. You can return to any of the chapters easily via the chapter select option in the menu, which makes going back for achievements to 100% this game extremely easy. There isn’t that much of a story to this game, so nothing too compelling. But the game keeps it’s interest in it’s little details and oddities for you to find and explore.It has a good sense of humor and had me smiling to myself quite a bit and the graphics are bright and cartoon-like which if anything just adds more to the general craziness of the game. All in all this was a fun way to kill a few hours. It’s amusing and an easy 100%ed game.TL;DR : Quirky, surreal, humorous and easy to 100% despite it being a little too short for the asking price I would say.			"

So I just want to reinterate just how much fun this game is.  There is not only a story/mission mode, but there are a lot of easter eggs thrown in through the game.  This is also a good game for achievements and trading cards.I had no problem running this game, no crashes, ran smoothly, and I played it with k/m.While I recommend adding this to your library, I do feel as though this games price should be dropped to $4.99 or so at this point.  It's been out a while and a price drop would help bring attention back to this awesome game.			"

												Jazzpunk imagines itself in the same family as classic Leslie Nielsen (Airplane!, The Naked Gun) and Mel Brooks (Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs) films, reveling in absurdity. What Jazzpunk lacks from the classic films it's emulating is sharp timing. To be fair, setting the pace is a lot more difficult in a video game than a movie, and I can respect Jazzpunk for trying, but ultimately, it felt clumsy and awkward. Further held back by a mountain of glitches and unsatisfying controls, I cannot recommend this game.			"

They even have many easter eggs about old things, such as the big as a room pc's and the man from uncle references. There all great for those of us older gamers that remember such things in real life.This game is not for everyone, but if you want a weird game about being a spy in a 1970's fake virtual pc world, this game is it.I recommend this game for weirdness, 1970 nostalgia, and being in a pc virtual world as a spy.

												PLEASE NOTE, MY TIME IS BUGGED DUE TO INTERNET PROBLEMS. TIME IS PROBABLY AROUND 4-5 HOURS.So, games and comedy. Sometimes that is an absolute MESS of a combo. A combo which should never work. But Jazzpunk. Wow, does this game do such an amazing job of it. The comedy in this game is crude and sometimes dark. But the comedy aspect of the game just works! Alright, so walking away from the comedy side of the game, let's consider the actual gameplay. The gameplay is smooth. I mean, really smooth. This is one of those games that you could honestly just play again and again because of the controls. The turning is responsive, the controls are tight and stiff. Just amazingly well done with how they made the controls work.As you progress in the game, there are no massive learning curves or any new ""gizmos"" which can help you. This is no way makes the game boring. The game always has something to keep you on your toes, be it trimming a man's back hair or just putting lipstick on your character to glamourize yourself. Speaking of the game having no ""learning curves"" I deem it important to tell you all that the game has pretty much ANYTHING you can do. Hell, there's an achievement for just freakin' using a metal detector and finding treasure! And what does the treasure do for you? Nothing, zilch, 0! And is it good? Hell yeah it's good! The ability to do those quirky little things just for the sake of it is totally unique and something that is rarely done in games.Speaking of that, most games will have you do some grindy-bore-fest task just to get yourself some better gear or loot. This game just allows you to do it for free! You can choose to do it, there's nothing to gain OR lose from it. And that's good. It rewards players with an achievement - which most people don't care about, so they don't have to bother with it. I know this is sounding like a ramble now, so let me sum this one part up.- Doing things for an achievement is good.- Making sure that the game isn't grindy is good.- Not making the player more powerful for something that they can do which others may not want to do.This game has side missions. And do you get any neat items from it? Nope! Anything at all? Well, yes. A few have achievements which is why I did them, so there's achievements for all you achievement hunters. Speaking of achievements, this game is perfect for all you achievement hunters. The achievements are easy to get, fun to achieve and actually feel rewarding. The game will make you go out of your way for some and others.. Well for others you just gotta play the game!This game, is just breath-takingly unique. The comedy element is just too well done to the point that you don't get sick of it and you don't feel like you want more. There's a perfect balance of gameplay and comedy. The game doesn't shove the jokes in your face going ""LOOK WE MADE A FUNNY, WE EXPECT YOU TO LAUGH,"" instead they make it so that you know the joke and that it's going to bring a small grin to your face. Be it the cheesiest joke ever, or a woman falling out a window from a bomb♥♥♥♥♥pillow fight!So, do I recoomend this game? Yes. 100% YES. Honestly, if you're looing for a game to spice up your library and make you giggle like an idiot for a few hours, get this game. Sure, it's short but it has a bunch of replay value and side missions. The achievements are fun to get and easy to get, so yeah. Get this game for a memorable little gem. Enjoy the review? Please consider checking out my curator! I recommend many games similar to this one. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JacksGamesOfChoice#curation "

Posted: January 4, 2015
												On first glance, Jazzpunk looks like the larger and grander version of Gravity Bone (Or Thirty Flights of Loving), offering lots to see and do. With advertising as confident as it was, it looked like it would be a pretty solid title, despite the fact that it was never disclosed exactly what you did in it. The trailers showed a few setpieces and environments, the screenshots showed a large world to explore and the key features mentioned ""Half a dozen jokes"" and an original soundtrack. I was never hyped for the game before release, and only heard of it recently. So when I went into Jazzpunk, with no expectations or knowledge of what it was and came out disappointed, I know something went wrong.The first ten or so minutes seemed promising. A well done intro set up the tone and feel of the game, but never did anything with them. You spend the mission faffing about in environments with a multitude of things to do, but with none of them interesting. While the tasks themselves resemble point and click adventure games in which there is little logic and a lot of dull things to do, the humour is referencial and circumstantial. Go to a cinema, annoy the patrons while watching a repeated advertisement from the 1950's. Go and spray people with bird pheromones, watch them get covered in birds. Go and contemplate how dull this game is, then listen to the same looped track for the fourth time. In these sections, there is nothing of substance or worth, and these are the main part of the game!Intersperced between these prolonged sections of bland mediocrity are the occasional part that requires actual skill, like playing Frogger or Space Invaders. That's right, this game is so insubstantial it relies on games that are the best part of two or three decades old. These mini-games also come in the form of Duck Hunt, Quake, Virtual Boy 3D Tennis and more that are either rip-off other (Better) games or just made without any thought put into them. As they try to do a variety of old games, it fails to do any of them well and they all end up being the same (If not lesser) than whatever they were replicating, and as such there's no personality in these mini-games. Quake is thinly disguised as Wedding Qake, which is a watered down version with uninspired designs for everything inside the mini-game. Near the end, there are several of these re-used mini-games in a row which you're supposed to lose for the story to go on, with no prior knowledge that you failing was vital to what little plot there is, and as most of these mini-games control poorly, you end up putting a fair amount of effort into something you inevitably lose, which is always annoying.This is generally the part where, if you haven't already, you talk about the story and memorable parts, however in this case I'll mention the lack of each. The plot is pushed along by your pre-mission briefings, and the occasional scripted sequence. None of those flashy scripted sequences shown in the trailers mind you, those never really happen. Instead you have these very slow and unexciting sections in which you go from point A to point B, maybe knocking down a few people if you go out of your way for it. There is no sense of pacing whatsoever, and anything interesting it has to offer to shows off as soon as it can shoe-horn in a bad punchline.In addition to that, the minimal amount of interaction required is plagued by some rather bizarre technical issues. Mouse smoothing and acceleration change from time to time with no reason or indication that it's happened. The artstyle itself can be off-putting from time to time, so having your mouse go completely nuts combined may lead to motion sickness, especially in the penultimate level in where you're inside some sort of technical difficulties area, complete with bluescreens and enough whizzy things to make your head spin. That and the layout of the level may lead to headaches, without factoring in problems with mouse acceleration or smoothing. Using a gamepad works well, thankfully, and I reccomend that if you can play through Jazzpunk with a controller that you do. There's no real challenge here, so anyone can use a controller with ease in Jazzpunk.Jazzpunk reminds me of Borderlands in a way. The admittedly nifty artstyle and its brand of humour (If you can call it that) are just a cover for an insubstantial game with horrible gameplay and a lack of a plot. Unlike Borderlands however, Jazzpunk doesn't have moments of catharsis or entertaining distractions from the main quest. Despite all of that, Jazzpunk is well intentioned and with a little more thought put into the humour and gameplay, it may even stand up as a game, not just a sightseeing tour.For more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview "

												After seeing the zany trailers and the recommended reviews, I was intrigued and pretty excited to play. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. I'm all for bizarre and wacky gameplay, but the lack of any deeper overarching storyline or humor to tie it all together quickly makes the game bland, predictable and forgettable. If you're the kind of person that finds endless video game and pop-culture references hilarious, I could probably recommend this game to you. If not, I wouldn't pay any more than a few dollars for the cheap laughs you'll get out of it. It's also very short. You'd be lucky to get more than 2 hours of gameplay out of it. Having said that, the art style is pretty cool, and ""Wedding Quake"" was quite fun. 2/10.			"

												If you enjoyed Gravity Bone, check this one out. It reminds me of that, but a little less tight. There’s just a little bit of puzzle and minigame holding it together, but mostly it’s about poking everything to see how it reacts. It’s one of the only comedy exploration games I can think of.Some jokes fall a little flat, but it ranks super high on jokes-per-minute. There’s definitely a lot that caught me by surprise for a chuckle. The use of cartoon sound effects and physics slapstick are perfect. I like how the game references are lighthearted puns and not malicious jabs.The story has a nice flow to it. They’re good about setting up a formula and then breaking it to keep things interesting. I love the look of the more surreal environments.			"

7/10 Aesthetically a masterpiece, gameplaywise not so muchNOT suitable for EPILEPTICS, can cause SEIZURESJazzpunk (2014) is the first Steam game developed by Necrophone Games. And while the art and sound design both are amazing, it ultimately falls short in gameplay, narrative, and cohesion. After the more than stellar introduction to the game’s world, players spend the rest of this two hour long spy comedy pretty much walking around while the premise disappears further and further into the background and the jokes start to wear thin around the middle of it all. Players slip into the role of secret agent Polyblank in a Cold War-esque world and have to retrieve things from the enemy so his organization can do other things. None of it matters, however, as players will shortly lose investment in the story altogether.


Right you are. 
A Screenshot of Jazzpunk

Jazzpunk lacks an appealing game mechanic but also misses both agency and payoff to compensate for that – meaning that at the end, there is not a whole lot to talk about. Around the third mission, Kai Tak Beach Resort, things start to turn dull as players realize that they have basically seen everything and that the game is not headed anywhere. There are no puzzles, perils, or high points. The areas feel disconnected, talking to non-player characters leads nowhere, several gags are not linked to anything, and some of the quips don’t have any punchlines to them, with a number of them simply referring to things that only make sense if one knows the source material. The Frogger, Space Invaders, and Wave Race segments try to bring variety to the monotony, but end up feeling very alien, as if they are only in the game because the developers knew how to program them.

ConclusionNecrophone Games and Adult Swim Games did a phenomenal job with the audio-visual presentation of Jazzpunk. Sadly, as there isn’t anything to do in the game, there also isn’t too much to revisit or to remember either. In my initial playthrough it took around two hours to complete the story and another 2.3 hours to play through it again, this time getting the achievements I missed and attempting to get out of bounds. The game definitely starts off strong and maybe future titles will be able to build on that momentum to create a truly great experience.


Got it.

RATING - NEUTRALSince you can only rate products as recommending them or not, I have decided to opt for not recommending this game, however my feeling for the game are fairly neutral and I will outline this in my review.Jazzpunk is a game I received from a friend some time ago now, it is a game I really wanted to play and experience, upon viewing some footage of it, I write a review now after some time has passed, because I feel it is important to wait a good amount of time after playing / completing a game, to assess whether it's a game that you can find within your heart to always return to, something that is rare in many modern titles.Jazzpunk is not one of those games, if you see how many hours I have on the game it is 3.2 hours, and this is more or less how long it will take you to complete the game 100% and unlock all achievements, this is a very short game, something I've been keen to avoid as of recently, you will be able to complete this game in roughly 2 hours while still experiencing everything the game has to offer, and the game levels do pack in a ton of things to see and I dedicated the time within each level to exploring every single area, every single pixel to get the most out of the game. Perhaps if I didn't spend so much time the first play through doing this, I may have considered revisiting the games areas to find new things, but even if that were the case, you're still not going to get more than a few hours worth of entertainment from this game.This is the main reason why I cannot recommend this game and my reasons are bias, I grew up with the majority of online games being the free flash based games, in which just as much effort was put into making games that could keep you entertained for a few hours, and have huge replayability, and these were uploaded for free to many free flash gaming hubs, for people to enjoy. I feel as if this way of experiencing games online is shifting, as many indie developers make these kinds of games and sell them for $10 or more rather than making them available to everyone. This game in some respects is an exception, it is extremely well made and thought out, and I would definitely pay money to play a game such as this, but is it worth the full retail price of £11? No, definitely not (although that might be a subjective viewpoint). This is one of those games that you really have to get on a sale when it's down to £4 or something that reflects it's price better. What I expect from a game that costs more than £10 is something that will keep me entertained for roughly 20 hours +, something which a lot of indie games fail to provide unfotunately. If a lot more time has been put into expanding this game into many more levels, to bring it up to the quality we expect from a good video game, and what those who grew up with gaming have come to expect, then certainly this game could be huge, instead it simply leaves memories in my mind for a few weeks and then it sits gathering dust in my steam library as i fail to ever find a reason to replay it again. For all these reasons I cannot recommend it at it's current price.I will however go on to say that this is definately a game you should play at some point, if you can pick it up for cheap, for it is a really entertaining and quirky game which rewards you exploring and trying things you wouldn't normally do in video games, if you're a fan of exploring games and trying to unlock everything and see everything, this game is packed full of all those kinds of easter eggs, mini-games and many cultural references that will keep you entertained and hold your attention for a whole playthrough, it is a game that is not very hard at all either, and is all round a fun experience playing it. Some may find some of it's humour a little too over the top, but I feel that there's something in this game that everyone can enjoy.There is not much to say beyond that, the game levels are very interesting and vibrant, the crazy story adds some sense of progression to exploring the mad levels, as well as the achievements which convince you to fully explore and enjoy the game, all round it is a great game and I just wish it could have been longer, adding atleast 8 hours worth of gameplay, rather than the 2-3 hours that it provides.Will I play it again? I highly doubt it, maybe in the distant future. Did I enjoy it? Very much so.Would I recommend it? Not at it's current price, but get it on sale and you won't regret it.A rating out of 10 - 8.5 "

												Jazzpunk: a wacky adventure game stuffed full of gags, pratfalls, and jokes. Like many of Adult Swim Games' works, Jazzpunk's gameplay is supported mainly by its comedic factor. The end result is a somewhat shallow, yet still entertaining game. As Agent Polyblank, you travel the world collecting sensitive materials, thwarting other spies and engaging in general mischief. Though the sidequests offered by the game are enjoyable, the main plot itself can be finished in an hour or so, a glaring example of Your Mileage May Vary. None of the puzzles are remotely challenging and the game is more or less a Walk To Goofy Setpiece simulator with a few minigames that merely distract. Though the game ends quicker than a run to the Post Office, the jokes are somewhat funny in that Adult Swim brand of humor. Once again your mileage may vary and after the humor the game really doesn't have much going for it. The art style is abstract and engaging, but the world itself is more or less dead and roughly the size of a football field. Before you know it the level is over and even the few 'sidequests' in the game add little substance. That being said, the game is pretty funny, but it begs the question ""Why did I pay for this?"" Even at $15 (or $12 at the time I write this) Jazzpunk seems way too expensive for what it is and feels more-suited to the Flash Game crowd rather than a standalone title. In conclusion, not a bad game, but not worth the money.			"

												""All work and no toppings makes Jack a dull pizza.""Fantastic yet short game with a hilariously stupid sense of humor. If you don't dig dumb and downright stupid stuff like Tim and Eric or H3H3 then this game will undoubtedly make you angry, and the humor is the main if not only selling point to this.There are some performance issues which I can't find anything addressing them. Huge frame drops down to 3 a second happen randomly seemingly unrelated to what's going on but this doesn't impact the enjoyment.Great art style that is incredibly unique best described as ""jazz punk"" - an abstract Cold War inspired world that is complete nutters. Take the Philip K♥♥♥♥♥♥view of the future and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ize it with inane humor and an espionage feel. Honestly I haven't seen / read / or otherwise experienced a style like this, with the closest being the humor of the earlier Fallouts.The humor is the main drawing point. Without spoiling too much there are some sequences that are just ridiculous and well executed that tap the dumb humor appeal. I've taken 461 screenshots of occurrences, conversations, scenery, etc. - stuff like depressed talking boxes, this recurring hobo character's conspiracy theories, stealing money from a jazz player to put in a sex robot, or a plant saying it's a political prisoner. I digress, but I could go on and on about the humorous moments and not do them the justice they deserve. It really needs to be experienced fresh and I could definitely see someone being disappointed if they've seen videos longer than 10 minutes of this.The only points of contention would be the length, lack of replayability, and price point. Due to the style of game it is, essentially an interactive comedy game with 4 or 5 levels with little to none replay value since you can easily explore everything the game has to offer the first time around and the second time knowing all the jokes. While this is bad for some games, I don't find it that much of a downside. While I would love more to this, I am satisfied with the time I had. While $15 would be too much in my book, the common sale price of 75% off is super worth it.			"

												A quirky experience. It's a kinda walking simulator, but only because you can't really place it in another genre. You walk around the detailed hubs and interact with pretty much everything in bizarre ways. Watch the trailer, if you're interested, the games 100% for you. It also has rock solid pacing, I never got bored, even though it does have a short running time, only taking me 2 hours to 100% including achievements. It's not replayable as in multiple ways to play, but definitely something I'd replay down the line sometime. Because of this, it's not worth the asking price. £5 or below and you should for sure pick it up.			"

												I'm an obsessive player when it comes to these kinda games, I leave no stone unturned and This game was rather disappointing on that front and considering that's one of it's selling points, random funny♥♥♥♥♥♥around every turn. It is way too short and way to hollow for the asking price. I got it on a steam sale for 33% off and I still feel cheated. The worst moment in this game is on the resort level one of the extremely few levels that isn't squeaky fart short and you get a master key for all the rooms other than your room, which you had a key for anyway, There are two rooms that have anything interesting in 2 out of about 30-40 rooms. Which really pisses me off because of one of the things the bellboys mention ""Level 2 has the most haunted rooms"" and I got kinda excited about that because haunted♥♥♥♥♥♥Oooh loads of cool♥♥♥♥♥♥to be done and laughed but nope, Just a Relitively empty hotel room with the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music and a growing disappointment, I'd be somewhat happy with this if it was 66% or more But certainly not worth £12 for 4 hours of content			"

												This was really fun to play and then I forgot to save and went to bed - that's fine though; two hours gone but my fault.I then started the game again the following morning and in 30 minutes I had made all the progress I had in 2 hours back. Only then to find I was at the end of the game anyway. How short is this game? The screenshots on the Steam Slideshow Gallery in this page pretty much show you one scene from every mission, there are 4 in total.It's like all the effort was put into the real world trailer because that lasted as long as the entire play through. I payed £5.50 on the Steam Sale, I wouldn't recommend unless it's down to £2.50 or less.  The ending doesn't even wrap up the story either...			"

												★★★ out of four.Jazzpunk is a comedic game aiming to surprise and amuse you. In the world of Jazzpunk, you play an agent named Polyblank. You explore the 3D world from a first-person perspective, doing everything except the main objective first so that you don't just see a only a very tiny fraction of what's actually in the game. It may be a bit thin to some players, but it still is the kind of thing only a videogame can do, and we need more stuff like this or evolved from it. Here a line something like ""generic joke"" can work because the whole thing is not generic. Yes, you'll get tired of such stuff if you talk to every NPC like ya should and sometimes it has referential ""humor."" Well, sadly, I do feel to mention that it's probably a four hour game for people. The FOV is unchangable and character movement continues after you release movement. Also consider the price and buy when you won't feel disappointed. Regarding achievements, they are all just for poking about the Jazzpunk world well, so I suggest ignoring them due to light spoilers on your first playthrough and looking forward to them for the second.Jazzpunk's a type we need more of. It's a 3D world with hotspots of jokes, cleverness, and surprises. When the price can't be wrong, tune your device for squelch and jump in.			"

												A funky robo-mid-century art style mixed up with a Hunter S. Thompson surrealist vibe makes for a strange setting.  Great sound design adds to the fun, as do the numerous homages to video games of eras gone by. All that said, the actual gameplay is pretty shallow. Fortunately, the setting doesn't overstay its welcome and the game is over before its flaws become tedious.One last note: I expected this to be sort of an indie shooter, but it has a lot more adventure game DNA.Overall worth your time but maybe not at full price.

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupFew words about the gameJazzpunk is amazing and uniqe game, made entirely of laughs and puns. Personally I had one of the best times playing this game, around every corner hides something hilarious, each thing you interact with is created to make you fun, even the credits. Friendly warning - it pokes fun on ton of different topics so not everyone might like everything about it, so you might get annoyed or even offended.Advantages - Game is overally one of the funniest ones around, it's designed to make you laugh and belive me, it works - Graphics are kinda odd, I can't say that they're good, you might even call them crappy, but they are awesome at the same time - Same goes to soundtrack, it's not good, it just fits in perfectly and makes game even funnier at some parts - It contains alot of hidden or side stuff so don't go ahead too quickly, just look around and have fun - Loads of references to games, movies and actual eventsDisadvantages - Relatively short game. Rich in content, but still short - Quite expensive, I suggest you to buy it while discounts are going on - Replay value exists only to get achievements and find stuff you have missed in your first playthroughIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!

After finishing the game do I understand the story? NO! But it really doesn't matter because I had a good time the whole way through. This game pretty much spoofs everything. Even though it was short it was a great play.Right now its included in the current humble bundle for around another 10 days (Nov 1st 2014 today) so head over and pick it, and a bunch of other great games for dirt cheap.Give it about a 8/10			"

												This game is MINDBLOWINGLY AMAZING — for me. And for you, in case:• you know some tech, IT, consoles, retro games stuff• you understand English pretty well• you enjoy exploring every corner to be amused with tiny detailsIt's very funny parody/comedy adventure game, it's _incredibly_ stylish, sometimes it feels like it's over the top. Vivid, colorful, loud, with a certain absurd humour style. It's good to play alone, it's good to play with a couple of good friends watching and it's VERY easy to spoil if you saw everything beforehand somewhere on youtube, so just jump on it.I'm very sensitive to music, style and pacing in modern games, because a lot of times all of that is so ""wannabe"", This game is,,, pro. It's simple and it is an instant pleasure for every game/PC/tech geek about 20-30 years old.Bottom line! Basically, it's jack in the box. So be ready for many exciting surprises, and you won't regret it.			"

												It's hard to describe this as it's probably one of the strangest, most surreal games I've ever played.  Jazzpunk is a first-person comedy adventure where you assume the role of Polyblank, a secret agent.  You'll find yourself progressing through a series of increasingly bizarre missions, complete with plenty of WTF moments, though the game's sense of humour is hilarious at times.  The missions take place on sizeable maps that have plenty of curiosities to discover, even though the main game itself is quite short.Not bad for the price.			"

This game had many refferences hidden in it from Street Fighter to Star Trek, and trying to find them all is a blast. The achievements are interesting as well and make replayability a must.

												It's probably the only game that's ever made me actually laugh besides stick of truth, most quirky based comedy games only rely on observational comedy about video games themselves in which the jokes are very obvious and generic. This game however has actual non video game related comedy with proper diversity in the jokes.But the game is WAY TOO SHORT. In the 3 or so hours of actual playtime I've finished the game twice and gotten all the achievements, the only way you can take a long time on a mission is by over analysing an objective. This game is too overpriced for it's content and should only be gotten on sale or in a bundle.			"

 TL;DR The game is fun, funny and punny (yes that was a puns pun deal with it) however ot is very short. i don't think it's worth 14.99$ but i do recommend to get it on sale. Long Version  Jazzpunk is about you playing a secret agent in the Cold War named Polyblank. the game's entire atmosphere is comical and funny. It's a First Person Puzzle/Adventure game that brings a breath of fresh air to the genre. it has multiple TV Shows, Movies and various Video Games refrences like Frogger, Solitaire and even Quake.the game never takes itself seriously, and that what makes it so fun and intriguing.Jazzpunk's graphics are also one of my favorite features of the game. The graphics are like 3D-2D kind of hybrid that looks really good and surreal and really adds up to the whole Voxel thing this game has, kinda like ""Thirty Flights of Loving"" or ""Paint The Town Red"". but the  REALLY  big con is it's length. the games is about 4 hours long and really leaves you a bit disappointed when you finish it. i really hope that the developrs will make a sequel for this great game (and this time make it a bit longer).i give it a 9/10.

												With a $15 price tag, Jazzpunk is NOT impressive at all. Even with the fact that I purchased the game 75% off, the game still fails to deliver what I expected. Maybe it is the fact that I watched a brief video of someone playing it. If you are purchasing this game because your favorite youtuber played it  DON'T DO IT . There's no point; you are just redoing those events in the video but in your game. Nothing is different other than the fact that you are just playing it by yourself. But if you're not a doofus like me and you don't watch let's plays or whatever, I could still list off many reasons why to avoid this game, no matter if it's on sale or not. Yes the game has a unique and interesting setting, but they do not utilize it. The map feels very scripted and limited to the point where you know where there's going to be an invisible wall. The maps are based off level by level so you can't really go back or explore. It's just levels. There's few interactivity but everything else you wish you could do, you probably can't. The puzzles are easy and straight to the point. Sometimes I would get stuck because I over-thought one. The jokes are not that funny, and more punny. They are the jokes that make you cringe and sigh at. The comedy of this game may appeal to some, but I did not crack a chuckle. It may appeal to a young child or an autistic grown man-child. A few more things to throw in were that my framerates were always plunging down on some parts. There are some bugs on each level where you could see font from a distance. The sound design (other than the goofy voice acting) is crap, putting annoying ambience noises on loop. The game in general just felt very  linear, scripted, and limited.If I had to compliment one thing, it would be the artwork and the graphics. I like the characters and I think they are silly looking. The environment is basic and colorful. But that's about it.Overall this very short $15 game does not live up to my expectations, and in fact, the game should be cheaper. If you are interested in this game but you don't want to buy it- just watch a video of someone playing and their commentary (doesn't matter who you watch) would be funnier than the game itself.			"

												In Jazzpunk wander around a wacky world, that's wonderfully whimsical as you embark on a wildly ridiculous adventure with plenty of wit as well. What's more, Jazzpunk is a unique experience and whilst humour is entirely subjective you're likely to find a few jokes great whether it's the dark, the referential, the cynical, or the random humour. The aesthetic in my opinion is fantastic and only adds to the experience. Jazzpunk is however very short, 2 to 3 hours at most, and with humour being as subjective as it is, I can only recommend buying on sale.			"

												Weird, crazy, funny game. Takes 2h-3h to complete, and after that, you'll still be wondering what the hell have you just played. Surrealistic, they say. Achievements are not working on Linux.			"

												I had a friend recommend this game to me because it was surreal and funny. My cup of tea.And yes, it was surreal and funny.The whole time I was thinking ""This feels like a late night Adult Swim short in video game form."" SPOILERS: It was created by Adult Swim. Oh.I played with the Steam Controller. Since it is still effectively an FPS, I probably shouldn't have done that. But there are only a couple of times where precise aiming was key, and they were optional, so no biggie.If you like late night drunken giggling at stupid bizarre stuff, this Bud's for you.			"

												Let's get one thing right out of the way: This game is ridiculous. If you dislike any kind of surrealism or completely over-the-top and often quite random humor this game is not for you, but I'm pretty sure you have gathered that from just watching the trailer and looking at the screenshots.Now, for those still with me: this game is pretty short. I'm talking below 5 hours short for 100% completion.I personally consider this game a must-play though, simply because it's such a unique and hilarious experience. However, I gotta be honest and say you shouldn't get this at its full price. Either get it in a bundle like I did (if that ever happens again) or buy it at a discount of at least 60% off.Jazzpunk features some light puzzling, platforming, a little ""combat"" and some sandbox-ish messing around with everything you can find in the environment. It has a nice comic-like art style and brims with pop-cultural references (James Bond, Star Wars, Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas and so many more). Comedy is hard to pull off in video games, but Jazzpunk is a prime example for slapstick done right.			"

												Jazzpunk is just weird.You're some sort of spy in some sort of mid-1900's computer joke fever dream. At its heart, Jazzpunk is a game about walking around and having surreal things happen to, around, and because of you. Some of these things are more interactive than others. It's hard to really tell you what these things are without spoiling loads of jokes, which are kind of the main reason to play the game.Suffice to say, the humor is great. From computer puns and silly mini-games, to witty nonsense and a vacation resort filled with Hunter S. Thompsons, there's plenty to go 'round.Jazzpunk isn't overly long. I clocked in at just under 4 1/2 hours, and that was by doing everything.It gets good marks in the visual departments. The game is stylized in a strange way, and it wears it well. The music is... well, it fits. Take that as you will. I mean, it's good. I just don't really know how to describe it. It sounds like the sort of music that would go well with a weird Cold War spy surreal stylized computer-themed comedy game thing. Okay?Okay.I enjoyed it. The best part about odd comedy is that it can be quite good at consistently catching you off-guard, and Jazzpunk certainly was just that. I laughed aloud many times throughout my adventure. You should give it a go, if you need a laugh and you're down with just straight-up silliness.			"

												Jazzpunk.  There almost isn't a point in reviewing this title with all the hype it's received lately, so I'll be briefer than my normal reviews here.  Jazzpunk has a very unique asthetic and an almost anarchic sense of humour.  It's these that the game hinges upon, so if either falls flat for you watching the gameplay trailers or the reviews, then I wouldn't pick up this game, as the actual gameplay while lightly enjoyable is about as shallow as a tea tray.  For me personally, it was a short but fun ride that had me genuinely laughing at a few points.  While a few of the jokes fell flat for me, some of them were quite funny.  The production values are certainly high and the voice acting - including a spot by Jim Sterling - were actually quite well done, which certainly helps with some of the jokes.  So if the humour appeals, then you'll definetely find an enjoyable purchase in the game and I would highly recommend it.			"

												This game is fantastic. It is a hilarious firstperson puzzler that has a unique art style and loads of secrets to find. It even reminds me of vintage first person shooter games because of the design and amount of secrets. However, it is quite short, it took me a bit more than 2 hours to complete the whole game, find lots of secrets, and 100% the achievements so I would recommend it only if it goes on sale for under 5$.8.5/10  "

												Jazzpunk is a short game that is full of dumb gags. It is the Airplane!/Naked Gun/Police Squad of video games. It is pretty damn sophomoric, predictable, and is basically centered around ♥♥♥♥ing with the set dressing, poking things and combining some things with other things to see what happens. And I love it for all of those things. The programming is a bit haphazard and they've just finally managed to fix mouse smoothing, which was ruining the experience for some people by making the player nauseous as ♥♥♥♥. They are planning an FOV slider for the next patch. And they should get that done ASAP, because comedy is hard to enjoy when you're nauseous as ♥♥♥♥!			"

═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEW Jazzpunk is a comic comedy adventure game where you take a role as a secret agent in some kind of Matrix, I dunno, it's confusing, if you are familiar with the publisher, Adult Swim, you probably know what kind of stuff you can expect. As said, this game is a comedy adventure, if you want to take a break from shooters, this game is probably the best choice, you will surely laugh a bit, but there are some random = funny moments too. The scenery is so atmospheric, it feels alive thanks to music, at least 90% of the stuff in it is interactive and every single one of them contains some kind of gag. Every single NPC you will come across will have something to say. The game is kinda short and easy, it has only 5 levels and it takes around 3 hours to beat, but I'm sure you will enjoy those 3 hours.═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONSPros:You will laugh for sureAtmospheric sceneryAwesome soundtrackA lot of interactive stuffA lot of hidden mini-games and bad punsA lot of references to other gamesCons:Too shortBad voice actingNot really suitable for children═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATINGThis game is for everyone that wants to have a laugh or try something different. I rate the game 9/10, would bake a pigeon pie again!═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												I finished this game at once, 3 hours in a row, with all achievements, in one evening. I just coundn't get away from it. It's as if it's absurdity and my disturbed mind were linked together.It does have a scenario: you are a spy, who executes missions assigned by his boss in some kind of cold war universe (?) The game is full of random references such as Hitchcock movies or even ninja turtles (if you find the ninja turtle one I can tell you that you're gonna have the stupidest laugh you ever had). But the real core of that game is it's... humour. Absurd humour. This is so absurd. To give you a really quick example you'll have to... wait, no I can't do that. I can't spoil you any of these wonderful crazy moments. If that's not your kind of humour you'll probably consider that game as the worst joke ever, if it is your kind of humour you'll probably try to find each single nonsense, reference and mini game. So it's up to you. Is your mind twisted enough for that game ? PS: I want wedding qake to become a thing.			"

												This is a pretty short,easy game and may not seem worth the price, but the story is only a small fraction of what this game has to offer. Sidequest and mini games, amusing conversations and references galore are scattered everywhere. You could finish the first mission in 5min if you wanted to but an hour there and you may still not find everything. Gameplay is about exploring and having fun. You cant die or lose, there is nothing serious going on here. Even when you have the option to rescue someone, you can press the wrong button and things still end well :)Price may still be a little steep, but this is definately something you should pick up sometime.

												A Unique and Interesting GameIt's very short. The story is pretty straightforward of a run, and there is a lot of puns and one-liners that you may or may not get. After finishing it, I was kinda disappointed. But depending on who you are, I guess this would be the kind of game for you.What I do like about the game is the unusual music and art style. Really more of an aesthetic game than a fun game, but enjoyable. If you are looking for a bizarre yet casual play game, Jazzpunk is for you, but don't buy it at full price. The trailers can be misleading.			"

												In Jazzpunk, there is not a single moment where the game isn't funny. Everything about this game, including the credits, is hilarious, and it's amazing. It's a puzzle game, but the only real puzzles are in getting the achievements, which aren't that difficult to get. Unfortunately, it's pretty short, averaging 4 hours to both complete the game and get all the achievements. While it's a bit of a demanding price for a lack of practical content, it's so worth it for the humor.8/10			"

You get to do fun things while in game and it doesn't have anything scary or annoying in it. One things tho, it's very short and I think it should've costed like 5 or 6 dollars, maybe 4, not 15... If there were more levels I wouldn't have complained about the price. I bought this game hoping it would be a long adventure but I finished the game in like and hour or two which. Overall it was good, I laughed a bit and it's not boring. But please fix the price...			"

												A must-play for fans of the surreal, the psychadelic, and the abstract. A bizarre blend of spy movies, science fiction, wacky transitions, and off the wall concepts. Few games are written well enough to make me laugh but this game managed to nail it. It's hard to describe gameplay. It's an odd mixture of explorative scenarios (similar to Hitman) with a ton of distractions and mini games littered around you with no actual insentive to complete aside from some superb humor. The only way to truely understand is to play it for yourself. My only minor issue is it's current price at launch. Considering this is about a two hour game I'd be hardpressed to suggest anyone not just wait for a steam sale. However I enjoyed my time with it and it was a wild (albeight short) ride.			"

												A surreal bizarre tongue in cheek adventure that doesn't hold back punches with it's layers of absurdity.Makes subtle hat tips to not only gameplay tropes but compulsive player behaviour that in most games would yield zero results (ie. walking into every inconsequental spot looking at absolutely everything in hopes of your exploration being rewarded, and excessively clicking on inanimate objects (atleast when you start a game to gauge the interactivety therein))The graphics are reminiscent of a vintage (hanna-barbera era) cartoons, abstract and minimal and somewhat... okay heavily bizarre. The same can be said of the punchy eclectic soundtrack which is just as bizarre and quirky.The completely random and bizarre mini-games are a highlight in terms of what jazzpunk can deliver in the hilarity department.    It's less a traditional gaming experience, and more a first person adventure game, and an experience akin to a digital acid trip.Recommended to anyone keen to have a humour packed pseudo-psychedelic experience, thouroughly enjoyable albeit short. worth the price of admission.

												Jazzpunk understands video game humor.From the get-go the player is faced with a stylistic and slick animation introing the game - it's simple 2D colourful style is reminiscent of several movie openings, Catch Me If You Can being a prime example. And from that very moment the game feels abstract and different.There is much to say about Jazzpunk, but not much can be said without spoiling the game itself, as the beauty and charm relies heavily on situational humor, references, and player-induced gags.To put it simply you are an agent tasked with fulfilling tasks for your ""secret"" agency during an alternative cold war era. Thus, you will be tasked with infiltrating a Russian Consolate to steal data, killing a target in a Japanese setting, and making a journey around the world into a holiday resort to steal vital information. Each of these cliched settings and quests is accompanied by a varied amount of jokes, gags, situational humour and dark comedy. The best part about them? Very few are shoved down the players throat. If you don't explore the environment, you won't get the jokes. If you don't interact with items/NPCs/backgrounds you will never know whether they have something funny to say or whether they will cause a chain reaction of absurd humour.And absurd is an area very known to Jazzpunk - The characters exist in a reality where they semi-know they are inside a video game and are able to express insightful and hilarious commentary accompanying many of the jokes and gags. As you approach an agent-looking-man in a dark alley, the moment he begins talking to you the text ""SIDE QUEST"" appears underneath him on the pavement, mocking both the player and the game industry, and yet somehow managing to put a smile on your face. Text is one of the vital strengths of Jazzpunk, and one of the stylistic decisions I enjoyed the most. The text is superimposed upon the 3D world as part of the charm. Almost every line of dialogue or activity is accompanied by a few small lines of white, bold, caps-lock text which further mock or create humor as appropriate to the situation.Jazzpunk is also full of mini-games, each of them their own gig, their own sketch, their own gag. The mini-games make little sense and don't actually add anything to the games story or plot development, but they are hard to hate. (As an example if you explore enough you'll get to play ""Wedding Qake"" A wedding cake version of quake with AI pretending to be real players, and chatting to each other with phrases such as ""lol ur pretty gud at this game, a/s/l?"") This can be entirely missed and the player is never told that such a minigame exists, which makes exploration in this game all the more and valuable.Since a lot of exploration games have been released recently - Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable and Gone Home just to name a few, Jazzpunk plays on a similar idea that The Stanley Parable utilized, except it does it better. Rewarding the player for his/her exploration isn't done with dialogue, with achievements, with new tasks or with arbitrary map unlocks or anything of the like - exploring Jazzpunk feels like exploring a Monty Python sketch, a basin of comedy waiting to splash you the moment you dip your hand in it.There isn't a lot to critique about this game, maybe aside from it's length - I was able to 100% complete Jazzpunk in under 3 hours. Whether I saw all the gigs and jokes I won't know, and that's the wonderful thing about it too. It's likely that upon revisiting the game you will discover a lot of comedy you missed the first time around.Overall it's hard not to recommend Jazzpunk as an interactive comedy experience. As a game it's a pretty simplistic first-person point-and-click with mini-games added for good measure, under the hood of a game though is a greater experience, one that brings the player into a bizzare world of comedy, pop-references, abstract voice acting and a ridiculous story, all tied together by playing on the basic human need of exploration and wanting to smile and laugh. Since laughing is healthy, it's likely that Jazzpunk will extend your life by like 0.02 years, so you should probably get it for that.			"

												Jazzpunk is the perfect rollercoaster ride of gameyness! I really cannot go on without recommending it to just about anyone possessing the slightest hint of humor. It´s hard to describe what´s so great about a game when it´s the package that just feels right as a whole. Maybe, if you could imagine that Hamburgers would taste better if they came in bags with a certain branding - for Jazzpunk this is the exact truth. Everything it does feels so right, changing anything about it would spoil the experience.I don´t like where this review is going though, i wanted to compare Jazzpunk to Super Mario 64 and the Beatles Yellow Submarine film, and now all i´m saying is Buy Jazzpunk it´s the McDo of Gaming - see what playing Jazzpunk did to me?!

												So yea....lets look at Jazzpunk. I will do my reviews on a pro/ con style.Pro:     Very fun game. Its a first person game where you go on a wacky adventure for some reason. Its an adult swim game....it isnt suppose to make much sense.     The game has humor. Alot of funny moments like getting a fly swatter and swatting everyone or the moment when you need to spray canned cheese into an old mans mouth but decide nah im just going to spray his entire face.       Alot of pop culture references but it doesnt feel over the top. When playing the game you will see many reference to pop culture like 007, quake, street fighter, the old virtual boy, and much more. I do not feel that all these references feel at all out of place but adds to the quality of the humor presented.     Easy achievements. The game has a small ammount of achievements that can be completed in about 2hrs. So it is definantly an easy 100% achievement list.     Cheesy music. The developers added the most cheesy music to the the game and just like the references i mentioned it doesnt subtract from the experience but rather add to the humor.Con:      The game is very short. From my experience i completed the game and the achievements in about 2hrs. So it isnt worth i want to say the game is about $15 right now. Not worth that much cash.Conclusion:       It was really hard for me to find any positives about the game because it is so short and does really do much besides putting the playing in a wacky first person adventure that is filled to the brim with references to other popular shows, movies, ect. I played throught the game with a smile on my face and laughing alot because i have never played a game that is just out there like this one. I got this perfume that i spray at people and then birds will take the character in the air or how about playing wedding quake....let that joke sink in for a sec. This game is certainly worth playing but remember it is short so check it out during a discount. For the whole 2 hours I was having a fun time laughing and having a pillow fight with this girl in her room that i accidently knocked her out of the penthouse.....whoops but thats enough spoilers because if i went over all the funny moments in the game this review would be really long.

												There's a bunch of random objects that you interact with, scattered arbitrarily around a small level.  One is a frog that throws you in a frogger minigame.  Another is a microscope that puts you in a space invaders minigame.  Most just give you dialogue that is supposed to be funny.When you get bored of listening to what every trash can and pizza box has to say, you solve a simple puzzle to complete the mission.  Then you go to the next area to click on more random objects.There aren't really any characters or storyline.  The whole thing looks like an excuse to deliver puns and one-liners, but without any context they're not very funny; they just seem arbitrary.  The gameplay seems to be an afterthought, and isn't fun.			"

												Jazzpunk, a funny little experiment 7/10+Solid visual style+Great menus/UI+A ridiculous amount of jokes in every stage+Odd, but catchy soundtrack+interesting cyberpunk/50s-60s spy movie world+a lot of the jokes had me cracking up, with an even mixture of clever, witty humor, and stupid slapstick. Both are well executed...-...Most of the time. There are occasionally jokes that miss the mark. (The last half of the resort stage was almost painfully unfunny)-The voice acting is heavily filtered, which hinders the effectiveness of some jokes' delivery-Even though I beat this game in two hours, some jokes were getting somewha repedative (ow my face. I have 4th degree burns all over my face.)Despite some flaws, this is still an interesting idea, and in between this and the Stanley Parable; comedic adventures might have a future.I would get it... but on sale.

												Jazzpunk is RIDICULOUS. It just gets weirder and weirder the more you play. The characters are odd, the writing is spot on, and the art design helps to complement the insanity of everything going on. There aren't many games which actually make me laugh aloud, but Jazzpunk is one of them.I don't know how best to describe it, but if you like silly alternate history cold war era spy games in which you steal a man's high tech kidney get Jazzpunk.

												Jazzpunk is a short, mission based first person 'shooter'. Shooter isn't the right word here I guess, because you won't be shooting anyone here, and when you do (maybe 2-3x) it's just for the fun of it. This game parodies a lot of games and movies from the 80's and 90's and does it in style. I must admit that I wasn't impressed by the graphics of the game when I first saw the screenshots, but after having played it it looks really sharp and clean. The NPC's are still roughly modeled, however, and I think they could've done a better job here, but that's debatable.There are so many little details, scenes and easter eggs to be found that you can't help but smile if you understand a reference. I don't think a lot of people will be laughing out loud, it's just all too random.There are, technically, 4 levels to complete (if you count the mini levels it's a bit higher, of course) and each of them can be completed in around 30 minutes. So it isn't a long game. In fact, I think you can finish it within an hour if you just rush through it, but trust me, it's worth it to touch/activate/etc. as much as you can, and just play around with stuff.For a game this random I was surprised to actually find a semi decent story here. It won't blow anyone away, but considering the context of the game it's kinda fun.If you like weird and random games play Jazzpunk. It's also good if you want to relax. You can take your time doing things, and you're not being pushed forward every 2 minutes. Yes,... yes, I think I like Jazzpunk.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												I never noticed until now that Jazzpunk is a play on words. Like the title of the game suggest, this game takes in a retro-futuristic setting that is reminiscent of the 1940's or 50's era. This is an adventure indie game by Adult Swim where you play the role of a spy and given missions to undertake through each level. Jazzpunk is fun and clever with it's dry humor and pop culture references. There are fun little mini-games throughout the story to encourage the player to exploring each passing level. The graphics are nice and fits the style and tone of the game. This game is fun, clever and just plain bizarre at times but I cannot recommend this game at full price. The game is just too short to justify the price tag. Total game play if you just stick to the story is maybe 2 1/2 hours at most. After you are done with the game's story, there is not much to keep the player from coming back for a second play through. It is a great game, but the no replay value and short story hurts this game. This should be a $10 game at most.  Get this game when it's on sale. It's a 7/10 for me.			"

												I can count the number of times I've played a game and described it as genuinely funny. Lots of games can be amusing because of their direction, or incidentally funny because of something I did compared to the game itself.But Jazzpunk is actually funny. As in within the first few minutes of booting up the game, their first few jokes already had me chuckling it up.Just remember to think of Jazzpunk as an old-school adventure game, what with you going around touching and grabbing everything in an effort to trigger progress. But in the meantime, as you do that dreaded thing adventure games often make you do and touch-EVERY-THING to make sure you don't miss anything, Jazzpunk throws lots of great jokes and gags into every nook and cranny to fill your search.

												A friend of mine has labelled Jazzpunk as an 'interactive joke machine', which I feel sums the game in its entirety. Unlike titles like Proteus for example, which are more compelled to give you an experience and story rather than any kind of solid campaign (and also is debated on whether or not it's an actual game), Jazzpunk brings you a nicely sized campaign that is more interested in entertaining you through cheeky puns, strange encounters and comedic situations than anything else... But surely you could browse image sites instead of paying $14.99 for a laugh, right?I won't be using words like 'acid', 'drugs' or 'trip', regardless of the numerous bewildering sights and interactions you'll have during your missions in Jazzpunk, even if I question the developers state of mental clarity when they came up with most of the game's content. It all starts off innocently enough; you playing as a secret agent who must go to Soviet Russia and steal precious intel, then escape. If you have even a fractional tiny chance of being distracted however, a mission that would take less than ten minutes to complete through its linear track will soon become an hour, thanks to the game being stuffed with NPC's, mini-games, references and other oddities that will either confuse you or make you laugh out loud, or a delightful mixture of both. While at first I was hesitant of playing a game that was simply a comedy routine and little else, I was very impressed in finding that most to all of the jokes were sharp, witty and never, ever overstayed their welcome. Premise, hook, punchline, done. Never did it feel like a joke had to linger longer than it had to in order to make you chuckle, and even if you don't laugh at some jokes, you can just proceed on to the next odd chatter a NPC had to share with you and move along like nothing ever happened. Jazzpunk has an incredible strength in that aspect, allowing its player to progress at the speed that they wish, able to take in all the gags at their own pace, and despite quite a few jokes refer to computer and technological terms, the clever writing will ensure that nothing ever truly sails over your head.To talk about the finer details of all the comedy in Jazzpunk would feel like a major spoiler, and I would be cheating you. Thankfully, it's not a raunchy romp, nor is it a child-friendly adventure. Despite being silly and weird as hell, it does merit a Mature rating from the ESRB due to violent sights and adult themes, but there isn't anything that would cause incredible shock or offense; again, applause for the intelligent writing staff. For me to try and objectively comment on the gameplay is a moot point, as you merely walk around and interact with characters or objects to either uncover jokes, a diversion or even side-quests, which can lead towards the handful of achievements Jazzpunk has. One could argue that this game could have been a Flash game on the internet for free as a point and click adventure, but I would argue that you lose much of the visual appeal when not made into a 3D adventure. I'm no art major and Jazzpunk isn't looking to be put on display in a museum, but the graphics are both subtle and clear enough to not assault your senses and detract you from the experience or make it a struggle to find something else to interact with for the next joke. It's not to say that Jazzpunk is lazy in its graphics, but between the bathroom sign figure population and the nicely detailed though still deranged looking environments, the game strikes a nice balance between wanting to look presentable, but doesn't blow its budget into trying to net awards for being the best looking game ever.I didn't realize how impressed I was with Jazzpunk's technical and visual aspects until I sat down to write this, and to complain that this is an interactive adventure game would just be silly. I will however gripe that for $15 I would've enjoyed a bit more time in the weird, cyberpunk universe, though this is a risky gambit since artificial game extension may just lead to recycled and stale jokes that seriously miss their mark. With my wandering and desire to unearth all the jokes, my first playthrough of Jazzpunk took me about four hours, and that's considering I possibly might have missed some jokes here and there, which leads into my only major complaint; replay value. Unless you want to go back and get all the achievements, find those last few hidden gags or want to take another spin in the future when you need a chuckle, Jazzpunk's shelf life feels quite limited, especially if you don't share in the referential, computing and word play jokes throughout the game. I'm getting my value out of the game through speedruns, but I suppose Jazzpunk can be appreciated like many indie games that are labelled as 'art'; an occasional playthrough to remind you what made the game, and your purchase, worthwhile.I digress. A $15 dollar price tag is asking just a bit much, where $10 would've been pretty much the perfect price tag. That said, I have no regrets of spending my time with Jazzpunk, where laughs and dumbfounded stares were plenty. If the trailer to the game garnered no interest from you, then I would wait until a sale heavily drops the price. Just do yourself a favor and avoid having any jokes or discoveries be spoiled for you; even the above three images feels like I'm robbing you of what can be expected in the game, but thankfully, they're nowhere near the weirdness you'll came across later on. Jazzpunk gets a solid recommendation from me, but maybe not at the full $15 price tag.			"

												Jazzpunk is like a video game version of a comedy like Airplane!, Top Secret, or Get Smart. It's just packed with ridiculous jokes, and I'll say 95% of them connected for me. I was actually laughing out loud for most of the game. However, the game is quite short. It took me less than 3 hours to finish with 100% of the achievements, and I did pretty much everything I could in every level. If you just beeline through the objectives, it'll take you less than an hour and you'll miss most of the content. That would be a terrible way to play this game. It's not long, but it's the kind of game you want to soak up a bit. It's like a more absurd version of Gravity Bone or Thirty Flights of Loving. I definitely recommend it for all of bonkers jokes.

												WTF did I just play?And more importantly: Why The F*** are you not playing this?This really deserves all the thumbs up you can get. It's basically an exploration game. Or even a walking simulator, as there is no way to actually fail. But the comedy is good enough not only to keep you playing but to cheer you up in a way few other games manage to do. And that's actually kind of surprising, seeing how jokes about computers, video games or old detective stories aren't exactly new. Some examples:-your chief asks you to sit down in a stern voice...but there's a farting pillow on your seat-cyber sex if you insert a coin in a fembot-WEDDING QUAKE!-(from the credits) ""stunts performed by...unpaid interns""And so on. About the only game that comes close to comparison (that I know) are Wario's minigames, but those who've played that know that these sorts of games are unique in and of themselves. So all I can say is that the building quality is decent and that the jokes are good ones. Sure, it's not very long. But on a game like this, one shouldn't expect that.			"

												Full Review - http://www.ggsgamer.com/2014/02/06/review-jazzpunk/Imagine an ongoing spoof of 60s spy fiction with slapstick comedy that of Leslie Nielsen’s most iconic films. Throw in postmodern and referential humor with a penchant for cyberpunk tropes and gadgetry, and you’ve got Jazzpunk.Games like Jazzpunk and The Stanley Parable excel at telling a story through exploration and discovery, and provide a lot of laughs in their initial playthroughs. The downside to this is that once all of the jokes are found, there lacks personal replay value; although, I can see the appeal in replaying the game with company over so to share some laughs or revisiting the game in the future.If you have no qualms playing through an exceptionally funny three hour game for $15, then Jazzpunk might be for you. Personally, I really enjoyed my time with the game, albeit the inclusion of so many minigames kind of put it – at least in my eyes – on the borderline between a traditional title with extensive gameplay, and an interactive narrative game. At the end, I wanted more from Jazzpunk; it felt shorter than it should be and I wanted to see more from the wacky world it takes place in.			"

												Jazzpunk isn't a long game. Even if you find every little easter egg, every liitle sight gag, every little extra in the game, it will still only take you four hours to complete MAX. Some may be turned off by this,  but seriously, don't be. Because what Jazzpunk lacks in length it makes up for with humour. I say that becuase I think Jazzpunk is up there with the funniest games ever made. Ever. Not once did a joke fall flat, and on occasion I almost fell out of my chair laughing. Every level is meticulously detailed with a shocking level of extra obtainables stuck in here and there for the sole purpose to make you laugh. It's an excellent, albeit short, game that any person with the vaguest sense of humour will enjoy.Also, a wedding spoof of Quake where you shoot Brides and Grooms in the face with champagne bottles and rose launchers.

Unlike titles like Proteus for example, which are more compelled to give you an experience and story rather than any kind of solid campaign (and also is debated on whether or not it's an actual game), Jazzpunk brings you a nicely sized campaign that is more interested in entertaining you through cheeky puns, strange encounters and comedic situations than anything else... But surely you could browse image sites instead of paying $14.99 for a laugh, right?I won't be using words like 'acid', 'drugs' or 'trip', regardless of the numerous bewildering sights and interactions you'll have during your missions in Jazzpunk, even if I question the developers state of mental clarity when they came up with most of the game's content. It all starts off innocently enough; you playing as a secret agent who must go to Soviet Russia and steal precious intel, then escape. If you have even a fractional tiny chance of being distracted however, a mission that would take less than ten minutes to complete through its linear track will soon become an hour, thanks to the game being stuffed with NPC's, mini-games, references and other oddities that will either confuse you or make you laugh out loud, or a delightful mixture of both. While at first I was hesitant of playing a game that was simply a comedy routine and little else, I was very impressed in finding that most to all of the jokes were sharp, witty and never, ever overstayed their welcome. Premise, hook, punchline, done. Never did it feel like a joke had to linger longer than it had to in order to make you chuckle, and even if you don't laugh at some jokes, you can just proceed on to the next odd chatter a NPC had to share with you and move along like nothing ever happened. Jazzpunk has an incredible strength in that aspect, allowing its player to progress at the speed that they wish, able to take in all the gags at their own pace, and despite quite a few jokes refer to computer and technological terms, the clever writing will ensure that nothing ever truly sails over your head.To talk about the finer details of all the comedy in Jazzpunk would feel like a major spoiler, and I would be cheating you. Thankfully, it's not a raunchy romp, nor is it a child-friendly adventure. Despite being silly and weird as hell, it does merit a Mature rating from the ESRB due to violent sights and adult themes, but there isn't anything that would cause incredible shock or offense; again, applause for the intelligent writing staff. For me to try and objectively comment on the gameplay is a moot point, as you merely walk around and interact with characters or objects to either uncover jokes, a diversion or even side-quests, which can lead towards the handful of achievements Jazzpunk has. One could argue that this game could have been a Flash game on the internet for free as a point and click adventure, but I would argue that you lose much of the visual appeal when not made into a 3D adventure. I'm no art major and Jazzpunk isn't looking to be put on display in a museum, but the graphics are both subtle and clear enough to not assault your senses and detract you from the experience or make it a struggle to find something else to interact with for the next joke. It's not to say that Jazzpunk is lazy in its graphics, but between the bathroom sign figure population and the nicely detailed though still deranged looking environments, the game strikes a nice balance between wanting to look presentable, but doesn't blow its budget into trying to net awards for being the best looking game ever.I didn't realize how impressed I was with Jazzpunk's technical and visual aspects until I sat down to write this, and to complain that this is an interactive adventure game would just be silly. I will however gripe that for $15 I would've enjoyed a bit more time in the weird, cyberpunk universe, though this is a risky gambit since artificial game extension may just lead to recycled and stale jokes that seriously miss their mark. With my wandering and desire to unearth all the jokes, my first playthrough of Jazzpunk took me about four hours, and that's considering I possibly might have missed some jokes here and there, which leads into my only major complaint; replay value. Unless you want to go back and get all the achievements, find those last few hidden gags or want to take another spin in the future when you need a chuckle, Jazzpunk's shelf life feels quite limited, especially if you don't share in the referential, computing and word play jokes throughout the game. I'm getting my value out of the game through speedruns, but I suppose Jazzpunk can be appreciated like many indie games that are labelled as 'art'; an occasional playthrough to remind you what made the game, and your purchase, worthwhile.I digress. A $15 dollar price tag is asking just a bit much, where $10 would've been pretty much the perfect price tag. That said, I have no regrets of spending my time with Jazzpunk, where laughs and dumbfounded stares were plenty. If the trailer to the game garnered no interest from you, then I would wait until a sale heavily drops the price. Just do yourself a favor and avoid having any jokes or discoveries be spoiled for you; even the above three images feels like I'm robbing you of what can be expected in the game, but thankfully, they're nowhere near the weirdness you'll came across later on. Jazzpunk gets a solid recommendation from me, but maybe not at the full $15 price tag.			"

												It may not last very long considering the price tag, but the attention to detail in this game is just amazing. There are so many jokes and references that'll go unnoticed or over people's heads, but the deeper you dig, the more you'll find. I'd much rather have quality over quantity - and this game certainly gives that.			"

												This game is alright. It is not worth the $15 price, but still fun. If this game was like $2 then I would definitly recommend it. I still do say try it out, but buy it when it's on sale. If you do like weird, in your face, and over the top humor then this is the game. I wish it was longe than 2 hours, but what I got was enjoyable. All I'll will say is when the game is on sale get it, but don'y get it for full price.			"

												Full Review - http://www.ggsgamer.com/2014/02/06/review-jazzpunk/Imagine an ongoing spoof of 60s spy fiction with slapstick comedy that of Leslie Nielsen’s most iconic films. Throw in postmodern and referential humor with a penchant for cyberpunk tropes and gadgetry, and you’ve got Jazzpunk.Games like Jazzpunk and The Stanley Parable excel at telling a story through exploration and discovery, and provide a lot of laughs in their initial playthroughs. The downside to this is that once all of the jokes are found, there lacks personal replay value; although, I can see the appeal in replaying the game with company over so to share some laughs or revisiting the game in the future.If you have no qualms playing through an exceptionally funny three hour game for $15, then Jazzpunk might be for you. Personally, I really enjoyed my time with the game, albeit the inclusion of so many minigames kind of put it – at least in my eyes – on the borderline between a traditional title with extensive gameplay, and an interactive narrative game. At the end, I wanted more from Jazzpunk; it felt shorter than it should be and I wanted to see more from the wacky world it takes place in.			"

												Jazzpunk is like a video game version of a comedy like Airplane!, Top Secret, or Get Smart. It's just packed with ridiculous jokes, and I'll say 95% of them connected for me. I was actually laughing out loud for most of the game. However, the game is quite short. It took me less than 3 hours to finish with 100% of the achievements, and I did pretty much everything I could in every level. If you just beeline through the objectives, it'll take you less than an hour and you'll miss most of the content. That would be a terrible way to play this game. It's not long, but it's the kind of game you want to soak up a bit. It's like a more absurd version of Gravity Bone or Thirty Flights of Loving. I definitely recommend it for all of bonkers jokes.

												WTF did I just play?And more importantly: Why The F*** are you not playing this?This really deserves all the thumbs up you can get. It's basically an exploration game. Or even a walking simulator, as there is no way to actually fail. But the comedy is good enough not only to keep you playing but to cheer you up in a way few other games manage to do. And that's actually kind of surprising, seeing how jokes about computers, video games or old detective stories aren't exactly new. Some examples:-your chief asks you to sit down in a stern voice...but there's a farting pillow on your seat-cyber sex if you insert a coin in a fembot-WEDDING QUAKE!-(from the credits) ""stunts performed by...unpaid interns""And so on. About the only game that comes close to comparison (that I know) are Wario's minigames, but those who've played that know that these sorts of games are unique in and of themselves. So all I can say is that the building quality is decent and that the jokes are good ones. Sure, it's not very long. But on a game like this, one shouldn't expect that.			"

												This is honestly one of the most bizarre games i've played in a long time but despite all the madness it does make for a fun experience. In it you play a spy called Polyblank in what is a spoof of 50's and 60's era spy films. The game is so bizarre it's hard to describe it. It really is one of those things you need to experience for yourself. The basic formula of the game is each level is an open area you can expore through at will and discover the various strange and funny events and mini-games in each level. There are some fun mini-games in this game (Wedding Quake being my favourite) that are parodies of classic games. This is a short game but it is packed with a lot of fun.The Good- This game was a lot of fun to play. Each level has a lot of random stuff to discover.- I enjoyed this games humour. It's a bit off the wall and bizarre which was right up my street.- The visual style of this game really stands out and looks great a bit like a weird Hanna-Barbara cartoon.The Bad- It is pretty short. Even with taking my time and almost fully exploring all the levels my playtime came to just over 3 hours. - This games humour might not appeal to everyone.Overall this was a fun but regrettably short game which i enjoyed a lot more than i expected. 7.5/10			"

												I finished this game over a year ago.  Naturally, I had to come back on a day when they least expected to write a review.It had to be today.  Otherwise, they'd find me.This game was FUN, from beginning to end.  Yes, it has randomness and surrealism and...kissy robots.  But that's only part of it--and all of it.  It is an adventure game, so you are actually working towards a goal.  You have to play it to understand the rest of it--or none of it.  Or something.But seriously, play this game.  I'm not usually a compulsive smiler, but this had me grinning at frequently regular intervals.  I would have been quite ashamed if I hadn't been enjoying myself so much.  In fact, it's been too long.  I think I'm gonna go play it again.Crud.  Now they'll find me.  It's exactly what they'd expect.			"

												I should have read the game description rather than looking at the pretty pictures. This game is well... eh? Like many other people who played this game, I went into it thinking there was something else.The initial cut scene and first level set you up for what appears to be a journey like no other. The design and aesthetic of the game capture you with an initial impression that is quirky yet filled with mystery which you assume will unfold into a carefully articulated plot. Sure, there were clues like the whoopie cushion that were used to soften the situation like the room does to frozen water ice. However, I wish it hadnt gone too far. As you progress further into the game, you begin to realize that a story isnt really there. Instead, JazzPunk turns into a walking art gallery. You spend the large portion of your time listening to the ambient noise, interacting with the environment. This isnt a bad thing either because they throw in alot of hidden references that make the experience entertaining and memorable.Ultimately, JazzPunk is a series of events that were created where the developers can input there own type of humor. The length of gameplay is perfect for this type of thing. Like a buffet, the playthrough gives the gamer enough time to indulge in everything and then bail before your eyes adjust to the swine surrounding you. If it was any longer, the whole experience would have been dissapointing. TLDR: Overall, JazzPunk is good. If you dont like looking at stall art for 3 hours, this game isnt for you.			"

Once you complete the game and achievements, there's nothing to do. Well, you could always play Wedding Qake, but it gets boring after several repeats.14€ for 3 hours of fun.

												Jazzpunk is wacky, inventive, and fun. I dug the alternative reality spy motif, found a lot of the dialogue genuinely funny, and was continually surprised until the very end. As far as I can tell, there are no fail states (a conclusion I only reached after spending WAY too much time trying to avoid being seen by a security camera that simply blinked at me and carried no consequences). This lack of tension lowers the challenge, obviously, but it allows you to freely explore every nook and cranny of this bizarre world looking for the jokes and non sequiturs. And let's face it, that's why you're here. Just take your Missionoyl and enjoy the ride.			"

												Is Jazzpunk good? Yes.Is Jazzpunk short? HELL YES.I took my time, tried various things and I finished the game in barely 2 hours. To a rather unsatisfying ending.Don't get me wrong; Jazzpunk is a good game. If you know about computers, video games, the 80s and 90s pop culture and current geek pop culture, there's plenty of laughs to be had. Maybe times I caught myself going ""AW YEAH"" while chuckling. Even a few ""I can't believe they did that."".But, in the end, the game is incredibly underwhelming.Under the guise of a 70s-era spy show set in a computer, you find yourself trying to get a russian data tape, then find an old enemy, save yourself and save someone else. And that's it.Lots of slapstick comedy, but... is it worth 15$? No.10$ would have been a steep yet fair price, in my opinion. For two hours of gameplay, if would be on par with a movie admission ticket.But I complain about movies charging more than 10$ for a 1.5 hours running time feature-length movie, I would be remiss in pointing out the same flaws with a video game.If you want to support an indie developper with a great sense of humour, and maybe Jim Sterling at the same time, then go right ahead.However, if you are looking for anything that will ""go the distance"", so to speak, then don't. And that's with the gimmick of ""click on everything at least once"" of exploration games, such as this one.TL;DR:Hilarious if you're a 25-or-plus years old geek, finished awfully and disappointingly fast.

												A must-play for fans of Top Secret!, Airplane, Naked Gun, Ren and Stimpy, etc. The game, which is sadly only about 2 hours long, is absolutely loaded with jokes, puns, and references to other video games and television. A child of the 90s will feel right at home with all of the references, but anyone with a sense of humor can appreciate the entire game. Not only is the game very funny, but it's also very psychadelic. I feel like certain parts of this game are more drug-induced than the LSD Simulator that was released years ago on the PS1... Very interesting.tl;dr: Buy the game immidiately and play it while drinking with friends. You will die laughing.			"

												This game is one of a delightful new wave of independent games that demonstrates creativity (in form, function, aesthetics, delivery, and basically everything else you might hope to get from a game) is alive and well.  Other than perhaps having a few too many NPCs who are only in the game to spout intentionally uninteresting dialogue, I basically cannot think of anything negative to say about this viscerally insane and fun experience.Well, it is still dumb that you cannot change the control scheme in-game, but if you hold down CTRL while clicking ""play"" you get a keyboard configuration menu and can do things normally that way.

												I bought Jazzpunk as part of the Indie bundle 13. Viewing the trailer, I was really excited for it. It was a humorous, colorful adventure game. It was a major reason why I purchased the bundle.But humor games are dangerous. Typically they're either widely hysterical, or so bland and predictable that you heave a heavy sigh as you wait for the joke to play itself out to see if it in anyway will be helpful to solve the level. Unfortunately, the humor did not connect with me.To anyone looking to purchase this game, I say this: Be careful. Make sure you like the humor in it, otherwise you'll be deeply disappointed.			"

With a unique aesthetic, which is surprisingly beautiful at times, Jazzpunk provides an experience that leaves you laughing and asking ""did I really just see that?"". Not only is the espionage styled storyline fun to play, Jazzpunk also allows you explore the world around you for puns and mini-games aplenty.If your humour leans toward the darker side of comedy and you're all for quirky click games, Jazzpunk is a must buy, and you will be talking about the jokes for weeks after with your friends.

												Essentially a three-hour-long sightseeing tour!The lack of graphic settings beyond resolution and Unity presets is a significant downside, especially since the FOV appears to be locked at a nauseously low view angle.'s gonna make your head spin, especially in the early bits.Overall, the complete lack of options gives way to sensory overload.Especially in the first level, with its bright, clashing colours; but all the way through, music or disorienting sounds playing from multiple sources at once make this basically-a-theme-park-not-a-game a chore at times.Jazzpunk is essentially a series of things to click on numerous times to see what they have to say!There's no failure state to it, but it does have its neat moments, including some neat minigames, some of which based off its own interpretations of what a reference is.(Among them a first-person take on the Street Fighter car smashing bonus thingery as well as ""Wedding Qake"", which you'd have to experience for yourself for my lack of writing experience couldn't bring the impression it left on me across properly.)However, it lacks length (The game is 3 hours long, and that's counting all side exploration, conversations and achievement hunting)and tends to cause nausea, motion- and simulation-sickness, as a number of people point out on its Steam Forums. Hasn't been fixed. No FOV slider or option to turn down or off the volume of mind-drilling ambient saxophone droning noises.The humour may or may not appeal to you, but I definitely cannot recommend this game to you at full price.

												What can I say about Jazzpunk without giving too much away? If you're aged between 28 - 40 and enjoy offbeat pop-culture references with no explanation (you just had to be there, man) this is the game for you. As soon as I started to play, the utter brilliance and absurdity seeped into my brain like a double shot of tequila. Relaxing and exhilarating at the same time, I’ve enjoyed every minute of this game. A true gem, bursting with experimentation, joy and creativity. Necrophone Games are testament to the old adage, “Build it and they will come” and like Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams, Necrophone listened to the voices in their heads and built a game unlike anything we’ve seen before, or will ever see again, and the people rejoiced. Get Jazzpunk, get comfortable and get ready for a good time. "

												I imagine this game will end up (if it isn't already) generating some divided discussions, sort of like The Stanley Parable. In terms of plot length, the game is fairly short. However, there are dozens and dozens of unique assets and dialogue blips to entertain and even evoke a laugh. JAZZPUNK is exactly the kind of game I enjoy: simple gameplay, nonsensical plot, ridiculous situations, trippy art style, out of control soundtrack, and sharp humour. Playing this I feel every childish and random event is deliberate, and often pretty smart.Admittedly $15.00 may be a bit high for such a game, but it'll likely go on sale in the near future. And when it does, I recommend giving JAZZPUNK a shot			"

												This is the definition of a ""short 'n sweet"" game. I completed it in five hours, after replaying some parts to get all the achievements--it's my only perfect game so far. But don't let its small size fool you: full of references and comedy, this game made me laugh/confused me at the same time. It's set in an alternate world as you play Polyblank, a James Bond-esque spy. I just...this game is so weird and grandiose at the same time and I love it. You play mostly unconnected missions (although you can dial a Hint Hotline in-game for help) and I think there are like...3-4, though I'm probably wrong.

												I just finished this game for the first time a moment ago and I can't seem to find the words that would properly describe my experience. So, instead, I will simply tell you about some of the things that I did in the game.> I ate vast quantities of jelly in order to fulfill my ethical obligations> I ran gleefully through the streets of a city, spraying strangers with pigeon pheromones and beheld the spectacle of the ensuing chaos. > I swatted Japanese people with a flyswatter, which resulted in them becoming blow flies and taking to the skies.> I explored the depths of cyberspace as represented by a 3D space suspended in an endless white void.> I cleaned a man's ears, with perhaps a little too much zeal, and was rewarded with a portion of his brain and sandwich -both of which were previously residing in his skull.> I threw a jar full of large, dangerous looking spiders in a man's face and suffered no ill-consequences for it.> I turned on an industrial blender which, for reasons unknown to me, was located in the bottom of a hot-tub, killing and processing the corpses of the four people who were inside and then served a portion of the bloody juices up to an unsuspecting woman who was terribly thirsty.> I snogged a homeless manThe game has an unremarkable story that shows glimpses of wanting to be a meta-commentary on things from time to time but is ultimately just mindlessly stupid (in a good way mind) and requires no real focus.7/10, a very memorable experience; buy when on special.

												What can I say, this game works on so many levels. It's funny. You will be laughing. There are lots of shoutouts to lots of other stuff. If you are old enough that the game's retro mid-century aesthetic is what you remember from your childhood, even better. If you are familiar with some electrical engineering, there are vintage schematics and several very nerdy puns. If you remember The Cold War (the first one; as I am writing this Russia has just seized Crimea), even better. If you have been playing computer games since the MS-DOS days even better. If you are familiar with the Japanese and/or Russian languages, even better. If you are familiar with the names in the guestbook, even better.Even if you just arrived on this planet yesterday, you will really enjoy this game.

												After months passed after beating Jazzpunk, I wasn't completely comfortable recommending it. Even though I absolutely loved every second of it. But now, I think it's time to voice my thoughts on this game.Jazzpunk is a game that meets every desire I would want in a video game. It has one of the funniest senses of humor I've seen in a game. Baffling the player with surreal situations that, upon first playthrough, are absolutely unpredictable. However, this humor is not for everyone, and that's why I had trouble recommending it. For me, my god it's hilarious. But for most of my friends, and most people on Steam, it's probably not for them.Basically, I absolutely loved this game, and I will vouch for it for anyone with a love for surreal humor. Anyone else... not really. The only real problem I have with the game is that it's 15 dollars at the time that I write this. It doesn't seem like much of a difference, but I feel that 10 dollars is a more fitting price. See, I'm mostly okay with buying at full price, but not everyone will feel the same. So, if it's on sale: BUY BUY BUY! Unless you don't mind. I don't care. I'm not good at writing reviews. I'm sorry for wasting your time.			"

												""Holy Pidgeon, i'm on LSD and i don't know how to catch flies without beeing called a pervert""This could be a good slogan to promote this game. All in all this game was made with so much love for the details and the developers create a game that is simply not comparable to other ones. In each and every corner you can find funny eastereggs and you're always searching for the next joke. The gameplay is simple and it was not the main object the developers focused on becouse the humor and the weirdness pay you back every penny. Not sure if its worth 15€ but if you get a hand on it at the sales this one is a must buy. You will not regret it and you will laugh enough to wake up your roommates/neighbours/parents/gf/bf like i did :)			"

Clearly, this game is not for everyone - weird, exaggarated, confusing...i'll admit, sometimes it's too weird, though Jazzpunk is still hilarious, stylish, bold, awesome gameplay-wise and it always finds a way to surprise you with an easter egg or a reference. Or augmented cowboys ( i never asked..). A very clever and enjoyable game indeed, 9/10.			"

												Jazzpunk is a game where you walk around and do special missions! Which really shouldn't be taken seriously, as the game is all about doing funny missions, activities and coming across references. What attracted me is the art style of the world and the people, which all can be seen in first person.  I really enjoyed the humour in this game and it even made me laugh out loud several times. Even after a while playing the humour doesn't get predictable. The humour is mostly: cartoonish, absurd and goofy. Afterall I am happy that I have played Jazzpunk because there are not many games with an funny experience. The only two complaints I have is that after a while I didn't want to talk to random people in the game because they weren't that funny. And the other one is that the game only takes around 3 hours, Which may be for many people too few hours for the asking price. So those people can better wait for a sale.In short:A game where you walk around and encounter many funny activities, references, people and mini-games.			"

Kissing hobos and robot sex aside, the storyline is also pretty dang good and the replay value is high too, considering I'd definitely take a swing at this in a couple months just to hear some of the odd bits of dialogue again.

												An odd, surreal, colorful world, the first thing you'll notice about this game is just how creatively bizarre it is. It's strangely familiar with many of its elements and homages, and yet when it mixes them all up you still feel a breath of creativeness shine through. If you enjoyed things like old 60's cartoons or shows with their campiness, and love tongue in cheek humour, this is a great game for that. It also reminded me a bit of the Venture Bros., with the tone of everything satirizing and poking fun at the ""cartoons of yesteryear"".The humour and art direction are indeed the strongest points to this game. If you're looking for a plot, however, I would say this doesn't really have much of one, aside from glimpses of the world they live in. The writing is at its strongest with humour, which is what the game 100% is.Unfortunately, the game is very short, at most 2 hours, and not much replay value unless you like to experience it again after a long time or 100% the game. I recommend it solely off of the fact that it is an extremely funny game, but I would not pick it up for its full price of $15. Pick it up for when it's under $5, preferably around $3. It is well worth that price in broken sides and laughs alone.			"

												Take one part Get Smart, one part Warioware, a generous splash of Ren and Stimpy, liquify then shake well and what your left with is Jazzpunk. A wholly unique and incredibly fun game. It is, hands down, one of the best games I've played in ages. Considering how simple of a game it is that may seem like an exaggeration, but that's the truth. The entirety of the gameplay is essentially walking around and clicking on just about anything you can see. However, inside the simple gameplay is a wealth of humor and absurdism so abundant that it bursts through the simplicity to smack you in the face, leaving you asking for more. This is a really short game, I mean extremely so, and I would have loved for it to be longer. But really, there's so much packed into what little length there is that I know if I play through it again I'll find more goodies, side quests, and easter eggs that I didn't see the first few times around. I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I got this way below the asking price in a bundle, but it is more than worth the full fifteen dollars. If you can get it cheaper, then great, but consider buying it full price if you can't because it's a great game that everyone should try.			"

												Great game! Its best to play this without any idea on what the game is about. But I can at least tell you that this game has excellent dialogue.This is a 4 hour game, so you can finish it in an afternoon and it won't take up a lot of your time. I highly recommend this game.Go play it!			"

												Jazzpunk is an incredibly humorous game, with a great main quest in addition to a considerable number of side quests, that can potentially earn you an achievement (if you work out how to actually achieve them). The only down-side is that the game isn't very long, even if you are questing for all of the achievements... but because of Wedding Qake and my epic degaussing skills, I rate 10/10 and highly recommend the game to anyone who is in need of cheering up!Phage complete.

												I got this game as a gift, so I didn't have to pay 15 dollars, which I think is a little steep when it took my about 4 hours to perfect the game. That's not to say I don't like it, and you could spend a long amount of time finding every easter egg on each level. Kissing hobos and robot sex aside, the storyline is also pretty dang good and the replay value is high too, considering I'd definitely take a swing at this in a couple months just to hear some of the odd bits of dialogue again.

												A weird,humorous,3ish hour adventure,full of random gags and references to the 80/90s.Pros:-quite a few gags and references manage to elicit a laugh-nice art style,it's simple and weird but it works-music/sound effects are good-quite a bit to find/do if you explore aroundNeutral:-humor isn't for everyone,Adult Swim is known for their puns,sexual innuendos and moreCons:-on the short side-a few random framedrops here and there-some slight control issues Overall,if you like Adult Swim and their brand of humor I'd say this is worth a go when on a 75% sale (to justify its price due to its short length).

												Jazzpunk is a game where you walk around and do special missions! Which really shouldn't be taken seriously, as the game is all about doing funny missions, activities and coming across references. What attracted me is the art style of the world and the people, which all can be seen in first person.  I really enjoyed the humour in this game and it even made me laugh out loud several times. Even after a while playing the humour doesn't get predictable. The humour is mostly: cartoonish, absurd and goofy. Afterall I am happy that I have played Jazzpunk because there are not many games with an funny experience. The only two complaints I have is that after a while I didn't want to talk to random people in the game because they weren't that funny. And the other one is that the game only takes around 3 hours, Which may be for many people too few hours for the asking price. So those people can better wait for a sale.In short:A game where you walk around and encounter many funny activities, references, people and mini-games.			"

												I just finished this game for the first time a moment ago and I can't seem to find the words that would properly describe my experience. So, instead, I will simply tell you about some of the things that I did in the game.> I ate vast quantities of jelly in order to fulfill my ethical obligations> I ran gleefully through the streets of a city, spraying strangers with pigeon pheromones and beheld the spectacle of the ensuing chaos. > I swatted Japanese people with a flyswatter, which resulted in them becoming blow flies and taking to the skies.> I explored the depths of cyberspace as represented by a 3D space suspended in an endless white void.> I cleaned a man's ears, with perhaps a little too much zeal, and was rewarded with a portion of his brain and sandwich -both of which were previously residing in his skull.> I threw a jar full of large, dangerous looking spiders in a man's face and suffered no ill-consequences for it.> I turned on an industrial blender which, for reasons unknown to me, was located in the bottom of a hot-tub, killing and processing the corpses of the four people who were inside and then served a portion of the bloody juices up to an unsuspecting woman who was terribly thirsty.> I snogged a homeless manThe game has an unremarkable story that shows glimpses of wanting to be a meta-commentary on things from time to time but is ultimately just mindlessly stupid (in a good way mind) and requires no real focus.7/10, a very memorable experience; buy when on special.

												Games like this are often not for everyone, and really it will come down to weather you're open to something new, different, but personally speaking, I went in not knowing much, and came out laughing, having explored every little nook and cranny the game has. The world has a strange, absurd stream of consciousness feel to it, with the odd musical score jittering throughout the game, I left feeling like this was a genuine attempt at being a little different and succeeding somewhat.I clocked in just two hours on it, so I'll let you decide if that's worth 10 pounds, but as of right now it's a mere 3 pounds and for that price I'd say it's absolutely worth it.

												Madcap, hilarious and weird. Mashes together cyberpunk, 50's/60's aesthetics, spy movies, and on-point video game references. Absurd and ridiculous sense of humor that is unpredictable but not stupidly random. Most of the jokes have amazing punchlines if you think about it enough. A good portion of this barrage of goofball antics are really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ funny, and will leave a lingering snicker under your breath for the rest of the day.The gameplay is basic. The puzzles are generally solved through exploring the world, identifying things out of place and investigating. Minimal understanding of the game world's logic needs to be applied; your first instincts are usually right.I can't recommend this game enough.

While you do have a general objective for each stage, you aren't forced into carrying them out, you can just explore the stage and do whatever.The humour in this game is what makes it worth playing, it uses a lot of references to technology and gaming in general.The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it's pretty short, but if you go and explore the levels fully (Which you'll want to do) it's not so bad.

												The, “are video-games art?” debate has to-date been hampered by one glaring issue. Every video-game people point to as a great example that they ARE art is, more or less, the same. Somebody who doesn't think video-games are art, and doesn't think Journey, Flower, and its' ilk are evidence to the contrary is probably not going to be swayed by examples of other games that are very similar to Journey and Flower. I really like those games, for the record. Enter Jazzpunk. This game is, at the core, an art game. The entire point of it is to explore the world, find interesting hidden stuff, and progress a very basic plot that takes you to new areas and new hidden stuff. Most things you interact with have no point, other than to tell a joke or show you a weird thing. The difference between this game and those other 'art' games is mostly one of tone, but it is different enough that I think people who hate Flower could easily love this. It removes the pretension from art games and grounds the genre in weird, cyber-cold-war trappings. It's genuinely hilarious. It, quite frankly, has grown up. Flower is the type of interactive art that a poetry major straight out of college would dream up. Jazzpunk, on the other hand, feels like it was made by some dude in his thirties who likes wrestling, eighties action movies, and Johnny Mnemonic. It has meat, and substance, and an actual identity that's all its' own. It has, quite literally, changed the game. From now on when I want to show a non-gamer an artsy-fartsy type interactive experience, it probably won't be Flower or Journey, as much as I like those games. It'll be Jazzpunk.			"

												I imagine this game will end up (if it isn't already) generating some divided discussions, sort of like The Stanley Parable. In terms of plot length, the game is fairly short. However, there are dozens and dozens of unique assets and dialogue blips to entertain and even evoke a laugh. JAZZPUNK is exactly the kind of game I enjoy: simple gameplay, nonsensical plot, ridiculous situations, trippy art style, out of control soundtrack, and sharp humour. Playing this I feel every childish and random event is deliberate, and often pretty smart.Admittedly $15.00 may be a bit high for such a game, but it'll likely go on sale in the near future.

												What can I say about Jazzpunk without giving too much away? If you're aged between 28 - 40 and enjoy offbeat pop-culture references with no explanation (you just had to be there, man) this is the game for you. As soon as I started to play, the utter brilliance and absurdity seeped into my brain like a double shot of tequila. Relaxing and exhilarating at the same time, I’ve enjoyed every minute of this game. A true gem, bursting with experimentation, joy and creativity. Necrophone Games are testament to the old adage, “Build it and they will come” and like Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams, Necrophone listened to the voices in their heads and built a game unlike anything we’ve seen before, or will ever see again, and the people rejoiced.

												BUY/SALE/PASS: Sale - Wait for a price dropPerhaps the closest video games will ever come to the cult classic comedy film ‘Airplane!’, Jazzpunk never fails to make any interaction with absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anything result in something that makes you laugh out loud whilst mired in a murky middle ground of confusion and amusement. Simple missions to infiltrate complexes and retrieve secret intel are spun out to also include such activities as guiding mind controlled pigeons, watching movies while armed with a bucket of popcorn to hurl at people further down the rows, and an outrageous shout-out to the best bonus game in Street Fighter history. Oh my car indeed.The vibrant-colored cartoony environments, the huge dialogue text, the restroom sign shaped characters, and the rapid fire jokes makes this first person adventure/descent into madness both fun and stylish. If you have ever laughed at the likes of comedy classics ‘Naked Gun’, ‘Hot Shots’, or ‘Kung Pow: Enter The Fist’, Jazzpunk is a fully worthy experience. Be confused. Be very confused.			"

Gameplay is inspired by spoof comedy films and cartoons of yesteryear, with a focus on weird gadgets, exotic locales, and open-world style exploration."" -Please read the entirety of the review for all considerations-The Cold War era and corporate-espionage themes are nice and not common in games. There is, mixed in, a world where technological integration and a feeling of publicity in every action taken is felt. The locations visited in the game, especially if they are actually named their alternative national names (in a 'mission' where you fly to your location) are a nice variety.That being said, for the gameplay; there is a good amount to see on each level and a nice artistic style. While the levels are decent, they tend to be relatively short considering how many levels there are in the game. With a dozen or so levels (there I told you how many there are): some can be completed in a manner of minutes- even one that can be completed in seconds (the 'mission' where you fly to your location). This game relies on the side-missions or exploring the locations to add gameplay, as doing the objective straight-forward results in a even-moreso short game.The game story is spy-ish and that's nice and all, but with little context as to what you are actually doing and an ending that says ""this could be explained later"" but, as of September 2015, has no additional missions or follow-up.For 15 US dollars, this game is short in gameplay and (frankly) not a high gameplay-to-dollar ratio. I have, as of this review, 3.1 hours into the game: and that includes two runs of the entire game, exploring the entirety of each map; playing the joke mini-games, like Wedding Qake, several times; and replaying select levels to do all the mini-games over again, like the ""boss level"" and the ""vacation resort"" locations.That being said, for the good quality and detail and fun this game has, for 15 dollars I would not recommend this game until, either, there is a sale or some sort of additional gameplay bundled with it.

AUDIOBad VibesVISUALSurrealDIFFICULTYGlitchyVIBESurrealCRAVINGExperimentalON SALEOccasionallyPROS: As someone who is enamoured with surrealism, this kept my attention through to the very end. It is fashioned like LSD: Dream Simulator for PSX. Levels are dream-like in consistency and style, while sound serves to bemuse and disorient.CONS: Difficulty seesaws illogically. FOV is messed up; at best, you will constantly be butting into things. At worst, you will get motion sickness. Final level is not designed well, making it inordinantly-laggy. Too short for it's undiscounted asking price. The artistic direction is tops, but the actual game design is amateur.WORTH: It's not worth $15.00 USD, plain and simple. A fair amount of my hours came from walkthrough creation, you can expect to beat this game in less than four hours. It sees the occasional sale, but only during the major holidays.OVERALL: Jazzpunk has heavy goals involving ""alternate reality Cold War Cyber-Crime Espionage"" that fall hilariously flat, but it's comedic eyecandy and worth a night of drunkplay with that distinguishable Adult Swim style. SCORE: 7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												I adore this game. It has a lot of really simple humor in it that you could miss if you just power through. It is rather short, but that is part of it's charm. I finished it in about two hours, but it has replay value to get all the achievements.			"

												The most carefully crafted nonsense I've ever played in my entire life. If I could describe this game in one word, it would be absurd. The humor hits more often than it misses, and there are tons of bad computer related puns, lots of Airplane/Naked Gun style humor, and a bunch of stuff that reminds me of Ren and Stimpy. If you're into dumb games then this is right in your wheelhouse.			"

												Too many puns + great art style + great mini games = genuinely wacky, in a pretty delightful way.  I would say it's a bit short, that it sometimes feels a bit empty, and that at times the content seemed shallow.  The puns at times became a crutch for lack of ... narrative, maybe?  A game doesn't need a story, of course, but this sort of game needs something story like.  An ironic, absurd something.  What it had wasn't quite enough to keep me intrigued while meandering through the levels.Still, strongly recommended.			"

												Great game. In many ways it feels similar to The Stanley Parable, except here you have multiple levels, all of which have a bunch of stuff to see and do. While you do have a general objective for each stage, you aren't forced into carrying them out, you can just explore the stage and do whatever.The humour in this game is what makes it worth playing, it uses a lot of references to technology and gaming in general.The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it's pretty short, but if you go and explore the levels fully (Which you'll want to do) it's not so bad.

												The, “are video-games art?” debate has to-date been hampered by one glaring issue. Every video-game people point to as a great example that they ARE art is, more or less, the same. Somebody who doesn't think video-games are art, and doesn't think Journey, Flower, and its' ilk are evidence to the contrary is probably not going to be swayed by examples of other games that are very similar to Journey and Flower. I really like those games, for the record. Enter Jazzpunk. This game is, at the core, an art game. The entire point of it is to explore the world, find interesting hidden stuff, and progress a very basic plot that takes you to new areas and new hidden stuff. Most things you interact with have no point, other than to tell a joke or show you a weird thing. The difference between this game and those other 'art' games is mostly one of tone, but it is different enough that I think people who hate Flower could easily love this. It removes the pretension from art games and grounds the genre in weird, cyber-cold-war trappings. It's genuinely hilarious. It, quite frankly, has grown up. Flower is the type of interactive art that a poetry major straight out of college would dream up. Jazzpunk, on the other hand, feels like it was made by some dude in his thirties who likes wrestling, eighties action movies, and Johnny Mnemonic. It has meat, and substance, and an actual identity that's all its' own. It has, quite literally, changed the game. From now on when I want to show a non-gamer an artsy-fartsy type interactive experience, it probably won't be Flower or Journey, as much as I like those games. It'll be Jazzpunk.			"

												I really wasn't sure what to make of this game. I'll admit that it was an impulse buy. The trailer for the game was intriguing, although not necessarily indicative of the actual game. But for the cost I thought I would try it out.What I really like out this game is that it's really good at poking fun at everyone. I found myself laughing at inside jokes from my childhood, i.e. Ninja Turtles, SW, old school Quake, Street Fighter, Twister......I mean the list goes on and on. It also pokes fun at modern society, medicine, and morality without being too tongue in cheek.The achievements are relatively easy to obtain. The gameplay is also not overly complex. As an added bonus there are mini games scattered throughout the campaign. My biggest disappointment with this game is that it is quite short, and even a long run thru will only last you maybe 2 hours. It also desperately needs a sequel. It's not terribly expensive, but if you get it at a good price then I think that it is worth buying. It's a fun and funny game. I would love to see a successor to this, with new jokes, trippy missions, and outrageous mini games. Timmah says: 12/""It's meant to be quite good"" "

												Jazzpunk was born from an alternate reality in which Leslie Nielsen did not die and instead became an adventure game designer. Quirky, bizarre, disorienting, and hilarious from the opening cutscene to the final fade to black, Jazzpunk has to be seen to be believed. Most of the obstacles are simple to overcome and the game can be finished in a single sitting, but it's all about the journey in Jazzpunk. Walking around, poking everything just to see what happens, and then rubbing your eyes in disbelief when you see the results.It's an experience that I was sad to see end, but it's brief stay on my computer screen made it's impact all the more potent.If you have no qualms about spending money on a short interactive comedy then definitely pick up Jazzpunk. It'll provide fourth degree burns all over your face.			"

												Jazzpunk is a brief but hilarious indie game full of non sequiturs and espionage. After finishing the game in the 3 hours it takes to complete it would seem like a reasonable guess that I could have something to say about this game. Unfortunately this game has the unique quality of being completely indescribable. What is accomplished between the start and the end of this game is not something that can be put into words, and attempting to do so would destroy what makes Jazzpunk so great. I suggest anyone who has the time and money to play this game to get it if only to show the world that taking risks and making unique experiences is important.			"

												8/10What to say about Jazzpunk? It's a blast in every way possible.Ok, the world is limited and the graphics are basic. Who cares? The personality and originality of this game surpasses any other. Set during the Cold War, it's a mockery of conspiracy and the fear of new technology that abounded in that era.You enter each level by taking pills, then you have to solve the puzzles using the craziest interactions possible to discover who the bad guy is. There is plenty to explore in each level that doesn't have to do with the main story.By the way, this game predicted ebola.Fun includes: Zapping pigeons, killing pizza, turning on the fire and ice alarms, playing WeddingQuake, putting as much makeup on as you want, catching a robotic pig, racing gravy dishes, killing someone in a pillowfight, and getting eaten by a crocodile  (or is it an alligator?)

												Oh what a disappointment this game is. Let me count the ways.1. While a cork to the face in real life is rather overpowered, this is a game. Please balance the cork.2, I don't know who this ""Jim Sterling"" is but I must say they were the weak link as far as the superb and clear voice-acting went. Replace him with William Dafoe.3. It is not remotely realistic for that leak to be fixed so soon, please try to make the game believable.4. The game ends, this is a serious problem, correct via constantly adding more content, being sure to hire a necromancer to revive your expired corpse to continue.5. The Gelatin should have been included, it was a major selling point early on and i'm disappointed the finished product doesn't come with it. Instead you merely eat it in the game. That's just cruel.			"

												Jazzpunk is more than a game, it's an experience. While one could presumably speed through the game in under 2 hours, the point of the game is not to simply find the exit. Jazzpunk is best experienced at a slow pace. Just like the best point-and-click adventure games, Jazzpunk encourages you to poke around in all corners and explore every option. Heck, even the game lets you break the rules. Wanna put lipstick everywhere BUT your lips? You can do just that. I've put in more time than I'd like to admit into Wedding Quake. If you're someone who wants to see the Ren and Stimpy philosophy in action, Jazzpunk is for you.			"

												I love quirky, unique, off-the-wall games and was really looking forward to Jazzpunk based on the reviews. What I got, however, was a game with an incoherent story, painfully dull core mechanics, uninteresting objectives and scattershot ""trying-too-hard"" humor that doesn't work for me at all. Perhaps the last point is a cultural or age-based issue since I'm English and now into my 40's, but I found nothing funny about the game at all. The reviews that Jazzpunk is getting suggests that it definitely has an audience out there, but it's clearly not me. I would suggest taking a peek at some videos before buying in order to make sure that it's the sort of experience that's going to work for you.			"

												Ehhhh... I would have recommended this if it was cheaper, but for 12€ you get 2-3 hours (this including most of the side activities and achivements) of comedy that ranges from actually funny to ""that was supposed to be funny?"", which I realise is hard to avoid with a game that is completely built on comedy, but while a game like The Stanley Parable managed to be funny time after time, the jokes here aren't very fun on replay if at all. The gameplay is also a bit on the iffy side, which for a ""walk and interact with stuff"" kind of game is hard to defend, with the walking in the game feeling floaty and sluggish, and there just isn't enough varriation in fun things to happen when clicking around. The sound design is also rather bad with music that is downright depressing and droning, and overdone robot effects on voices which sometimes makes it hard to actually understand what is being said.If you see this on a really cheap sale and want to see a game build itself entierly on crazy random comedy, then sure, do pick it up, but it's simply not worth more than 5€ in my opinion when there isn't a lot of content to be had, with only 3 actual big levels.

No using turtles, no flying brains, and the skycar section is literally about 10 seconds long and basically on rails.

												This game is incredible. First of all, it's absolutely gorgeous in the most retro/♥♥♥♥♥♥/stylized/STRANGE way??? Which I love. The trailers and intro to the game are gorgeous, and from the moment you step out of your person-shapped luggage case, there's a lot to explore and look at (talk to the box). It's definitely not the longest game by any means, but it's jam-packed with humor and is by far the most surreal game I've ever had the enjoyment of playing. The NPCs have some hilarious lines, the levels are full of strange side missions and stuff to interact with and there are even a few minigames to find. Everything is so surreal and it breaks the fourth wall a lot and it's so random I JUST LOVE IT SO MUCH. You can wack people with a fly swatter why would you not buy this			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic. It requires some thinking, sense of humor, and curiosity to get the most out of it though. There are many minigames, side quests, and hilarious tasks that make up the bulk of this game, as you can beat the main story in a very short amount of time. Even though it's only about 2-3 hours if you play it the way I do (just looking around each stage to find whatever I can, but not caring enough to find everything.), this game is just WAY too good to miss out on. Wait for it to go on sale if you don't wanna spend that much money for just 5 hours of entertainment.EDIT: This game has great replay value for me atleast, so seriously, if you can get this game, get it.

												Jazzpunk is really great. It's the kind of game the Zucker Brothers (Airplane, The Naked Gun) would make if they were around and playing games during the Nintendo 64 era. The humor is mostly really really silly, but there's so many gags thrown in there that eventually one will pop up that really makes you laugh. The whole game feels more like a fun toy than a game with a well defined structure. Most of the areas have lots and lots of optional things to play with or people to get dialogue from. There's almost nothing else out there like Jazzpunk, and I wish I could play it all over again without knowing the gags. I recommend it.			"

I think this game has so much potential, and then it`s so short, that i completed it in under 4 hours, and still I was running around and explored what I could. You play as a secret agant, who must complete tasks given by your leader.The games key factor is it`s humor, the game uses everything from bad puns till pure randomness, and it`s so amusing to just walk around and see what you can find. The game has very few stages, but still, the game delivers entertainment from the beginning till the end. The story is not that complex, the two first missions is just you retriving some object, and thereafter the game get´s a plot, wich I will not spoil. The game mechanics are simplem, pick things up and use them when needed.The game get`s a thumps up, allthough i`m stil a bit mad about the lengh of the game, it delivred intertanment all the way throug. 5 out of 10			"

I'll wait.If you didn't like that, you might not enjoy this game too much. Maybe you should go buy a different game.If you thought it was at all funny, Jazzpunk will be worth your time. The gameplay is nothing amazing. It's just a lot of humor, references, jokes, and fun. To me, it was worth every second I played it. Massively entertaining. Even the end credits were fun.On the other hand, it is quite short, and it might not be worth full price. Get it on sale, or in a bundle, and enjoy.			"

												It's very damn short and i am glad i didn't pay full price for this game and only had to spend 4 bucks on it. Anyway, i really enjoyed this game, visually wise and humor wise. It usually takes alot that an indie game makes me laugh when it atempts humor, and while i didn't laughed out loud once, i got a few chuckles out of it sometimes and found some things pretty funny or amusing, and even that is an accomplishment alone, which i command Jazzpunk for. Otherwise, the whole setting is pretty cool and bizarre, sorta like a take on Soviet Russia, Japan, Cyberpunk and whatnot. I like bizarre/weird Settings anyway so this was a big plus in my book in the first place. I am pretty glad the game is as long as it is, if it would have been longer, i don't think i would have enjoyed it as much after some time. Besides the main game you have short, but nice little minigames to and the also  alot of dialoge with the characters and/or the enviroment itself. If you rush the game and don't talk to anybody, you will be done in an hour i guess, but if you take your time and basically explore everything you get a good few hours counting, atleast for me it didOnce again, i can recommend it, one of the few indiegames i like out there. For what it basically is though, i can't recommend it for the 15 € (or dollar) pricetag.			"

You know all that kooky stuff you see in the trailer, that sets you up for a super psychadelic experience? Yeah, pretty much none of it actually happens in the game. No using turtles, no flying brains, and the skycar section is literally about 10 seconds long and basically on rails. It's good for what it is, but the trailer is just flat-out dishonest and you'll breeze through this in an hour and a half. Get it on a sale.			"

												I love quirky, unique, off-the-wall games and was really looking forward to Jazzpunk based on the reviews. What I got, however, was a game with an incoherent story, painfully dull core mechanics, uninteresting objectives and scattershot ""trying-too-hard"" humor that doesn't work for me at all. Perhaps the last point is a cultural or age-based issue since I'm English and now into my 40's, but I found nothing funny about the game at all. The reviews that Jazzpunk is getting suggests that it definitely has an audience out there, but it's clearly not me. I would suggest taking a peek at some videos before buying in order to make sure that it's the sort of experience that's going to work for you.			"

												Le sigh. Well, this game was funny-ish (how many electronic/software/computer puns can you fit into one scene?). Very charming, retro-chic style and music (the music is the best part). Makes me wish I was a high-roller sales exec in the 50s, when flying and traveling were still cool.But other than the massive nostalgia blast, kind of not fun as a GAME. Lots of near-chuckle moments, almost no laughing. A single digit number of gross-out/creep-out moments. Jazzpunk really wants to be Maniac Mansion or Day or the Tentacle, or some other adventure game that really knows how to bring the funny, but those games it ain't. I got this as part of a bundle from another distributor that shall not be named. Glad I did, otherwise I'd have been annoyed at how short the game was. (A lot of my recorded game time was just pausing the game to go do something else). If you watch a playthrough, it's as fun as doing it yourself. So don't buy this game. Because you have better things to do. Like, anything.I'm telling you, if you buy this game and finish it after reading this review, you'll be like, ""Man, I wish I had listened to that reviewer guy, he was right."" Last chance? Fine, whatever, get the game, I don't care. I just felt super-stupid finishing it, and I'm only telling you now so you won't have to suffer the shame and regret that I did. Cheers!			"

												PRO: -Its kind of funny, but for the humor to matter you would have to give a ****, which is hard to do for a game that has barely any gameplay.CONS:-For the price this game is terrible. I got it on sale for 6 quid and it was still too much. This seems like a blatant, effortless attempt to make some money and rip people off. -Even the voice acting is computer generated.-The game consists of running around and listening to mostly unfunny jokes.-Graphics are bad-Gameplay is not fun 2/10 WOULD NOT PLAY AGAIN			"

												The plot is awful (and can be explained in 5 seconds) the side missions aren't even missions, and the game is as linear as it can get. At first, the game seems pretty interesting. But it quickly becomes boring/confusing/stupid. The game can be easily beaten in less than 90 minutes. Don't buy the game unless it's at least 90% off. Not worth the money I spent.			"

												I'm usually all for wierd games, but this one achieves nothing else. It's ridiculous and absurd, and while I'd generally say those are good things, there is simply nothing else behind this game.

												This game is amazing. The style of the game is unique, and it is by far the most funny game I have ever played. The greatest part of the game may not even be the main story, but all of the other mide missions and games. The side missions lead to a longer gameplay, which is nice because the main story isn't that big. I think that my favorite game in the game was ""Wedding Qake."" I played that game alone for 30 minutes. It is also cool that when you get up to the part of the game which Wedding Qake is in, it is is the ""Extras"" section so you can play it any time. To sum my review up, this game is one of the best I have ever played, and I would rate it 6 stars. (Out of 5)			"

												Firstly, it is hard to be serious about this game, it throws humor at you from just about any realm of interest. The game is about thirty to forty-five minutes long in the story length but you will spend some time admiring the world or just laughing at the random occurences. The story is nothing special but filled with jokes and references to easily find this entertaining. This game does what a video game should do, entertain the player and provide maybe some challenge but makes the experience memorable and fun. I would recommend this game to anyone that wants to just play a casual and humorous game.			"

												I love this game, don't get me wrong. I love its quirkyness and it never fails to make me laugh.

I personally picked this up in a Humble Bundle, and it has previously been on sale for around £3, which I feel is a reasonable price, but when you pay £10.99 for a game, you expect at least a few hours of gameplay.Nevertheless, I will be replaying this game to find all of the achievements, and it will probably still be as funny as the first time around. Flawless gameplay, no glitches, totally original concept. Just a little expensive if it isn't on sale.			"

												Jazzpunk is one of those diamonds in the rough that you find once in a while, although it isn't the longest game out there, it still has a lot of fun and hilarious content packed into it. i found myself wanting so much more from the game after i got to the end.You start the game as Polyblank and from the intro credits video it shows you are being shipped somewhere in a human shaped suitcase. Another example of the different style of comedy this game portrays.I wasn't invested with the story as i was too taken by what was happening at that moment in time. One second it's sitting in a room reading comedic hospital booklets, next it's swatting flies in a vase shop. The game always has you knowing that something funny can and will happen. So i never really payed attention to the story as much as i should, but i did gather that You're an agent for some agency that has their headquarters in a seemingly abandoned subway station, from the way the game is and its style it feels like its 1950's to 1960's era. but you talk to ""The Director"" in the organisation and he assigns you to do these James Bond style of missions. The missions start after you take ""Missionoyl"" pills which i found quite humorous.You need to save the director who gets kidnapped near the end which came with some funny yet new ways of comedy.The game has an mix of looking both cartoon and drawn, it really sets it apart from a lot of other games. the game-play makes it much more exciting to explore instead of going straight to the objective, the game will be quite short if the player just went for the objective, but as do any games the side quests tend to bulk it up. But as much exploring i did, and i tried to see everything, it still felt rather short as i completed the game in just 3 hours. It left me wanting a lot more of whatever charm that Jazzpunk had.I really enjoyed Jazzpunk, i hope that whenever Jazzpunk 2 or similar comes out that it keeps me as humoured as Jazzpunk9/10 Love It			"

												This is less of a ""Game"" and more of an experience.  And that's a shame because at it's pricepoint I figured it would be at least worth some puzzle solving akin to the days of point and click adventure games.  But not really, anything puizzling is pretty much linear.  There are lots of secrets, but it's really only about searching different areas until something funny happens.  If there was more ""Meat"" to this game (Puzzles and the like) I could reccomend it.  But honestly as a comedy piece it's not worth playing through a mere four levels for this level of strangeness.

The gags that were rewards were worth it though.As you can see, it took me about 3 hours to get through the whole game.

												Oh boy, Jazzpunk.There are not a lot of games out there which force me to laugh out loud while being home alone in front of my computer screen, but Jazzpunk certainly is one of them. I literally LOL’d quite a few times while playing this game.This game is so silly I can’t even begin writing about it, so I’ll just paste the Steam store description:“Jazzpunk is a comedy adventure set in an alternate reality Cold War World, plagued with corporate espionage, CyberCrime, and sentient martinis. Gameplay is inspired by spoof comedy films and cartoons of yesteryear, with a focus on weird gadgets, exotic locales, and open-world style exploration.“You have to experience it yourself. It’s worth it.

												If this game was a meal it would be one from one of those take-away places where the menu has a picture that makes it look like Heston Blumenthal works in the kitchen but what you get is a brown paper bag with a passable burger and some listless fries.Let's try and concoct a genre tag for this one. Interactive pun simulator? Burroughs-em-up? It's a distracting and fairly enjoyable little thing, but this is ultimately a once only experience. I wouldn't recommend dropping more than £5 on this if you can avoid it given a loose £/hr enjoyment ratio you can get everywhere else.I'm all for doing something a bit different within the concept of a 'game'. What Jazzpunk provides is an on-rails 'experience' telling a somewhat surreal story laced with puns and references to hard-boiled detective fiction and gaming staples and offering up a few puzzles to solve on the way.Whilst never exactly actively bad it does suffer from being overly drawn out in places and the general pacing feels a little disjointed. The puzzles seem to actually get less difficult as the story progresses, perhaps this was a intentional 'thing' but if so the point of it was lost on me.If you've played games long enough to anticipate some of the usual game design language (the items hidden in the bind corner, if the game points you left have a quick look to the right, pull the lever that appears to do nothing etc) then don't bother chasing after the intriguing possibilities in Jazzpunk. There a lot of hidings to nothing to waste your time on for no reward.I really am trying to be positive about this game, I'm giving it a thumbs up because it's not actiively awful.What there is is very nicely made, there's nothing technically wrong with it, but ultimately when reaching the end I was just left with a general feeling of ""Oh. Well that happened. Next!"".			"

												The overall game itself doesn't take too long to complete, maybe about 45 minutes or so. I managed to complete the game and got almost every achievement on my first playthrough on 3 hours, the 0.4 hours was just getting the last three-four achievements I needed to complete the game.The fun is in finding all the hidden secrets and easter eggs, such as the 'Wedding Quake' minigame and a couple of others, in which you'll surely rack up some extra hours spent searching for these fun little things.Overall, I really recommend this game, despite being a bit short for my liking, I really enjoyed all the little things you can do in the game and all the bad puns that came along with it.

												In my short time with this game I've infiltrated the Soviet Embassy, devoured countless pharmaceuticals, committed insurance fraud, played miniature golf, stolen a top secret cybernetic kidney, and boxed a sedan to the death. Jazzpunk is filled to the brim with personality, humor, and enough WTF moments to make even the most seasoned adventure gamer blush. The setting alone is worth the price of admission; Imagine Mad Men meets Blade Runner written by the folks who brought you Airplane and directed by Tim Schafer. Sure, it may only clocks in at four hours; but it never ceases to be utterly engrossing as well as hilarious. I've not played something so memorable, so provocative, so weird as this in quite some time. If you're a fan of spy movies, satire, adventure games, cyberpunk, copious amounts of alcohol, or simply want a fresh experience then JazzPunk is your most certainly for you.			"

												If you locked a handful of game developers in a room with a plethora of drugs, some William Gibson and Ian Fleming novels and a PC with a copy of Gone Home you would get something that resembles Jazzpunk.Lots of tasteful pop culture references, slatherings of satire and a handful of mini-games made this rather linear adventure very entertaining.My main criticism is that it's a little on the short side... but any longer and its charm and novelty may have grown thin.10/10 would Jazzpunk again.

												Jazzpunk isn’t for everyone, and players willing to invest in its sense of silliness and extraneous satire will undoubtedly find stretches they’ll need to endure while searching out the next slice of brilliance. Whether or not it’s worth it is going to wildly differ from person to person.  So I’ll end with a vague recommendation; give Jazzpunk a go if you’re in the mood to nerd it up for an evening, but don’t blame me if you expect a game that asks you to photocopy your♥♥♥♥♥♥to act as an I.D. picture to be high humour.

												A charming and hilariously funny heavily stylised first-person point-and-click adventure. Sadly, much shorter than it deserves to be. If you play though only the story content it will likely last less than an hour. If you spend time thoroughly exploring the world - a task which will richly reward you for the experience due to innumerable hidden jokes and sidequests - you may get 3-4 hours of gameplay from it. Still an absolute must-play. Game of the Year candidate, for me.Check out my first impressions:

												this is pretty much Naked Gun: the game. It was really fun and a really nice game to explore every nook and cranny. The game is only about 2-3 hours long though but I was never bored or upset with it the whole time. It's just a simple little point and click with really dumb jokes but if you like stupid jokes and exploring this game is perfect.			"

												A while back, when I saw the trailer for ""Thirty Flights of Loving"", I was excited by the abstract, highly stylish visuals.  It looked like a seriously unique, undeniably ""indie"" experience, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Players heaped praise on the game, finding deep meaning inside the painfully short experience.  I was not one of those people, unfortunately.  I found ""Thirty Flights..."" to be a shallow proof of concept, at best -- something the developer himself seemed to admit from the commentary track.  I walked away from the game bitter, having felt duped by popular opinion.That said, I very much liked the IDEA of ""Thirty Flights"": an interactive book.  A way of telling a unique, linear story, letting the player guide the narrative along at their own pace.  (Adding VR into the mix will take this immersive idea even further, but I'm getting ahead of myself.)  As it turns out, the game I was hoping ""Thirty Flights"" would be, is what ""Jazzpunk"" actually *IS*.  Both games are very strange, unique, linear short stories, but ""Jazzpunk"" gives you a bit more freedom to explore, with side-quests and mini-games here and there along the way.  What separates the two further, is that ""Jazzpunk"" is straight up hilarious and wonderfully strange.  More times than I can count, I found myself wide-eyed, staring at the monitor and going ""whaaat!"" with a huge smile.Additionally, there are numerous references, both popular and obscure, to old technology (Captain Crunch's famous 2600 whistle, for example), and the culture around them.  Raymond Scott's unmistakable trademark musical style heavily influences the proceedings (not to mention directly referenced here and there).While I damned ""Thirty Flights"" for being criminally short for the price, I found ""Jazzpunk""'s short length to be JUST long enough without overstaying it's welcome.  A $10 pricetag would probably be more comfortable than $15, but the effort and love that was clearly put into this...well, I wouldn't at all feel ripped off if I'd paid full price.I'd absolutely love to see this expanded into an ongoing series, with each installment being just as short but sweet.4/5			"

A Paladin's Steam Review: Jazzpunk. Is This Memes? Or Just Complete Nonsense?Genre: 1st Person Surreal I-Haven't-Done-Enough-Drugs-For-This Adventure.Developed & Published by: Necrophone Games & Adult Swim Games. Platform: Windows, Mac, LinuxBusiness Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself PreambleI can’t help but feel that the title of this game is more than a bit apt to describe the experience I had with this game. This game makes no sense from a story perspective. If this is what tripping on drugs is even remotely like, I don’t think I want to ever experience the real thing. I’m not even going to try and describe the story or the purpose you play in this game because even I’m not certain what the purpose of this game is supposed to serve. Oh right, a comedy adventure. Overall Gameplay ThoughtsReviewing a game's comedy is a very dangerous road to walk on. What I find funny isn't what you'll find funny and vice versa. I stay away from talking about a game's humor and generalize what it's like. You may find this incredibly hilarious while it's all completely lost on me. So, I’ll just break it down to its parts. What you’re essentially getting is a collection of unremarkable (or boring) mini-games with walking sequences between them. During the entire time you will be subjected to a multitude of references and jokes from various forms of media that you may or may not get. (Prepare to not get a lot of them). This style of game has been rising in popularity of late and frankly, it hasn't been my favorite to play. Which this entry has only further cemented my dislike of it. PC Settings & OptionsJazzpunk comes with resolution options, control bindings and more. However, it should be noted that the game will override your mouse + keyboard for the controller every time you start up the game. Field of View slider is missing (from a First Person game no less). What you’re left with is a quality slider, v-sync & mouse options. Optimization seemed fine (its not terribly demanding) and it never crashed on me. That said, I noticed that my camera was really jerky/jittery when you moved it around. Never figured out why. Final ThoughtsIt’s hard to find these games enjoyable when the interactive parts are meager and the jokes are lost on me. Obviously I got a few of them but when a world refuses to take itself seriously, you have to wonder if everything is trying to be a reference. Is the walkway a reference or did what that character said behind me supposed to be a reference? Or is it actually relevant to the plot?! I can't tell! The references are extremely broad too so it's hard to place where they're coming from half the time. Is it supposed to be an homage to some other TV series and what is that or why am I flying upside to, idk, something and augh and gah this game is….…..ultimately frustrating.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												I hope the developers manage to make enough money on this title to recoup at least a portion of the cost of the truly massive amount of drugs they must have been taking while they made it.I feel like I just dropped acid and carried a bunch of LEGO figures through an N64 game before crawling out of an alligator's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.And yes, that's all relevant.

												Surreal and hilarious.  This game is all over the place, and while in most cases that would be seen as poor structure, here it keeps things fresh and in the bizzare theme.It never, ever takes itself seriously, and neither should you while you play it.  Jazzpunk is a short but very enjoyable, very strange adventure game.  Definitely worth picking up for something different and plenty of laughs.If you'd like to watch a blind playthrough of it, feel free to check out the video below:

												Jazzpunk is quite unique.  It's really fun to look at, it's odd and absurd, which is great, but for me it goes nowhere with it. I am going to give it a thumbs down because: 1) It takes no effort or thought to play.  I have clicked everything, played all the mini games, searched every corner, gotten all the achievements and feel like I didn't do anything worthwhile when all is said and done.  2) The humor was not my kind of humor and it's unrelenting.  That's a problem since humor seems to be half the game content (the other half are the visuals).  For the most part, it is a continuous stream of computer-geek puns. IE: You go into a restaurant and the waitress says ""I will be your dedicated server.""  Lots and LOTS of that. There is almost no dialogue per se, just a lot of word play.  3) The game made me feel ill which really surprised me.  If you play for more than 30 minutes in a go, especially after the first chapter, most likely you will end up with a degree of motion sickness no matter how rarely you get it in real life.  This game could probably be weaponized for that ability.  4) The game is very very short, though given everything else, that is sort of a plus.  I kept expecting something in the game to wow me, to grab me mentally at least once, but nothing ever did.  It's colorful fluff.  If you like computer puns and pure silliness -- you'll probably have a great time.  If you want more from a game than just being taken on a ride, or if puns make you roll your eyes and sigh in annoyance -- then you probably want to give the game a miss.			"

												This game was ok.  I had a decent fun time playing this thinking, ""oh boy this might be a good story line"".  MEH.  The environment is cartoony which I like.  The humor is good too.  It's just TOO DAMN SHORT!  That's my only complaint in this game really.  I got it for I think 4.99 when it was on sale, it's worth that much in my opinion.  Unless the creator adds onto it, I don't see how it should cost $15.			"

												Yes the 'game"" itself it short. There is very little to the story and you can feasibly complete it in a 30-40 minute sitting. That being said, the amount of humor, subversive side quips, and side content that the developers managed to pack into this gameis truly amazing. From a H.S.T. doppleganger spouting William Gibson quotes to a marriage inspired Doom-replica, this game is well crafted and bursting with character. I really havent enjoyed a game as much as this one in quite a while.			"

												More information here: http://www.brokencartridge.net/games/review-jazzpunk/ (features a video review!)You will laugh, you will cry, but mostly you will be confused. Jazzpunk is an avant-garde comedy adventure inspired by spoof films and old slapstick cartoons. In this cyberpunk style world with an alternate reality Cold War theme, you are some type of spy or investigative agent. You are sent on missions finding cases of corporate espionage and “CyberCrime” in an open world.Jazzpunk will leave you scratching your head as much as it will be making you laugh. Each level has a main mission you must accomplish, but that is just the surface of what the game is all about. Expecting the unexpected will do you no good as you will still be absolutely bewildered at what lies behind every corner. Find a pizza box next to an old bum in the street corner? Open it and find that it brings you to another pizza world where you must kill pizza zombies with your oversized pizza pan and cutter. Surprises like that are waiting for you behind nearly every intractable object.A large amount of content in the game is not mandatory for completion, but that is what makes it so great.  You feel the impulse to cover every inch of each area to ensure that everything is experienced, because it is definitely worth exploring. Maybe you will steal the entry ticket to the hotel rooms, and in one you will find a bride and groom with their wedding cake that transports you into a wedding edition of Quake, or possibly have sex with a robot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The possibilities and expectations are endless and worth every moment.One thing I quickly realized is that there is no sense of challenge throughout the entire game. Essentially there is no way to fail or do something wrong. While this insures that you will never have to do the same thing twice or the hear same joke multiple times, it also removed some depth to certain scenes. Comedy is the game’s forte, which is great in its own sense but ends up revoking any type of challenge the game could possibly offer. If that is good or bad depends on the player, but it is definitely something worth noting.Even though I took my time trying to explore as much as possible, I still beat the game within 3 hours. That was slightly disappointing seeing how it is a 15 dollar title. Playing the game through multiple times is advised, because there will definitely be things that you missed. I would have liked to see a few more levels packed in there, though. I actually had an interest in the story and where it was going, but in retrospect is was a very short one. The game had some minor technical issues as well, such as crashing when trying to mess with the video settings in game. It wasn’t dual monitor friendly, either. I ended up having to use a control to properly play the game, which is still fine because it is perfectly playable with the standard Xbox controller, but let that be a warning to dual monitor users out there that you may have a few issues.Jazzpunk is an excellent game with a grand sense of humor and a unique style of play. We’ve never seen anything like it, and I doubt we ever will again. It shows that sometimes all we need is something different slapped onto our face. Adult Swim’s streak of publishing interesting games continues.			"

Full review at: http://www.mode486.com/jazzpunk-review/Jazzpunk is an amazing comedic adventure. It’s funny, fun, entertaining and just a fantastic overall game. It has almost no flaws aside from being a three-hour experience, but that’s okay since the game only costs $15. I love everything about Jazzpunk and I feel that it’s probably one of the contenders for game of the year or at least indie game of the year. There’s simply nothing like it currently, and I’m glad. It’s a very unique experience that you truly will not find anywhere else.			"

												My first review.The trailer is midleading. Check out actual gameplay videos. You won't laugh. You'll smirk. A couple of times. Probably more a 99 cent title. Honestly. Bought it on sale and still paid too much. A couple of cute nostalgic nods is really the only up-side to this title. Also, on OSX, I couldn't load my saved games. I could load chapters though and the game is so short, it hardly mattered but still a little annoying.			"

												This game was decently amusing, and certainly unique, but I can't recommend it at the price. The game was over in less than 3 hours, and that's with exploring every area as much as possible, talking to all npc's, doing side missions, getting lost a few times, etc. It doesn't seem like this game would have much if any replayability. I was actually convinced the ending credits were another joke when they popped up so quickly.			"

												I absolutely love this game in a way I wasn't expecting.It has the right amount of humour and always in places you never expect to find it. You never know what you're going to come up against next, but you're guaranteed to laugh. Of course you could probably run straight through the game, do the tasks and finish it, but then you'd miss everything else going on. It's a game where you feel rewarded by looking at every little detail because so much of it has extra things to offer. It's not all in your face either, constantly forcing you to be in a typical funny situation. In fact a lot of the comedy in the game is quite subtle and you have to steer from the path in order to find it, but it makes you appreciate it as you play through. The attention to comedic detail is quite marvelous.The gameplay is nice and simple. You walk around, interact with objects in often fun and ingenious ways to complete puzzles and make your way through the story. The graphics are very cartoony but still maintains a great atmosphere with all the music and extra sounds going on. It suits the tone of the game perfectly.It's something nice, different and random. Nothing like I have played before and definitely a great experience. Would recommend.			"

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/jazzpunk-game-review/Well, this was one of the more interesting titles I’ve played of late. Certainly one of the most humorous games I’ve played in my life, that’s for sure. There’s just so many things right about Jazzpunk.Jazzpunk is a first-person comedy-adventure game set during the cold war, in an alternate reality. The game places large emphasis on open-world exploration, which can be seen immediately in the first level. I spent the majority of my time in the game exploring, rather than actually playing through the main story, although I did manage to beat the entire game in about two hours. The game’s length being my major complaint. For such a great game, I’d like more than just two hours.Unique. If I had to use one word to describe Jazzpunk, that’d be it. The game is full of references, side quests, and plenty of areas to explore in the various chapters. I even helped clean a guy’s massive ear out when he was unable to hear. Just one of the silly things that can be accomplished within the several chapters. Oh, and the dialogue. Fantastic. Simply fantastic. A lot of the characters in-game spoke like robots and it seemed like there were new accents everywhere I went.Jazzpunk is heavy on its comedic appeal. There are several instances in the game that serve no purpose other than to make you laugh. I ran into a shop at one point whose door simply said “closed for no reason”. There’s plenty of new things to find when exploring the worlds of each chapter, and, like I said, that’s where I had spent most of my playtime, looking around. It’s overwhelming at times, the amount of stuff that you can find whilst exploring.The game uses an interesting art style. I want to say its cel-shaded, but I don’t know if that’d be correct. For the most part, it does look like its cel-shaded, which is always a art style. Nothing to complain about in terms of the game’s graphics.If you’re going to pick up Jazzpunk, don’t expect much in terms of length if you just play through the game’s story. Instead, spend some time exploring about. You’ll find yourself laughing at the numerous scenes scattered throughout the game.			"

												This takes me back to my childhood, playing adventure games, Point and clicks, Grim Fandango, Indiana Jones, Lucas Arts. I loved it from start to finish, I`ve just played through it and I`m considering playing it again just to get all the achievments. I can`t remember the last time I felt that way after playing a game, but its been a while.The characters and the universe is charming, the controls are easy and the story is fun. The whole cold war spy thing was a great setting and the music suits that theme brilliantly. Wacky, intelligent, and entertaining. I think I recognised one of the bar patrons ;) kudos Necrophone. Only minus I can seem to find is that the game was a bit short, but I do prefer a short quality game over a long game where you can see the story dabbing off and becoming dull.			"

												Hilarious! Art! These two words are ones almost never in the same sentence together, which is why I separated them with exclamation points. Separated or not though, Jazzpunk is both of these things.But to get to the point, (before I start talking about the weather or something, which i'm sure is nice where you live (if not, then I'm sure it's not nice (that is to say, I'm sure the weather is well weathered where you live (that really isn't what I was trying to say, but the 'weather is well weathered' pun is demonstrating the type of joke that can be found within Jazzpunk (You're welcome!))))) the real brilliance of Jazzpunk is how it frequently allows the player to transcend the main narrative in favour of allowing pointless exploration. The game itself is really more about the funny* hidden jokes than the silly storyline. So I only recommend this game if you have the patience to examine every little thing you come across. Or if you are an achievement hound. Because the achievements in this game are both numerous and drop-dead easy.All in all, I had a great time with this title! 9/10!*I take no responsibility for any un-funny jokes you come across.

												I love this game. However I couldn't recommend it to a friend. I got about 1-2 hours of gameplay. (I've played the story multiple times) And that would be perfectly fine for an eight dollar game, but the $15 dollar price tag on this one makes me regret spending that kind of money.PRICE TAG ASIDE-------------------It's a wonderful game full of jokes that will make you laugh out loud.8/10			"

												When I was told to buy Jazzpunk my first thoughts where “Is this some sort of new music trend” but after seeing the games outlandish landscapes and randomized chaos, I fell in love instantly. The intro itself is a masterpiece and the game mechanics will cause your mind to implode. The game gave me the most amazing curiosity of insanity that I could ever ask for. If you want a game to question your own mind wellbeing, Jazzpunk is the game for you!			"

												Hilarious! Art! These two words are ones almost never in the same sentence together, which is why I separated them with exclamation points. Separated or not though, Jazzpunk is both of these things.But to get to the point, (before I start talking about the weather or something, which i'm sure is nice where you live (if not, then I'm sure it's not nice (that is to say, I'm sure the weather is well weathered where you live (that really isn't what I was trying to say, but the 'weather is well weathered' pun is demonstrating the type of joke that can be found within Jazzpunk (You're welcome!))))) the real brilliance of Jazzpunk is how it frequently allows the player to transcend the main narrative in favour of allowing pointless exploration. The game itself is really more about the funny* hidden jokes than the silly storyline. So I only recommend this game if you have the patience to examine every little thing you come across. Or if you are an achievement hound. Because the achievements in this game are both numerous and drop-dead easy.All in all, I had a great time with this title! 9/10!*I take no responsibility for any un-funny jokes you come across.

												A few things you should know before buying this: It's EXTREMELY short (2-3 hours) and there is no real ""challenge"". It's more of an interactive story with some point and click adventure type gameplay and there is no way for you to lose. That being said, I still found it pretty enjoyable due to the general strangeness of the story. If you're interested in trying this out, you should wait until it's on a big sale or something and remember to explore each level thoroughly. There is a lot of side stuff. ;)			"

												Watching 10 minutes of Jazzpunk will let you know whether it's for you or not. Its brand of humour is hyper-specific, trading on James Bond, conspiracy theories, William Gibson and a dash of Blendo Games' work. If that type of humour appeals to you then stop reading, buy Jazzpunk, play Jazzpunk.Jazzpunk may be the funniest game I've ever played. Humour is brutally difficult in games because the player is in control of the timing. Jazzpunk nails it, almost effortlessly. It's a game that rewards you poking at everything, and everything you poke is guaranteed to have a joke attached. The concentration of lunacy is consistently dense. The number of jokes per square metre in this game is ridiculous. There's so much to find and so much to discover. A few jokes fall flat but the majority of them work and work well.Jazzpunk is essentially an adventure game. Often you'll be asked to collect certain items to combine with other items to progress. It sounds dull but virtually every puzzle is a clever joke or a stupid premise. Jazzpunk's objectives embrace the non-sequiter and the punchline and weave them into everything you do.Remember bubsy3d.com? Recall the end scene? Remember the Applebees? Jazzpunk's puzzles and easter eggs rival that moment in their sheer audacity every two minutes.It took some incredibly intelligent people to make a game that's so smart about being dumb. Even if it seems like it's not for you, you should play this game. It's a delight.			"

												Ok, i have had polarizing opinions on this game, but here goes.When you first start the game, you're greeted by attempting to infiltrate the Soviet Consulate. And then, as you're about to go up, you're greeted by a guy who tells you to go find a mailbox with chalk on the side, which you can ignore or follow. (There's no prompt to do so.) On my first playthrough i ignored, and i was greeted by a boring fetch mission with a glitchy dial phone, which then lead to a pretty boring game, purely because i put no time into it. It was short and un-appetizing, and the humor almost felt juvenile. But, on the second playthrough, i decided to follow the things the NPCs told me and i had a ♥♥♥♥ing blast. The side missions easily added 3 times the game's face value, and all the side missions and easter eggs felt actually funny. So, that's it.8/10, please follow the side missions for a much superior experience.Also, there is a parody of Quake called Wedding Qake built in, it's fantastic and addicting. Wedding Qake: 8/10, lack of options.			"

												A sturdy 10/10Although it may not be your typical game, this is precisely why Jazzpunk is so great. It's only downside is the fact that it is such a short game. Whacky humor and a lot of wtf moments is what sums this game up. Plenty of sidequests and achievements to get are unfortunately not enough to grant this game significant replay value. However, it is still definitely worth getting so you can make your friends come round to play and watch them as they sit in front of the screen baffled and bemused.A worthy buy.			"

												Jazzpunk is another game that, like Zeno Clash, tries to be held up entirely by weirdness.  It fails just as spectacularly.  Behind the extreme weirdness, there is nothing interesting nor compelling just a bland game full of random occurences and random references.  I would liken it to the recent teenage buzzword ""random"":  It feels like a desperate cry for attention by being different when in reality it's rather predictable and not the least bit interesting.Gameplay consists of walking around and interacting with various objects and completing very short side missions while you accomplish your main objective for each level.  There are only a couple missions and they go by quickly.  The game tries really hard to be funny but there's not much humor to be found when nothing makes any sense, barring a couple lines from side characters.From a technical standpoint, the game is a bit odd.  It has very simple graphics and should run on a toaster due to that but for some reason is limited to 60 fps.  Keyboard movement keys are not set by default so you have to do it yourself and the mouse control is very sluggish and stuttery.  The game also stutters occasionally.  All of these things are extremely strange for a game running on the Unity engine but it doesn't get in the way too much.So to summarize Jazzpunk is a very weird game held up entirely by weird random references and humor, neither of which work.  How this game has gotten over 90% positive reviews completely baffles me.			"

												Jazzpunk is super fun. It's a really random game that has side missions, supprises, and the main missions are really fun too! The only problem is that it would be a short game if you dont do the side missions. over all its a great game!I recomend this game if you have a little extra cash in your account/pocket.			"

												Easter Egg Hunting: The GameIf you like running around looking at every single nook and cranny in a vibrant 1960's spy movie, here's your game. -The humor is okay, not worth 15 bucks-A lot of people comment on how short it is and I wish I could verify but after 15mins into the game I get physically nauseous. Sooo yeah... Googled the nausea problem and I'm not the only person with this issue. Something about input lag and mouse filtering? Tried some of the 'solutions' but none worked for me.

												A sturdy 10/10Although it may not be your typical game, this is precisely why Jazzpunk is so great. It's only downside is the fact that it is such a short game. Whacky humor and a lot of wtf moments is what sums this game up. Plenty of sidequests and achievements to get are unfortunately not enough to grant this game significant replay value. However, it is still definitely worth getting so you can make your friends come round to play and watch them as they sit in front of the screen baffled and bemused.A worthy buy.			"

												You know looking back on it, this is one of the worst games I've ever played. When I first went through it, I was excited. It was weird and fairly stylish. Then I realized there was absolutely no writing talent behind it, and it was just a bunch of tired video game and movie references crudely sewn together. Remember Warcraft? What? Why is that in this game, it's not Warcraft! Hahahaha! What a great joke. It was also incredibly short, and had practically no real story. Utterly pretentious in every way imaginable.			"

												It was a fun little experience, but my god was it short. it was funny-ish, more in a quirky, ""lol random"" way then in a really haha funny way. In general, my main issue is the length of the game and the lack of things to do. For a game thats really just a point and click adventure in 3d, it really lacks the adventure. Heck at one point you're told to ""improvise"" but in the end, theres only one way to actually complete the objective.overall, it had potential and it ended up being half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 6/10, not worth a lot but i guess you might get it if its on sale. (although it'll likely be one of those games that you buy and then ends up just sitting in your library, never played. you know the ones i'm talking about)			"

												Jazzpunk is a difficult game to review, but I'll give it my best shot.Wow would be a simple word to describe this game. If there is such a thing as a God, it is Jazzpunk. Jazzpunk is a very much experimental game, infusing just about everything under the sun with puns. Alot of puns. Jazzpunk also incorporates just about any game you can think of into one neat little package. Pizza version of Nazi Zombies. Here. Quake game based around weddings. Here.The story line, while short, is funny and compelling at the same time. The story focuses on espionage, set in a bright world that enfuses new technology with a background of bright, and colourful Art Deco motifs. There is a ton of exploring to do, easter eggs to find, and whole new games to play! If you follow the main story path, you're looking at 2, maybe 3 hours of gameplay. But combined with all the secrets, achivements and down right silly side-quests, you could easily extend your playtime to 4-5 hours or even more!I expected a more Thirty Flights of Loving feel to Jazzpunk, but I was mistaken. Jazzpunk (it's just such a fun word to say) is it's own game, heck, it's own genre. It's much more ""in your face"" than Thirty Flights of Loving, but that isn't always a bad thing. Jazzpunk is just a silly, good time, but doesn't take it too far but actually making all these silly things funny. Granted, you'll need an acute sense of humor to enjoy this game. But I sure enjoyed the hell out of it, and I hope too again soon.+ The jokes are actually funny. No Duke Nukem Forver nonsense.+ The music, art, character and charm of the game are all fantastic.+ Incorporates lots of secrets, mini-games, this game has it all. Seriously.- Story is short- The ending is a bit abrupt/cheap- The very fact that it does end.9.5/10.			"

												What a game this was.First let me say that I have been playing a few comedy games as of late, so I potentially could be burned out on them as a genre.I hate this game, this game from start to finish was in a word horrible. In a few words a horribly optimized, exceedingly gimmicky, and just plain boring game. I'm not going to concern you with the plot. If you're interested in this game you know enough about the plot to get you started.  It uses the LOL so random ROFL gimmick to get a rise out of you, and then just stares at you when you don't laugh. Seeming to ask you ""What about the gun that turns pedestrians into pigeons don't you find funny?"" And that's the thing, at first it sounds very funny, but after the tenth similar joke it gets to be really old and very grating. And then it drags it out for four more levels, begging you to laugh while you just sit silently staring at your screen.Honestly if you really need to play a comedy game, I would recommend the Stanley Parable, or pretty much anything else. The only way that I would pick this game up was if it was free and had played everything in my backlog five times, and even then I would still hesitate.tl;dr Don't get this game			"

Would not recommend unless on a severe sale, or if you think that a magnetized pigeon and Wilhelm screams are hysterical.6.75/10Entirely subjective experience determined by your sense of humor for $15.

												Jazzpunk is one of the many ridiculous titles published by Adult Swim in the last couple years, thankfully it is the good kind of ridiculous. It is just silly and smart enough to make it worth recommending. On the surface the plot of Jazzpunk seems insignificant but there is quite a bit that is left implied that encourages thought. I finished the game in about two hours, however that isn't exactly a problem: the game relies on its humor and I could see it getting stale if the game were a few more hours long. If I had trouble with anything during my time with Jazzpunk, it was the soundtrack. It is a fantastic soundtrack and works excellently with the game, however when exploring the levels sometimes the looped music would become grating. It doesn't offer much in replayability either but there is a lot of variety to the game, offering some neat minigames and secrets. If you are interested in some memorable comedy, Jazzpunk has you covered.I paid ~$0.33 for Jazzpunk as part of the Humble Weekly Bundle: Extra Life 2015 bundle.			"

I took my time exploring as suggested and have have not finished yet still it's just ok. I found this the least intriguing game I have ever come across. If I were much younger then yeah maybe I'd liek it more.			"

YouTube™ Video: Jazzpunk ✭ 1 - Jazzy Funk 

			Views: 21		

			I don't want games that look ultra realistic, I want the drugs that make reality look like this. My playthrough of the adventure (/action?) game Jazzpunk on PC with live commentary		

Jazzpunk presents itself as a parody of spy movies, but quickly wears out its welcome with never ending references and sight gags, most completely unrelated to the task at hand, leaving you with a thin vein of a plot to serve as a vehicle from one joke to the next.That’s not to say all the humour is bad, but a lot is random for the sake of being random. There's no narrative hooks for many of the jokes, they just exist for the sole purpose of delivering a punchline; experience it and move on. Funnily enough, the better jokes are ones that are actually tied into the game plot, making the others feel tacked on and unnecessary filler.There reigns the problem with the game; if you don't make an active effort to seek these jokes out, you'll miss most the content of the game (possibly without even meaning to) and probably finish the game within an hour. Even looking for them I finished at just shy of three hours, with the ending just kind of happening rather than being built up to. £9.99 for a game that feels like it was a student's spare time project seems rather hefty to me. At that price point, I'd rather just go watch a terrible blockbuster comedy, I'd probably enjoy it just as much.The game gets split up into levels, which are small but distinct zones. Actually, scrap small, most are tiny. They look nice enough, but they're mainly just straight lines with a few offshoots if you want to go indulge in the humour, and there is no other reason to go explore. There's not much else to say about the game because, well, there's not much else to the game. There's a bunch of mini-games, though Wedding Qake repeats, which was a ""ha ha, okay"" the first time, a revisit of the joke was needless. You can swat flies in a vase shop, I avoided smashing the vases and killed the flies, the only effect was I now had a fly swatter, that had no influence outside that game room. I went back and smashed the vases, no effect. Sadly the gameplay part of the game seems like an inconvenience just getting in the way of the game telling its next joke.Also, there's a Rita Repulsa gag (see power rangers circa 20 years ago). In a game released in 2014... Who's this aimed at again?True, games like Wario Ware get by without much of a narrative, but it also just takes you immediately from one gag to the next, not leaving you to seek it out.I do really like the aesthetics, the graphics, character design, the audio; it is actually a pleasant game to play from that point of view. It’s a shame it gets bogged down with trying to cram in as much 'humour' as possible at the expense of a more fleshed out main story arc.This is the game equivalent of going to a forum for the sole purpose of looking at a random assortment of animated gifs; just a series of out-of-context punchlines.I guess you might counter all this by saying it sounds like I bought a joke book and expected a novel, I guess that may be true to a certain extent. But I feel a more apt comparison is meeting a new group of people and having them telling all their in jokes and expecting you to laugh along with them without engaging in any actual conversation.If you're just looking for humour, then honestly, Jazzpunk will deliver that, you may not like everything (I'll put myself in that camp), but the chances are you'll find something to laugh at. Just beware that most the gameplay is in service of jokes... and going and looking for more jokes... oh and there's a frogger inspired mini game.			"

												I'm a fan of comedy: on a stage, in film, on TV, in games, etc.  I also like many kinds of humor, but the jokes in this game could have only been of interest to a 10 year old version of myself.  Luckily I got this on sale, but even then, 2 hours of cringe-inducing attempts at humor really make this a ""poopy-at-best"" experience.  It's enough there is practically no content.  Or that the sounds and voice acting are terrible (made worse if you play with headphones).  Or that the only high points are the swing wing and the mini games.If you want a few chuckles but mostly want to groan, get this game.If you want an actual game with actual funny moments: wait for if No One Lives Forever comes to Steam/GOG.

												Quirky and fun, albeit short, game that's good if your looking for an hour or two to kill with some laughs. There's tons of little side things to explore and the art is unique and interesting, and most of the time your exploration is rewarded by the well-written comedy strewn about the game. Not a lot of games entice me to poke around every corner and click on everything like this one did. If this is your kind of humor, you'll probably love it. If not, well then you'll probably hate it.Dunno if it's worth 15 dollars (the only reason I can think of why the price is so high is because the developers had to pay for A) Drugs that assisted with the creation of this game, or B) the Adult Swim logo.) but if you've got the extra cash and are prepared to throw it at your screen for a brief hour or two of complete and total confusion, then by all means try it out!tl;dr This game broke my brain, rawr stars out of blarg.

												Jazzpunk's sense of humor will make or break your experience since the gameplay itself isn't fun. Most of the jokes are reliant on you laughing at something just because it's weird or unexpected. Another reviewer described it as going for ""OMGSORANDOMLOL"" with every joke and interaction. I couldn't agree more. If this is your deal, you'll enjoy it much more than I did. I still appreciated the game's art style, general focus on silliness, and creativity but it quickly felt like I was being told the same joke for the 1 hour it took to finish this $15 game. Only buy it on sale if you really like this kind of humor. Steam needs a ""maybe"" recommend option.			"

Jazzpunk is definately crazy plus a whole lot of random funny and surrealistic moments but then I finished it in exactly 103 minutes and thought...wait thats it? IM an explorer and I would say that out of those 103 minutes I was messing around and looking at everything. I thought that I would actually be busy playing this...but the puzzles are way to easy to figure out, there are no rewards and u cannot fail. I would not recommend buying it for the current price, buy it when it is on sale and have an hour of fun. OK Game...too short.			"

												Weird, wacky and wonderful. I can't think of a better way to waste my afternoon with my pants on.This is a fine addition to Adult Swim's stable of games. The opening sequence is inspired and is a demonstration of what can be done with minimalist graphics. The game play is straight foward and somewhat linear. I will play through again to pick up those little bits here and there I missed the first time. The humour is spot on and you'll probably find yourself laughing out loud at some of the silliness. My only complaint is the abruptness with which the game ends. Hopefully there will be DLC to expand the missions and fun.			"

												Jazzpunk is a rather short, but hilarous game with many puns, jokes, and parodys from other games/pop-culture. It should take an average gamer about 6-9 hours to explore and complete the game. Most achievements are quick and easy (if I recall, only one took any sort of effort). The only downside to this game for me was the lack of replayability. This is a solid purchase, I'd rate 8/8.			"

The missions are interesting, the characters and dialogue are hilarious, the gameplay is absurd, but at least doesn't take itself too seriously.

												I will be honest, I haven't even finished this game yet and I feel that I have already got my money's worth from this. It's an extremely unique comedy experience that delivers on its promise of fun. Interact with as many things as you can and you will be rewarded in spades with smiles on your face.Let me put it this way: there is an entity you may encounter who is a direct parody of Rita from Power Rangers, Chikita Banana, and Fruit Ninja. You also get to degauss pigeons in a level. There are even items that take you into mini games when you interact with them.The comedy is fast-paced and doesn't wave itself in your face in an annoying ""DO YOU GET IT?"" way. The joke comes and goes fast enough for if you actually don't get it you'll get to see something else and laugh at that instead. It's also worth reading signs too, even small ones and labels. Quite frankly, a game that includes ""Deep Fried Katamari"" as a menu item in a place and will allow you to miss it really ""gets"" this brand of comedy and won't drag you down.Also, there's no pressure to do anything in a timely manner. I like that in this type of game.I highly recommend it, particularyly to anyone who knows quite a bit about technology, are at least slightly familiar with the aesthetic of 1956-1960, and/or are a bit aware of Japanese culture. If you're not familiar with any of that, I'm sure you'll find the visual humor entertaining still.The only criticism I have is that occasionally you run into a thing or two that lacks polish, such as the odd audio file that cuts out prematurely, but with the large amount of voice acting it's really not a big deal and it's only been the tail end. It's certainly not brought me out of the fun I've been having!Bottom Line: if you love a bit of smart absurdity, this is definitely a game worth looking into. If you're worried about short gameplay, think about how much it costs to go to the movie theater for a couple hours (at the most) and how this game will provide much more.			"

												When I bought Jazzpunk I did not know what this game was about. After playing the game to completion I still don't. This is a game that even once it hints things are going to start to make sense, throws a curve ball of absurdity right at your face. The best way to describe this would be taking Bubsy 3D or Frog Fractions and mixing it with Thirty Flights of Loving or Gravity Bone. I enjoyed every minute of it, and I desperately want to jump back in and try to find the things I missed. Highly recommended if you are a fan of absurdist comedy and referencial humor.			"

												A simple and funny adventure game. Even though you'll get like maximum 3h of story playthrough you can still do side-quests and explore to gain achievements that are not hard to get. This game i can say that is unique in it's way and you should check it out. I give it 8.5/10.			"

												Amazingly fun game. Very bizarre but hilarious, loads of pop culture refererences and clever or just silly humour. If you're a fan of The Stanley Parable and the like I'd give it a go. Only about 3 - 4 hours of gameplay but still worth the buy.			"

												It's awesome. If you are the kind of person that whined about Gone Home being too expensive, you will probably feel the same way about this, but if you want a stupid adventure type game with a surreal and absurdist sense of humour (sort of Monty Python/Airlane!/cartoon) you will love it.

												this is just one of those unique games you don't see often anymore. In this case, taht's a good thing. This is an amazing indie game, often it's funny and random, basically everything i need for an indie game to be great. It has a wonderful art style  and the graphics are mediocre but in this game, graphics is nothing to worry about. This game is definitely worth it for those who love a unique, just completely random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t indie game 8/10			"

												Ok so I watched some videos, and thought yeah Jazzpunk looks crazy...so I bought it. Jazzpunk is definately crazy plus a whole lot of random funny and surrealistic moments but then I finished it in exactly 103 minutes and thought...wait thats it? IM an explorer and I would say that out of those 103 minutes I was messing around and looking at everything. I thought that I would actually be busy playing this...but the puzzles are way to easy to figure out, there are no rewards and u cannot fail. I would not recommend buying it for the current price, buy it when it is on sale and have an hour of fun. OK Game...too short.			"

												Input settings are easy to break (assign mouse0 to anything and you won't be able to navigate the menu anymore!); when the game tells you to press A to sit down nothing happens, I had to go back to the settings to assign A to some action (that was NOT assigned with the default settings); and then during the game when you move the mouse very often the camera will rotate a lot in one frame which makes the game annoying to play.Another nuisance, the voices are very hard to understand and not subtitled.If there wasn't those problems the game might be fun, I don't know... It's unplayable in this state.Edit: 7 months and not a single update later, I tried again and played a bit even though the mouse controls are still terrible. The game has annoying music and not volume settings, most jokes aren’t funny at all, boring ""quests"", and on top of it I haven’t been able to progress on the first task that you’re given.			"

												I'll start off by saying that this is a really short game. You can beat this game most likely under an hour. But, the overall visuals makes up for it. The atmosphere presented in this game very enticing. It almost makes you want to explore the environment rather than continuing forward with the objective. The story is very humorous along with the silly voice acting. With all these elements combined, it makes a great game worth playing. My one and only complaint is the duration of the game. Being short. Despite that fact. If you're looking to get a good laugh, or a short game, this is the one for you. I recommend!			"

												Think of it as an HD remake of Spyfox, but without very many puzzles.  But because it's first person, the puns can be very cleverly hidden.  And the whole cyberpunk 60s thing is legitimately fascinating.			"

												Think of it as an HD remake of Spyfox, but without very many puzzles.  But because it's first person, the puns can be very cleverly hidden.  And the whole cyberpunk 60s thing is legitimately fascinating.			"

												Short, but hilariously absurd. It seems that a lot of content was cut from the game based on what the commercials set up, but at the same time it is good that this game does not drag-on unnecessarily. Gameplay is fresh for about 4 hours if you explore a lot and hunt achievements.  Slightly reminiscent of the obscure ""LSD Dream Emulator"" for the PS1.			"

												Oh man. This game. Jazzpunk is a clever game, and for $10 on the Summer Sale, it was worth every penny. Clever jokes and odd NPC interaction kept me smiling. It's fun, but short.			"

												It's not too long but it is packed with humour of all sorts. Worth the full price? Maybe not but easily worth the money when on sale. You'll have a great time hunting down all the gags.Just wacky zany fun.			"

												Its a strange game that feels like a cross between an acid trip and a james bond fan fiction. Its funny but sometimes I felt that it tries a little too hard to be funny. Its also kind of short and you can breeze through the game in one sitting. Get it on a steam sale, its not really worth it at full price but its a nice little distraction for a few hours.			"

												Its a strange game that feels like a cross between an acid trip and a james bond fan fiction. Its funny but sometimes I felt that it tries a little too hard to be funny. Its also kind of short and you can breeze through the game in one sitting. Get it on a steam sale, its not really worth it at full price but its a nice little distraction for a few hours.			"

												90’s cartoons + film noir + 90’s video game references.          So there I was browsing the steam store at the beginning of the summer sale, hundreds of games on sale, with crazy deals, like 60-80% off some great games, from great game makers. Plenty of tried and true games for me to buy, from franchises that probably wouldn’t disappoint, but I was looking for something new, something interesting, something I hadn’t played before, and by golley did I find it. So just what is jazzpunk, you say? Well the short answer would be that it’s a walking sim, but the long answer would be a trippy, windy road, full of some of the most distinct hummer I’ve ever seen in a game.           The game opens up by dumping you off of a luggage conveyer belt, into a sweeping montage of abstract imagery, full of Japanese symbols, air planes, and radio waves. It looks like something that could have been taken from the intro of an old western movie, if the motif were jazz, and not the Wild West. When it’s over, you get tossed in something that looks like a 50’ds-60’ds office space, crossed with a train station, and yes you can immediately start talking to boxes that are lying around.         A couple of minutes later and boom you’re in the full swing of the games plot, working as a secret agent  for the “Director”, and his “Secretary”. Right when you sit down on the whoopee cushion, to talk to your new boss, little white cartoonish lines come out of his eyes directing you towards you’re first mission objective, which is to raid some kind of Russian compound. Rite from the get go, you can get a good idea of what this games all about. Then you take you’re happy pills and go off into crazy land. This kind cartoonish hummer is bursting forth from almost every inch of the game. And that’s defiantly its strongest point, unlike most other walking sims this game won’t ever leave you board, whether you’re talking to insane hobos, hipster pies, that where sunglasses, and smok cigarettes, or talking to sexy female robots, there is always some business to poke your nose into. The game is also full of crazy side quests that you can get from talking to said persons such as; destroying clay pots in a fly shop, helping a frog cross the freeway to get his startreck data visor, catching huge spiders in a glass jar, in some Japanese themed restaurant, just to throw them on the cook’s face, who hates spiders.        This game is full of WTF moments that will have you smiling, and laughing out loud, as it pulls out gage after gage, most of which can be traced back to classic Ren and Stimpy cartoon's, and video game hummer. I even remember thinking halfway through the game “Ok, when are they going to start playing The Thieving Magpie theme?” and sure enough, there it was in the final level. But it’s really more than a one trick pony as far as the type of gages the game pulls off. Some of them are dialog based, some teleport you into areas where you are fighting cars, street fighter style in first person, and others are things like pulling an ice alarm, that’s located right next the proper fire alarm. Ice alarm, “for what reason”, one might ask one’s self? Why, for the same reason the hallway right next to it has a caution ""greased up floor"" sign on it. “Well that doesn’t make any sense.” you might say, however to that I would say, “Nothing in this game makes sense.”, but it's still a blast.       If you’re into shooting pigeon’s with crazy magnet guns taking their guts, and spraying ""essence of pigeon"" on other people, while other pigeons flock to them, to carry them off into the sky, then you will probably have fun with this game. Perhaps I write this review in vain, as it’s difficult to put into words what this game exactly is, but it’s defiantly worth playing. The only complaint I have is that it’s pretty short, if it had 2-3 more missions it would have been perfect. 9/10			"

												A game that resembles Thirty Flights of Loving in style, but adds lots of gameplay, story, sound effects, color, and all sorts of little easter eggs into the game.

												I had to think about what to rate this, since steam has no neutral or similar option... I will preface this negative review with a point. I loved this game. It has the corny nerdy humor which I absolutely love. I havent laughed this hard in a while. That said, the game is too short. I paid 15 dollars for a two hour (if you take your sweet time enjoying it, (I have so many hours on it since I have a habit of leaving the games on instead of saving, a relic from when saves either werent a thing or were so unreliable that you were better off leaving it on when you leave)) Dont get me wrong, paying 7.50 an hour for a worker seems just fine, but 7.50 an hour for a vidya game? Ill pass, or at least I would if I hadnt already paid for the game and believed that it deserved the money.			"

												When I got to the credits, I assumed it was a prank, and that the next level would start. Nope. You can play the entire $15 game in less than 1 hour. At first I was entertained, and would have given it a thumbs up, but it's way too short for $15 bucks. $5 bucks, maybe. Feel like I got ripped off.			"

YouTube™ Video: Let's Play JAZZPUNK - Part 1 - Downright Hilarious! 

			Views: 23,993		

			This is a jazz & punk part of my blind Jazzpunk let's play (not walkthrough). The game is available on the PC via Steam or the official Jazz Punk game website. A first person hilarious adventure.		

Jazzpunk for me is like the drug you're looking for after coming home from work. It relaxes you, makes your jaw hurt from so much laughing at hilarious, sometimes idiot moments.There's a lot of easter eggs, references to gaming, movies, politics, anything you can imagine. There should definitely be more seasons/episodes for Jazzpunk.Recommended if you don't mind being placed in awkward situations.			"

												I really want to like this game, I really do. But it is just a glorified walking sim with bad jokes. Seeing all that positive reviews I thought that it gets funnier later on bu it just kept the same pace throughout the entire game. It may be funny for someone who likes abstract comedy but it is not suitable for your average gamer.			"

												Please answer the following questions.1. Do you like games that overcharge you and have a lack of content?2. Do you like games that replace humor with ""SO WACKY""-ness and referential humor?3. Do you enjoy paying lots of money for 2 hours of content?4. Are you, or have you ever been, a freaking idiot?5. Did you see the words ""Jazzpunk"" and think, ""Hey, this might be interesting""?If you answered yes to any of the following questions, then Jazzpunk is for you. A boring, awful game that was a chore to go through, and where I suddenly realized ""That was it"" after 90 minutes of playing, with an additional 30 added because, hey, maybe some things do change if you play it different. Hint: It doesn't. It never does. It's the same boring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t all the way down. Luckily for me, I got it off the Humble Bundle along with games that were actually good. Yet despite paying far less than the normal asking price, I feel incredibly ripped off. I would ask for a refund, but I don't want to take money back from charity and I don't think Humble Bundle even does refunds.			"

												What a huge disappointment.  It gives off a presentation of being crazy and wacky, with old-school roots in its humor - poking fun with the 1960's version of sci-fi tech and trying to throw you off with wild scenarios and pop-art.  What it actually comes across as is nonsensical bull♥♥♥♥♥♥with boring pop culture references.Minor spoilers I guess.  I got to punch a car, and we both had yellow life bars, and when I destroyed it it said ""You Win!  Perfect!"".  I found a ""public domain man in carbonite"".  There was a James Bond intro sequence, what with him shooting the camera.  I clicked a thing and an orcish hand appeared, with a ""Something need doing?"" voice line being played among other things.  I had a resort receptionist recite the Konami code to me as something to try to fix my complaints.  I once played as a cat to tear around an apartment tearing things up because cats are evil xDDD.  There's more than one Wilhelm scream.  Leetspeak, conspiracy theorists, and a voice acted line saying something to the likes of ""this is just background noise, the player won't even notice"" all line up to pinpoint very naive humor with weak delivery.  It's not creatively introduced into the game, it just exists because pop culture.  Each new encounter with such things just made me sigh and consider stopping playing.In the first level, there's a ton of things to interact with, except you have to go out of your way to poke them, and the result is just garbage.  Sometimes literally.  Characters and objects spout unfunny gibberish in no relation to the universe or game.  After doing ""side quests"" and poking around the whole level, I was so bored I actively avoided almost everything extra in the rest of the game.  I could slam even more content, but instead I'll try not to drool all over myself.There's something promising underneath all of this, but I'm having a hard time figuring out what.  The few minutes in my under-two-hour completion time where I was doing actual ""60's spy things"" and not being bombarded by bird crap - again, sometimes literally - gave me a small hope it would expand into something more interesting.  Nope.  Just a series of art projects linked by 5 second music loops.Edit:  Wanted to add that the art and aesthetics in the game are unique and inviting in and of themselves, and I do appreciate a good chunk of them, as much of it is well-presented.  Heck, the intro sequence could be a standalone animation.  Unfortunately I don't find that enough to carry the rest of the game's weight.			"

YouTube™ Video: Jazzpunk Review 

			Views: 785		

			Let's take a look at the upcoming Steam game Jazzpunk in this first impressions review, with a little bit of an informal twist! Here's a gameplay video of the first 20 minutes!		

You've never really played a game like Jazzpunk before. It shares  things in common with recent ""walking simulators"" Gone Home & The Stanley Parable. In Jazzpunk the goal is to procrastinate, and do anything but the level's objective.  You want to explore every corner of every map, and the goal is to experience the hilarious jokes that this game has to offer. The jokes range from incredible video game references all the way to adult humour. Unfortunately, the game last about 3 hours, and thre's an abrupt ending. However, the game is beyond hilarious and probably worth your time.			"

												I bought this game hoping for some solid gameplay and funny commentary. I received the funny but i didnt get anything for solid gameplay. Even after looking for easter eggs and doing as much as i could i still got barely any gameplay. So thats why id reccomend not to get this game. And if you do id reccomend you torrent it its not worth buying at all			"

												It's a very nice game but my issues lie in the price. It costs about 15$ but there's very little actual content to the game, sure there are plenty of minigames and odds and ends but it ends very abruptly. It has a wonderful sense of humor and great graphics, but game breaking bugs and overall shortness make it not very worth it in my opinion, a game better watched then played for the price.			"

												Jazzpunk is a wonderful game that really is horribly short. The beginning is a great introduction to a world that is reminicent of a 60's spy flick mixed with 80's cyberpunk. Off-beat comedy is everywhere, and it benefits from adventure-style gameplay. There are no complex puzzles, but you will need to experiment and click on things to advance. You will likely not be challenged, and unfortunitely, there isn't much reason for a second playthrough. I got everything I wanted from one go through, messing with everything I could find.Oddly, the biggest failing of this game is it's exploration, in that there simply isn't enough. One entire level is merely a night version of an earlier one, and it possesses the same jokes and side events as the day version. Also, there where at least two occasions when I wished there was an alternative action or possibility than the ones you are forced into in order to proceed with the story. A cliched lapse in judgement brings about a briefly, inarguably unfunny event that amounted to the plot getting in the way of the fun. The final portion of the game recovers, but the ending failed to impress me. I don't regret buying it, but Jazzpunk is not worth full price.			"

												Let me tell you something about Jazzpunk, it is too often the problem with adventure games that the logic behind the puzzles is completely random nonsense, forcing you to hunt and peck everything against everything to succeed. Not so here! The nonsense behind the puzzles are completely consistent, and the designers did quite a good job of putting you into the headspace to solve their particular brand of Illogical challenges. Combine that with Some clever humor and terrific visuals and you have the makings of a masterpiece. My only fears for this game is that it will either sell Poorly preventing Stuff like it from being made in the future, or have negative reviews From casual gamers who just aren't quite ready for this outstanding experience.

												This game can be best summed up as an acid trip. After a long day it's great to enjoying it's cartoonish ways.I recomend it if you want some stupid fun.It is short but you'll always be finding something new each time you play.			"

												Let me tell you something about Jazzpunk, it is too often the problem with adventure games that the logic behind the puzzles is completely random nonsense, forcing you to hunt and peck everything against everything to succeed. Not so here! The nonsense behind the puzzles are completely consistent, and the designers did quite a good job of putting you into the headspace to solve their particular brand of Illogical challenges. Combine that with Some clever humor and terrific visuals and you have the makings of a masterpiece. My only fears for this game is that it will either sell Poorly preventing Stuff like it from being made in the future, or have negative reviews From casual gamers who just aren't quite ready for this outstanding experience.

												Jazzpunk is a game that you won't know if you like it unless you experience it for yourself. As much as I enjoy these walking simulator games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and The Stanley Parable, Jazzpunk does not meet the quality you expect from these games by its narrative, immersion nor in its writing (especially its humor). Warning: Epilepsy Gamers, Beware.I wouldn't recommend this game as the intro screen and various moments in the game have tons of flashing lights.Chalk Full of Gags, Little ElseComedy is not something I'm going to critique the game for. It's too subjective, but I think I know who it's audience. This game comes across as another Youtube Bait game (Goat Simulator, etc.). The humor only seems to work off of ""LOL RANDOM NONSENSE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"", which makes the game itself feel shallow to play alone. The game is chalk full of random mini-games, techy/nerdy/video-game references, and tons of open environments with various gags to be found. If you explore everything and exhaust all the dialogue, you'll probably get five decent hours of a playthrough. But with so many unnecessary nonsense gags, you might grow tired from the game's charm after the first area. And don't expect getting a narrative worth those five hours (at best). If You Still Want It, Buy It On A SaleThere's nothing for me to analyze in its mechanics nor anything story-wise to keep me interested in reviewing Jazzpunk. I liked the aesthetic, the soundtrack and the spy-hero gags/moments of the game. I wanted more of the riddiculous espionage humor, but that gets burried amongst the LOL moments that I quickly grew bored of. Some people may enjoy the more obscure references and the novelty of Jazzpunk. I sure don't see the appeal of a game of easter eggs. What's the surprise if you know that is the gag?			"

												I found this game to be incredibly boring.  It tried way too hard to be funny but the lack of quality and variety in the art and voice acting just didn't do it for me.Tone down the polygon count and some textures and this is something you could find on N64, yet the performance was still abysmal.  It seems as though there's a memory leak or something because sometimes performance gets progressively worse after certain events.  A 6-core CPU with a R9 290 should be able to handle this game.I have often found myself struggling to point polyblank in a specific direction (when using a mouse+keyboard) where my view would sometimes change by 30 degrees when the mouse pointer may have only moved by 1 pixel.  Incredibly annoying.  I often found myself walking backwards towards a doorway since it was the only way I could control the direction I was moving in.The music in the game was crap, most ""songs"" only lasted maybe 20 seconds at most, and they were all on loop.  They also sounded like they had a 64Kbps compression.  On top of that, the volume of many sound effects are way too loud.You can't lose at the game and it gives absolutely no incentive to try anything.  I could complete an achievement and the game never acknowledges it.  The game is hardly a good time waster.I have played free games made by amateurs that were more fun and higher quality than this.  Even without the technical issues, this would be the worst game I own on Steam by far.			"

												Where do I begin...        Set during what I suppose is the Cold War, in what I THOUGHT was Japan, this is one trippy journey into a sweet♥♥♥♥♥world. I've always had a thing for the Eisenhower/JFK era: late 50s early 60s. I also had the pleasure to live in Japan, but my Pops, he had the pleasure to live in Japan during the Cold War. I play games not to get away, but to explore worlds I could never go in real life. This is the closest to 1960s Japan I'll probably ever get.        Jazzpunk is a first person exploration game. There's no real firm location except for one chapter.  The story is not very cut and dry. You play the role of a freelance ""Spy"" operative. It's never really stated who you ultimately work for, but know The Director is your boss. Really, the story is not it's strength. It's more of a visual adventure into someone's trippy mind. You interact with the world and watch the results. Gags, and jokes galore. Oh the gags! It's hard to categorize the game, the fun is in your curiosity. Walk around each location, and EXPLORE. It's a visual piece of art in my opinion, and the art design is superb. A ""retro-futuristic"" (think The Jetsons) Japanese aesthetic all thrown into a blender and somehow not coming out as sloppy as you would think. The music has it's strength. It works VERY well with the world. I can't even categorize the music...Latin, Bassnova, Jazz, 1950s shopping music???        The few cons I have is the price tag. Its a very short game, and the content may not justify the price for some. I also noticed other reviewers reporting motion sickness. For me, this was true. The camera is very sensitive to controls and I found myself getting sick. POV movement is quick and fast. Changing sensitivity might help.         This is one my favorite games ever, and I wish there was more to it. I never thought I'd see the day Quake, Street Fighter; It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Johnny ""Cache"" all get referenced in one piece of artwork! Luis Hernandez is definitley on another world. Glad he chose to share it with us. If you have an open mind, if you have an interest in the culture of the 50s and 60s; or if you just want to try something different, this game is for you. One last thing: did Japan win the war in this universe?Thanks for the trip Mr. Hernandez. I'll raise my bottle of Sake to you.			"

												I'm conflicted about this game.It's very silly, and has plenty of fun points, but the game lacks cohesion. While it's fun to run around and try to find each hidden joke or intractable set piece, you quickly learn that most of the things you interact with have no effect on the overall story, and are little more than a distraction. If a player chooses to ignore all the random set pieces of simply focuses on the main objectives the game can be finished in under and hour.Honestly if you're looking for a funny, joke-filled game, you'd be better off playing something like Phychonauts.

												First of all, I think this is a good ""game"". Why do I not recomend it? The biggest problem is the FOV. It is way too small. Please search Jazzpunk motion sickness. This game will cause most people to experience nausia or just feel terrible. I want to love this interactive gallery, but I simply can't sit down and enjoy it without feeling sick. Hopefully the developers will make a patch eventually to make it playable but that does not really look like it will be happening any time soon.The writing is entertain and it is fun to explore except for the sick feeling.

												Jazzpunk feels like a labour of love, a finely crafted adventure game crammed to the rim with zany, madcap humour; pop-culture references to please even the most devout hipsters; and wonderful little easter eggs. You can really tell the developers had a lot of fun making this game, but not as much as you will playing through it.The only concern you should have with this title is its steep price, especially as you can finish the game in two hours, but this is definitely a must purchase when it goes on sale.Remember; it's a fun thing, it's a Swing Wing!

												This is a walking simulator with light puzzle elements and plenty of 4th wall breaking. Probably entertaining to those who are bored with games with stories, gameplay, or personality beyond references to things they might remember if they are around 30 years old or so, or might have heard their parents talk about. This is the kind of game that will either please you if you aren't into playing games for their systems and mechanics, or repel you: make you play it for an hour or so hoping something beyond simple visual gags, random dialog, and done-to-death 3D tricks you should have seen a dozen or so times by now will happen, until you realize that's all this game has to offer.TLDR this is a game for walking sim fans or people with nostalgia glasses coated so thick with old references and humor they can't even see their noses.The first mission is the best part of the game.

												Jazzpunk is basically a game that doesnt take itself seriously. If you are looking for a serious game, leave now, because this is not what you are looking for. The graphics are great and definitely go well with the play style. Its a game that has easter eggs around every corner and always keeps you wondering what will come next. The one and only downside is limited replay value. If you can get the game at the right price, its well worth it.			"

												If i could describe this game in one word it would be....Chaos. This game simply is filled with so many quirky moments that make people sniker and laugh everytime they happen and its a great little game to pass the time. So many puns and references are hidden that its almost impossible to find them all in one go. However this game is rather short and while its colorful art style is unique its not much to look atI'd say pick this game up if you're looking for a game thats short and humorous, overall i give it a 7.6/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but it honestly wasn't as funny as it thought it was.I chuckled a few times, but because the game relies almost entirely on humor it fell flat for me. It was also over really REALLY quickly. I had heard it was a short game, but it's like an hour and a half short. On top of that, it has little to no replay value. This game is not worth your money.

												Hilarious and deeply strange adventure game. It's a blast to go through the story here, but it's just as fun to explore each area, because there's a lot to see and hear and do. This game absolutely rewards your ability to not simply pursue a given end goal with tons of tomfoolery--and a handful of excellent minigames. This is also the first game in ages where I really wanted to unlock all the achievements; it was fun to do so.The imagery is colorful, cool and not quite like any other game I've ever seen, and the music and sound frequently enhance visual gags. There's excellent punning throughout, too--the writing and voice acting are probably cause for the funniest parts of the game. Charm and wit and humor all over.I absolutely recommend this game if you're willing to goof off with it. It was a really satisfying experience for me as a result.			"

												Hi today I am reviewing JAZZPUNK! It's so funny! I had to stop playing once because of the laugh out loud moments. This is a fantastic game, but it's short. Jazzpunk does however make the short game feel like a life time. There are so many little things you can do like I don't play frogger...Yep You can play frogger. Once I finished the game I found a small game mode that lets you kill bots with rose missles, cake chain guns and other akward things. Overall its a great game. There was one time when it launched me into space and I had to start over again. But in 2 hours of gameplay it only happend once. 9/10ProsSO MUCH LOLSFun minigames...I think that's what I should call them.ConsToo short for $15			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I can't say much about it without spoiling the experience, and the experience is pretty much the whole game, but I can give you some advice:This game is not for everyone. that said, if you want to give it a try, you have to be in the right mindset. This is not a traditional game, in any sense of the word. For one, none of the challenge comes from skill. Some people might say that makes it not challenging at all. I happen to disagree. The challenge, and indeed the enjoyment, come from searching the environment and seeing what wacky things you can find.Shoot, this is hard. I can't give any examples without spoiling a signifncant part of the (Exceedingly short) game.Look, the game is cheap, just try it. If it's the game for you you'll know it. Just don't go into it expecting anything in particular and you'll enjoy it that much more.			"

But that ""story"", as funny as it is, is not as interesting as the levels themselves. You can do a lot of sh*t, explore, do a few sidequests. Still, the game is over after about 3 hours. But these 3 hours were extremly funny. Jazzpunk features a lot of minigames (e.g. Wedding Qake... awesome+) that you can play as much as you like.Overall, what Jazzpunk lacks in length it makes up with humor and jokes. You WILL love it.

Perfect humor, a great story line and interesting characters. The puzzles arent the hardest to solve, as they sometimes.. okay, rarely need logic, but thats okay that way. The only big downside is that, even though you explore everything in the levels and see much funny stuff and eastereggs, the game itself is just like about 3 hours long. It has 5 levels just, if I remember correctly, not even the minigames help making it longer. I highly wish for a sequel, as the wish of having a free dlc with additional content unrealistic. I assume its so expensive because the developers need to make up for their investments, its an Indie game after all, and I think the 11,20€ are well spent.			"

												This game is far from being perfect. But what counts is it will give you one of the greatest and weirdest experiences you'll ever have. Anything you can say will be some kind of spoiler except my opinion about it: This is a game I wish I could forget I ever played it just to get a chance to experience it again from the beginning with all its ""wtf moments"". In my opinion everyone should have played this game once.Only the time to finish it could be longer so that the experience will not end this soon.			"

												Very short but highly entertaining and a genuinely unique game that has some pretty offbeat humour. Set in a alternate cold war era 50s/60s where everyone seems to be a robot. Most things in the game are interactive so the majority of the time spent will be looking around each of the games levels for objects and easter eggs to find, which is the main attraction of the game. A bit of a one-trick pony but it's enjoyable enough to pick up when it's discounted to enjoy for a short but sweet few hours, and the unique visual style combined with it's jazzy soundtrack makes it great purchase.

												Jazzpunk is a wierd little gem set in the era of Cold War secrecy and espionage. You play an agent (so far, at least) who must gather intelligence. You do this through various drug trips, which are entered after consuming some pills from your handler. This game is absolutely bizarre. There are thousands (literally) of small little events that can be triggered which end in all sorts of weird ways. For instance, if you pop some guys bubble (from his gum), it will pop on his face, blinding him and causing him to run into traffic. Is it relevant to the story? Absolutely not. Is it funny regardless? Sure is!The art style, chilling soundtrack, and arching story of the game keep me coming back time and time again. I highly recommend this extremely weird title.			"

												Jazzpunk is silly, fun, filled with technological jokes and honestly is a mixed bag.I don't judge by how long a game is, but even on pure content it doesn't go a full 14 smackers. There's a few harty laughs, and the weirdness is worth something, but there are better, bigger games for this price. Is it worth it without a sale? If you REALLY like old timey jokes and references, maybe. If you like sandbox quirks... MAYBE. If you're looking for a 'game' game, no. It's short, a one-timer, and is more a walking simulator than an engaging experience.But again, it's great for a quick prank or two.			"

												15 Dollar pricetag for a game made with few original assets. TL;dr not worth the cost. Get it if it goes on sale for 50 cents. Nothing more.Gameplay looks as if it's trying to mimic something from Blendo Games, and fails short. I may have given a bad review to 30 Flights, but at least that title lacked the design flaws that occasionally stand out later in the game. Then there is the matter of asset flipping. Using assets made by someone else and then dropping them almost tetris-like into unity to make a quick buck. This does no good for the consumer. Even Jim Sterling thinks so, at least I thought he did until I saw his name in the credits as a voice actor. Then there is the matter of some of the ""plot puzzles"" being nothing more than references for aging gen-x'ers, aka old people. The Captain Crunch blue whistle for the 2600hz control tone for the phone line is one example of many. Can I say this game is worth buying? It's not even worth owning. The quality of this game falls into that category of indie freebie that you download once, play for a while then delete and never play again because it wasn't a memorable enough experience. If it goes on sale for $0.50 USD or less get it. For half of a dollar maybe, anything more is not worth it.			"

Jazzpunk's style and all around absurdity are a refreshing departure from a number of the AAA games I've been playing recently. The mini games and ""side missions"" are an awesome addition and help round out Jazzpunk's ridiculousness. If you're bored and looking for something funny and surreal, definitely check out Jazzpunk.			"

												The game is a series of tenuously connected gags. That's kind of interesting, in that it's a sort of playable ZAZ film, but none of the jokes are actually all that funny. I thought the game would have more of a satirical bent than just cartoons, but even as cartoons it just doesn't work.			"

												Jazzpunk definitely has a unique feel to it. We need more games such as these! The style of humour and references are put together so well that it creates a fantastic gamplay experience. I have never seen a game like it before!On the other hand, since Jazzpunk tells a story, you cannot enjoy the game as much when replaying it. It would be interesting to see similar games developed in the future with new playable chapters to come out for some time after the main game has already been released rather than just one story and that being the end of the game.

												At it's heart Jazzpunk is a ridiculous ""secret agent"" game where you try to complete the objectives given to you by your drunken Director.  I was grinning a big broad idiot grin the moment the first mission started, and I don't think it ever left my face.  Everything is ridiculous, and also ridiculously perfect.  There are nods to classic spy thrillers everywhere, and hilarious little interactions scattered throughout every level.  The art and style is amazing.  Genuinely a must-get for any gamer out there.

												How do I best describe this game? Hilarious. Nonsensical. Downright disgusting at points, but awesome. Amazing. Very few words can describe such a fun little indie game full of jazz, computers, minigames and PIGEONS! As Polyblank, a robot in the future where the world was taken over by 'em, you are sent on missions from the Director as you meet foes and allies alike. However, at a resort getaway meant as a vacation from the tiring work, the evil Editor kidnaps you and brings you to his room in the resort (pretty strong bromance there, guys). You escape and find your way out, only to be sent back to a fake beginning! Doesn't make sense? It shouldn't, so don't worry.All-in-all, Jazzpunk is a must have for your Steam library, and nothing should ever change that.			"

												If you like quirky, unorthodox games like The Stanley Parable, you will certainly get some enjoyment from it. Similarly to The Stanley Parable, it's a game that's less about winning and more about wandering about and seeing what you can do. There are a couple of big differences though.The first is that it's linear. There's only one path to take, and no amount of meandering through doors will change that. Instead, however, you are given large, open areas to explore, with a nice handful of jokes, minigames, and even the odd sidequest. If you try rushing through the objectives and getting to the end, you will miss out on most of the meat the game has to offer.The other difference is, obviously, the style. This is much more cartoony, with a nice dose of slapstick thrown in there. The humour is certainly a lot more visual than lyrical, although there's some good dialogue in there too.I would highly recommend this game if you're looking for something funny and quirky, a nice experience albeit short. On the other hand if you're looking for a traditional espionage game with stealth and whatnot, yeah this really isn't for you. Hitman this ain't. :P			"

												Easily the most fun I've EVER had playing a game. The reviews are what got me to try it, and people who offered reviews here on Steam are right. This is laugh out loud funny in the 'Robot Chicken'-inspired Adult Swim fashion, its colorful and always interesting, has good action and a chance to explore while amidst the more linear quests that often spawns random sidequests, instant hidden games or just plain hilarious randomness. I'm not completely through, but its safe to say this is one of the most creative, captivating and fun games ever, and I so far see a high replayability factor. I hope to see more like this one. It is easily worth the price, and a must-buy if you find it on sale.			"

However, it took only 4 hours for me to beat this game and unlock all of the achievments, and I honestly feel that 15$ is too steep of a price to pay for a 4 hour game, no matter how funny it is.

Jazzpunk is one of the funniest games I've played in a long time. Its humor is irreverant, often bizarre, and is reminiscent of films like Airplane! or Blazing Saddles. Much of it is random, but in a an unexpected ""why the hell is this happenening,"" way rather than the tired ""throw in anything and hope its funny"" way. Checking out a pile of rubbish has the game throwing confetti at you and congratulating you for checking said rubbish, taking a random bottle of pills could turn you into a horse, or inspecting a wedding cake could treat you to a short game of Wedding Quake.The premise is simple: you're a freelance spy sent to recover sensitive material. Each of the game's four main missions brings you to a new area populated with strange characters that all have unique, funny dialogue.The game is short; clocking in at just over 3 hours for me. It's even shorter if one ignores the side-stuff and just does the main missions, but that would be missing the point of the game. At its core, Jazzpunk is about exploration and finding just what weirdness lurks in the nooks and crannies of the game. Personally, I don't see much difference between spending $15 to see a comedy in a theatre or spending the same amount for a comedic game of a similar length. Regardless, even if you have to wait for a sale, Jazzpunk's oddball humor is not to be missed.			"

												Pretty quick but very humerous game. Alot of the extra stuff on the side of the main objective is very fun, and reason alone to play the game. Plus much of the dialog is humerous, especially from the homeless looking peoplebots. I recommend this game to anyone looking to kill 3-4 hours in a humor filled adventure created by adult swim.			"

												Even if a tad expensive, Jazzpunk is a greatly entertaining game. With a real sense of open world style adventure, mixed with a 20's style attitude, Jazzpunk is a great game. Would recomend this game. The only downside is that it is to short to fully get into, I don't know if more levels are going to be added, but is a great and replayable game, every level you replay you find something new!			"

			Views: 0		



A lot of people critisize short games for being, well, short. That's like saying the Falklands War never accounted for anything, because it really did. And this game does too.For it's decent off-sale price of £11.99 (or the equivalent) you get a game that explores many forms of game mechanics and comedy. In the game you catch pigeons, play a replica frogger game, play crazy golf with a pool cube, explore the digestive tracts of a crocodile, have an online match with other players over who marries who, cook a pig, fly about in a car, have a streetfighter-style match with a car, play tennis with a replica virtual boy and race gravy pots around a penthouse water feature filled with instant gravy granuales. And that's only just skimming the the top of the custard-covered apple crumble.Despite it only being around an hour and a half long, it has a large replay value. It's like when you watch a film for a second time; you see things that you didn't see before. There are numerous side quests, gags, easter eggs and weird happenings to find in the game all of which are too complicated to explain.If I was asked to explain the storyline to you, I can't. There's some mentionings of soviet embassies and editors, but it's really a big pile of slapstick comedy merged into a blob called Jazzpunk. Go buy this now. You will not regret it.			"

This is the kind of game I would want to never end- I just want to keep going deeper down the rabbit hole. Funny, intuitive, only mildly challenging. There are a few bugs here or there that made the game seize up, but they let you go back and select which chapter you're on so it's not devestating.Awesome as balls game.			"

												Jazzpunk is a short simple first person adventure game.It's humor is based on complete slapstick and randomness (if you're into that), while its world is charming if not incredibly quirky. While there is little element of gameplay for the main story, there are a few interesting but not very compelling minigames to play.Is it worth it?

I thought to myself, this is like adult swim turned into a video game!  Then in the ending credits, I see, it’s an Adult Swim video game.  But the game is really very good.  I actually don’t even like Adult Swim and I found this game to be very intriguing.ProsReally interesting art.  It’s excellent between the music, aesthetic, and even characters and bizarre script.Fantastic music.  Really very good.A very original world.  You won’t find anything like it.  Interesting story, though limited, kept me happily playing.  Bizarre, but funny, comedy.  Often in the form of very strange beings saying very strange thingsSo many fun throwbacks to the 90’s: References to old games, old windows, just incredible.Game runs well.  No glitches.  Ran at about 100 fps max settings on my i5 4670 and GTX 980.ConsThe game is very short; maybe 1-2 hours.  This isn’t bad for the game, but something to be aware of.Nothing else really; it’s a great game. "

I hope the devs patch it sometime (as they did with the mouse accel thingy) because it can throw you off a bit.Extremely recommended "

												When PC gaming first began, the genre at its head was the point and click adventure game. For years, games like King's Quest, Gabriel Knight, and The Curse of Monkey Island dominated the market. There were so many point and click games, every single idea one could have became used and abused, and the genre faded into one of gaming years past.JazzPunk is not your typical point and click adventure game.Firstly, it employs a clever mix of the classic Commodore 64 games and more modern shooters, giving you a game that feels like a shooter and plays like a classic. In addition, it has an abundance of something that just wasn't present in early games in the genre, and that's personality. The game will leave you holding your sides in its hilarious nonsense time and time again. Throw in a clever and unique art direction along side a perfect soundtrack, and you've got yourself the masterpiece that is JazzPunk.Despite this praise, Jazzpunk is not without fault. The biggest one is this: Its combination of floaty controls, psychedelic graphics, and low FoV will leave many users nauseous after just a few minutes of play. It can be a risky endeavor, play this game at your own risk. Another issue is that this game is quite short. for $15, you can find yourself beating this game in less than an hour. This may seem to be a ridiculous complaint to fans of The Stanley Parable, who know that for the same price you can finish the game in 20 minutes, but the fun in The Stanley Parable comes from its replay value. This game is all about exploration, but one can end their experience in a short amount of time, and there aren't 17 more endings to choose from. If one were to plan on buying this game, they need to be patient and search for secrets, otherwise they could be looking at a 45 minute game rather than a 4 hour one.All in all, JazzPunk is a creative and interesting experience. It blends unique game design with witty and pleasurable humor, but can be dangerous to users who are prone to epilepsy or motion sickness, as well as being a tad on the short side.			"

However, it took only 4 hours for me to beat this game and unlock all of the achievments, and I honestly feel that 15$ is too steep of a price to pay for a 4 hour game, no matter how funny it is. So if you are interested in buying this game, than I would suggest you wait until a Steam sale to get it.			"

												I like this game very much. It is indeed unique, as the jokes are purely genius. The game itself has so many secrets and funny lines. Its like, everything you ever want in a game. Perfect humor, a great story line and interesting characters. The puzzles arent the hardest to solve, as they sometimes.. okay, rarely need logic, but thats okay that way. The only big downside is that, even though you explore everything in the levels and see much funny stuff and eastereggs, the game itself is just like about 3 hours long. It has 5 levels just, if I remember correctly, not even the minigames help making it longer. I highly wish for a sequel, as the wish of having a free dlc with additional content unrealistic. I assume its so expensive because the developers need to make up for their investments, its an Indie game after all, and I think the 11,20€ are well spent.			"

Jazzpunk is one of the funniest games I've played in a long time. Its humor is irreverant, often bizarre, and is reminiscent of films like Airplane! or Blazing Saddles. Much of it is random, but in a an unexpected ""why the hell is this happenening,"" way rather than the tired ""throw in anything and hope its funny"" way. Checking out a pile of rubbish has the game throwing confetti at you and congratulating you for checking said rubbish, taking a random bottle of pills could turn you into a horse, or inspecting a wedding cake could treat you to a short game of Wedding Quake.The premise is simple: you're a freelance spy sent to recover sensitive material. Each of the game's four main missions brings you to a new area populated with strange characters that all have unique, funny dialogue.The game is short; clocking in at just over 3 hours for me. It's even shorter if one ignores the side-stuff and just does the main missions, but that would be missing the point of the game. At its core, Jazzpunk is about exploration and finding just what weirdness lurks in the nooks and crannies of the game. Personally, I don't see much difference between spending $15 to see a comedy in a theatre or spending the same amount for a comedic game of a similar length. Regardless, even if you have to wait for a sale, Jazzpunk's oddball humor is not to be missed.			"

												Very funny, very silly, and doesn't out stay its welcome.Lately there have been one of two funny games coming out, and this is another one. Its a first person game where you take the role of an agent carrying out missions. Each mission takes place in quite a small map,  but it is filled with interactions. The majority of which achieved their aim of bringing a smile to my face. The important thing here is that exploring and interacting is key to getting the best out of the game. This is one of those games where it is possible to ""play it wrong"". If you just follow the mission objectives you will be done on each level in five minutes. Even exploring everything this game is still not a long experience (about two and a half hours) but personally I don't think funny games should be long, the joke will get old.On an artistic level this game is fabulous, the music is great and adds to the offbeat sixites robot spy vibe.

												This kind of my game is my niche. I can't explain it to anybody else, but I love games like this. Blendo Games makes similar stuff. (Thirty Flights of Loving, Atom Zombie Smasher, and the upcoming Quadrilateral Cowboy which looks pretty great)This game has some really bad jokes, and pretty much all dialogue is poorly written and poorly delivered. It also has some pretty great jokes and I'm so glad there are games like this.It's pretty great and I wish there was more.also metal gear solid 3 is the best game ever			"

												Definitely one of the funniest games I've ever played. Everything in Jazzpunks world has a punchline so you'll want to look in every nook and cranny. The excellent writing combined with the beautiful art style makes this one hell of a game. The jokes are relentless and don't give up until the credits roll. This game is beautifully bizzare and I loved every bit of it.			"

												There is no way to explain this game, except to say that it is awesome. The complete randomness thrown in between mission objective and the strange interactivity the game has with random characters makes it one of the best games I have ever played for none of the usual reasons. Strange graphics that I love, completely weird comedy, just nothing that you expect. Something you think is compeltely random could actually help you finish the mission. Just all the adult humor at random times and the weird sidequests and games just add so much to it. Best stress reliever ever. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I am not a big indie game fan, but this has really won me over.			"

												Much like many others, this is hard to recommend. The game is a surreal 'comedy' in which you play the part of a secret agent tasked with a number of tasks all set in a very stylised world. The tasks are pretty easy to work out with some lateral thought, ie if it seems a bit silly more than likely your on the right track and there are some fun side quests to flesh things out. The story is pretty much second fiddle to the jokes. The issue is, its short. Very short. I finished it in 2 hours and i didnt feel compelled to go back and do the side quests i skipped. The humour, while funny enough to make a playthrough worthwhile sometimes falls a bit flat. Playing this put me in mind of the Accomplice series of books by Steve Aylett. i found myself compelled to continue, sometimes laughing but other times just wondering what i was reading. The game is nowhere near as dark but it felt similar in that i would find it hard to explain, just play it / read it, you will see.For the price though, no. Just no. £10.99 for approx 2 hours play time is just too much. Sale only. Pros:Its funny with a very unique art style Its more of an experience than a game and for that i applaud the devs for thinking out the boxIts good fun for the couple of hours playthough it providesCons:It will take you 2 hours :P.The humour could put some people off, lets face it, not everyone has the same sense of humour.Ill say recommended but only if you like the idea of playing though a surreal trip with no real challenge, its just something you hop onto to ride along and enjoy the rather silly show. Plus, i MUST be on sale, at least 50% off to even begin to justify the playtime.			"

												This is what I call a fun adventure game. It's filled humor and style. You play as secret agent in the 1950's and you go on missions in this crazy universe. The game is really short. You can finish the game in an half hour if you grind through it, but you might as well burn your money if you're going to do that. What's special about this game is the amount of detail is in each piece. There's npcs with their own personalities and jokes, side quests, and minigames. You'll get wrapped up into the environment from just the detail and design. Unforunately, I finished the game with 100% achievement in 3 hours, but I still want more and will probably go searching again. Easily one of my favorite games this year.TLDR; Watch the intro. If you don't like the intro, you're not going to like the game:

												It's very rare these days that one finds a game aimed to be more funny than serious, although very short Jazzpunk has entertained me from start to finsih, even the credits were funny to watch, i was there when it was filmed live (laugh all who get my joke) and it was very funny live. Such a brilliant buy for a fantastic game. I hope to see more like this.			"

												Odd, weird, bizarre, bad puns. Just some of the words that can be used to describe (I can only assume) some kind of conspiracy theorists acid trip.The humour is bad, I would advise only getting if you are the sort of person that likes (genuinely painful) puns and the more surreal Monty Python esq types of humour.Only put in a few hours, but it flew by, I hardly felt like I spent any time on it. There are a couple of things that do bug me about it, sometimes you want to skip through what other characters are saying sometimes, but that’s just me getting impatient on subsequent play-throughs (played each level so far at least a couple of times, mostly for the achievements, but still found entertaining) "

												The spiritual successor to Lego Island and an incredible tribute to the classic spoof movies of the 80s (Airplane!, The Naked Gun). The game is a rollercoaster of ridiculous gags and an oddball setting that is three long, twisted steps away from James Bond gadgetry and cyberpunk. The game is never challenging and can be rushed through quickly (but what the ♥♥♥♥ is the point of that); the levels can be thought of as environments to explore and interact with to find secrets (a la Gone Home or The Stanley Parable). The scope of these secrets is immense, ranging from short slapstick gags to entire games-within-games that have to be seen to be believed. If you're not the kind of nerd who gets pissy about short games, Jazzpunk is absolutely worth your time and is one of the great examples of the finally-growing comedic game genre.			"

Runs very well on my pc and from my experiences there is hardly any bugs. I loved the missions and twist to the game. It wasn't one of those games that you grow tiered of after the first 15 minutes you play. I beat the game in only about 2-3 hours because I couldn't get enough. I hope the developers make more content because Jazzpunk was an awesome game to play and I would love to see more on this game.			"

												According to indie developer Necrophone Games, Jazzpunk is a “comedy adventure game set in an alternate-reality cold war world, plagued with corporate espionage, cyber-crime and sentient martinis,” fused with gameplay supposedly inspired by spoof classics such as Airplane and Naked Gun. So, with a description as above, it is fair to suggest that I had no idea what to expect when I ‘cyberjacked into the netrix’ for the first time.Published by Adult Swim Games, whose notable successes include the absurd, quasi-addictive Robot Unicorn flash-game, it was always a reasonable guess that this title would be somewhat lacking in real-world sensibilities. By the time your character has consumed his prescription ‘Missionoyl’ medication (Guidelines for usage: take one capsule per mission until reality is sufficiently augmented), your assumptions are confirmed. Jazzpunk is Christian Bale crazy.You see the world through the eyes of Polyblank, an espionage agent of sorts, who, under the instruction of a peculiar gentleman known only as The Director, must infiltrate the Soviet consulate to obtain a top-secret data cartridge.Except, when you arrive at the location of your first mission, it doesn’t take too long to realise that the ‘storyline’ itself is as tenuous and stringy as overcooked spaghetti, it is purely the vehicle that transports the player from one fast-paced escapade to the next. This is not to say that there isn’t a vague storyline in place, but, to be playing this game for its storytelling narrative and character depth would be to miss the point entirely. Jazzpunk is intended to be a light-hearted poke at, well, pretty much everything.It is an ambitious notion, particularly for an indie games development team consisting of just two people. The good news, however, is that Luiz Hernandez and Jess Browse have succeeded in their primary aim, to make people laugh. After a promising but sluggish opening chapter, Jazzpunk really begins to gather pace, providing several genuine laugh-out-loud moments, generally involving pigeons.However, Jazzpunk isn’t just the quirky chick that nobody wants to take to the prom. She’s pretty, too. A vivid cartoon landscape adorns the open-world environment, and Hernandez himself has composed an original soundtrack, which wouldn’t sound out of place in a 1950’s motion picture.Help From a Few FriendsThose hoping for a little more than an interactive comedy can also rest assured, Jazzpunk is not short of good old fashioned gameplay. Mini-game appearances from favourites such as Frogger, Fruit Ninja and Space Invaders creep up on you when you least expect it, as well as an incredible wedding-themed parody of Quake, in which players must use champagne corks as projectiles in order to avoid the prospect of matrimonial doom.The game builds to a resoundingly triumphant climax. An Olympic style multi-format duel with the story’s main antagonist, The Editor (or ‘The Man with the Horn Rimmed Glasses,’ as he is originally introduced), continues to raise the ridiculousness stakes, and an epic gravy boat race (yes, that’s what I said) closes the battle magnificently.Jazzpunk, a nominee for the grand prize at this year’s Independent Games Festival, is a thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish. It shares some similarities with fellow IGF nominee The Stanley Parable in its ability to not just break, but smash the fourth wall, yet still remain exciting. However, where it stands apart from TSP, and the vast majority of other computer games to date, is its steadfast commitment to being absolutely mental.Too Much of a Good Thing?Of course, the off-the-wall nature of this title will mean that it will not be for everyone. If you are expecting an experience that follows traditional gameplay protocol then you will be confused, let down, and most likely irritated. Jazzpunk is wacky, in a way that is simply incomparable to anything else I have ever seen. It is an explosive compound of equal parts satire and slapstick, noir and nerd, sublime and ridiculous.On the whole, Jazzpunk seems to completely merit its reception as one of the best independent games to be released this year. In terms of replay-ability, it is very solid. Having completed the full-story twice, I was able to find plenty of content that I had missed on my opening play-through, which kept it fresh and engaging.The humour is likely to be hit-and-miss, based on personal preference. But, for this soul, Jazzpunk is an extremely funny and refreshing piece of work.http://www.pixeldynamo.com/reviews/2014/02/06/3554/jazzpunk-pc-review/ "

												Yes the game is really short. But it's friggin funny. You are ""Polyblank"", an agent who has to complete various missions for the director. But that ""story"", as funny as it is, is not as interesting as the levels themselves. You can do a lot of sh*t, explore, do a few sidequests. Still, the game is over after about 3 hours. But these 3 hours were extremly funny. Jazzpunk features a lot of minigames (e.g. Wedding Qake... awesome+) that you can play as much as you like.Overall, what Jazzpunk lacks in length it makes up with humor and jokes. You WILL love it.

												I feel kinda inadequate reviewing this. I ""beat"" the game technically, but after watching some Youtubers play it and looking at the list of Steam Achievements I realized there's so much stuff that I missed it's embarassing. It's an adventure game, but the focus isn't really on puzzle solving really. This is a world of spies and pigeons, pizza and hallucinations. It's insane, you have to figure out how to interact with this insane world and use that insane logic to solve it's insane levels.There's lots of references to video games and pop culture. particularly the 60s and 70s and Cold War era spy movies. But really the only reference is insanity and stupidity.It's beautiful. Just try it.			"

												QuirkyJazzpunk is a weird game. Simply said, it's a bunch of short vignettes where outrageous things happen and the world is strange. I'm not going too much into it becuase you kinda just have to experience it. The one thing that I will say is that the humor relied on absurdity which suits a linear level. However, the humor also relies on finding things off the beaten path which requires a hands off approach. These two aren't balanced quite right as there are entire sections where I just sit there bored but what is there is pretty funny. Get it on a sale.			"

												hey guys, i was well invested in the game way befor i bought it, watched crummy play threws and looked it up online, sadly the gameplay in trailer is very falsly advertised the content that youl find in the game really wont hold you over more than 2 hours 3-4 tops with a blind 100%  unfortunatly i wouldnt suggest playing the game when you too tired, i passed out on the keybord and a refund wasnt an option, but i didnt really plan to anyway.    over all the game needs its developers to expand on it for more content and for what they got to work with it shouldnt be that hard.

Buy it while it's on saleThis is one of those games that's better if you see it than if I explain it to you. If you're unsure whether you want to buy this game or not, look up a couple minutes of gameplay of it. If you like what you see, you'll enjoy the game, and I fully recommend you buy it.Be warned that the game is only a couple hours long. I did a decent amount of exploring and still only squeezed two hours out of it. You might get a little more if you try and do everything. It's a great two hours, but it's still only two hours. To get the most of your money, wait for it to go on sale.			"

JazzpunkThis is a pretty strange game to be honest, though in a good way, at least in my opinion. Although the cartoonish graphics are nice, and the storyline is okay, I think that the bad jokes and puns, combined with the side-quests and minigames scattered around really make this game.It's just so fun to explore and do things completely random and different; things you've never done before, like capturing birds so someone can bake a pie with them, or 'swatting' flies in a vase shop (you can imagine how that turned out).Jazzpunk is like nothing I have ever played before, and I highly recommend it.Although there have been a few issues with this game e.g. me being confused and using up an item that i was supposed to use to progress in the game (SPOILER-with the gravy granules within the Bachelor Pad Chapter I didn't read the text on the table, and didn't throw the granules in the water, instead I just used them all, and then had to re-play an area to get back).To conclude, I have greatly enjoyed my few hours of playtime so far. I may even replay this game at some point in the future, to try and find anything that I may have missed the first time while playing.10/10 - Odd, but a very unique game. And funny at times, too! :D			"

												I have a difficult time finding words for this game. it's weird. It exists as its own weird little genre, I can't think of anything to accurately compare it to.It's not a story driven game. There is no coherent story. It's not a gameplay driven game. The gameplay is pretty simplistic. It's more exploration driven. You go from thing to thing, looking to see what the next odd thing you find is. It's not a usual way to build a game, but it was enough to get me to play through it.			"

The graphics and the overall tone of the game could have made for a good 60s-spy-thriller parody, but instead it just a garble of of (mostly) unfunny jokes and an incoherent plot. The gameplay itself was rudamentary at best, but this could be excused if the game's jokes were actually funny.  If you absolutly must have this game, buy it during a sale, because it is not worth $15.			"

												Sometimes a game can try too hard to be funny, but Jazzpunk is just perfect. You'd be missing out if you didn't interact with everything that crosses your path, be it people (more like bathroom signs) or objects that let you enter mini games just as random as the main story.It is short, though, and it might be wise to grab it during a Steam sale. Either way, hopefully the developers will use the money to make a longer sequel or some kind of DLC.			"

												I don't play many single-player games due to the fact that I get bored easily. That wasn't the case with Jazzpunk. One of the whackiest and most amusing games I have ever played. It pokes fun at several different games as well as TV shows and movies. It gives you little background story and lets you go on your merry way as you interact with the enviroment and characters in it. The levels get super trippy at points during the game but in a good way. Really over the top humor with a few puns here and there makes it unbelievably enjoyable. If you're looking for something short and sweet, Jazzpunk is the game to buy.			"

												Jazzpunk is a funny, engaging little game that suffers from a short story but is bolstered exceptionally by amusing dialogue,  achievements that actually make you think about them (mostly) and entertaining tidbits hidden throughout the landscape that seem to add an overall ""panache"" to the game itself. It might be fairly easy and straightforward (since even the ""final boss"" has no real way to lose that I can determine) but for a game to make me laugh as hard and as often as it did in the (short) time it took me to play through it and collect all the achievements means I have to recommend it. Also the soundtrack was fairly good, if a little blaring at times so... take that as you will?			"

												Jazzpunk is a First-person game, but it's not a shooter. It's more of a FPC, First-Person Comedy. It's really funny, and it turns a lot of the FPS genre tropes on their head. It is a parody of, not only the genre, but also a big chunk of the medium as a whole and of pop culture from the 90's to today. It covers a lot of ground in very little time. You'll see everything in less than 5 hours, but that's one of the things that makes it good in my opinion. It doesn't overstay it's welcome.It's full of nonsensical visual gags, cheap and fast puns, and wacky physical humor. Normally, all of this would equate to something that is difficult to spend very much time with, but Jazzpunk's atmosphere remains inviting throughout. A lot of the jokes may be cheap, but they continue to get a big laugh from me until the very end.			"

												Very funny, very silly, and doesn't out stay its welcome.Lately there have been one of two funny games coming out, and this is another one. Its a first person game where you take the role of an agent carrying out missions. Each mission takes place in quite a small map,  but it is filled with interactions. The majority of which achieved their aim of bringing a smile to my face. The important thing here is that exploring and interacting is key to getting the best out of the game. This is one of those games where it is possible to ""play it wrong"". If you just follow the mission objectives you will be done on each level in five minutes. Even exploring everything this game is still not a long experience (about two and a half hours) but personally I don't think funny games should be long, the joke will get old.On an artistic level this game is fabulous, the music is great and adds to the offbeat sixites robot spy vibe.

The sense of humor in this game will sometimes leave you scratching your head but most of the time completely speechless due to how ridiculous yet hilarious it is. If you just rush through the game, it is really short. Only an hour long, however once you understand the charm of this game, you will want to explore every nook and cranny for every possible joke and hidden secrets, not to mention you'll want to beat every minigame. Still, I don't recommend buying it at full prince unless ridiculous humor is your thing. But if it's during a steam sale and you're looking for a good life, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I honestly had trouble choosing either side. It starts off promising with quirky visuals and sound, light puzzles with a little exploration in a somewhat ""humorous"" world. After a level or two you realize most of the jokes are of the ""Lolz so random"" or ""reference to something"" variety and the puzzles become so light, I would struggle to argue that they are puzzles at all.If you have 3 hours to kill and enjoy that type of humor you may get a few dollars worth of enjoyment.

												  This is a quirky and fun adventure-type game.  I say adventure-type because while you are trying to solve puzzles, they are, thus far in my admittedly short play-time, quite easy.  The pull of this game is the stylized 60's spy-thriller setting.  Basically you are given a set-piece environment that you explore and try to ""solve"" to make it to the next level.  There are opportunities to interact with a number of objects in the game, including ""characters"" that rather look like they belong on public washroom doors to identify ""men's"" and ""women's"", with some terrible-but-in-a-good-way puns and jokes.  One caution I would give is that this is a first person game.  Your character ""runs"" smoothly across the environment with no bobbing or jumping.  As the environments are very busy and colourful, I found myself feeling a little motion sickness at times.  Admittedly I am succeptable to this phenomenon, and by simply moving more slowly and in more straight lines I was able to continue.  I would also like to suggest there be an EPILEPSY warning for this game.  The intro scene in particular was intense with flashing lights and crazy sounds.  My 9 year old daughter saw this and immediately wanted to play it.  There are some risque jokes, but really it's pretty PG.  Additionally, many of the jokes went right over her head, particularly the non-sequiturs and those referencing old computer terminology.  She was mainly attracted to the blocky and colourful artwork and the physical jokes, of which there are plenty.  The music and sound are particularly mentionable.  The ""Jazzpunk"" music is a blend of jazz and... I'm not sure punk exactly.  Imagine Miles Davis improvising with modern jazz while tripping on acid.  It can get a little much - but then again I'm old so what do I know?  I was able to get this game on sale, and at under $5 I can whole-heartedly recommend it.  If you are sitting on the fence about this one, I'd probably wait until it went on sale.  If you want to experience something unusual and trippy, then go for it.			"

												It's an experience, that's for sure. Jazzpunk is not a traditional game by any standards. It's very much an ""explore and mess with things"" playgroundwhere each level is filled with little bits and gags. Some of it's pretty funny and all of it is strange and out there. In fact, I don't think you can even die. Walk around, interact with things to see what happens, move on. IF you can pick it up for 3 bucks or so, its'a cool little journey for a few hours. Any more than that is too much though.			"

												What is Jazzpunk? I've played through the game to 100% now (or at least 100% achievements, I'm sure I've missed some stuff along the way) and I still have no clue. It's a point and click adventure game, I guess, and there's some exploration to be had, too, and a bit of questing, and random minigames, and just... a lot, a lot of weird but great humor. So many times the game just pulls something out of nowhere that's completely unexpected but not just ""LOLSORANDOM"". Not all the humor is great but so much of it is and there are so frequently jokes that it's hard not to find it amusing. The game is really on the short side, but it makes it a tight, focused, fast-paced package and really that's all I can ask for. I'm not sure it's worth the $15 price tag, but on sale, it's a great buy.			"

It wasn't one of those games that you grow tiered of after the first 15 minutes you play. I beat the game in only about 2-3 hours because I couldn't get enough.

												According to indie developer Necrophone Games, Jazzpunk is a “comedy adventure game set in an alternate-reality cold war world, plagued with corporate espionage, cyber-crime and sentient martinis,” fused with gameplay supposedly inspired by spoof classics such as Airplane and Naked Gun. So, with a description as above, it is fair to suggest that I had no idea what to expect when I ‘cyberjacked into the netrix’ for the first time.Published by Adult Swim Games, whose notable successes include the absurd, quasi-addictive Robot Unicorn flash-game, it was always a reasonable guess that this title would be somewhat lacking in real-world sensibilities. By the time your character has consumed his prescription ‘Missionoyl’ medication (Guidelines for usage: take one capsule per mission until reality is sufficiently augmented), your assumptions are confirmed. Jazzpunk is Christian Bale crazy.You see the world through the eyes of Polyblank, an espionage agent of sorts, who, under the instruction of a peculiar gentleman known only as The Director, must infiltrate the Soviet consulate to obtain a top-secret data cartridge.Except, when you arrive at the location of your first mission, it doesn’t take too long to realise that the ‘storyline’ itself is as tenuous and stringy as overcooked spaghetti, it is purely the vehicle that transports the player from one fast-paced escapade to the next. This is not to say that there isn’t a vague storyline in place, but, to be playing this game for its storytelling narrative and character depth would be to miss the point entirely. Jazzpunk is intended to be a light-hearted poke at, well, pretty much everything.It is an ambitious notion, particularly for an indie games development team consisting of just two people. The good news, however, is that Luiz Hernandez and Jess Browse have succeeded in their primary aim, to make people laugh. After a promising but sluggish opening chapter, Jazzpunk really begins to gather pace, providing several genuine laugh-out-loud moments, generally involving pigeons.However, Jazzpunk isn’t just the quirky chick that nobody wants to take to the prom. She’s pretty, too. A vivid cartoon landscape adorns the open-world environment, and Hernandez himself has composed an original soundtrack, which wouldn’t sound out of place in a 1950’s motion picture.Help From a Few FriendsThose hoping for a little more than an interactive comedy can also rest assured, Jazzpunk is not short of good old fashioned gameplay. Mini-game appearances from favourites such as Frogger, Fruit Ninja and Space Invaders creep up on you when you least expect it, as well as an incredible wedding-themed parody of Quake, in which players must use champagne corks as projectiles in order to avoid the prospect of matrimonial doom.The game builds to a resoundingly triumphant climax. An Olympic style multi-format duel with the story’s main antagonist, The Editor (or ‘The Man with the Horn Rimmed Glasses,’ as he is originally introduced), continues to raise the ridiculousness stakes, and an epic gravy boat race (yes, that’s what I said) closes the battle magnificently.Jazzpunk, a nominee for the grand prize at this year’s Independent Games Festival, is a thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish. It shares some similarities with fellow IGF nominee The Stanley Parable in its ability to not just break, but smash the fourth wall, yet still remain exciting. However, where it stands apart from TSP, and the vast majority of other computer games to date, is its steadfast commitment to being absolutely mental.Too Much of a Good Thing?Of course, the off-the-wall nature of this title will mean that it will not be for everyone. If you are expecting an experience that follows traditional gameplay protocol then you will be confused, let down, and most likely irritated. Jazzpunk is wacky, in a way that is simply incomparable to anything else I have ever seen. It is an explosive compound of equal parts satire and slapstick, noir and nerd, sublime and ridiculous.On the whole, Jazzpunk seems to completely merit its reception as one of the best independent games to be released this year. In terms of replay-ability, it is very solid. Having completed the full-story twice, I was able to find plenty of content that I had missed on my opening play-through, which kept it fresh and engaging.The humour is likely to be hit-and-miss, based on personal preference. But, for this soul, Jazzpunk is an extremely funny and refreshing piece of work.http://www.pixeldynamo.com/reviews/2014/02/06/3554/jazzpunk-pc-review/ "

												One of the funniest and craziest games i've ever played!The game is short (it took me 4 hours to complete it and get all the achievements), but those four hours are filled with hilarious and sometimes akwardly funny jokes and situations.The game's plot is never really explained, instead you go through a handful of different scenarios where you have one specific objective to complete. Along the way you can interact with the objects in the world and that's where most of the gameplay revolves around, you interacting with everything you can. If you go straight for objectives you can probably complete this in less then an hour.If you've got a good sense of humor and got 4 hours to spare, pick up this beauty of a game and laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off all the way through!

												Jazzpunk had been a game I was introduced to soon after it came out and I was not disappointed at all. Comedy games aren't something you see everyday among all the triple A big budget games that are so popular. Jazzpunk was able to overcome those boundaries and truly come out as a good game. The game was short and only took about 3 hours to find everything and unlock every achievement but the game felt much longer as you continue to adventure on and search for every little Easter egg. The jokes were silly and somewhat juvenile at times while still retaining a charming wit that meshed well with the vintage aesthetic. 10/10 Would have a cake fight again.			"

												Very well done. A funny comedy game with a great visual style. Although it is short (~2 hours) there is plenty of hidden stuff and easter eggs to justify another playthrough. That being said $15 feels like it's a bit much, but if the price per hour doesn't bother you then get on this!			"

												8/10 gameCon: - Mouse and controls seem a bit clunky, even for this kind of game.- Psychotropic drugs aren't mailed to house to be consumed while playingI love this game so much! It's hilarious, I dig the music, the story is ridiculous yet good. Did I say the game was funny? I don't think I went more than 5 minutes so far without laughing. Priceless dialogue and imagery that makes you want to screencap basically the entire game.Best $4.00 I ever spent, hands down.			"

												A damn good game. Not long mind you but, it doesn't need to be. It's a full story with unique gameplay.The best way to explain Jazzpunk...Imagine If Philip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ian Fleming, & Hunter S. Thompson collaborated in a drug induced stuper (so the norm) on a trippy, witty piece of Cold War era spy quasi-fiction...(also the norm).Sadly,♥♥♥♥♥♥thought Fleming and Thompson were CIA and FBI agents. So he hid the manuscript in a hollowed out electric sheep lawn ornament.Some years later Ted Turner purchased the lawn ornament at an estate sale and asked for it be dropped off at the Williams Street offices while he was in the process of moving from Georgia to the Western Frontier.Fast foward to 2013, Some smuck at Adult Swim tripped over the sheep's power cord in the storage closet...breaking it and revealing the novella.and the rest is history.TL:DR; One of the funniest games & well written games I've ever played.

												Bad jokes, leddit gaemer culture xDxD references and 90 minutes of gameplay, not much more to say about this one.Oh wait, yeah. It's got a pretty solid art direction, like, top notch stuff. Reminded me a lot of Psychonauts in that respect. Sound design is also very solid, although the voices acting is kinda meh at times (to be more specific it feels like the voice distortion is borne more out of necessity than deliberation). The writing is... completely f*cking absurd, but that's the whole point, isn't it? All in all it's a nice effort, but terribly overpriced and suffer from the plague of many indie games coming out these days: lots of good ideas, too little time and money to make them work. Feels more like a student project than a commercial game if you know what I'm saying (saying this as a game design student in college). I r8 it 5/10, worth buying if it's like 75% off or in a bundle (like I got it).P.S.: Zoe Quinn did some stuff on it, voices and testing I think, just a heads up if you're one of those gamer gater people.

												I have said the word ""what?"" aloud more times in a single play through of this game than watching Inception.Gloriously confusing and uniquely designed, the charming cold war era world of conspiracy and espionage is a fantastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of old spy novels and movies.The gameplay is basically a point and click adventure game. Gather Items and clues to solve puzzles and advance the plot. While gameplay isn't particularily interesting, the oddity and context of many events makes it worth it.Also Hunter S.

												This is a fun short game.I wished that maybe they could have added a few more levels.The game leaves you wanting more .Which I feel is a good note to go out on.The price however .Well being cheep I go it on sale for half price which was worth it.If price is not a big deal go a head and pick it up now.Some people may not like the humor in the game .Also if you are looking at  the game and think god this looks ugly you may want to pass.  The game is not hard at all so if you are looking for challenge you won't find one . The game is just an off the wall goofy spy story . Check out jacksepticeye's videos for a more in depth look at the game. If you read this and say""I CAN'T STAND THAT GUY!!!""

The amount of charm, comedy and originality packed into this game is unparralelled. The cheeky little moments in a Rockstar game are all this game is made of.

												Jazzpunk is a very weird and different game that is pretty enjoyable as an comedy adventure. you play as a secret agent and do missions, and along with playing these missions there are side-missions or random things that happen thoughout the game. From swatting flys in a vase shop, to gravy boat racing, and weddingquake. This game is a game worth getting, but wait for it to go on sale. I don't think it is worth a $15 price tag, but is worth probably around $10, because of the replayability and shortness of the game.Rating in Numerical value would be: 9/10			"

And also, the Stereographic Polygony Soundeo™ and Colurvision™  really help set things off in the game. If you do finish it and get all the acheivements, there's a pretty good chance you haven't beaten up the car in the resort, or won in Wedding Quake. So, over all, you should get it. Unless you like serious games. Trust me, if you hate comedy games, you'll hate this.			"

JazzpunkThis is a pretty strange game to be honest, though in a good way, at least in my opinion. Although the cartoonish graphics are nice, and the storyline is okay, I think that the bad jokes and puns, combined with the side-quests and minigames scattered around really make this game.It's just so fun to explore and do things completely random and different; things you've never done before, like capturing birds so someone can bake a pie with them, or 'swatting' flies in a vase shop (you can imagine how that turned out).Jazzpunk is like nothing I have ever played before, and I highly recommend it.Although there have been a few issues with this game e.g. me being confused and using up an item that i was supposed to use to progress in the game (SPOILER-with the gravy granules within the Bachelor Pad Chapter I didn't read the text on the table, and didn't throw the granules in the water, instead I just used them all, and then had to re-play an area to get back).To conclude, I have greatly enjoyed my few hours of playtime so far. I may even replay this game at some point in the future, to try and find anything that I may have missed the first time while playing.10/10 - Odd, but a very unique game. And funny at times, too! :D			"
