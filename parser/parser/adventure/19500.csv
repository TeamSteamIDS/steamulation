												Well, this one was my first game on steam almost 5 years ago, it was a nice looking game back then, they promised 2 extra chapters free of charge, everything was great... but after all these years i can say this game is one of the worst games on steam, the controls are not perfect but they are slow and don't respond properly, the level design is onw of the worst things i've seen, you're gonna die mostly for the bad programming and design other that your own fault, the enemies have the same movements on every level, so they become easy to avoid, some others are simply jump and avoid, the history is non existent, even the game asks weird questions or the chat it's incomprehensible, but most important... after all these years the Chapters 2 and 3 are not available so the game is incomplete without them, sorry but the only good thing is the art, it's pretty, that's for sure, but everything else it's really really horrible, it feels more like an alpha game and not like a full game, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME SPECIALLY AT IT'S FULL PRICE			"

												Well, it is a pretty game.  Sure do wish I could see more of it.  Unfortunately, the cursor that is used for shooting on the only available level does not respond to the mouse movements;  it merely jitters about while the character moves back and forth.  I dig the painted, whimsical art style.  This should not be for sale anymore.  It's been out since 2008, and hasn't had any fixes (that I'm aware of).  I just tried playing it again, to little avail.  Fell through platforms and couldn't hit much with the shoot-wherever-lady.  Eternity's Child is truly broken, and could not only use a re-visiting by the developer, but it probably needs to be taken down entirely from this and any other store.  I can't believe the $4.99 price tag on it.  I highly recommend you don't, either.			"

												Years after purchasing it, I still feel burned by this game. Don't let the fabulous artwork fool you, this game will bore you, infuriate you, or both, depending on your patience level. Also, if you're like and thought the story sounded intriguing, know that it's barely present and features deeply pretentuous, unengaging writing that will have you ignoring it pretty rapidly. It's rare to see an indie game this disastrous actually get released. What's galling is that with a lot of polish it could have been something special, but it feels like the designers ran out of time, money, or patience and just threw it into the marketplace.No matter what you're looking for, this game will disappoint you.

												Eternity's Child is an indie platformer made by unknown studio Silver Sphere. The story revolves around... I don't know. The game starts with an intro in form of wall of text that is scrolling, and it's scrolling pretty fast, you won't get enough time to read it.So, let's speak about the story as how I felt it through the gameplay. You're something between bunny and elf, with emo bat-elf friend who is shooting laser balls. You are jumping through unique grotesque world full of weird mechanical enemies that are evil. To save the world, to get a heart of your lovely bat-elf and... whatever, you just collect gems with your girlfriend and shoot at mechs.Let's talk about gameplay. It's praiseworthy the developers put their time into their own engine but it's not much praiseworthy that it plays terrible. You control movement with keyboard, shooting with mouse, nothing surprising, but the whole movement and jumping feels bad - you are now sure of platform edges and objects react with a lag.Though the game is not even finished (and don't expect it'll ever be), it offers several levels that will make you ask your conscience for not doing anything else. It also has a level editor (beta), but I must admit, I didn't dare to try it.If Eternity's Child was supposed to be an art project (with removed gameplay), it could end up being pretty nice and interesting ""experience"". The environment feels weird but that's definitely something positive I can tell about the game. Sadly, there is also some confusing visual design on places - there'll be too many things on the screen and you won't be sure what's supposed to be platform (to jump on) and what's just on the background.Conclusion:Overall, this is one of the worst platformers I've played lately, it has terrible gameplay and unfinished content. Unique visual style can't save it when everything else is bad. Don't even think about buying it.			"

												This game is just plain awful. I really don't recommend this game. It's basically unfished it even has levels in the games code that were never used. The problem with this game is that they sold this with the promise of more content in the future. Then completely backed out and left this game unfished. There are actually menu options for these chapters and they're just blank. Essentially Luc Bernard sold us a game in beta and never finished it. Imagine buying a game in early access to then have the developer announce they weren't going to finish the game and just left you all with a buggy beta mess.Of course you ask: ""But what of the content that is in the game?""It's... average at best. The level design is not interesting at all and all levels are just ""find 3 gems and get to the exit."" If that sounds boring it's because it is. There is no story in this game save for some scrolling of text and then some poorly written, and unfunny banter between the two main characters in the game. I spoke to Luc Bernard about this before in the past, when his game had just been release and he claimed that the game was going to have a deeper story but his collegue thought it was ""too cheesy"" and so they dropped it. Oh wonderful.The combat is mostly just shooting some rather bland enemies with boring designs and poorly coded AI. Hell there is a robot bird enemy in this game that will stop chasing you or attacking you if you move past his ""activation point.""I hear what you're saying: ""But this game is just so gosh damn beautiful."" Absolutely. Excluding the poor monster design Luc Bernard has done some rather pretty artwork. But it's all ruined by the awful sprites. The beautiful mind that is Luc Bernard chose to stick with ragdoll physics instead of actual animation. Oh speaking of physics! Do you like falling damage in your 2D side scrolling platform games? Because Eternity's Child has it. So to sum up.-Painfully average level designs-Below average gameplay-Mixed presentation-Unfinished game Is it worth it for the price? No. Absolutely not. Don't even give this man money because he doesn't deserve it. Use your money to buy a better game on Steam. Because there are loads more better indie platformers and other games.			"

												For Sale: One (1) entirely unfinished game, abandoned by creator who could not bear the shame of what he created and ushered into the world. Menus still bear the scars of their birth, promising that the remaining 2/3rds of the game are <<coming soon>> four years later.Will throw in one (1) level editor to sweeten the deal, so you too can use the game's built-in platforms with WackyCollision™ and enemies such as ""Bat who splits into smaller/faster bats who split into even smaller/faster bats when THOSE are shot"" or ""♥♥♥♥♥-shaped robot fish who menaces you after stealing the diamond from Bejeweled"" to create the ending yourself! All this and more for only the low, low price of $5 and the sense of self-loathing and exhibitionism needed to advertise both buying and then creating more of this terrible, gutter-dwelling title!

												It's a nice game and has some interesting ideas like the very complex and badly explained shooting mechanics which allow for about 5 different kinds of bullets. The enemies are very overwhelming and hard to kill which is only more frustrating when you have to worry about dificult platforming. The level sometimes glitches out and doesn't end so you are stuck there until you lose all your lives.I would have liked more context. Every level seems to be be ""collect 2 gems"" having no idea why collecting a gem is worth risking your life against a hundred enemies. It's a very pretty world made with a lot of care but I would apreciate it more if I felt I was doing something there.It's also impossible to tell if you are damaging an enemy or they are immortal. Some enemies will follow you forever and take about 30 seconds to kill so you are forced to shoot anything you encounter for at least 30 seconds to find out if they can be killed. It is also very unfair since enemies will pop out of the ground beneath you making their attacks undodgeable and the platforming often has very little logic to it meaning a lot of trial and error and cheap deaths.It's not unplayable but there are too many issues for me to recommend it.

												This game is a love letter to every wannabe game designer who's played Mario and completely missed what makes it such a brilliant game. The jump physics are floaty and hard to control. The camera is sticky and often forces you into leaps of faith. Platforms are arranged with no rhyme or reason, and it's often visually ambiguous where you can stand and where you can't. Enemy AI makes no sense: sometimes swarms of enemies will gleefully dive-bomb you from off screen, and other times the same enemy types will sit perfectly still, ignoring you as you shoot them. You have health, but levels are mostly made up of insta-death pits. The story mocks itself and the game's arbitrary mechanics right from the first level. Even more embarrassingly, the first thing you see in the game is the fact that two-thirds of the game's content (the second and third acts) are listed as ""Coming soon!"", despite the game having been released seven years ago (as I write this). It doesn't matter what price point this game is offered at, there is no enjoyment to be had here.			"

												I never thought I'd play a modern video game that reminded me of Action 52, but here it is.I don't even know where to start with this terribly unfinished game. First: Who are these characters? What is going on with the story? IS there a story?? I found there is supposed to be a plain text crawl explaining the story & characters of this game (a lazy move on part of the designers there, one of many), but when the game starts, there is no such thing. Everything you do has no context as to why you're doing it. The bubbles that slowly describe the game's few controls on the first stage are so slow that you're trying to read these things as you're endlessly shooting stuff that wants to fly right into your face and at weird angles, even for a platformer. The controls are a total mess, you slide off platforms if you don't angle your blurry jumps just so, if you can see where you're jumping that is. The camera likes to stick on your character's position in such a way that you are often jumping blindly into who knows what, more likely than not, it's something that will kill you. Jumping is iffy at best with having to learn the trick to getting a decent jump without slipping off edges or even getting to a higher up platform. This would be fine if there was a way to grab platform edges, there isn't.I don't understand the point of having two characters to worry about if the one you actually move doesn't do anything else but that, the flying girl shoots at enemies & nothing else. This is really unnecessary & could have been done better with just one character doing these things.Many, many sections of the game, both while playing & in the menus, appears to be either really buggy, unfinished, or both. I'm betting on both. Even for an episodic game (which I can see why the sub-sequent chapters never saw daylight), there should have better effort on cleaning this game up, at least so someone knows wtf is going on when they start playing. Again, an intro would have been nice here. Another odd happening is that I got a totally different level 3 on later playthroughs, sometimes happening before I was done in the last area. No warning, just a new level out of nowhere. I even fell through solid walls a few times.I can say good things about the art style of this game, it's vibrant, pretty to look at & a gothic sort of cute. It's pretty much ruined by the camera motions & animation style they used in this game; very bland, lifeless & marionette-like. Plenty of other games pull off a 2-D world with life & emotion, why didn't this game?Seriously, save your money. Maybe buy this as a gag gift for a friend if it's on sale for $1. Try the buggy demo, but do -not- pay money for this disappointing and unfinished fragment of a game.			"

												This game is a slice of bad early Steam history, wherein a developer promised the moon, free DLC, and ran off in a huff when the game was panned. I imagine it's part of why Steam doesn't add indie games to its roster willy-nilly.Addendum, almost two years later: Ah, hahahahahahaha. Ha.			"

												The camera is unbearable unless you plan on going in one direction for a while. Moving your character around is very awkward and imprecise and the camera certainly doesn't help. At first I was a bit excited, but I quickly lost interest in the second level when I had one gem left to find. You'll get hounded with enemy fire moving back and forth trying to dodge and with the camera throttling so quickly in whatever direction you're moving, it gets annoying. Did I also mention the camera stinks?			"

												It has a nice style (but a style I don't really like), but that's all it has going for it. The controls are unresponsive which resulted in me dying several times in the first level to the point I didn't want to play it anymore.  Now, I don't want to brag, but for a hardcore gamer like me (don't laugh) these things shouldn't prove too difficult. I shall give it another try later on, but for the moment I'm sticking with these first impressions.[Rating: 57/100]			"
