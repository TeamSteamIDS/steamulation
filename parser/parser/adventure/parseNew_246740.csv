												I hate to write this review, I really do.  The world needs more serious horror titles like this that are story and atmosphere-based as opposed to action games with horror themes.  The problem here is twofold.1.  They forgot to actually create a game around the story.  Finding items precious to the orphans?  Fine.  Putting them on their graves to free them?  Awesome.  Putting those graves at random in a massive maze with very few identifying marks and no way to mark your progress?  Yeah, massive mistake. That's just not fun.  Using standard maze navigation tactics accomplish nothing, because you aren't looking for one goal or exit, you're looking for a dozen.  The no-inventory rule is fine as well, forcing you to carry one item at a time.  But ONLY if you can actually locate your destination.  2.  They lack the technical skill to make an engine that supports the kind of game they want to make.  It's clunky, and while it looks okay with details cranked up in the settings, the actual physics of it all are horrible.  You drop things at random, and have to scramble around to see where they fell among extremely busy textures.  You have no interactive options except with 'hot' items.  You can't move small objects to get around them, you can't jump, it's all very 1996.The end result is that it's just no fun.  The Huntsman is designed well.  I like the idea of the slow, inevitable stalker-like villain.  The story is interesting, the acting is good, the way the ghosts interact with your smartphone is clever.  None of that can counteract the tedious nature of the game.  It defies common sense and logic: if you were really trying to navigate a maze and were somehow incapable of carrying more than one small item at a time, you'd figure out SOME way to mark progress in the maze.  Breadcrumbs, whatever.  Drawing out a map.  SOMETHING.  Nobody would just wander around lost, repeatedly.  The building is full of potato sacks, but you never grab one to carry these items in.  It's all just a way to draw out what amounts to an extremely small game.  You could blow through this in two hours if you could carry more than one item.I wish the devs would have consulted with more experienced designers in the development of the game.  Just a handful of other environments, a smaller maze, and an increased limit of carrying such as three items would have made the difference between an atomspheric movie-you-play-through and a game that's effectively a spooky version of taking out the trash.

												I traded for this game because I was curious, and wanted to whet my appetite for horror games. Despite numerous negative reviews, I decided to take a chance.If you like walking simulators, mediocre voice acting, lengthy backstories, and gameplay similar to Slender Man (find items while evading a stalking enemy), then you might enjoy this game. Regardless, I advise you stay away from this one and save both your time and money - unless you manage to obtain this for free.The aesthetics are decent, but fairly bland - playing on the highest settings gives an average atmosphere, but nothing too fancy. The remake of Slender Man is much nicer to look at, if you care about that kind of thing. The music and sounds leave a lot to be desired - the voice acting is pretty horrendous and takes away from the game significantly. ""Only If"" is a free to play game that was a quick project, and the voice acting there is much cleaner and smoother than what you will find here. The story initially was provided as minute-long vignettes, but has been shortened to about half a minute (with an option to explore with more depth if you so desire) after the endless amount of complaints regarding the immersion-breaking audio narratives that forced you to stand and wait until each was completed (all the while a supposed ""Huntsman"" is stalking you). The controls are straightforward and the learning curve is minimal - you just have to find objects and return them to the respective tombstone while avoiding the Huntsman. During gameplay, your character holds a cellphone in landscape mode, and this really defeats the purpose of jump scares because many of these surprises occur primarily on phone screen - which occupies a very tiny portion of the lower right corner. At times, you may miss a potential scare because your attention is not always fixed onto the small phone screen.The gameplay is very boring and slow-paced, amplified by a small-ish map and lack of substantial things to do. Honestly, just watch a playthrough on YouTube and save yourself the trouble if you are that interested. Otherwise, I'd strongly advise you spend your time and effort somewhere else.Do not recommend,Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												I really don't want to write a negative review on this game, but after trying to get into it three times, and failing to do so every time, I just want to say something about it. I know my playtime is limited, and probably I should have spent more time in-game, but the truth is there are so much good games waiting to be played out there, that I couldn't force myself to spend more time with this one than I did.Huntsman: The Orphanage is a story-driven horror game with a large emphasis on exploration (some would call it a ""horror-inclined walking simulator"", if such a description made sense at all). The idea behind it all is VERY good on paper: arriving by accident at an abanboned orphanage, you have to discover what happened to the children, what horrors lie hidden in the strange, frightening place, and figure out how to ""set their souls free"". You can do this by finding one special item per child and placing it on their graves. Now that's a good idea behind any horror game, I'd say. The Huntsman referred to in the title doesn""t appear till later in the game, and since I didn't face him, I honestly can't tell anything about him.Now, while the concept might be promising indeed, the actual gameplay and especially the game-mechanics used, miss the mark by more than a mile. Using the flashlight of your cellphone to be able to navigate in the darkness is cool at first, and the clues and voices/images of the children appearing on the little screen are unsettling indeed. The problem is that there is no mechanic to store the clues you get (a journal), no inventory to place the different items in (there are twelve children/stories/items and once you pick up a new one, you drop the one you're holding in the spot), no map or other mechanic to help you orientate in the maze with almost identical rooms which the orphanage turns out to be. So most of my in-game time was spent walking around clueless, trying to find out more about the intriguing story but being unable to actually find any pleasure in playing.It's obvious that the developers took quite some inspiration from games like Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Dear Esther, but while these games got me hooked from the first moment, this one failed doing so, due to the problematic game mechanics. I do appreciate the fact that a game doesn't want to hold your hand and tries to offer a ""realistic"" experience, but truth to be told: if I were to stumble upon a place like this orphanage, I would run as fast as possible, and not look back for a second. Horror games are still games and not real-world simulations, and some useful game-mechanics are definitely necessary.Not recommended, unless you have played almost every other horror game out there and are desperately looking for more.

												Huntsman: The Orphanage is one of those very rare games that has an interesting idea for a game, and it works pretty well. It is one of those games that whilst you can watch people play it, the only way to really get the full experience of the game is to play it yourself. I also like how they take the sound of a ticking clock and make it something that you will learn to fear. I have lost count the amount of times I thought I heard it in game and breathed a sigh of relief when I realised it was the clock on my wall that I heard, Which to me shows how atmospheric the game is if they can make me get scared by my own clock. The stories that each of the characters have to tell also add to the games atmosphere. I honestly believe that these stories wouldn't look out of place in a movie as it is just so well told by each of the people that they got to play the characters in the game.And they have gotten a Ripley's Believe It or Not master to create the maze that the Huntsman calls home. And you will get lost in it, I have many times, I usually end up visiting the same grave 3 or 4 times as I look for the Orphan I am trying to free. Not to mention nearly jumping out of my skin as I turned a corner and there was the Huntsman making his way towards me in the maze. The Huntsman himself is a creature I have learned to love and fear. He is based on a Huntsman spider: Only he is a lot bigger and his prey is you.This is a rare gem of a game, with so many games out there going for the jump scare tactic. It is a nice refreshing change to play something that goes for atmospheric horror and really gives me the creeps whenever I play it. And for that, I thank ShadowShifters for giving me this game to play and look forward to whatever they decide to do next.			"

												You'll need a pencil and paper to take notes, and use graph paper to get through this one!  Seriously!  You need to map out a huge hedge maze that you have to find your way through 12 times to find 12 different graves, so be prepared!   You have to carry items to graves in the maze and can only carry ""one"" item at a time!  Then you have to go back to the house and get another item, go through the maze again, find a different grave, rinse and repeat!  It's so lame!!!  Keep in mind, each item goes on a different grave and you have to find the right grave for each item.  It wouldn't be so bad if you could carry all the items at the same time, but having to go back to get each item, then transverse the maze again is torture!!!  Even if you brought all the items to the entrance of the maze, it's going to be a long haul!!!There was one cool part in the game that was freaking creepy!  I had an encounter with the Huntsman, but I won't spoil it for you because it was so creepy and really cool IMO.  I never finished the game due to sheer boredom and frustration.  I warn you, if you buy this game, get the graph paper out before entering that maze! lol  I do not recommend this game, even at the sale price of $2.50 USD!  It can be very frustrating and so boring!!!			"

												It's rare to find a horror game that has no blood & violence but the prob with this game is that I don't like it. (I'm going to post my thoughts on why I don't like it).Cons: 1. It does a terrible job at making you nervous since the game's antagonist moves way too slow & does a lame life sapping technique if you look at him (Doesn't that sound familiar?)2. Your main character moves slow and your always tapping Shift all the time just trying to run (The running in that game feels like fast walking)3. The lack of names on the graves makes it annoying & time wasting4. The lack of exploration sucks too because the orphanage is too small in my opinion which has a short basement, 2 short floors & that annoying hedge maze which takes forever to figure out5. Finding Treasure and setting them on a certain grave kinda reminds me of a matching game except a more boring version of itPros:1. Really good voice acting on each of the characters2. The story is decentOverall I personally think this game is terrible but some people might like a creepypasta based game with no blood or violence but don't bother wasting $15 on this game (I'm sorry about the negative review but I just didn't feel it).

												Do not buy this game. I can't believe steam allows games like this. Even if this was a mobile app i would feel ripped off.This game consists of only one map and is smaller than the average counterstrike map. You simply have to walk around and find a dozen items. There is no inventory just your left hand, so you have to physically carry each item one by one. It's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There are no enemies no nothing, just this ""Huntsman"" guy who you die if you get too close to. He doesn't attack your or chase you or anything he just slowly walks around the map making a clicking noise so you know when to avoid him. Seriously the first time i saw him he was just standing there and he just looks ahead and i just stopped and was like.. wait.. this is why im supposed to be scared? Than all the sudden the main menu screen shows and it says ""start new game"" it really doesn't get much stupider than this. It really doesn't.The devs are very inexperienced and do not really know how to do anything for that matter. You can't physically open doors, they just float open like some sort of magic trick and you hear the doorknob turn. When you place items on the floor they sometimes just float in midair.There is no savegame or anything, you can spend an hour collecting items than just accidentally step within a 30ft radius of the hunstman and your game will just end.The graphics are mediocre, very bland and not sharp or high resolution textures.You can't open drawers, you can't open cabinets, its just a bare, boring, stiff house.No jumpscares or enemies or anything, just an occasional door slam sound.The tombstones you have to find are literally inside of a maze.. Like seriously? How is this supposed to be fun? it just makes you want to put your fist through your monitor..Oh and i didn't even get to the worst part, you have to click on these hanging portaits of each character which plays an audio file of their entire life story.. Literally there are some that are half an hour. No joke. Half an hour. And you can't stop it or run away from it.. You have to listen to a half an hour story and the second you think its over, there is a short pause and they start talking again, you will literally fall asleep at your computer. You are supposed to listen to their entire life story just to figure out which item is theirs.Stupidest game i've ever played in my entire life. Not only do i want a refund but i want compensation for brain damage having to listen to the dialogue in this stupid game.			"

												I'll just say this out front: This isn't a perfect game. I do feel that there are some things that were done right and some things that could use some improvement, but I'm also confident that any perceived negatives will be addresed by Shadowshifters.The game does a good job of setting up a creepy environment with a creepy backstory. If exploring an old, abandoned orphanage marred by an unexplained, supernatural tragedy doesn't give you a few chills, then you might want to check your pulse and make sure it's still there. The Huntsman himself is a creepy character too, although maybe based a tad too much on common creepypasta tropes in his appearance, but I'm largely quibbling on that one and have probably read too many creepypastas myself. The cellphone flashlight and screen are a nifty addition that makes you wonder why it hasn't been incorporated before in games like this. The flashlight mechanic is obvious, but the use of the screen is a very nice idea that can really enhance the genre. You may also wonder if the character is lugging a car battery in a backpack that's wired up to the thing, too, heheh. It's used to decent effect with some creepiness, although granted, I feel there's more potential in the idea than we currently see.That being said, I feel like this game could do more with what it has. More mystery would be very welcome. Handing much of the story over in narration isn't so bad, but I feel like feeding the story in smaller chunks via exploration and other means could have been a better hook. One item in particular was pretty difficult to find. The mechanics can sometimes be a bit too simplistic.However, I'm giving this game a solid recommendation based not only on atmosphere and some inspired mechanics, but also on Shadowshifters (the folks who made the game in case you didn't notice). They have been very active on the Steam forum for the game and have been very receptive and open to the community. I've reported a few bugs that were fixed within days. You are going to be very hard pressed to find that kind of open ear or dedication in any game company, big or small. Don't forget that this game only came out of early release status about a month and a half prior to writing this, so rough edges are still being smoothed and they're still expanding on the game and fleshing out further details. Some people have complained of low-quality textures and some rough sound effects. I thought so too when I first got this game, but before I even got through it I would fire it up and notice that I must've grabbed a patch, because they were steadily getting fixed. Better textures, better sound, bugfixes, adjustments to mechanics, and more have been pouring in for some time now and it doens't look like they'll stop while there are things left to do. The surprising rate at which they've been fixing bits and pieces (and hinted at some further expansion of the game overall) along with enthusiastic community interaction gives me great hope for Shadowshifters and the games they can make in the future. As such, I solidly recommend The Huntsman. It's good for some crawling skin and there's a great deal of further promise in the game and in the company who made it.Snag this game, turn out the lights, and have some fun. You might find yourself stopping any noisy, ticking clocks nearby when you're through for the night.			"

												The main problem with this game is it just plain boring. Very little happens and when it does, you feel cheated. The main selling points was the story and phone but neither of these seems compelling or used in a good way. What seem like random voices and videos on your phone seem so out of place and uninteresting. You can see what the developers where trying to do but the idea was executed very poorly which is a huge shame. Cannot recommend.			"

												As far as indie horror games go, this one could be worse. You walk the ill-lit halls and environs of the unfortunately-named Grimhaven Orphanage with naught but your cellphone flashlight and your graspin' hand to guide you. The graphics are pretty sharp and the atmosphere is nice and lonely... until the ghost messages start up. Every time you get near an important item or location, some kid will pop onto your phone and whisper spooky clues to you. They're little FMV clips of (I assume) the developer's friends that carry absolutely no weight and blow the solitary feel of the game all to hell.But even ignoring the clips, exploring the grounds gets tedious fast. Huntsman purports to be a ""non-linear"" game, which basically means they made huge, wide open fields of brush to get lost in, and put about a billion little useless siderooms in the orphanage. You have to find 12 mcguffins around the place but without knowing what they are (the kids are pretty damn vague sometimes) they can be hard to pick out of the piles of copy/pasted detritus infesting the rooms. You can also only carry one at a time, so if you put one down, you better take note of where you left it. I had no idea what to DO with them either, at least until I read up on the goal on the game's store page.The titular Huntsman is actually pretty cool looking, and his introduction was appropriately creepy, but I never actually saw him again after that. Of course, I just wandered around with a toy frog in hand for about 10 minutes and gave up, so I might not have given him the chance. Honestly, you shouldn't either.			"

												Pros: Good atmosphere, very interesting back stories for the orphanage children and staff (it could make for an interesting short film!).Cons: A little bit buggy. Picked up items have a tendency to randomly fall from your hand, for no discernible reason. The hunstman is hardly frightening (although the spooky atmosphere is pretty effective aside from that.) Weird things: The phone is clunky. Flashlight strength on it varies, and I'm not sure if that's deliberate, or just a weird -thing- that it does for no particular reason. Overall, I'd recommend the game if you want something mildly spooky without any really big scares, are interested in character stories, and want to kill a few hours. It's not fantastic, but it's a decent concept. Plenty of room for improvement upon the idea. If you're looking for something with seriously terrifying scares, this isn't going to have them. If you're pleasantly spooked by wandering around a mostly dark and abandoned region, with no idea what's coming, this is the game for you.			"

												I’m going to start off by saying, this game is made for people that prefer suspense and walking simulators as opposed to jump scares. This game is one of my go tos when I’m bored. It has amazing ideas and atmosphere, a very beautiful design, a great idea with story and characters, and one of my favourite monster designs. The monster is just alien enough for you not to figure out what he is at first, yet recognizable enough to make you know you have to run. His introduction scared the pants off me! I’d love to know more about him and the story they were hinting at.The game’s big pit falls, and reason for a majority of bad reviews, is the main quest of the game. It does fall into monotony and boredom very quick. You have to keep running back and forth in a very time consuming maze driven task. While the Huntsman does add paranoia and fear to the maze, he’s just the minor annoyance. A map, an inventory, or even more and better landmarks would solve this in an instant. I would love to see a bit more aggression to the AI to make him much more frightening. He doesn’t have to kill you with gore to be a serious threat.All in all, if you stay mostly in the first half of the game, it’s great, second half…not so much.			"

												Very interesting idea and the designer (an indy group) is very accurate with their ""more story than gory"" description of this game.  Zip - zero - nada blood & guts style ""horror"".  There is no violence in it but there is tense suspense as the huntsman wanders around, you can hear him.It is the story of an abandoned orphanage that became so due to the disappearance of many children over a hundred years ago.  You are a paranormal type investigator checking out the stories in the place as wander through the abandoned building and the grounds - which include a maze where the empty graves of the missing orphans are set.Going through it, I found more than 2 hours of voice acting and the stories of the 17 characters (12 children and the 5 staff who worked in the place)  and all the stories are interesting in their own way.  Lots of listening in this to learn the details of the stores as you hunt around for the pieces to free the trapped orphan souls.			"

												With the creator of this game spamming my activity feed right before Halloween, it just reminded me that I hadn't yet done a review on this game. Why? Because at the time I didn't want to say anything bad. Now I feel bad for my fellow gamers because I DIDN'T say anything. I'm sorry, guys. :(----I will note, my post may be recent but my review of the game is older. I haven't touched that game in over a year and I'll tell you exactly why...This game falls flat. Flatter than a pancake lost in time. Now originally I was hyped before it was Greenlit as I thought there'd be more to it. I even pre-purchased the original Halloween edition to show my support, esp for more content. I was very disappointed. And still am.It's just plain boring. The in-game audio-dialogue goes on for what feels like forever and it's designed to punish you for wanting to listen to it. When you hear that ticking getting louder, it means the monster is approaching and you have to flee. Because you abandoned the audio, you have to come back to listen to the whole thing all over again.I had to ask myself why: why would the creator do that? Why would they make us loathe the voice actors/characters because they took too long explaining their sob-story. The reason is, because it wastes time, and more ""X time in game"" statistics makes it a better sell on Steam.As for the 'monster', it is in my opinion the worst part of the game. And that's saying something...If you haven't seen it in the Store's preview yet, it's basically a 3' tall spider-chicken. It's not a scary thing towering over you in a sinister-like manner - nothing that brings chills up your spine or causes you to scream in terror when you see it. When it does find you, it meekly expresses itself in pantomime by swishing its pedipalps (claws) at you like a silent game of tag. That swish means you're dead, btw. Otherwise, the rest of the time you never see it but you hear it quietly ticking around the house as if it's lost its way. It shouldn't have been called the Huntsman, but rather the ""Meander-man"".Speaking of spider-chickens...As a farmer, I've had to deal with far scarier roosters in my lifetime. Ones that wouldn't hesitate to fly up to your face to peck out your eyes or tear into your jugular with their 3 inch long spurs. They could bring on real terror, and they were 2 feet tall at best! Of course, they were also easily dispatched with an axe. So why can't I use an axe on Mr. Spider-chicken? It would actually make the game somewhat enjoyable. Barely. Probably not.When I first saw the Huntsman in game, I laughed my butt off. It droped down from the mannequins in a ""Ta da!"" stance. It looked silly, and stupid. It glanced up at me from the ground as if to say ""I'm powerful because I have .kill command!"" Ugh. Laughter really shouldn't be the first reaction a player has over a horror game monster.To finish off I'll say this game is in my hidden list, along with the other junk I regret purchasing. Save yourself money and time, don't get this game. No wait, don't even accept it as a gift. And if a friend sends it to you, they probably hate your gutts.			"

												Recieved this game as part of a GreenManGaming bundle so figured id give it a try.The game has potential, Reminds me of a Daylight/Outlast style game when you are only given a phone or camera.The creepy little girl needs to be scary but the voice acting needs work as she kinda makes me laugh more.The scenery is kinda creepy, was always expecting something to jump out at me.Overall id give it a 6/10 but does need alot of work.

												I thought this game would be scary.  Turns out its really not.  At first the atmosphere is a little creepy, but theres not much to interact with.  Finding the first key to get to the maze was a huge pain.  I searched every room in the orphanage and I still didn't find it, I had to look up the location of it online.  The Huntsman is a windup-Spider-Puppet-Guy, who is really not very scary at all.  If he is in the house, he usually doesn't move from one spot.  You can always tell where he is because of the clicking noise, so it's easy to avoid him.  He moves very slowly and He basically doesn't attack you or run at you. When you are too close to him for too long your screen just starts fading to black.  So you lose if you stand next to him for like 15 seconds.  The reason I don't find it scary is because he doesn't seem very aggressive towards you.  He doesn't attack you or anything, I never feel threatened when playing the game like I do when I play other scary games.  The developers said that they made it this way because they wanted a different, less violent approach than most games, but I think that was just an excuse so they didn't need to put anymore work into making the AI smarter.  Overall, the graphics are pretty bad, you can't interact with much, and the game is not very scary.  Definitely, not worth $15, I'd say even $5 would be stretching it.			"

												Although it is scary in the beginning, it lose it very fast and become more fraustring then scary. I loved it for the first couple hours because the story is fantastic but it also lose it charm was you get into that stupid maze and you run into that chessy Huntsman, everytime I do i just want to push a button to hit the guy because he couldn't even scare a four year old, not that you'd want too, but still it was more scary when he was a nosie that always seem to be right behind you instead of this crap/doc dude from assassins creed, that just walks around the stupid maze ticking away and grunting, then when you finally run into him theres not much you can do so its game over. The most painful part is trying to figure out were the toys or objects belong. But I guess the real question is would I recommend this game to a friend it really would depend on the friend, if the friend was going after a game to scare the crap out of him through out the game heck no, but if it was a friend that like a interesting story and a challenge then yea I defeatly would. P.S. sorry for the bad grammer or misspelled words.			"

												after what seemed like a good start out, i quickly grew bored of all the scares in the game, pretty much laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off. The graphics are good however for a game such as this, however if you want a good horror game, look elsewhere this one will pretty much put you to sleep, thats how boring it was. i give it a 3 out of 10 for the graphics and zero replayibility.

												Firstly I'd like to thank the developement team for actaully doing a great job on the graphics even with the fact its not very resource intensive on your system. That being said; there is alot of glitches witht he rendering when i played this game at 1900x1200 Full Screen on my i7 3930k, 8gb DDR3, GTX 750ti 2GB system. Lots of artifacts on rendering on wall textures in the buildings and also very jagged egdes on shadows and lighting. The Physics of the game work very well; go watch your flash shining on a oject and casting a shadow, you will see the shadow move with your breathing. If you bump into some stuff they move like they have been smacked out of the way by the player. I believe this was intentional but if not please correct me. One thing baffled me was when i walked up the stairs, turned the corner and stood next to the banister (which should stop you falling off the landing onto the stairs below) i was able to walk through this and fall down the stairs.The storyline was mediocre and too easy to do. Im guessing this was purely a story to get the game moving in developement and test run it.If this was to be the only storyline in the final game then i would have to recommend never buying the game and order refunds. That being said its not a bad story its just way too short. I honestly never finished the game but then half the time i wasnt able to do anything with the character e.g Open Doors didnt always work; If they wasnt supposed to then why did it offer me to open those doors with the symbol on screen?.Positives of the game so far do outweigh those of the negatives. I may have not said much about the positives personally but thats because i believe i shouldn't tell everyone the games secrets and beauty; I believe you should go and find out for yourself!My recommendation is: If you havent bought the game then id say buy it and support a new company to develope a game which has potential. You may be slightly disappointed by the current lenght of the game though you will have to remember its a working progress and just enjoy the wonders as they are implemented into the game. If you have already bought the game id like to say to those people dont give up on the game. Take your time to write reviews for the game and make suggestions for the game itself.I hope all in all this reveiw wasnt too negative and i believe the positives still outweigh that. so guys and girls keep playing and Devs carry on the good work!Thank you for your time reading my review			"

												Huntsman: The Orphanage is a game about an orphanage whose children have apparently been murdered and their souls trapped in a dark sort of purgatory for the amusement of a demon known only as the Huntsman.  You're investigating the events surrounding the massacre and both attempting to put the pieces together, as well as find a way to save the 12 orphans' souls.This is what I get out of the plot, anyway.  The game is an exploratory horror game, similar to Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  You first have to make your way to the orphanage, then you're tasked with finding the way insde.  Your job is to explore both the orphanage itself and the surrounding areas, learn about the staff and the children by playing back the recordings within their portraits, and find the items necessary to free the doomed children's souls.  On paper, this is a great idea; however, there are some major problems with its execution.Roaming around is fairly straightforward, but instead of walking, jumping, an ducking, you walk, duck, and lie down altogether.  There is no jump mechanic whatsoever, though you can also run when necessary.  Lying down seems to have little use, though it helped me find a single item.  For much of the game, there isn't even anything to run from; at least in my playthrough, the Huntsman didn't appear until quite late, though this probably has something to do with my approach.  The problem is that it's sometimes very difficult to identify a specific item you need.  Unlike in Amnesia, there is no visual indicator whatsoever as to whether you need an item until you point the crosshair over it.  If you can use the item, you click to pick it up and carry it--literally.And this is one of the biggest problems with the game.  You hold your cell phone (used as a flashlight and a one-way communication device) in your right hand (as well as the key, once you find it) but can only carry one item at a time in your left.  There is no inventory system of any kind; whatever item you pick up has to be carried until you either figure out what to do with it or decide to set it down somewhere.Additionally, some of the clues for locating which items you need are very cryptic, especially with a child named Min-Min. While it's fairly straightforward to determine WHAT she needs, actually FINDING it is extremely difficult.  At least for my brain, the riddle you're supposed to solve is far too cryptic.  There are even some red herrings in the game, a few items that are essentially useless, yet there's nothing in the game that suggests what they can be used for.  Whether these are objects meant to be used in a later revision that simply has never been released is unclear, but they add to the overall frustration that is the endgame.And what an endgame it is!  Once you have identified the items you need and the children they belong to, you have to avoid the Huntsman in a forest maze that is so large as to be virtually impossible to map out with any efficacy.  The game's lush graphics actually are a BAD thing here; the forest maze is so highly detailed with overgrowth and underbrush that it makes actually figuring out where you're going almost impossible.  The maze is so long and has so many twists and turns that you can wander around aimlessly for half an hour or longer without ever finding what you're looking for.  There is no mapping system or even a compass, and clues from the kids over your cell phone come so infrequently and are so vague that they might as well not even be there.The lack of an inventory system is the most punishing in this segment of the game.  Because once you've finally located the correct grave for an item and left it for the child, you have to make your way back out, pick up another item, and do the same thing again.  You have to do this TWELVE TIMES.  By the time I got to the fourth of fifth item, it became so incessantly maddening that I contemplated just abandoning the game.  But I wanted to at least finish it, which I finally did.  But in all, it took something like 7 1/2 hours just for me to deposit the items on the correct graves--and that also included having to go back and locate two items I simply could NOT find after discovering the afore-mentioned red herrings.  If you could at least carry SOME of the items in an inventory of, say, six slots, it would be more fair.  You could try to take six items with you, deposit them, and then collect the rest and do it all in just a few trips--assuming you could at least find your way around.Even the Huntsman himself is uneven.  I had two basement deaths that I didn't even understand.  The Huntsman was just THERE, with no warning, and he killed me as soon as I made line-of-sight.  There was no chance to escape; he doesn't have to actually touch you to kill you.  The second death, by the way, was when I was back inside exploring for items, when he was supposedly still out in the forest maze!  My final death was in said maze after simply coming into his view again; I again had no way to escape.  However, several other times, I either touched or came very close to touching him, and I was able to turn tail and run before he killed me.  A couple of other times when I came upon him, I tried lying down in pitch blackness and turning off the flashlight like I would in Amnesia and was able to escape once he passed by.  However, whether this is actually a consistent strategy or just another symptom of the uneven encounters is unclear.  Additionally, you can apparently get behind him with the flashlight shining right on him, and he won't even turn around and come after you.  There are just so many quirks with his AI and what it takes to survive or to be killed that you don't know really how to deal with him.All of these flaws add up to a game I just cannot recommend.  While the game has nice touches--graphics, sound, and a self-writing chalkboard that gives you hints if you watch it for awhile--they don't lift it up enough to make it a worthwhile experience.  Which I think is a shame in a way, because this is a good concept on paper, and if something were done about navigation in the forest maze, more straightforward clues as to what needs to be collected, an actual inventory, and the Huntsman's overall behavior, I think this would be a solid title.  As it is, though, I cannot recommend it to the vast majority of gamers.4.5 out of 10			"

												Theres not too much that can be said about this game right now, Its a w.i.p with alot of potential. I hope they'll add achievements, though it doesnt seem too likely. So far the orphanage has been pretty creepy, if only there was a goal or something while its currently out now. its been out long enough to atleast have 1-2 objectives, cmon guys put out.			"

												This game is bad for two reasons:1) It isn't clearly indicated to you at the beginning of the game that ""F"" turns on your phone's light.(This can cause you to fumble around in the beginning, not realising, if you overlook the controls on the main menu. Why not just have it on as default? After I found the button I don't think I ever turned it off for fear of not being able to see again.)2) There is no inventory system. This makes traversing the maze annoying because you must be carrying the specific item for the path you are traversing and make sure you remember where you left the other items. At this stage of the game I couldn't be bothered continuing. Had there been an inventory system I probably would have finished the game rather than searching YouTube videos to avoid frustration and a waste of time.Thankfully, this game was granted to me in the Halloween sale for free. In my opinion it's not quite worth the money they're asking for. Even if there had been an inventory system I still wasn't missing out on much after the point I had gotten to.Originally, this game looked promising but honestly it's sub-par. The game itself is too short, the story is too fragmented and honestly it just feels like something is missing - after playing the game for a while it just isn't any form of scary that it's trying to be.However, I like the idea of games in the story-driven no-guns ambience horror genre and should they make a game that is full-length, more creative in the ways that it scares the player and polishes up its minor flaws whilst making the storyline flow better (it would have been better if we were lead to each child in a specific order, where the first child sounds inviting and by the time we hear the last child we fear for our lives - this kind of story progression would be good) then I would try it.It's good for maybe 30 minutes of playtime (if you know what you're doing) and worth £2 max in my opinion.

												My playtime with the game has been short but this is one of the better horror games avalible, its ambience is great, the story is intresting and it doesnt rely on jumpscares. What most people fail to see is that this game offers you the chance to get the whole story before playing which is nice since the main gameplay involves running back and forth from a maze hunting tombstones. The maze itself is probably the best idea i've seen for a horror game as maze's are ment to be confusing to navigate and this such maze will confuse you to the point of getting lost with the huntsman after you. The walking and running speed could be better then again it my by involantary stealth to avoid the huntsman. Plus his constant ticking makes you doubt that upcoming corner or him popping out of a path in the wall you can't see till you get further down said path. The maze itself is not just a cube splased with normal maps and textures like most 3d gamemazes, it actually looks like a hedge a iv scared myself from the bits of the hedge that stick out.The Huntsman design is excellent i completley didnt expect it and i killed myself by accident just trying look at it on all sides. The huntsman's in-game reach is abit off though as he can get you about 5 steps away which needs to be fixed along with the 3-5 minute death scene. Basically if you die you have to watch a floating phone for a bit before credits rock up. Not bad the first time but each time is annoying and is a pain as i havnt found an actual skip button.The objectives arn't ground breaking since they are find and place quests but are much more fun and difficult thanks to the maze and the huntsman.Overall this is one of the better horror games, it has some problems that are minor and are doesn't force the player to go through a gauntlet of jumpscares but more originality than anything.All Horror games lose that ""horror""element after 2 or 3 plays and have to resort to jumpscares to fix it. It happens here but they don't add jumpscares to keep it up. It shows they trust there game enough to not cheap it out like several triple A games such as ""Outlast""or""Slender The Arrival"". Truly one of the most original horror games on steam.			"

												Amazing horror experience ,good voice acting and atmosphere Huntsman : the orphanage is a first person survival horror focused mostly on exploration from the get go every door in the creepy abandoned orphanage can be opened and the game allows the player to roam around freely (and so does the huntsman).the game can be labeled as an open world and by open world l mean u can visit any location ( inside the orphanage) there're a few locked doors but once u find the master key they become unlockable in less than 8 minutes in.the monster design is one of the best l've seen in survival horror titles so far			"

												Not a good game. At all every aspect of it falls flat, graphics, sound, pacing, design. Just a bad game, pick up outlast and/or amnesia (even a machine for pigs) far superior games.Here, I'll slap my first reply up here to help quanitfiy how bad this game is:The graphic design is bad. I don't know how much further you want me to qualfy that for an indie game that wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't also for how poorly animated everything is. The sound was recorded poorly, and is balanced horribly speach that pops up is at whispered levels while a slight wind buffetting a house sounds like a hurricane.The game goes long stretches of nothing only to show you a monster who stands stock still and talks (whispers) at you for a minute or two before vanishing.It is a terrible game. I don't care if you trust me (and why would you fully trust anyone reviewing a game, everyone is biased in some way you dolt)Go ahead and buy it though. Apparently some people enjoy quick cash in ""horror"" games.			"

												This game is garbage. Seems to rely entirely on jump scares, and is incredibly frustrating to play. The walk speed is ludicrously slow, and even the run speed takes forever to get anywhere. The darkness makes it hard to see anything, which also makes it hard to figure out where you are, so you spend a lot of time very slowly wandering around places you may or may not have already been over. And there's no clear objective - I guess you're meant to find each ghost's item and take it... somewhere, but it's not clear where. Also, you can only carry one thing at a time, so you'll probably have to remember where things are and come back for them. It's just really slow and dull.			"

												30 minutes in, can't say I'm impressed. The videos on the Steam page seem to handily not show the poor textures littered throughout. Some textures, like the doors, are decent but there were many muddy, low-quality textures making it look like a very old game, and not in a good way. Can't help but feel this game would've been better off being an HL2 mod. The game doesn't lead you around in a very convincing manner. It's possible to walk around and just see nothing for ages. I like non-linearity, but there needs to be hints imo of where the ""exciting"" stuff is. Instead you're following strangely arranged fences, or wandering blindly it seems. The main screen gives you a goal, but it's not presented well in game form, as well as NO mention of the controls ingame! That hedge maze sounds interesting in the steam description, but is there a path to it? You can only see a few feet, so navigation is a bit annoying. The voice acting varies between OK and unconvincing. There's even a cheesy poet in there... yup. If you're scared by creepypasta, this game may do it for you, to some extent. I'm very difficult to scare, so I'm not a good measure for scary, but it wasn't really entertaining me much either. Felt kinda B-movie. Aaaand bugs - the main reason I stopped playing after a short time. Several external walls and fences seem to have trouble deciding to exist. A few places walls didn't render until I faceplanted into them... which was strange, as they seem to render fine on the phone camera view. Also I think I may have managed to lose an item through the floor, or the weird shrinking objects seem to do when dropped in this game just made it too small to find. The fullscreen mode doesn't lock the mouse to the window, which is very annoying for people who use dual monitors. There's no (easy access to) a borderless windowed mode either. Find the offer of a bordered windowed mode a strange choice for a horror game, as that tends to detract somewhat from immersion. Controls. Walking is too slow imo. The run speed was a decent pace for me, so would like a perma-run setting. Picking stuff up felt a little awkward, thanks to the animation. There's no inventory in the game, but there's items to move around, and it felt frustrating having to drop one thing, just to pick up another. When you ""use"" an empty space with an object in hand, the guy drops it and does lead to accidentally dropping stuff when you didn't intend to.  The animation is ambiguous when looking straight - it almost looks like he's pocketing it to me, which got me confused the first time. It would be good to have a seperate key for drop, and for the animation to either include looking where the item dropped or the ""deus ex"" style seeing it drop in front of you. The two items I placed down seemed to shrink once dropped, which made them awkward to find again, which is not something I like doing.... the PC needs to invest in a coat with pockets! Kinda glad I didn't find what use the stuff was, as it's slightly annoying to remember where you dropped stuff. All in all, this felt like an early access title or a mod to me. I feel there was an interesting idea there, but the game lacks a lot of polish to really make it work.			"

												Do I really have to sit and listen to dozens of sob stories and get chased around by a Muppet? With sluggish controls and not enough light. Why does the monsters always have to hide in the dark? This game is chock full of lazy cliches, which would be great if you're into that sort of thing. This game would have been amazing on the original PlayStation sold in a bundle with Nightmare Creatures. This is getting a very generous 1 out of 5 stars ★☆☆☆☆.			"

												Hello everybody, my name is Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) and I'm the writer of a game review and article website known as Universal Gaming Reviews. This is my review for Huntsman: The Orphanage. The game definitely has a fairly creepy atmosphere and the stories/voice acting is very well done. The FMV horror sequences are also a plus and gives it a sort of edgy feel to it. The game definitely won't be for everybody and may bore most people early on in the game but if you're a die hard fan of horror games and are looking for a more old school style horror game to play then this is a fairly good choice. Thanks for reading folks, happy gaming!You can read our full review here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/2013/11/huntsman-the-oprhanage-overview-review/ "

												Huntsman: The Orphanage.It's a fantastic game, scary, tense, with a incredible story line and voice actors. It's horror without violence, without blood and gore, it makes it even more scary, you're not worried about dieing, you're worried about something darker, there are things worse then death.The game has nice graphics for an indie game, the mechanics work well and the triggers on all the Orphans are just fantastic, you can sit there for hours just listening to the stories, which each have a compressed version and a full version. The maze is difficult, but it promotes thought and tactics, drawing maps, talking with friends, all that kind of thing!The downside would have to be that the jumpscares are not always random, especially the Huntsman himself. He can be predictable whilst hiding in a room.All that being said, the game is getting a MASSIVE revamp, which is going to make things a LOT more scary, tense, fast paced and frightening. It's something that I""m really looking forward to.So I want to know guys, if you have the game or have just seen pics and watched the trailer, what are your opinions? What do you think is good about the game, and what do you think isn't?			"

												It feels more like a walking simulator a la Dear Esther than a horror game and a short one at that. Scares are few, if any. In fact, I'd call this game boring. All you do is lug around a number of items and watching clips on your îngame phone that try to evoke the creepy child trope, but comes off so forced and clichéd that its more annoying than anything. There is no sense of urgency or tangible threat while doing so, as the titular Huntsman is easily avoided. To compound these issues, the map is small and visually unappealing in both technical and aesthetic aspects, with level design that might make sort of sense from a real life perspective, but makes for a poor game. Overall a below average, quite dull experience that might provide a momentary distraction for some, but falls completely flat for anyone who ever played some of the far superior horror games out there.

												Nice idea, but rather repetitive.I enjoyed parts of this game. The concept is top hole and the atmosphere is great. The stories of the children are really good and it is worthwhile going to the basement and listening to the full versions. This adds to the atmosphere immensely. It's a shame the full versions aren't in the rooms where there is just a very short story. However, I found the maze a real pain and doing it once was torture, but the same thing again and again was crazy. If you could carry more than one thing it would be ok, but padding out the game by making the player go back and forwards so much is really tedious. Also, some of the graphics had issues as I would get stuck in walls in parts and in others, especially just outside the house, the walls would be sometimes invisible, but still there. The huntsman himself was a bit annoying, but nothing too much to worry about.This title would have been brilliant as a pure adventure, without the repetitive fetch quests and the arcade bit of the huntsman.So, this game had some good areas, but the tedium of the fetch chores back and forwards through the maze sp[oilt it.As the price is low, I'll recommend it, but would give it a score of 2.5 / 5 as it stands.
