AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Mechanic Escape Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Platformer; Action; Unforgiving My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre REVIEWMechanic Escape was a pleasant surprise for me.  It is a reaction and path-learning based platformer with rouge-like elements (no checkpoints in levels).  Once you beat a level, though, you can move on.I usually can’t stand rouge-likes, because having to start over from the beginning after playing for an hour+ doesn’t appeal to me.  Fortunately the levels in Mechanic Escape are each only about a minute long, so even when you mess up: it isn’t that bad.  It does a pretty good job of being difficult without being overbearing.  Masochistic gamers out there may disagree and may find this game too easy, but I felt this game was just the right amount of challenging.  It toes the line of challenging and downright frustrating, while staying on the better side.There will be frustrating moments though.  About 80% of the times you die it will be because you made a mistake—usually due to the fact you are still learning the proper path through a level.  10% of the times you die it will just be due to the luck of the draw, as there are instances where an enemy attack will be unavoidable due to randomness. And the final 10% are the truly frustrating deaths: those where your character does something you didn’t want due to the minimalistic control scheme.  The most annoying example of this is that jumping next to a wall will cause you to wall-jump backwards always, even if you don’t want to.  Some games require you to push the directional button towards the wall to execute a wall jump, and if you don’t then you will just jump normally… which gives you more control.  In Mechanic Escape, there is no way to jump next to a wall without wall jumping—it doesn’t matter which way you aim the direction.  There are other examples as well, but that one was the most egregious for me.There are 4 worlds with 20 levels each.  The first 2 worlds are pretty easy.  Towards the end of world 3 and throughout world 4 the levels begin to get quite challenging and will probably require a few dozen tries to get it right.  But even the hardest levels can be beaten before it gets to the point of tossing the controller out the window.  The graphics are on par with what you would expect from a modern indie platformer.  The music is decent, but pretty unvaried.  And there is no story really, just a theme.In summary, I would say if you are interested in getting a taste of rouge-lite, challenging platformer action, but don’t want a game that’s so over-the-top it will have you pull your hair out: then check out Mechanic Escape.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Now before you think I dislike the game, I don't...I just can't recommend it fully for a few reasons which I'll outline in this review. Overall, I'd probably give the game an 8/10 for the first half only, but a 5/10 overall.Mechanic Escape is a fun little Super Meat Boy-esque platformer in the sense that it is very trial and error. For the most part, when you die it is entirely your fault as the player. It takes skill and dexterity to get through the levels. Again, for the most part.The story is pretty lax. There's a tiny movie at the beginning and the end. Basically, you're a TV and your TV buddies are captured. You collect them and free them from captivity. That's it. Where it shines, though, is the style. The artwork for it is beautiful and I really enjoyed the general look of the entire game. Some areas seemed to pop more than others and being stuck in certain worlds made me grow tired of their appearance, but for the most part it was a lovely looking game.Gameplay is where the game both shines and falls flat. Chapters 1, 2, and the first half of 3 were great. The controls felt tight and responsive, though there were some minor pitfalls. The second half of Chapter 3, however, introduced a lot of segments where you have to float upward while avoiding walls, spikes, etc. The problem with this is you are floaty. Too floaty. Nudge right or left fly halfway across the screen floaty. The worst offender is the finale of chapter 3 which may be the hardest level in the game by far. There were 2 or 3 of these air sections in total and they really got on my nerves by the 40th death or so. Note that before this level, the most deaths I've ever gotten in one level was 21 and I would not move to another until I 100% completed it by collecting all the TVs.Level design was hit or miss. Some levels were awesome and harkened back to platformers of yore. My favourite addition was put into the third chapter and was well welcomed by myself and I'm sure anyone who played Donkey Kong Country...barrel cannons! These were utilized well and one level in particular used them nearly exclusively. That level may have been my favourite in the entire game. Where the level design fails, though, is when it relies too much on making you wait or keeping you moving. Almost every level has a boss enemy that chases you. These enemies are unkillable and never stop, so you must keep moving, too. Add onto the completely broken mechanic of there being laser gates that open and close at set intervals and pillars that can smash you and occasionally you're thrown into many unwinnable situations. Sometimes beating a level is more luck based than skill based since the timing isn't always 100% the same each time you reload.I also noticed frustrations in controlling your character that didn't matter much in earlier levels but did a TON in later ones: walljumping is performed by being close to a wall and pressing the jump button. Your hitbox is large. A lot of times you will walljump without meaning to and cause your own inadvertent death. Second, any button at all triggers the Kong barrels. If you are running into one and do not let go of the direction button in time, you will be shot out in an instant. This has caused me some unneeded strife in later levels.There's also a few glitches in the game, too. One that can be both good and bad depending on how its used is some objects do not obey pausing the game. For example, there are turrets that shoot insta-kill fireballs. If you pause the game, the fireballs still travel forward. So too do the smashing pillars raise and lower and the laser gates open and close. This is a horrible design choice if you expect the player to have to pause for any reason. I had to go take a bathroom break halfway through a level in Chapter 4 only to unpause the game and die before I even see what happened. After experimentation, I find out the glitch I mentioned above. Honestly, it wouldn't have hurt to know earlier both to avoid deaths like that and to maybe even the playing field when it comes to those levels where you both have to constantly move but paradoxically wait for a path to open up.Finally, let's talk about achievements. The ones in this game are really easy to get and if you beat the entire game, you WILL get all of them with the possible exception of the 1000 deaths one. (I had to spam kill myself after beating the game to pick it up). This is all well and good, but there is NO reward for beating the game. Even worse is that the collect x amount of TVs achievements will be maxed out by 100%ing chapter 3, making chapter 4 almost pointless to play unless you really enjoy the game. And by that point, you won't. If you do druge on like I did and 100% the entire game, collecting all TVs and conquer all 80 stages, you are greeted with a short cutscene saying ""The End, Thanks For Playing"". This is the very same scene you get for just beating the levels without collecting all TVs. In other words, there is no incentive to actually 100% the game. You'll have all the collection achievements by the end of chapter 3 and all the unlockable costumes by the middle of chapter 2.In conclusion, for completionists this is a terrible game. The glitches and the control gripes make 100% clearing it a chore and you are given nothing in return if you do. For the casual platformer fan, though, this could be a nice diversion or alternative to other games out there. For the price, I do feel it's mostly worth it, but I can't really recommend it as the flaws outweigh what's great. I liked the game, but after about 75% of it I began to tire of it and only continued on to see what it had to offer. I made it that far, might as well complete it. But I was only met with disappointment and a longing for something a little more polished.			"

												Hardcore platforming goodness right here. Mechanic Escape is fast-paced and fun. You control a little TV-looking fellow who has to jump, fall, swing from ""vines"", shoot itself from cannons, and float on air curents, all while dodging tons of environmental hazads and giant robot nemeses my sons and I dubbed Factors. At the same time, you're trying to pick up as many of your little TV friends per level as possible. There are fifty small and five large TVs to collect in each level.Almost every level requires a bit of trial and error, and memorization of all the little ins and outs and change-ups of the layout. Luckily, it rarely gets too frustrating because the levels are so short, with each taking around a minute to complete. So even if you die, you're usually only seconds away from getting back to where you were. The game starts out fairly easy, but the difficulty increases steadily.  A nice feature is that normally if a level is too punishing (and there are some that have taken me dozens of tries) you can skip trying to collect all the TVs and just take the straight route through to make it easier on yourself.On top of that, the game has a delightful art style, with crispy, bright graphics. This is a great game to take in short bursts of maybe 30 minutes or so at a time, because there's really no story, and you can just pop in and complete a few levels then shelf it for a few days before coming back.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a challenging platforming.			"

												Nice casual platformer that focuses on trial and error. The controls are tight and the level design is very good. The difficulty curve feels just right and the achievements tied to the game are on the casual side.The game gives you a solid 4-6 hours of content with 3 extra unlockable outfits as you progress through the game. I'd say $5 is a fair pricepoint seeing as several other platformers within that range can be completed in less time.4/5 "

												A shocking good time. Very addicting, yet very frustrating. If you die, you start from the beginning of the map. You can't go slow or the evil bot will kill you. You can't go fast or you will miss a jump and die. Either way, you're going to die eventually lol.			"

												I've played an hour of Mechanic Escape (video link below) and completed the first world (20 out of 80) levels and I can say this is a solid platforming game. The controls are tight, the graphics are wacky, some great level design in some places (some annoying designs in others) but overall this is a great platformer, especially for the price. The difficulty was ramping up nicely towards the end of the first world, supposedly the rest of the game gets pretty hard. If you enjoy platformers, this is worth every cent.

												So fundamentally mediocre that it can't possibly be recommended.1. Bland level design. All 90 degree angles so there's a limited scale of what's possible and the 80 levels tend to not have anything unique about them. As well, most of the added mechanics don't add much to the game. The cannons have about two levels where they do anything, and the circuits literally add nothing.2. Bad level design. A lot of the levels are seemingly designed to let you keep moving without stopping, but then a fair number of them actually tend to have collectibles placed in a way that isn't quite natural, forcing a lot of awkward jumps that makes things far harder than necessary; levels where I died the most tended to have this exact problem.3. Unfair gameplay elements. Two of the three ""boss"" monsters have attacks that are often luck-based whether or not you can work around them. The missiles can kill you through no fault of your own in narrow corridors or forced jumping sections, and lasers and tight corridors just never mix. The bosses often seem shoehorned into the levels simply because every level is obligated to have one, and the levels aren't designed with them in mind; especially the case with timed elements that can often force you to wait /during/ chase sections. Eugh.4. Bad controls. The character is the lightest, floatiest platformer character I've ever seen. Jumps are from HOLDING the jump button, not pressing it, so you often end up wall-jumping off places you didn't mean to. Cannons fire when ANY button is pressed, not just the jump button, leading to many cheap deaths. Poles only let you jump in the direction you're facing, which is not always the direction you're pressing for some odd reason; especially painful in that one level where you have to jump between two poles with a boss chasing you.There's just not much to like here, it's so bland and incompetently designed; the only challenge comes from how poorly some sequences are set up.Also, a nitpick, but the achievements are kind of dumb as heck too. You can 100% this game without playing past the third world. On the opposite side, dying enough times for the last achievement takes serious effort.			"

												In this semi-hardcore platformer you assume the role of Mech, a tv on a mission to save his friends and escape the ruthless machines. It's a very simple platformer with basic controls, you move around and jump. At first the controls felt a bit ""floaty"" but it only took a couple of minutes to get used to and after a few levels it felt really solid. You speedrun through the levels and collect tvs, it's a great and simple concept.The levels are really well made and even if I missed some collectibles along the way it didn't really bother me. Since the game is so fast paced I didn't mind retrying a level a couple of times until I could collect everything.The downside to this game is that it feels abandoned in a way. It times your run on each level but there's no use for it really. The lack of leaderboard is a dissapointment because it has the potential to offer some real good competition and replay value. The other thing are the achievements, they are just one big grind. I'm not surprised that the most rare achievement is ""Die 1000 times"" because you probably won't play the game again after you finish it. There's no reason to keep collecting all the tvs either after the third chapter because at that point you already got the achievement for the collectibles. But then again, not everyone is obsessed with achievements (Don't judge me!).So if you enjoy platformers, you like to go fast and you're not too obsessed with the lack of achievements and leaderboards there's a good chance you will enjoy this game!

												Mechanic Escape is a very solid platformer! It's very linear and rhythmical, where timing is more important than actual mechanical mastery. Think more Rayman, less Super Meat Boy (the iOS Rayman, anyway, never played the others).Every obstacle is designed to be easily surpassed if you time everything right, making it easier the faster you go. There are collectibles in each level, but they generally serve as a guide/help, instead of a hinderance. There are 50 little guys spread around, almost delineating the optimal path. Then, there are 5 bigger ones that are usually in alternate paths, but are just as fast as the normal paths, only you need to pay attention to where they may appear. There are 80 levels, spread out on 4 worlds. Every level is beaten in about 40 seconds and there are no checkpoints in each level, you have to beat it all in one go. You can only jump and run, basically. The running could have even been scrapped (again, iOS Rayman) and the little guy run automatically, since you can't really stop, most of the time.However, there are lots of different obstacles, slowly introduced as you progress. They're introduced elegantly, usually in a harmless manner, as a warning.There's also a Boss of sorts in every level. In certain sections, that Boss pursues you, sometimes even shoots bullets/lasers at you. This is a very limiting obstacle, making it almost impossible to stop and think before starting another challenge. It is good, sometimes, keeping you on your toes! It's a pressure point of the level.Later on, however, it can be frustrating and very, very limiting, to the point that you'll die dozens of times before pulling everything off perfectly.The first 3 worlds are really enjoyable! Everything is well timed and fun to go through. The last world is a huge spike in difficulty... I was halfway through the 4th world with less than 600 deaths. The last 10 level cost me 300 lives. That's a bit disproportional, isn't it? ... Well, everything is timed just slightly off. I'm not sure it's intentional. But it makes the game a lot harder. Like... a lot. Instead of running through it elegantly, as before, you have to find ways of tricking the Boss, and even slow yourself, but not too much, otherwise it'll catch you...I was really frustrating. Usually, I had 3-7 deaths, sometimes around 20 deaths on hard levels. On the 4th chapter, some levels were around 30 deaths, one of them even reaching 80, and another 60. Granted, there were some easy levels as well, but the frustrating ones painted the picture, for me.The biggest ""problem"" is how floaty the controls are. This is intentional. And it works mostly well, for the first 60-70 levels. Because the levels are well designed around these controls. For the reasons stated before, it becomes really frustrating, since the floatiness doesn't allow for fine-tuned movement.Also, the achievements do not reward perfecting the levels (all collectibles) at all, and there doesn't seem to be Time leaderboards nor achievements... I think it would only benefit a game like this, but oh well.All in all, it's still a solid game. I enjoyed most of my time with it. It looks good, the music is pretty cool, and it can provide a challenge. Give it a go! Oh, and it's nowhere near as difficult as Super Meat Boy. I mean, not even close. So don't worry about that. It can still appeal to more ""casual"" platformer fans.			"

												This puzzle game looks nice and plays nice. The first few levels are easy but it's clear they progressively become harder. The game looks polished and UI handles fairly nicely. For me personally the gameplay got a bit boring with a pretty lax difficulty ramp. Regardless it's a complete game and it's clear there are tougher puzzles ahead.http://played.today/mechanic_escape.html

												Great jump and run platformer, 9/10. There is a nice variety of features (crusher, flamer, disappearing platforms, teleports...), and each level has an invincible boss chasing you for some part of each level, where every jump and every maneauver counts... responds very well to the controller. Importantly, the difficulty gradually increases, but is not as frustratingly difficult as some of the other famous platformers (Meat Boy...), its exactely right... you will still die a few times per level, but then you memorize it and get farther and farther and make it to the next level... the last few levels are really challenging but doable. Finally, achievements make this game a really nice game to complete, would buy a sequal instantly!			"

												Mechanic Escape feels a bit like Super Meat Boy lite; it's a series of challenging, bite-sized, no-frills platforming gauntlets.  In my assessment, this game is a lot more accessable than SMB, as the controls are more forgiving and the level of challenge isn't quite as high.  As a heads-up, most levels will have one or more menacing cloud-monsters that spawn behind you and chomp at your heels as an incentive to speed you up.  When I was a child, this would have been scary enough where I would have stopped playing, and very casual gamers might want to stay away.  However, this is a worthy edition to any library, and can be completed with persistience.			"

												Mechanic Esape is a fun, but challenging, plaftormer game that follows the escape of what looks like a tv mechanic as they try to escape the world they are trapped on.With four main worlds and different hazards in each one, the gameplay is varied, and the difficulty of levels is fairly well balanced with some easy and some quite dificult. Of course, the real challenge is collecting each and every one of the smaller tvs before finishing the level.Played  with a controller, I did find it difficult initially to get my head around the momentum of the players character. The gravity seems less present than in other games, but once you figure it out and get used to it the game plays pretty well. It can be frustrating at times when the character drifts in certain directions, but this game is meant to be played fast rather than slowly (this effect is less noticeable at high speeds). This is when played with an xbox 360 controller, which works great.The graphics in this game are very nice, with differing styles in each world, and nice details on the player character and the enemies that follow you around. The music is nice initially, but I began to tire of it fairly quickly, as it plays on a constant loop.Aside from the intially odd momentum and gravity the player has, I had no major bugs. worth noting however: If the flying enemy that shoots bullets is within a wall, it can fire bullets that pass through the wall without exploding. Watch out for that.This is a veyr nice game, and definitely worth buying if you like platformers that play at high speeds.			"

												Mechanic Escape feels a bit like Super Meat Boy lite; it's a series of challenging, bite-sized, no-frills platforming gauntlets.  In my assessment, this game is a lot more accessable than SMB, as the controls are more forgiving and the level of challenge isn't quite as high.  As a heads-up, most levels will have one or more menacing cloud-monsters that spawn behind you and chomp at your heels as an incentive to speed you up.  When I was a child, this would have been scary enough where I would have stopped playing, and very casual gamers might want to stay away.  However, this is a worthy edition to any library, and can be completed with persistience.			"

A lovely platformer game with a TV!The price tag is a bit much, but if you're into platformer games, then definetly give it a try if it on sale! At first, it wasn't the gameplay that kept me around, it was the design, the whole game's atmosphere, the awesome ""graphics"", and when I kept sticking around, I started noticing the lovely gameplay. Although, the game is a bit annoying in stage 4, but it is managable.TL:DR - Pick it up on a sale if you're into platformer games, it is a rare gem in the platformer theme. "

												Challenging Speed Platformer with elements from games like Super Meat Boy and Bit.Trip Runner with Rayman style art! Needless to say Mechanic Escape is a gorgeous fast-paced and fun platformer where you play as a TV and collect TV's... what more could you want? However, I did enjoy it like everything it still had it's pro's and cons which I will explain.Pro's:♦ Awesome Graphics and level designs (Similar to Rayman)♦ Challenging like all good Platformers should be (Not too challenging that it takes away the fun)♦ Easy but good Achievements (Mainly for just playing the game)♦ Aspects such as Time and Starring for 100% completion to make you want to replay levels (This is great as it keeps the levels interesting and gives you something to do once you have finished the levels)♦ Steam Trading Cards♦ Controls that just seem to work (Pressing the up arrow allows you to jump, what more could you want?)♦ Great number of levels (Not too many and not too little)♦ Constantly adding new things to levels the further you get in the game (This made the game more interesting as you didn't know what to expect per level)♦ Every level was different and had some uniqueness to it (No one level felt like the last etc)♦ Unlockable Character Skins (This keeps your TV looking sexy, what more could you want than a sexy looking TV?)Con's♦ Lacking Storyline (There was little to no storyline which kind of ruined the game. Needless to say when you beat a Chapter and went to the next there could have been a cinematic which lead up to the final cinematic but there wasn't)♦ Final Cinematic didn't make much sense (This was disappointing as I expected something more)♦ Last levels of each Chapter were the same as any other level (There was nothing to distinguish that you were playing the last level of a Chapter or the first, which was annoying as they could have added in bosses or something unique just to symbolize it was the last level of the Chapter)♦ Jumping sometimes seemed weird (Jumping from ropes seemed like you had a delay and when in the air sometimes if you pressed left or right you'd go flying which was annoying)♦ No highscores (This would have made the game as each level had number of deaths and time. The game could have had level highscores based on fastest time and number of deaths which would have increased the fun even more)♦ Level lengths varied (Some levels seemed way shorter than others for absolutely no reason at all)Overall, even though there could have been a better storyline, highscores and jumping could have been better in a few situations... there are still many many pro's that make the game worth checking out. So, if you love Platformers with aspects of Super Meat Boy, Bit.Trip Runner with Rayman style graphics than I'd definitely recommend you check this out. Plus it's only $5 and you'll get over 8 hours out of it, so I enjoyed it and highly recommend it!PS: You get to play as a TV collecting TV's... what could be more better than that?			"

												Not a bad little twitch/collect'em'up platformer, though not nearly as good at Super Meat Boy (hereafter referred to as SMB).   Starts off very easy, but gets progressively harder though never to SMB levels - which is a good thing because the levels are longer so dying would cost you more time (nope, no mid-level checkpoints here either.) Unlike SMB, most levels feature at least one or two ""chase"" scenes, so it's not only the traps that you need to worry about.  Also, no spikes! (don't worry, plenty of other things can kill you.)  The controls are good when on the ground or ""wall jumping"", but very ""floaty"" when in the air.  I don't know if this was intentional to increase the challenge, but it makes it very hard to air-maneuver with a gamepad's analog stick - the input is digital, making it too easy to ""oversteer"" or understeer by holding the direction for too long or too short a time.  In a few sections, I found it easier to switch from my 360 pad to a keyboard so I could quickly tap the direction buttons without worrying about deadzones.  But you can doublejump from the beginning, which is a plus - double jumping should be mandatory for all platformers IMO :)There are 4 chapters of 20 levels each.  I beat them all, but only ""100%d"" the first chapter since I decided doing so for the latter ones would be too frustrating.In the end, this game isn't anything really special, but it's a decent piece of twitch platforming fun if you can get used to the air controls.  I'd recommend it on a 50% Off or better sale.			"

												A solid game that will certainly fit players looking for an exacting platforming challenge.  Levels are designed around very specific challenges, which make the game a combination of puzzle-solving and execution.  The developers have wisely kept levels short to minimize frustration.Unfortunately the simple controls and single best solution makes little room for any style of player except execution challengers and achievement completionists.

												I don't get the ""Very Positive"" rating this game currently has. Maybe I haven't played the game long enough? But that's tough, it's so plain, repetitive and boring right out of the gate. It's the nigh-simplest set of gameplay mechanics in a game (jump, double jump, and what else?). Is there a time when you get to control a different character? How much insufferable ""collect all the things as you jump through a stage"" mechanic do I have to suffer to get through to more content?Why is it insufferable? Because what this game tries to do (be a speedrunning platformer) is done better by other games made many years before this one (Super Meat Boy, heck even Mario games).Pros:Graphics are polished and consistentCharacters are unique (not many games you play as a TV)Stages are short, so if you're shooting for perfect and fast runs, the iterations are at least quick.Cons:Floaty jump mechanics that could use tighter air controlCan't control jump height with button press durationNo other mechanics but jumping (not even holding it to move faster)Trial-by-error only of learning of any tricky parts of any stageYou either spend your time replaying the same plainly designed levels trying for 3-star finishes on every level ORYou blow right through stages with no regard for ratings and get treated to a barely-present ho-hum story.It has elements that seems like it's trying to appeal to gamers who enjoy speed-running or the super hard category of platformers, but it fails to offer the depth, complexity, or tightness of gameplay mechanics to support that genre well.If you like this style of gaming, there are plenty games that do better what this game attempts. See any of the following first: Super Meat Boy, Super House of Dead Ninjas, They Bleed Pixels, Dustforce DX, Shovel Knight, Cave Story, BattleBlock Theater, Rayman Origins, Broforce, Guacamelee!, etc.			"

Posted: September 25, 2014
												I'm a bit torn on this one. It's a platformer, duh. It is moderately fast paced and has elements of Super Meatboy in it (namely that when you die, you gotta start the whole thing over again). I am currently through chapter one and the levels take about 30-60 secs if I get everything (20 levels per chapter it seems). There is not much room for speed runs I think, because there is a ""lovely"" feature in which you are very often hunted by an annoying robot thing that kills you on contact, catches up to you and even explodes periodically and is only lost when passing a gate. Your goal is to just complete the level, as a bonus there are small and big monitors in the levels. I don't know what the small ones give you, but the big ones unlock skins. I completed every level on perfect so far (albeit with some cursing and retrying) and almost got all the skins now, so after that point there is no sense in collecting them anymore (they make the levels harder of course) other than personal accomplishment.Sounds like an ok game, doesn't it, so why the negative review? For starters it gets pretty boring and repetitive. New elements are gradually introduced, but they're not very catchy or game changing. You don't seem to get any abilities, you don't fight, you just weave through the levels and those levels are pretty bland, not to mention the soundtrack which is the same for each level within a chapter...My second problem are the controls. The game feels clunky and unresponsive, sluggish even. Not the best formula when you have to run away from a big bad killer machine. It almost feels like you are floating, you can double jump and wall jump and often it works as you want, but too often it just feels off, hard to explain. For example when you swing on a chain you cannot jump off the chain if it is not at its apex somehow. Either that or the controls are not responding properly. Also holding down the jump button makes you jump continuously (I am the kind of person that wills a jump to go longer if you only hold down the jump button lol, so that cost me a few lives).I can't say too many bad things about this game though. If you desperately need some sort of platformer and it's on sale, go ahead. If not then there are A LOT of better alternatives. Generic levels, boring sound track, weird controls and a wonky hero with a hitbox the size of an elephant as well as meaningless collecting of stuff within the levels and a constant pressure by being hunted. That is ""mechanic escape"" in a nutshell for me. Mediocre in everything.			"

												I expected an average enjoyable platformer, what I got is a dark abyss, a vacuum of creativity. Playing this game is like staring into the grave of imagination. This game is so bland, so average, so forgettable it's practically white noise.The controls are floaty and inaccurate. They're not terrible but cause enough irritation, especially considering the awfulness of the wall jumping mechanic, which kills you more times than it works properly.			"

												Take it from someone who did it already, don't waste your time on this turd. Although the basic premise and some of the level design is good, there are too many flawed game mechanics and controls that ruin it. First off, trust the reviews, the control of the character is terrible. People say many games are floaty, but I've never noticed it until this game, which has the worst platforming physics I've ever seen. For a game that wants you to be precise, it punishes you by having a character that is impossible to control. If you try to move him in the air, he will barely move, and then if he does move he has way too much momentum and you cannot stop him. 2/3 the time you die is because there is terrible control of him, the most important part of a platformer. 2nd off, the wall jumping mechanic is terrible. It makes you automatically jump off walls, even if you're not pressing the other way. This means multiple times you are just close to a wall and you're trying to jump up over it it will make you jump off of it, which is of terrible design and makes no sense. There should need to be a directional hold as in platformers you are commonly touching walls. There are then just basic gameplay mechanics that are stupid and only there to inflate game length. First off, they use this thing that chases are you, which is fine sometimes but every single level uses it and so basically every level is instead of being a platformer, is a free running game like a bit-trip runner. It is akin to being forced to do all these hard jumps with terrible control against a clock, putting a timer on each level, which is just stupid. Add that to the fact that the chasing creature has abilities, like a heat seaking rocket. This means that since you are forced to take jumps while running, you cannot avoid it because you are forced into the platforming and only moving forward. So many times I died because there was literally nothing i go could and based on where the rocket was and its trajectory I automatically was going to die, which is just stupid because it means it is based on timing and not skill. The only way to try and get around this is by continually doing the part until you have the perfect timing and pace for the rocket to be shot at a different part, which means you need to follow some tempo set up by the game creators that you have no way of knowing until you do trial and error. Add all these problems together and every time you die, which is after 1 hit, you must start the entire level over again. Having to lose all progress and start again based on bad control or poor game design is the worst offense. A checkpoint half-way through the level would make sense. This is all obvious they do this so you just retry the game to inflate game length, also known as the ""super-meat-boy effect"". This effect is where poor game design and forced play to complete the level without any mistakes and in the same way the developers did, makes the game seem longer because you just keep retrying the same part. It is a sign of sloppy game development, compared to a game like dark souls where mistakes are your own fault. There are a lot of levels, and a few unlockable costumes. Also, the complete lack of story doesn't bother me as much as it did other people. It was the terrible imprecise controls, and poor core mechanics of the game, that ruined it. 5/10.			"

												Mechanic Escape looks and feels amateurish, including the painfully-curved interface and uninspired level design. The collectibles mostly detract from the game by providing hand-holding through parts of levels, and by reducing branching paths to essentially the one with the collectibles. It might get better as the game progresses, but I doubt it would be worth trudging through the mind-numbing beginning.For Linux usersThere is actually a Linux build for this, despite the lack of indication on the store page, but achievements aren't implemented.

What is this game?It is a quick paced, run and jump style game where you play as a TV guy and collect other little TVs to rescue your kind while being chased by giant monsters from time to time.The FlawsI have two mayor complains about the mechanics, which otherwise I would recomend this game, the first being and biggest is that the camera seems to fall behind the character, obstructing the view of what is comming in front of you and it doesnt help that the camera is so close to you character either. The other complaint is unesserary mechanics, like having to press the jump button to activate the cannons that shoot you since this are just static, it would make more sense if they changed position or angle like in Donkey Kong Country, this just slows you down, I also found that this cannons sometimes shoot you atomatically and sometimes dont, I dont know how that works.This are also some other complains I have with the game, but they are MAY be more of a nitpick of mine, but the music is really not enjoyable, suiting but not enjoyable since it sounds sometimes like a robot having a screech at times, the hazards arent too visible at times, and every level just seem to blend toghether with no real differentiation but the level design being different. Also the main character design is just bad imo, it just doesnt feel suiting as you can be very agile, and you are like a chubby TV with stumpy legs... also why the wand-y thing?The ProsGood responsive controls and worth the money in content.My conclusion:Bad music.Bad visual design.Good gameplay that could be better by changing what was mentioned before.It seems like a short game.None existing story besides what it says on the store page (nothing is explained).Final Score: 6/10 Average(This review is incomplete as it goes as far as the 14th lvl of the first world)Even though I give it a negative recomendation it doesnt means the game doesnt have some redeemable value.

												While trash TV suffers from being too short and expensive for its value, this game suffers from being too repetitive and gets boring quickly. Also level design towards the end is notorious for being bad. The two games should mate and have a baby and that would probably produce a great game.

												I must say I have been thoroughly surprised by Mechanic's Escape. I expected something to simply satisfy my precision platforming itch, not something that, to some extent, blows me away and is so much fun to play. So far, I've played 30 levels out of 80, so I can't talk about the overall difficulty, but I expect it to get pretty hardcore in worlds 3 and 4. The first world (20 levels each world) was pretty easy, and seasoned platformers should be able to perfect it completely in under an hour. However, from the last level of the first world to the first of the second world, you can already see that there's a marked jump in terms of difficulty. It's also worth noting that there are NO checkpoints, so you restart each time you die from the beginning. The good thing though is that the levels are mostly around 45 seconds long each. The jumping is a bit floaty, but that's the nature of the game. In the first world, this won't matter much, but in the second, as things heat up and the collectibles are less straightforward, you'll need to take awhile to completely grasp it. I wouldn't count this against the game...that's just the learning curve here.One thing I love about Mechanic's Escape is that (so far at least) the collectibles are ""get-able"". Some games tend to over-complicate the placement of the collectibles, but here, you can see most of them (none are really hidden) and it's usually just a matter of timing your jumps well or trying alternative ways to navigate the section to get them. Art looks great. The cartoonish visuals and theme is simple and not out-of-the-world, but nice to look at all the same. Sound design is serviceable for me. Nothing particularly memorable, nor anything bad. The mechanics here are just moving left/right, and then jumping (double-tap to double jump). So yeah, pretty straight-forward. But the game adds new gameplay elements from time to time, such as rails, canons, air vents and electro-circuits, alongside new obstacles and enemies.One novel addition to other platformers of its kind is that each level here usually has one or two boss sequences. The boss starts chasing you, so you have to navigate said sections quickly until a laser zaps said boss. It doesn't feel gimmicky at all to me and actually adds a sense of urgency (and a bit more challenge) to the game. Overall, I am plenty pleased with this. It surpassed my meager expectations, for sure. It has that addictive ""one more try"" going for it. The nature of the game means that this is obviously tailored to the hardcore gamer that can withstand bouts of deaths trying to get that one elusive collectible, or making that one particular jump. Or well, to those who just love shouting profanities at their deaf monitors every 30 seconds!UPDATE: I have played more now (50 levels already out of 80), and I can say with certainty that this is not as challenging as Super Meat Boy, Giana Sisters TD or Electronic Super Joy. This is good for me actually since I found the aforementioned games a tad too frustrating. It is still a challenging precision platformer, just not as hardcore as the ones I mentioned above (which makes this an ideal game to start with if you've never played precision platformers). This could both be a pro or a con, depending on you. Getting all collectibles becomes much harder though, so it also depends if you just want to complete the levels or perfect them.			"

												Mechanic Escape is a game i was not impressed with. I am surprised no one mentions the odd resolution which makes the game bulge out like an old tube television. While it was an interesting choice I found it hampered my skill to survive the simple levels. The levels themselves don't look half bad but I could not see far enough ahead to dodge the various traps, which seemed quite unfair. Even the character himself seemed too floaty for you to feel completely in control in a platformer designed around simply surviving. You can collect what are essentially coins but it is not required which makes it even simpler. The chasing mechanic around the enemies was what originally brought me in but even then it seemed they get cut off at checkpoints. Terrible choice. The biggest thing that confuses me however is how 29 people (as of this writing) found a review which calls this game a ""rouge-like"" helpful. Even comparing this to Super Meat Boy hurts my soul. Roguelikes are obviously more fun, difficult, and have gameplay that draws you in and steals away days of your life. Super Meat Boy drives you insane with its difficulty, but the character controls like a dream and when you beat a level you feel good about mastering it. Mechanic Escape felt like a online Flash game which just annoyed me, especially when the character would randomly wall-kick when I was timing my jumps perfectly. All in all, I am just glad I got this game for free. the best thing about this? Free cards.			"

												Mechanic Escape was a game that I got in a giveaway from IndieGala. At first I was doubtful it would be anything near high quality, but it was Okay saying it was free. I would not pay 5 pounds for this game as I feel the content is repetitive and somewhat boring. It is very rage inducing, and is similar to Super Meat Boy (Just not as good). It has an average concept; but I think that they should develop at least some kind of story as to why he's running round like a headless chicken looking for mechanical parts.Good Things-Interesting Concept.Enjoyable Bad Things-RepetitiveRage InducingNo Storyline.Boring.

												This is a pretty decent game that could have been a great game if it did not have some major flaws.First off you're character is floaty as♥♥♥♥♥♥which is not all that bad considering the levels seem to be designed around this .................for the most part.The game is rather solid at the beginning to middle half......but then starts going down hill. The game has a couple of really annoying flaws like wall jumping being WAY too sensitive,cannon firing from directional input, ""bosses"" having ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t unavoidable attacks in certain situations (PARTICULARITY THE SECOND FISH ONE WHICH SHOOTS HOMING MISSILES THAT ARE FASTER THAN YOU ARE  WHICH ENDS UP BEING HARDER THAN THE SUPPOSED ""SUPERIOR"" THIRD BOSS).........sigh,etc.The MAIN problem with this game however is that the level designer/s seem to overestimate the ability of the controls.The controls aren't bad it is just not nearly as good as the level designer/s thinks they are.Again this is rather fine in the beginning when you don't have to be perfect but then the later levels.....sigh the later levels you do.What ends up happening is all those flaws that were previously annoying but tolerable and perhaps ignored become INFURIATING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T AND PAINFULLY APPARENT.After all the rage is gone what is left is mostly disappointment because it could have been a great game.Despite this i did enjoy a lot of it (mostly early levels) and it has other GOOD game mechanics.So i write this hoping the creator/s read this or other reviews like this and fix these problems perhaps in a sequel.For players however i would recommend this game on one condition:the first time you see the collectibles   .....you raise you're hand.........and give the bird because ♥♥♥♥ em they are not even REMOTELY WORTH IT.

												A very nice little game. A platformer that has tight controls and a decent amount of levels. Game isn't that much difficult except a few levels later on, but in all a very fun game. Music is very good and follows the game mood nicely. Levels are nice and short, mistakes or deaths are instant respawn so there is no wait time to get back in the game. A definitive recommendation on my side.			"

												WARNING: This game is addictive.A really good platformer in Super Meat Boy style with nice and detailed graphics and sound. The difficulty rises quite fair but does a jump between the worlds. So be prepared for some frustrating tries at the beginning of each world.The controls are very precise and I recommend a gamepad for optimum experience.Each level is played on the clock and you have to collect 50 small and 5 big TV sets in each level. This gives a lot of replayability to the game to get 100% and beat your best time. And the big boss chasing you in every level will surely help to get you a better time ;)I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do.Cheers,Gecko			"
