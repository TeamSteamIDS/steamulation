												Journey of a Roach throws you into a topsy turvy animated world that's really quite charming. Climbing around on the ceiling can be a little bit dizzying, and at my time of playing there were a couple of little movement snagging areas. It's also a very short game, but I feel like the pace that it sets is good and I worry that if it was longer it might overstay its welcome. At 3.5 hours this was with me backtracking for a couple of achievements. The puzzles are logical and bizzare, the best kind.It's cute and cheerful and unique enough to give a chance. The full recommended retail is high in my opinion for the time you will get out of it but if you can get it for <£5 i'd snatch it up. Daedalic published this for a small team and honestly as companies go these are guys that i'd be proud to be giving money to - sale or not.			"

												 Journey of a Roach is a short but sweet adventure game in quite the unusual setting. Playing as a roach you have to move around the scenery on the walls, ground and ceiling. The free movement on all surfaces of the rooms you are in makes the game quite different and adds to its charm. The puzzles are fairly interesting and not too hard.The game has a bunch of missable achievements so would recommend checking them up so you can do them on your second playthrough (or even first if you don't mind the slight spoilers). The game also has a collectable achievements and multiple achievements tied to replaying the game; one for beating it without saving, one for beating it twice and then the challenge of the game...beating the game in under 18 minutes. The speedrun might take a practice run or two of the game  to be able to pull it of but its very doable.Time to 100%: 3-6 hours (depending on the amount of attempts for the speedrun)			"

												I did not like this. I did not like this at all. The setting is interesting, the story is okay and the controls are sometimes a bit too frustrating (why wouldn't I be able to walk on all walls and step over small pipes). And that's actually exactly what I expected from this game. It's okay to have janky controls. But it's not okay to have ""nonsensical puzzle game logic"". Every now and again I stumbled upon a puzzle that had the most illogical solution. Sometimes the thought bubble explanations are obtuse, sometimes the required items don't make sense, and sometimes the actual goal of the puzzle is illogical. For example - a bug asks us to find him a drink, but when you eventually find it he won't take it. Why? Because you apparently need to put a AA battery in it to make it an energy drink (simple logic right?). I have no idea how anyone supposed to come up with this solution without just trying all the items on other items and coming up with the solution by trial and error. And the game never gives you a reason why would you have to do it. Progressing in this game mostly means trying all the items you could find on all the intractable points in the current room and hopefully something will happen.If that's something you enjoy/can withstand, go for it. It's cheap on sales. Otherwise stay away.  "

												Journey of a roach has a good story and interesting puzzles from the beginning to the end. Also it has lovable characters and nice songs.It is a short game and you will finish it in a few hours but it worth it. It has cool achievements to unlock and this will double the playing time.			"

A journey of a roach is a third person point and click adventure game developed by Kobold games and Daedalic entertainment.GameplayIn AJOAR  you do your usual point and click games mechanics, aka: picking up items and using them on other things or combining items.But it has a unique mechanic: wall climbing it works pretty well though on some stuff it seems you can climb it but you cant.There's one complaint i have there's a puzzle pretty close to the end where you to get electricity to a screwdriver but, you can't let the pipes touch it to much or else it resets.The game isn't that long, i kinda took too long with the electricity puzzle so it should be around 3 hours give or take.DifficultyIf you played other point and clicks games this game should be pretty easy sometimes you just have to look at what the npcs say then you'll usually find out what to do.ReplayabilityTheres not much replayability but you'll probably have to do two playthroughs if you want all achievements, you need to do a speedrun collect all worms and get all secret item combos.There's a guide if you want to know how to get em.AudioThe soundtrack is really charming, the music switches if you enter a different rom and there's a nice amount of variation and some stuff sounds familiar.lLke when you enter spider grandma's room the music changes to one of those wind up boxes ish music, and the soundtrack is free!graphicsThe game has a cartoony artstyle and it has a drawn style, the characters talk with bubbles which fits really well with the cartoony ness.all of the cutscenes are drawn and look really good.Storya nuclear bomb dropped so everyone's is dead but insects.Blue roach finds a flower and goes to tell green(the character you play) when try to go up a bird thinks you're fingers are worms,And bites you so you fall into this room with a cobweb.Then you try to save green and try to save him from the cobweb and you try to get back up but then blue falls through the ground(or something similar can't remember exactly) and then you try to go save him.Final verdictShort and decent third person point and click adventure game with a original mechanic and a story about two roaches who just wants a flower.If you're a fan of point and click games you should definitely pick this game up.No drama, Just Reviews.

tl;dr -> Play as a cockroach on a never-ending quest to save his useless brother who keeps getting owned by every situation. 11/10 older brother simulator.I got this game gifted to me by a generous friend and was interested to play because I wanted to try a refreshing point-and-clicker with an interesting artstyle. I was pleasantly surprised with my gameplay experience.The aesthetics are very nice - the amount of detail in the game world is high. During brief cutscenes, the artstyle switches to a charming, fun cartoon appearance. The music and sounds are good and add to the positive, comical vibe emitted by the gameplay. Much of the game consists of you travelling throughout an extensive bomb shelter, trying to fix all of the troubles caused by your roach friend/brother. The controls are simple and easy to learn - I recommend using a controller to play, but the keyboard and mouse combo work fine. There is a quick tutorial that helps you understand the mechanics of the game. Clues are constantly given, and trial-and-error will help you progress through the game most of the time. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with point-and-click adventure/puzzle games. Most of the puzzle solutions are intuitive - or at least hinted at heavily when you interact with said objects.  Gameplay consists of you moving around different rooms of a bomb shelter, usually solving problems for other people in order to progress. As a cockroach, you can walk along walls and the ceiling, changing the orientation of the camera if you do so; you cannot jump, only walk. You can pick up items of interest, combine them in your inventory (if applicable), and use them to interact with the world (indicated by a puzzle icon over an item). Unlike many point-and-clickers, you can actually move your character around without using the mouse - something I found refreshing after playing many mouse-only point-and-clickers. Another nice thing I appreciated in this game is the depth of puzzles - many times, you have to do an extra step to solve a problem. For example, there is a part where you need to collect baby flies that are located throughout a set of rooms. One of the flies is racing in a circle around a makeshift track - to capture it, you need to place a net on the wall, repair it, and physically block the fly's way so it goes around you (straight into a ramp that launches it into the net). These type of dynamic puzzles help prevent the game from getting stale. Overall, the game is a very well-done point-and-clicker that makes up for its simpler storyline with fun, comical puzzles. If you are interested in the point-and-click genre, then you should definitely give this game a try. I normally try to avoid mentioning price if I feel it is unnecessary, but I do think that the retail price ($16.99 CAD) is a bit steep. At the time of writing this review, the game is discounted at 88% ($2.03 CAD), and that is more than a fair price for the value you are getting. Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

												Journey of a Roach is a short but cute 3D Puzzle Adventure slash Point and Click game and a result of a colaboration between German P'n'C veterans Daedalic Entertainment and the relatively young studio Koboldgames from Switzerland.STORYYou play as Jim, a cockroach living in an underground bomb shelter that is controlled by an army of ants. When your cockroach buddy accidentally crashes through the floor and gets captured by the ants, you set out on a quest to rescue him, end the ants' terror regime and find a way to get out of the bomb shelter and to a peaceful place somewhere else.HUMORThere aren't any actual dialogues in the game. All of the communication between the characters takes place in the form of incomprehensible sounds (sort of similar to baby mumbling) and comic bubbles with drawings that show what the characters try to say. Some of those illustrations are pretty hilarious and probably wouldn't be remotely as funny, as if the characters would actually say 'I found this plunger. Shall I put it on my head?'. It's not the kind of humor that makes you laugh out loud and spit your drink on the screen, but it's amusing and cheerful throughout the entire game.VISUALSWhile the game is advertised as a Point and Click game, it hasn't much to do with the usual pre-rendered, stiff and sometimes blurry enviroments known from other P'n'C games. It's actually best compared with The Walking Dead where pretty much everything is in 3D and where you can freely move around while still retaining the classical P'n'C feel of finding objects, combining them, solving puzzles and so on. Due to the comic style of the visuals, you don't have to worry about blurry textures or anything, either - it all looks sharp and just sooooo cute. :DGAMEPLAYBeing a P'n'C adventure at its heart, the game adds some welcome addition to the fairly worn out genre as it basically plays like a sidescroller where you control Jim with WASD (or the arrow keys, respectively) and the actual item handling is done with your mouse (you can also use a gamepad, if you wish to do so - works great). To add to that (and since you're a cockroach, of course) you can also climb on walls and ceilings to progress through the levels, reach items or just avoid being seen by the ants.It takes a bit getting used to and you sometimes accidentally climb a wall or a crate that you just wanted to pass, but overall the mechanic works great and gives you another way of freedom to explore your enviroment.Puzzle-wise, the game is fairly easy as most puzzles only consist of picking up items, combining them and using them on something or someone, but since it's mostly quite obvious what has to be used how and where, they shouldn't provide that much of a challenge for experienced P'n'C or Puzzle game players. However, since the devs probably tried to also appeal to a younger audience, it wouldn't have been of much use to incorporate ultra-hard puzzles that you can't solve without consulting a walkthrough, so I'm generally fine with that.PLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITYBeating the story took me roughly 3 hours, which is rather short for a game like this, but personally I will always prefer shorter games with tight gameplay over games that artificially extend the playtime by repeating the same levels or gameplay elements over and over.Once you've played through the game, there's not much else to do apart from hunting the remaining achievements, however, there's one particular achievement that requires you to beat the game in less than 18 minutes, so that adds at least a bit of challenge and replayability to the game.CONCLUSIONJourney of a Roach is an extremely cute, cheerful and overall fun game for a relaxing evening, so if you like P'n'C games (especially with a gameplay twist) and don't get putt off by the game's length, make sure to check it out!

												What is this game?You are a cockroach on a post nuclear war world where there seems to be no humans and animals/insects have gained an enourmous size and inteligence. Your friend finds a flower and wants to show it to you, but then an accident accurs, he falls and you fall with him, you both get trapped and something happens and he falls through a hole, then you go on your journey to find him. An stright point an click  adventure.The ProsThe game have a really charming style, good controls and nice narrative with likable characters and lighthearted story with cool puzzles. The FlawsFor once, the cutcenes seem like more of a storyboard than a cutscene, very sketchy and simple, the only other negative is that the game is very short and the admission price is a bit too high (maybe 5$ worht of content).Conclusion:There is very little wrong with this game beside the price, is a cute little story that you should experience if possble.Score: 8/10 Good Game			"

												Cute and charming aren't words I'd normally associate with a roach but this game makes the gosh darn uglies downright adorable in this adventure. If the apocalypse comes you better believe roaches will outlive us all and this game takes us on a small journey about some of their misadventures. This is a perfect example of a game so well done that it doesn't need to say anything to be enjoyable. Most of the puzzles were easy enough though there are a few that took a bit of thinking to understand and one or two that were downright tedious. I just enjoyed climbing the walls with that little bugger and meeting all the different bugs in the underground. They story and characters burst with personality and the atmosphere is quite inventive. I would definitely recommend it for a unique perspective that you probably would never think about. It's got a cute story and some clever puzzles. The comic graphic style in which the scenes unfold are great when transitioning to a new area and you get into a lot of mischief as a little roach.			"

												Just finished the overalll average game.  I did enjoy most of it, and the drawings  made me laugh.  Bought it cheap and for that amount of money (around 1 eur) it is absolutly worth to play.  Not for the full price tho. The story ends a bit weak, which made it not satisfying for me.  The puzzles are not too hard, apart from a few. I had to check a walkthrough once and few other times it took a lot of time to get an idea of the solution.   Lot of trial and error. In short, it is not  a bad game, but also not a star. I really enjoyed  the way it was setup, being able to walk on walls and ceilings. This gave the game a nice perspective.  ALso I enjoyed the drawingstyle. A bit childish, but I don't mind that. Some funny pics there.  verdict: 6.5/10 "

												Journey of a Roach is a cute adventure that ultimately falls flat.I tried playing this with the kids because of the cutesy graphics, but they got really bored with it and the same can be said about me.As such, I cannot recommend this game for the 15$ price tag.The story is about a couple of roaches trying to reach a flower in some post apocalyptic world, and how they stumble onto some fanatic ant colony in the process.The game is your standard fetch quest (since apparently you are the only roach with the ability to DO something).The controls at times are awkward (since you can climb on walls), but they grow on you.But the game simply fails to hold interest, I felt like it was a chore to play and I was hardly enjoying it.In the end, I completed this game alone (kids lost interest), but it did not get better near the end.I hope future games from Kobolgames will invest some more in plot development next time.

												A genuinely charming, adorable game! And who would have thought a cockroach could be so gosh-danged adorable?! This is a game entirely without dialogue or writing -- the instructions, the character's ideas, conversations, etc. are explained entirely in thought-bubble cartoons -- and it just WORKS. It's a game you could share internationally without ever worrying about a language barrier! And the game itself is loads of fun to play! Set in a post-apocalyptic world in which things like roaches, rats, bees, spiders. etc. are the lone surviving inhabitants, players take on the role of an adorable little roach who wants to save his accident-prone friend from a series of escalating perils so that they can enjoy a beautiful flower together -- the first flower seen in a very long time. The puzzles are fun and engaging, the characters are likeable, the controls are simple and fun, and many of the adventures and puzzles you encounter take full advantage of the little roach's ability to walk up walls and along ceilings. I really can't recommend it enough -- a truly delightful experience!			"

Sure its Daedalic that publish it and even when it has not the jokes of Deponia, it has its own unique funny style, cute little riddles, gimmicks to find like worms, cakes that aren´t a lie (Portal), makeable speedrun where you can test you skills or a challenge like the Rock movie (Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage) dont get hit from the fire ventilators). For me it makes fun, its short but the quality is nice, at the moment you can see a happy birthday version till 30 november. Take a look, give it a chance and hopefully enjoy it. Thanks for reading. Have a happy day. I give this game personal 82% (only because the game lenght i cant get enough from the gameplay so i hope you support the game and maybe we get a 2nd part in some years). Bye			"

Gameplay'Journey of a Roach' is a point & click adventure game. In order to progress in the game, you collect items you find and then use them on stuff in the world or on other items you collected, as is usual in these games. But there is one thing that makes 'Journey of a Roach' stand out: as you're playing a roach, you can effortlessly climb walls and ceilings. This adds a whole new dimension to the game world, compared to other games of the genre. It also made me switch from keyboard and mouse to a controller, but a controller is certainly not mandatory to play the game efficiently. Graphics and soundThe graphics are cartoonish but not exuberantly so. The ambient music and noises are subtle and not intrusive. The sounds the characters produce are cute and not annoying, which seemed like a real possibility to me. So I was pleasantly surprised on both counts.The 'dialogue' and 'story''Journey of a Roach' is different because it doesn't use any words at all. No written words, no spoken words. Instead, you see the thoughts of the characters in the game in the form of a drawing in a speech balloon. This is a refreshing approach and it works well here. The only downside is that it severely limits what the game's makers can tell you, the player. This has two direct consequences: sometimes, the game can't communicate to you fully what you're expected to do. On one or two occasions, I had to take a walkthrough and look up the next step. When I read what I needed to do, I noticed two things: 1. I would never ever have guessed that from the available information; 2. the author of the walkthrough didn't really know what was happening exactly either, using words like 'thingy' and 'thingamajig' in an effort to describe it.  there is little story here. It's not really a narrative-driven game. A basic motivation and even a basic personality for the characters is established through drawings and sounds, but there isn't really an elaborate plot, as you can imagine. The size of the game world, the length of the gameThe game world is very small: there are only 5 scenes, basically, but the game does seem a bit larger than it is because of the climbing. If you don't rush and take your time to think about what to do, 'Journey of a Roach' will take you 2 or 3 hours to finish. If you do rush (a second playthrough or following a walkthrough to the letter) it can be very short. Let me put it this way, there is a Steam Achievement for finishing the game in 18 minutes or less.On Steam's extra features'Journey of a Roach' has 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 just for running the game.The Steam Achievements are varied and add an extra layer of fun to this game. A few are story-based and can't be missed, some are completely missable, some mean collecting optional stuff and a few are real challenges, like the 'speed run' achievement I mentioned earlier.VerdictYes, 'Journey of a Roach' is short, but I prefer short for point & click games. There is also no deep story, but it never pretends to be something it's not. 'Journey of a Roach' is an accessible, original and fun adventure game and I recommend it, especially since you can pick it up for less than €2/£2/$2 when it's on sale. At that price, don't hesitate and give it a go. Your reward will be a couple of hours of fun and giggles.			"

												Journey of a Roach is a rather short adventure game which is pretty easily completable in one sitting  (there's even an achievement to speedrun it in 18 minutes which only took me two tries.)  It uses silent storytelling with simple cutscenes telling the simple and rather nonsensical story.  You play a cockroach in an inhabited underground area populated by other bugs.  The game is very strange with a lot of the things that happen not making a whole lot of sense to me but it all fits pretty well with the bug civilization theme.The game is unique in two aspects: First you use WASD to move around rather than the mouse like most adventure games, and second, being a bug, you can climb on walls.  There are restrictions however since the camera is in a fixed position so you can't climb on the foreground or background walls.  The camera rotates to follow you which can be disorienting but it works well for the most part.  There are a few places in the game where you will get stuck trying to climb on things but it's easy to get out.I find that the weirdness of this game doesn't lend itself well to puzzle solving, but the game tries to give you hints through thought bubbles when you inspect objects.  I find it still ends up being on the obscure side which is unfortunate.I also had strange performance problems in the last section of the game with the game stuttering badly despite my computer having far more power than the game needs.  I posted on the community hub about the problem so hopefully the developers can fix it, but I haven't heard back at this point.Overall I find this game hard to recommend.  It's rather expensive for the length of the game and the lack of much of a story.  There's a lot of better adventure games out there, and even for $5 more I'd recommend them over this.			"

												A fun silly point and click adventure about a couple of roaches after the end of the world. Nothing groundbreaking here mechanically and in fact it can be beaten in under 18 minutes if you have beaten it once already and know all the item combinations. Overall a good time if point and clicks are your cup of tea. Definitely something to pick up on a steam sale.			"

												After a nuclear war only insects in a bomb shelter managed to stay alive. Two cockroaches need our help to survive their journey to discover the world. xD It's a very nice game in which you have to solve puzzles in order to help them find their way. You can walk on walls and ceilings. I think it's a lot of fun so far and I had no idea roaches could be sooo cute! ^^ It's on sale right now (very cheap) and I can definitely recommend it if you like adventure games.xD			"

												This is a very well made and extremely cute game about a roach friendship. :)If you like point-and-click adventure games you might want to check this game out, but let me say this: Don't buy it for the full price, because you're in for a disappointment (given that you're not made out of money). As cute as it is, it's also extremely short. I completed it in about 3~ hours and that's mostly because some of the puzzles took me a while to figure out (the game is completely non-verbal, you only get pictures to explain the puzzles).			"

												This game is really fun and interesting. It is casual and relax to play. Some puzzles are somewhat hard to solve but most of them are easy to get through. It is not a hard game at all, just a tip for those who want to play a difficult puzzle game. But still, I highly recommend this game since I had a really good time playing it.			"

												Just finished beating this game with 100% completion of the achievements. Journey of a roach is a great game about a roach who need to go and rescue his buddy from the ants. The game is point and click and incorporates interesting movement allowing the roach to walk on the walls and roofs. My first run through of the game took me approx 3 hours. A lot of the puzzles are pretty challenging but can be solved after thinking about them for a little while. i did need to look up a walkthrough for some of the puzzles and had issues on others where the game would not recognize the movements, or in order to complete the puzzle the actions would need to be done very specifically which was some what aggrivating at times. After the first run through the achievements to get the game 100% complete were challenging and i appreciated them to add the additional game play time. Because after 3 hours of inital game play i was defiantly not ready to say good bye to this great game. The game play is some what short for the price of the game but like many others have stated on here i believe it is well worth the price. due to the great art in the game, comedy, characters, story line, and charm.

												This is a short, sweet and enjoyable point and click adventure that has universal appeal. You play a cockroach that accidentally causes mayhem and end up needing to rescue your friend.Pros:+ Cartoony graphics are cute and well done+ No text or spoken words, so anyone from any country can understand and play the game+ Innovative gimmick allowing you to walk on walls and ceilings+ Fun puzzle design that isn't ridiculously hard. Mostly casual-friendly.+ Funny and entertaining, it perfectly captures what I want in an adventure gameCons:- When the cockroach starts walking on the walls/ceilings, the animation gives me motion sickness and I have to look away. Be warned - this may affect you!- Some players may not like how short the game is - if you are good at puzzle solving, it shouldn't take you more than a few hours. - A section where you need to play a game of 3 cups is not well explained at all. You need to click on the background picture to progress.Overall, I think this is a point n click adventure game worth adding to any gamer's collection. Highly recommended.Score: 9/10 "

												a cute and funny but short point and click game, the graphics are 3D cartoon/comic style just like in deponia (no wonder this games is made by the same devs ) the music is funny and enjoyable , no voice acting ( a game about insects so dont be surprised :p ) ,gameplay is smooth ( WASD to move and the mouse to interact with objects ) the puzzles are easy to figure and solve but some of them are soo easy that you will miss them at the first try , didn't face any glitches or bugs .the only thing i dont like about the games is the price ,the game is short (around 2h to complete and you can completed under 18 min if you're fast enough there is even an achievement for it ) and they are charging 14.99$ for it , in my opinion i think its too much (9.99 $ would be the best price for it) but good thing its on sale most of the times ( just like now its on sale for 1.49$ while i'm writing this review)so grabe i on sale or in a bundle 7/10			"

												Journey of a Roach is a point and click adventure game with a stylistic twist: as a cockroach, you can climb on nearly any surface, including the ceiling. This allows the main character, a cockroach named Jim, to traverse levels in a uniquely three-dimensional manner, with his main goal being to rescue his friend from a gang of kidnapping ants. The wall-crawling feature, along with the game's charmingly excitable characters, creative level design, and user-friendly puzzles, makes for a pleasant point and click experience.Like most point and click adventure games, the main goal in Journey of a Roach is to collect various items and then use them in the correct locations. Often the items are in hard to reach locations that require creative climbing to get to. Sometimes you might have to combine items in your inventory so that they can be used to solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves are fairly straightforward, with nearby NPC's often giving small clues whenever you happen to get stuck.At first the level design in Journey of a Roach seems rather simple, but as you go on they grow complex. The levels are often big and have several different branches of items to collect for multiple different puzzles at once. However, instead of overwhelming you, the amount of puzzles allows you to bounce back and forth between them when frustrated, minimizing the time you'll spend blindly wandering about wondering what to do.Solutions for the puzzles, much like the chattering, nonsense voices of the characters in Journey of a Roach, are often silly and happily humorous. At one point I was asked to bring an ant a burger and I fashioned one out of a piece of sponge, a shoe, and a handkerchief in order to continue onward in the story. The game ends on an equally laugh-worthy and heartwarming note, making it a great game if you want a quick, light-hearted adventure.			"

												4 / 5 starsBottom Line: This game is a great combination of originality, puzzle solving, surprising humor, endearing artwork, and brevity.You will enjoy this game if you are looking for:A different kind of gameA short gameThe adventure-puzzle genreA chance to support indie developersJourney of a Roach was a game I gambled on and won. I saw it come up as a Steam advertisement, and after having seen a dozen or more “stupid” games being advertised, something in me decided to check out one of them. I picked this up for a few dollars, and it sat unplayed for most of a year.By the time I dusted it off last week, I was pleased to find that it was exactly what I was looking for. Simply put, it is an adventure-puzzle game with a very simple and intuitive interface, and yes, you are a roach.I enjoyed almost every aspect of the game. I laughed, felt sad, smiled, and felt my eyes go wide on a few occasions throughout. It is a short game, but that is something I count as an advantage. I feel that I got everything I wanted out of it and did not waste time on repetitive content.Journey of a Roach is a single-player game, but in retrospect, it would have been fun to sit down with a friend and figure out the puzzles together. For the most part, though, I think it is perfectly great in solitaire.There were a few things that distracted from the fun of Roach. The first thing I encountered was the music. Early in the game, the music is so terrible that it was making me sick. There were bendy, modulated, sickly notes during one puzzle, so I turned it off. By the end, the music was better, but I did not listen to it most of the game just in case.Second, as with any puzzle game, it is very hard to get all of the clues fall within the perfect range of difficulty for a wide range of players. Journey of a Roach did a good job; in fact, most of the time, I realized later that there were subtle clues I missed. Nevertheless, there were a couple of times where I felt quite frustrated. Once, I looked it up after having spent thirty minutes on a single part of a puzzle, and it turned out that an idea I had thought might work but did not realize was actually doable (negative metagame thinking) was the right thing. In the end, this is a minor negative: that things that should be doable are not while others you might not expect are.Third, and this may be the biggest negative for me, the camera follows your perspective at all times. Oh, and you are a roach, remember? I am no entomologist, but it appears roaches can walk on walls and ceilings. If you are even remotely prone to motion sickness, …holy roaches, buckle up. I learned to squint, look away, or lay my head back while exploring certain parts of the game.All things considered, Journey of a Roach is a great game that does exactly what it sets out to do. If you are thinking about it, just buy it and have some fun.			"

												The apocalypse has fallen, Nuclear War has wiped out all traces of human life, but deep underground inside a bomb shelter a host of mutated insects live on... Nope, this isn’t a new Fallout expansion, its Daedalic Entertainment’s Journey of a Roach! This comedy clicker sees the player take on the role of Jim the Cockroach, as he puzzles his way through laundry rooms, bars and ventilation shafts on a quest to save his cockroach pal Bud, so they can escape to the surface together and finally experience what life is like on the surface.Visually, the game is a real treat. Cutscenes use comic-strip style storytelling to advance the plot and despite it being released in 2013, the graphics have aged relatively well. Levels are varied and interesting and the cutesy cartoony characters are lovingly and humorously designed - from the war veteran wasp, to the old lady spider and everything in between. Much like Machinarium, the game has no dialogue, or so to speak. Characters communicate using speech bubbles with pictures hinting at what they want, and voices are an adorable mixture of buzzes, bu-be-dees and bo-bi-dos. Combine all of the above with a quirky soundtrack and the game simply oozes humour. It’s cheerful, charming and fun. Gameplay is presented in 2.5D style, which gives the rooms you travel through a great sense of depth, and much to my surprise – Jim has the ability to scale the walls and ceilings. This alone makes every room feel almost twice as big, and adds in a whole new dimension to puzzling and moving around. It can take a little while to get used to at first and in places it can be a little clunky, but in no time at all you’ll find yourself rather smoothly navigating your way around. It’s worth noting too, that the game offers full controller support for even more fluid control as you scuttle around the bomb shelter. Puzzles are fair to reasonable in the difficulty stakes, and some of the item combinations feel very reminiscent of Day of the Tentacle and other old school classics, which is always a good comparison. As the game advances you will run into a few trickier parts, namely a section involving a pylon and a beam of electricity – but on the whole, there isn’t anything too difficult here. Some of the puzzles are designed with the 2.5D/Climbing mechanics in mind too, so what starts out as a little novelty, soon becomes a core gameplay element – much like the ‘thinking with portals’ logic, you’ll soon be making sure you explore every ceiling as well as the floor to help you progress. It’s a pretty unique mechanic for the genre that, for the most part, is pretty well implemented. The game clocks in at about 3 to 4 hours in length for one playthrough, so it is on the shorter end of the spectrum – but that doesn’t feel like any sort of a hindrance. The story is funny, the characters are great, and the puzzles offer a good enough challenge. The little bit of time you’ll spend with Jim on his journey is well paced, and the game certainly never drags or outstays its welcome. There’s a little replay value here too for you 100% completion junkies - I’m not one for achievements myself, so I doubt I’ll be replaying it anytime soon, but for those of you that are, there are plenty in there that challenge you to not only replay the game, but beat it in 18 minutes. Let me know if you manage it!One thing I will point out though, is that considering the length - at £11.99 as I write this, JoaR is slightly on the pricier side, so you may want to wait until it pops up on sale to really squeeze your pennies for every bit of value.All in all though, Journey of a Roach is a short and sweet Point & Clicker that brings in some new twists on the age-old genre. There’s not too many developers in the world that I would say are always a safe bet, but in my eyes, Daedalic are one of them and they’ve delivered yet again with this cute-as-a-button, post-apocalyptic comedy. A good balance between fun and frustrating, solid gameplay mechanics and good design. It may never make it into the videogame hall of fame, but don’t let it pass you by entirely!For more reviews and recommendations then feel free follow my curator page here: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26020279-Pointers-Clickers/  "

												A short game (you even have an achievement for completing it under 18min), but a really funny one. It has some great puzzles, a quite uplifting story with some very charismatic characters full of good intentions, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome.It has the twist that unlike most adventure games you move the character with WASD or arrows keys and use the mouse only to click on what you want to interact with, provided it is within range. As you play a roach, you get to walk around not only on the floor but also on the walls and ceiling, which provides a neat mechanic and some skill based gameplay, as you do have to watch your step sometimes and time your movement.To wrap it up, it is a great game, worth taking a look. Oh, and it has no dialogue, all the clues are drawn and so even the little ones who can't read can enjoy the story.			"

												This is a point and click adventure about Roaches. The name probably gave that away. It is a fun little game, a little on the short side. The humour is great,  although it ventures into the slightly lewd at times, The fun characters and puzzles are accompanied by the undertone of the world having gone through nuclear holocaust. Nothing buts Nuclear Holocaust in giving a game a dark tone. That said the game still manages to be relatively jovial and light-hearted.The story follows two friends trying to make it in a world now ruled by militant ants. With the help of a few friends along the way they battle against the military might of ants. I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Again it was a bit short but the puzzles were varied and interesting. The characters are conveyed through their interactions as no dialogue is used. Speech/thought bubbles are used throughout to help characterize and indicate what you need to do to progress. It is really well done. The graphics and art style fit the game. Also the sounds are excellent, there is no voice acting as such but you get a real feel for the characters for the sounds, screams, etc. that they do make. The""cut scenes"" come in the form of animated ""comic panels"" another style choice of which I approve. If you are a fan of this kind of game I would pick this up. "

												DO NOT BUY IT FOR A FULL PRICE !!!Journey of a Roach is an adventure game that is in my opinion aimed for the more casual players. The game itself is not too long and most puzzles are not very hard, but it is great as light entertainment and a fresh breeze for those who are tired of the conventional scraping for survival post apocalyptic games.The game-play is fairly creative being able (and having to) climb up on walls and ceilings to reach certain objects adds a bit of extra flavor to the conventional rub item A to item B mechanics. I am definitely sure that it's not worth the full price, my price would be no more than 4.99 USD / 3.99 EUR. But I get it in one of my Humble Bundle packages so I can't complain (7/10).			"

												Two roaches going on an adventure. And that's about it. It's where the story both begins and ends.I'm not sure if you could say ""the creators poured their love into the game"".The art is nice and befitting of both the game and its genre as well as the beautiful background music.However that's where the game falls short: The genre.So Journey of a Roach is a Point and Click-Adventure with some puzzles that literally require you to randomly click around in order to find the solution.It is incredibly slow-paced. So much that you could actually say, it's stretching playtime.As for the story:The whole story is completed in less than 2 hours, if you've played the game before probably not even an hour.I approve of Indie studios making their own (maybe first) games, but there's so many better games out that it hurts my feelings to even have wasted 2 hours on this game.If anything you could say I did it for the art style.To sum up:The idea certainly is nice, so is the art, but as far as story telling goes, this game still has a lot to learn.If I'd have to rate it: 4.5/10			"

												The art style in this game is neat.  With the hash marks on the walls, it would almost looks like a Dr. Seuss environment if there were fewer straight lines.The game's shortcoming is its puzzles.  I've got several adventure games under my belt now, but this one had some of the most illogical, silly, pointless puzzles I've ever seen.  A good adventure game sets up a logical progression of events that gets you closer to your end goal, but this particular game ends up rather devious in the way it forces you to think about your surroundings (not in a good way).  I think that the puzzles could be more logical and interesting if the interface were better at explaining how to perform certain actions.  There are no spoken or written words, so your success depends on your ability to interpret the pictures and thought bubbles that appear above characters.  To me, that wasn't very fun.Journey of a Roach tries to be cute, funny, and witty with its few puzzles.  It works for the first half of the game, but in the second half, instead of ramping up the challenge, it ramps up the frustration.  Play a Monkey Island adventure if you want to see witty puzzles done right.			"

												I recently purchased another game that was so awful it was not funny. This then came as a pleasant surprise. It was really fun, cute and a little challenge all in one. Really felt I was in there. Well worth the full asking price never mind 80% off I got it for. Worked with no probs on my Win 7 64bit set up. Very good value.			"

												A puzzle-infested 3D platformer. Pros:+ Inventive mechanics.+ Solid design.+ Memorable characters.+ They play with the myth that cockroaches survive even after a nuclear war.Cons:- Unbalanced puzzles.- Awful, irritating choice of music.- Short.- Childish design/sounds/game elements.Verdict:I think they wanted to make a game that uses awkwardness to it's benefit but they overdid it and it really just looks like a children's game only that the puzzles are so hard that no child will ever play it.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Point and click puzzle game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is a master volume, Sound and music slide bar.There are many many different languages. Almost every language.There are many Resolution sizes.You can play in fullscreen and window mode.You can play this with a xbox controller. (However if you are playing the game with a xbox controller, suddely the keyboard isn't responding anymore.)About the game.You are a Cockroach that moves through the sewers. You will have to complete quests, puzzles and you can even find hidden objects. The puzzles could be tricky at times but not a huge problem. The game is totally kid friendly and has cheerful humor. There is no text conversation but there are bubble conversations. Even for solving puzzles and stuff. the graphics are shell faded with the combination of 3D.You are able to skip cutscenes with ESC.There are multiple save slots.Controls play nicely. i do recommend to play on keyboard then with a controller.The graphics are shellfaded and characters are some what 3D animated.If you press Q, You will open the map. You can also find the cutscenes here again. There is an in-game tutorial. They will tell and learn you new stuff slowly as you move on.Small diagolues are drawn and Semi-animated.Game is somewhat humouristic.You can zoom out with the spacebar button, which will also show ""interacting objects"" in the current area.There are collectables. :(There is no Help or hint button that ""spoil"" it for you. There are only little animation balloons to give a small tip.Other things.Game is kid friendly.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10			"

												I'm a sucker for cute stuff, and by god are these roaches adorable.  That alone made this game rocket quite quickly to my ""top favorite games"" list.  The climbing-on-walls mechanic is really unique; I had no problems with motion sickness, although others have (so be wary of that, I suppose).  The game was funny and happy, with a really sweethearted ending.In short, a wonderfully adorable little game about roaches in a nulear wasteland.			"

												A nice game for younger ones. If you are a huge fan of point and click games, unfortunately you will find it really disappointing over age 10. The puzzles are illogical sometimes which could get you frustrated after a bit of gaming. Most of the time there's only one thing to do at once, so you won't get lost in this game. Hard to give recommendation ... a small yes if you are no older than 10 and a huge no if you are over it.			"

												Any game that has a steam achievement for total completion within 19 minutes must always be taken with a grain of salt. Don't get me wrong the design of this game is novel and intriguing, but if you don't get the nineteen-minute achievement in the first go and you try to play through this game in one go, you will end up blowing chunks.  The main issue with this game is not it's longevity, infact if it were any longer it would have interfered with my longevity; the issue is with the constant and rapid spinning of the screen.  After only 20 minutes of play I guarantee you will be facing serious inner-ear issues.  Great concept - dizzyingly poor delivery.  Apologies for the spelling, steam has no auto-correct and I am too lazy to review my own work (and apparently so are the creators of this game).			"

The graphics and the music are also very nice for an indie game.

												Short and cute adventure game with a pretty innovative movement system that involves walking up walls/ceilings. Daedelic really needs to hire an inbetweener for their 2d animations on games so that the FMV aren't so out of timing with the in-game action IMO. It's kind of jarring to be in a semi-smooth 3d/2d environment and suddenly get slow flipbook style animation where you pause for 3-5 seconds in between frames.			"

												Adventure game in a quirky setting with no dialogue. The setting and world is likeable even though the music is annoying the hell out of me after the first 2 minutes.Puzzles are almost always trial and error, this is the true death sentence for any adventure game. Try to combine all inventory items with each other and then with every object you encounter... so frustrating. Also the controls are nothing but annoying. Additionally, I played through the whole thing in about 2 hours, so vastly overpriced at 7.5 Euro per hour.Not recommended, even for adventure fans. There are million better point and click adventures out there.			"

												I do not recommend this game to players who (like me) like to have proper dialogues. In this game you don't have any text but characters communicate with speech bubbles that contain images that are supposed to describe what a character wants to say. This is just something that I don't like. I prefer normal text-based talking in an adventure game.From a technical prespective this game is well done. The mechanics of climing on the walls are nice but can also be annoying if you have to do a lot of backtracking.So, it's not a bad game but just doesn't meet my taste.			"

												Journey of a Roach is another adventure game that tries to re capture the fun of the classics but will you want to play this game ? In Journey of a Roach you play as a Roach. When youre friend comes back after finding a flower you need to travel to the surface to get the flower before it dies. So how is Journey of a Roach ? Its actually quite fun. Now for the Pros. Cute Art style. The game is present in 3D graphics but its also  presented in 2D comic like strips. You control youre charecter freelly and you can walk around a huge enviroments. The game also has cute voice mumble. The game is alot of fun to play through and theres alot of secrets to find. Also the game has a great soundtrack and a great sense of humor. Now but there is some cons. The game is confusing to navigate. You can walk on walks which becomes tedious when you try to find youre way back to where you wanted to go. The game also has alot of illogical puzzles which might be hard to figure out. The game also has a few bugs. Like charecters disspearing and Sometimes the charecters double. Overall Journey of a Roach is a great adventure game which i suggest you pick up at a sale and not full priced because its kinda short. I give Journey of a Roach a 7/10			"

												Journey of a Roach is the second Cockroach-themed game I've played in the last 3 weeks. What's happening to the games industry right now?Journey of a Roach is a short adventure game (see it like a point n' click game, but with actual freedom of movement) set in a post apocalyptic world governed by radiation worshipping ants. Yeah, sounds believable!The premise is very simple, but quite charming as well. Your one cockroach friend finds a flower in the middle of the barren wasteland the world has become. And he's quite enamored with it, and runs to tell you... But, unfortunately, he falls underground, and is later impriosed by the Ants.And there your journey starts, finding your way into their base to rescue your friend, and finally see the beautiful flower.The presentation of this game was very well done! It's certainly very light-hearted, and even... childish, but in a good way. The only voice-acting is gibberish (in a pretty frantic way, which was funny), and the characters' thoughts is told through pictures and some comic-book like cutscenes.The cartoony art-style is nothing to write home about, but it fits the theme, and it looked good enough. The music was also good in relation to the theme, and the overall vibe of the game, but it's nothing I'd listen to outside of it.The sound design was pretty good, although I could see the voice acting being annoying for some people. I enjoyed it, even with gibberish, they managed to get the point across, and the tonality always fit the character's mood.In this case, I'd say the whole is better than the sum of its parts! Nothing particularly spectacular, but it all works towards the same goal, and it ends up working out.  How's gameplay, then?Well, you work your way down, solving a set of puzzles in each floor. You go around collecting items, and trying to combine them until something works. The solutions are usually pretty over the top, and they make sense only after the fact, which can be a bummer. On the other hand, each area is small enough that you won't be backtracking a lot to experiment with stuff, and everything can easily be solved without feeling too frustrating.One aspect that I hate about point n' click games (which is pretty much the go-to genre for adventure games) is that movement is very limited, and lacks control, is sluggish, etc.This game eliminates that, having you walking with WASD, which I found really good. It may seem a little thing, but it makes a significant difference to me.The problem with the movement, is that, well... you're a cockroach, and so you can crawl on walls and the ceiling. Which results in the world constantly moving around, which gave me some serious motion sickness. And this was probably my main problem with the game, everytime I played it, I felt sick, and so I tried to get done with it as soon as possible (not bothering with completing it after finishing the main story).So, if you have any problems with Motion Sickness in video games... probably pass this one up. Disregard if you think you're fine with it. So. You go to the several rooms of each floor, and try to solve the characters' problems, in a step towards finding your friend.The solutions are all pretty silly, usually leading to a chain of reactions that will be amusing, but certainly not very predictable (which is a minus in the puzzling, but again, it's not a major problem).You'll try to dress up like a radiation-worshipping ant, you'll help a Spider with her baby flies, and you'll launch a nuclear rocket. What could go wrong in this game?!It's a very simple game, and can easily be finished in 2-3 hours in your first playthrough. The story is amusing, it'll make you smile at times, and it's something good not to worry about. If you're interested, get this, enjoy it, and then be done with it. There are also ""secrets"" to reward exploration, and some optional actions for achievement. I haven't bothered with it simply due to motion sickness, but it's good that's it's there!I like Journey of a Roach for what it was. Nothing groundbreaking, but certainly a charming little adventure game.P.S.: There was a sections in which they tried to give the game some sort of challenge (?), in which you had to walk through a vent, with blazing ""fans"" that would get you back to the beginning of the section. However, the perspective was a bit off, and it just felt pointless and out of place. You could easily just not see the fan correctly and get killed. But it was also very short, and once you passed a fan, you could deactivated, so it wasn't frustrating or anything, because of that decision, which was a good call. But still, I have no idea why it was there, it wasn't very good, it was also very short, and overall out of place, with poor perspective. It didn't affect my enjoyment of the game, but it was a design decision that I just didn't understand, so I'll leave it here.			"

												This game is a classic point'n'click, in the spirit of the Monkey Island series, with a twist: being a roach enables you to walk on walls and ceilings. While this is pretty fun at first, it quickly becomes stale because, well, it's a point'n'click. The way you walk is irrelevant.Some puzzles are easy, some difficult, and that's cool, but some are just so abstract that you can only solve them through a tedious process of trial-and-error, which is not good.And suddenly there is the warehouse room where you have to use a machine to move boxes, which adds a stealth mechanism to the game — you get noticed, you go back to cockroach prison. This room is so bugged that it's game breaking. Two ants notice you at the same time? Instead of throwing you to jail, they notice you alternatively in an infinite loop (while you can't move, quit, or access the menu)! An ant notices you while you're behind two stacked boxes? Infinite loop! Meaning that you are stuck, can't do anything, only Alt+F4 gets you out of it. SHAME! I hope for you that you saved the game soon before. This is the room where I stopped playing, out of frustration and dismay.Oh, and let's not forget lack of V-Sync causing MASSIVE screen tearing everytime you move, and the overly cartoonish voices that are just GRATINGLY annoying, and you got there the perfect mix for me not to recommend the game.The spider room was cool though so I'll give an overall... 3,5/10. Bargain.			"

												I grew up on adventure games, back in the days of Monkey Island etc and this game quickly reminded me of why the genre died for a long time.Pixel hunting really really sucks.The game even leads you to believe that it highlights all the items that you can interact with, which screws with you even realising that you need to pixel hunt in this game.The puzzles were incredibly easy, the only difficulty in this game was the slow tedious process of going back through areas just to slowly wave the mouse pointer back and forth looking for items that you can pick up. Which isn't fun. Does waving a mouse pointer around sound like fun to anyone?			"

												This game made me want to throw up. That's all I have to say.Actually I'll say a little more:Daedalic Games is a pretty good company that makes point and click games. While most of them are a little too text heavy and tedious, they are over all great games that are bringing back the point and click gaming era .Journey of a Roach however, is not a very good game. While the story line and game play are very innovative, actually playing the game is a different story. Since you are a roach, you can't talk and can climb on walls. After playing only 30 mins, I can still tell you that both of those points are a big issue. 1. They use pictures instead of words as a guide.This is a problem just because i got very confused, very often. 2. Climbing on walls.This would have been a cool feature if only the camera didn't get in the way. (Oh, that dreaded camera! You always have to ruin games for me...) Since the game was way too linear, the camera turned everytime you walked on the wals or ceiling to keep the prospective the same, but all it did was make me want to barf. That is literally the only reason I stoped playing the game. Games should make you queasy. Period.			"

												Nice artwork, decently challenging puzzles, decent story, not worth $15. I bought this for $2 and I would say it's not worth much more than that due to it's length. $15 for a game with less than 4 hours of content is not very worth the money, especially when there are so many great games out for that much. If the game price dropped to $5 I might consider changing my vote to recommend.5/10Gameply was too short and there is really not very much content at all.			"

												Great game,some good puzzles for a point and click, they always have a certain logic behind them (got only stuck once!). Visuals and sound are great in my opinion, characters and story are real cutesy, not a single written word is used in the game which was relaxing in way. The fact you're a roach actually adds to the game with the gimmick that you can walk on walls and ceilings (though it is nothing more then a fun gimmick, cause it isn't corporated into the puzzles that hard). Rather on the short side maybe (took me a little 5 hours to complete the game AND taking time to collect everything), but what it lacks in quantity it compensates in quality. tl;dr You like point and click or want to play a fun short inbetweenergame? Buy this. 8/10			"

												low price: $2.99This game was hard to give a chance after my first impression of Daedalic's point and click adventure, A New Beginning. I got this game in the same bundle and if I had not already played an hour or so of it in the past, I might have thrown it on an indefinite back burner. I'm glad I didn't, because everything about this game makes it worth its time and price. The story is short and to the point, which is what all games should be, if you want to keep playing, avoid the filler levels and just make multiple short games for half the price. Whether you agree with me or not, this game looks awesome, runs super smoothly [even with a controller] and everything about it is very straight forward, although the puzzles can be somewhat difficult if you don't stop to think every once in a while. I'm happy with my experience and feel like the devs accomplished everything they aimed to, it works really well as a story and a game.I spent maybe 6 hours on it total and the reason was mainly that I had a tiny screen. I want to just emphasize that a 13"" macbook screen makes it difficult to see everything you need to interact with, and the controller with a 23"" monitor made the game less troublesome and enjoyable. The gameplay consists of finding items, combining them with other items and combining them with your environment to solve all of the problems that your roach friend encounters as he gets from point a to ...point a.1 The pace is fantastic (although uneven at parts), i never feel like I'm spending too much time in one place and the areas are all different enough to keep you pulled into the story for long periods of time. The end of the game comes long before you want it to, but in almost every case, I prefer that to being in a perpetual state of trying and failing to force myself to finish a game that drags on long past the point where it is entertaining.Enjoy the game, its cheap and easy to do on a lazy afternoon. Overall Score: 8/10			"

												If real roaches were as adorable as the two in this game, I probably wouldn't mind them skittering about.Journey of a Roach is a nice little adventure game that'll probably last about 3 hours your first run. It has an achievement for beating the game start-to-finish in under 18 minutes... so that should be a pretty good indicator of how short it ultimately is. Despite that, it has a ton of charm and the puzzles are just obscure enough without relying on King's Quest style ""guess until you make the right choice"" gameplay.If it's on sale for like $5.00, totally pick it up.

												This game is quite strange in that there's no text, as the cockroaches and other characters talk to each other in gibberish and that's shown to players via drawings in speech bubbles. The gameplay itself is interesting because cockroaches can climb on ALL THE THINGS, so solutions to room puzzles and fiddly situations can be found on ceilings, in pipes, and crawling between rooms. Sometimes it's unclear what to do because of the lack of speech or text, but no good puzzle game was ever obvious in telling a player how to solve it, right? The artwork is well done, the gameplay is quirky and I personally enjoy it, and a lot of the puzzles are decently challenging. It's a good indie title, if you don't feel like spending 17 quid on it, wait for a sale and try it.			"

												Comparing this to other Daedalic games I just feel as if it really falls short. The animation is great and it is a simple little casual game to pass the time but I just feel like you could get more out of playing the Deponia series or night of the rabbit....randals monday etc...for a cheaper price and much longer gameplay story lines and puzzles. I feel like this was a really rushed game that could've been polished more before it's release.			"

												Cute story and artwork, a fun way to neglect my responsibilities and help this little Roach on his journey. Motion sickness prone gamers beware.. I can only get about 15 minutes at a time into the game before needing a break. The camera follows the bug as you walk on walls so the entire screen shifts accept for the roach. However, the gameplay is great enough to keep me coming back.			"

												Journey of a Roach is short but sweet. Unlike a lot of point&click adventure games the puzzles are not the result of ""adventure game logic"", but rather rely on exploring the 3D environment (including up the walls, and across the ceiling). Some of the trickier puzzles use actual line of sight.The characters and visuals of the game are cartoonish and cute (a mix of cel shading and 2D cut-scenes), while the music is light and bouncy.Journey of a Roach is a short game coming in at roughly 3 ~ 6 hours for all achievements. A single play through will usually net the majority of the achievements without even trying.  One achievement for completing the game in under 18 minutes usually requires multiple attempts to perfect but is a good indicator of how short the game can be.If there is one minor criticism of the game, it is that manoeuvring around doorways and other edges can be tricky. This is the result of being able to walk up almost every surface, and many other games that have attempted similar things have suffered in the same way.			"

There's great humor (the achievements are funny, too), lovable characters, and a spectacular environment.  If I had known how good this game was before Humble Bundle, I would have gladly shelled out the $14.99. If you're not afraid to try something different, this game deserves a play.			"

												This is a short yet fun point and click adventure game. Playing as a roach allows you to climb on walls and even go upside down. This is the main mechanic of the game and is used heavily to progress through and solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves can be tricky but definitely doable. Graphics and sound wise it’s very charming. The world is fairly detailed and everything was very sharp even at 1440p. Different rooms may have different music or ambient noise. It all works well together. The cutscenes are animated in a cartoon style and are fun to watch. There is no text and no verbal communication. You rely on small picture hints when clicking or hovering over hot spots to understand what is going on. The controls are simply and intuitive. I played with a keyboard and mouse. One great control idea was to put the scroll wheel as one of the actions to bring down your inventory screen. It’s very natural to scroll down in order to…well…scroll down the inventory. I don’t remember that being in other point and click games, so it was a nice addition. Pros+60FPS+Cute characters & “voices”+Controls+Music+Art style & graphics+Fun and sometimes head scratching puzzlesCons+Short!My only wish is that the game was longer. It’ll only take 2-3 hours depending on how quickly you solve the puzzles. There is even a speed runner achievement for <18 minutes, if that tell you anything!A very well done game but the asking price of $15 is too much. Be sure to grab this on sale, you won’t be disappointed. 7/10 Good			"

												Originally I got this in a Humble Bundle, and I have to say I'm quite surprised. Pleasantly so.This is a gem of a point-and-click adventure game that is neither too easy or too hard. There are some places where you may breeze by easily (and I love a good relaxing game like that), as well as others where you'll be stumped for a little bit. The length of stumped time depends on the individual. I've never personally been good at solving puzzles, so it might have taken me longer than it will you.But that's okay! If you like point and click adventures, and a good dose of back-and-forth breeze versus challenge, you'll love this game! Add to it that that the sounds these adorable little creatures make will have you squealing if you've any sense of cuteness.The gameplay itself offers some decent versatility, since you can either use WASD for movement, or just click around. Another fun feature is the thought bubble hints of sorts, though I won't go into more detail than that. The storyline is addictively sweet and genuine, with a lot of character.It's not really a game I can personally pick up and play for the entire day in one stint, but it's definitely not a game I will easily put down after a few minutes (looking at some of the games in my library, especially point-and-click ones, ugh). I keep coming back because it's a very easy-going, wind-down and relax type of game. It's just amazingly well done throughout, and won't tax you for brain or reflex energy.I hate insects, by the way. But after playing this game, it ALMOST makes me not want to kill another cockroach I see. That's how effectively adorable it is. The controls are well done in my book, the inventory is easy to use and not at all laggy or clunky, the achievements are fun to get (even the side ones that aren't necessarily part of the storyline), it has steam trading cards, it has character, it has personality.... What more could you want from a game?! And it's not greedily priced, so I'd definitely say it's worth your money.Choose. A dinner out somewhere that will last you 30 minutes, or a game that will last you many hours? I think people fail to consider the way they'd spend their money otherwise when it comes to games. Definitely recommend!			"

												low price: $2.99This game was hard to give a chance after my first impression of Daedalic's point and click adventure, A New Beginning. I got this game in the same bundle and if I had not already played an hour or so of it in the past, I might have thrown it on an indefinite back burner. I'm glad I didn't, because everything about this game makes it worth its time and price. The story is short and to the point, which is what all games should be, if you want to keep playing, avoid the filler levels and just make multiple short games for half the price. Whether you agree with me or not, this game looks awesome, runs super smoothly [even with a controller] and everything about it is very straight forward, although the puzzles can be somewhat difficult if you don't stop to think every once in a while. I'm happy with my experience and feel like the devs accomplished everything they aimed to, it works really well as a story and a game.I spent maybe 6 hours on it total and the reason was mainly that I had a tiny screen. I want to just emphasize that a 13"" macbook screen makes it difficult to see everything you need to interact with, and the controller with a 23"" monitor made the game less troublesome and enjoyable. The gameplay consists of finding items, combining them with other items and combining them with your environment to solve all of the problems that your roach friend encounters as he gets from point a to ...point a.1 The pace is fantastic (although uneven at parts), i never feel like I'm spending too much time in one place and the areas are all different enough to keep you pulled into the story for long periods of time. The end of the game comes long before you want it to, but in almost every case, I prefer that to being in a perpetual state of trying and failing to force myself to finish a game that drags on long past the point where it is entertaining.Enjoy the game, its cheap and easy to do on a lazy afternoon.

												As can be viewed in the trailer, this game offers a 3D experience playing as a roach. Well, 2.5D, because some obvious wall switches can't be made and you are forced to folllow a set path, which annoyed me big time.The puzzles are not really clever and are often too long (why collect 5 flies in so many ways to progress). When playing, you will walk a l-o-t! There even is an achievement for that called ""Hardcore Walking"". You need to walk 5000 something to get this, but when you need to walk so much to solve puzzles, this one is easy to get.At first, I liked the game very much, but in the end, it became a burden and I used a walkthrough for the last part as I was quite done with walking aimlessly.

The artstyle, environment detail, sound effects, and scurrying along walls and roof help enrich the sense of place. Mechanics hold an alright mix of just trying things out, thinking about things, and quirk. Being a bit quirky does help promote the player's own imagination.			"

You get to walk on walls and ceilings.  Toward the end of the game the logic gets better.Spoiler alert:As an example of non-logical sequences.  You feed a fish radioactive fishfood so it expands and breaks an fish aquarium, just to get a screw driver out of the aquarium.  Which you then of course stab into an electric panel so you can jump a hydro telsa air conduit thingy to the screw driver to power that panel.  Of course.Anyway, pretty fun.  8/10.			"

												This is a good point and click with an easy to use interface.  Puzzles aren't way easy, but not terribly difficult either, and the game is very cute so would be a good introduction to the genre for kids into gaming. I'm not the biggest adventure game player though I do get the itch to play one occasionally and this certainly satisfied the urge.  Total play time for me was just under 4 hours, but your results may vary.			"

												Cool little game.  Glad I picked it up 90% off for a little over $1 because...it is by far the shortest game I have ever played.  Start to finish it takes less than 3 hours.  It has no replayability what so ever.  Once you know what  to do, the game can be completed 100% in under 20 minutes.  Great idea.  Great atmosphere.  Clever story telling....or lack there of.  Too bad the game isn't longer.			"

												Like it.  It is a bit idiosyncratic in it's solutions, so, there isn't really a fluid and reasonable solution sometimes, which can be frustrating.  But Overall, fun, cute, smart. You get to walk on walls and ceilings.  Toward the end of the game the logic gets better.Spoiler alert:As an example of non-logical sequences.  You feed a fish radioactive fishfood so it expands and breaks an fish aquarium, just to get a screw driver out of the aquarium.  Which you then of course stab into an electric panel so you can jump a hydro telsa air conduit thingy to the screw driver to power that panel.  Of course.Anyway, pretty fun.  8/10.			"

												This is a fresh take on a point and click game, but still a point and click at heart. It has a quirky sense of humor running through. Nice clean artwork and the puzzles are not too obscure. Dont be put off by the publisher of this game, it stands out on its own merits. Take a look below to get a feel for the art style and basic game mechanics. (some early puzzels are completed in this)

												EhJourney of a Roach is a point and click adventure game where you are a roach (duh) that needs to find his friend and look for a flower. The story is pretty original but isn't fully fleshed out because the game is so short. The art style of the game is fantastic and the music is great as it fits the areas and rooms well. However, the puzzles are frustrating as you wouldn't really think of the solutions naturally. You have a do a specific thing in a specific way which I wouldn't have normally done. Additionally, the puzzle pieces are easy to miss and it is hard to tell what is what.Overall, the art was good and the story was alright. However, the lack of logical puzzles and obscure solutions kind of ruin it for me.			"

												Being able to play as a roach is enough of an argument to buy the game.+ funny+ original+ smart gameplay with the possibility to walk on walls and ceilings+ possibility to zoom out and see all the interactive items in the area+ no text, hints are drawn- short- hints are not always clear- it's not always obvious which wall you can/can't walk on			"

												$1.5 on sale is a steal, but $15 is definitely too high----------------------------------------------------------------------------Cute little game.  The only problems I have with it are the same as everyone else -it is just a couple of hours too short (only 3 hours when I would be satisfied with 5) and that some of the puzzles don't make much logic.  Other than that, the gameplay is good and the price is good when on SALE ($15 is way too much).  It is over all a little bit of cheap fun.-----------------------------------------------------+ fun+ big sale-  3 hours long-  puzzles unintuitive			"

												This is a short yet fun point and click adventure game. Playing as a roach allows you to climb on walls and even go upside down. This is the main mechanic of the game and is used heavily to progress through and solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves can be tricky but definitely doable. Graphics and sound wise it’s very charming. The world is fairly detailed and everything was very sharp even at 1440p. Different rooms may have different music or ambient noise. It all works well together. The cutscenes are animated in a cartoon style and are fun to watch. There is no text and no verbal communication. You rely on small picture hints when clicking or hovering over hot spots to understand what is going on. The controls are simply and intuitive. I played with a keyboard and mouse. One great control idea was to put the scroll wheel as one of the actions to bring down your inventory screen. It’s very natural to scroll down in order to…well…scroll down the inventory. I don’t remember that being in other point and click games, so it was a nice addition. Pros+60FPS+Cute characters & “voices”+Controls+Music+Art style & graphics+Fun and sometimes head scratching puzzlesCons+Short!My only wish is that the game was longer. It’ll only take 2-3 hours depending on how quickly you solve the puzzles. There is even a speed runner achievement for <18 minutes, if that tell you anything!A very well done game but the asking price of $15 is too much. Be sure to grab this on sale, you won’t be disappointed. 7/10 Good			"

												Wow! I'm really surprised! It's a really good game. Good art, good gameplay, good music and sfx. There's no dialogue, the communication is with pictures (animated!). Really cute. :)The only downside is that the game is too short. There's even an achievement for you to finish the game in 18 minutes - which I didn't get. I finished the game twice, and my second run took 34 minutes.			"

												As an amateur entomologist with specialization in Blattaria (cockroaches), I recommend this game to every child, not only the puzzles in the game help to train the development of logical thinking, but the game itself helps to remove children's fear of cockroaches (due to negative portrayal in education and media) and would encourage the children to learn more about insects, especially entomology.It would be great if the devs can make a part 2 of this game, it shouldn't be difficult to receive support from the universities if it is about entomology.

												That was interesting. Nice idea, nice puzzles- but. Cute graphics, fitting music and sounds, adequate controls- but.But what? Well, let's see. All in all, Journey of a Roach has about everything a good adventure game needs. Even the story, told without one spoken word, is enjoyable in a no-worries fun way. Unfortunately, with just over 3 hours playing time, this game is way too short. In fact, it comes dangerously close to casual game territory (shudder). With the limited replayability value inherent to most puzzle games, that's a place it doesn't belong.It's a pity, really, because there's so much potential there. I hope to see a full size ""Roach"" adventure game in the future- this one is good, but some demos are longer.			"
