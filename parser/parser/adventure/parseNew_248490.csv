												I’m treading the line with this one. Is 1953 a terrible game? No it does have some redeeming features. But it has some little problems punctuated by one MASSIVE issue and I’m left thinking I should dissuade you from making the purchase. There are plenty of adventure games, many right here on Steam, that deserve your attention more. Even when you narrow it down to the “horror”-niche of point-and-click adventure gaming there are other games like Scratches and Dark Falls (or hell, even Amnesia and Penumbra to an extent as long as you are willing to toss the point-and-click out) that are infinitely more enjoyable. But, if you’ve exhausted your options then this game might be worth your time, it’s the bottom of the barrel but it does manage to do a couple things right. Its greatest sin is committing the point-and-click taboo: pixel hunting.  That line is probably enough to send plenty of adventure veterans running for the hills. Pixel hunting is perhaps the biggest factor separating a good game from a sub-par or downright bad one. A good game cleverly takes your eyes to certain things while still being subtle, a bad one requires you to find the exact hit-box on the screen the developers arbitrarily decided to make a key point. Often with little or no sign that you need to interact with that area. And even once you do find it if you haven’t already collected the necessary shiny mcguffin (more pixel hunting) needed to interact with that area, then god help you.1953 starts off down this road instantly when I found myself trapped for about 20-minutes in the first two rooms. Eventually I found a floor panel that you have to pull up. The issue is not only was the panel in complete darkness, with little to suggest anything of note, but the hit-box for selecting it was painfully small. A rather simple puzzle was thus rendered an exercise in frustration based not on my ability to understand what needed to be done, but on the games inability to show me where I needed to go. You don’t need to shepherd your player like a 2-year-old and force their hand, but you do need to give some sort of indication that an area might be important. Rather than expecting me to find the one tiny pixel in an un-notable black floor that forwards the plot. Things open up a bit from there and you get to do a little exploration. But you still find a lot of this happening where you missed that one container from 30-minutes ago. And so now you have to revisit every room and scan it in slow-motion as not to miss the cue that you’re over something important.After that little rant you’d think I’d be hard pressed to say anything good, and don’t get me wrong this is a huge negative that detracts from the enjoyment considerably. But as I said it does some good things. The atmosphere is oppressive and though it’s never frightening it does manage to make you uneasy, despite knowing nothing would happen I still found myself nervous in dark areas. The story (as far as I’ve got) is decent, it’s pretty rote and predictable, but it’s done with enough care that you at least feel invested. Though your surroundings are bland, gun-gray concrete rooms and other traditional industrial clichés they’re all rendered carefully. Machinery is caked in grime, walls have been carefully rendered to have unique pitting instead of repeat textures, and various odds and ends lying about give the impression that the area was lived in at one point. This is backed up by some excellent sound design that throws all sorts of eerie clanks, hums, and hisses at you. Additionally the game occasionally hits a stride where you don’t run into too much of the dreaded pixel hunting and for those brief periods is quite enjoyable. I will mention that most of the puzzles so far have been rather easy, but I also haven’t reached the end-game. So far the challenge has been less about solving the puzzles, and more about finding the necessary items to get the puzzle moving.And in the end that’s what’s running me off. I may never finish 1953 because while I love what they’re trying to do here, every time the atmosphere and story try to soak me in that’s all shot out the window the moment I then have to comb my surroundings with a hawk-eye for 30-minutes to proceed. I want to like the game, it got so much right but when you solve a problem in an adventure game you’re supposed to feel gratified. Part of adventure games is your own wit, but the other part is the cunning developers making you THINK it’s your own wit. Crafting things in such a way as to mentally test you, but not to the point of frustration. And that’s the issue, when I finally solve a problem in 1953 I don’t feel like I’d accomplished anything, I just felt grateful I finally stumbled across the latest key item and can get this over with.And that’s a death sentence for an adventure game, at least for me.

												Status: completed (effectively 100% as linear single narrative)The completion of this game marks the beginning of a new epoch for me. I have had a bit of a magpie instinct over the last couple of years, and have bought almost every bundle and stockpiled my games. Now my library is quite big with the vast majority of games untouched. I have decided to play through all these games and write a review for each, in order to make sure I do not miss any I will be playing them in alphabetical order. I am likely to keep adding bundles and I don't know if I will ever catch up, but it's going to be a lot of fun!So 1953 - KGB Unleashed, do I recommend it?It's only just a yes but with a big asterisk which we will now go into.I personally really enjoyed this game, but I can imagine that it will not be for everyone. This was a game that I wasn't particularly looking forward to when purchasing the bundle. I was expecting it to be a run of the mill great war first person shooter, but initial impressions and cynicism of the gaming industry can be deceiving! Much to my pleasant surprise. The game is actually a lot more like Myst, a modern first person point and click adventure game. This game reminds me a lot of Myst 5 I think it was. It has the same pre rendered backdrops and the same “spherical” looking system. Your character will walk forward and stop in certain spots and you can look all around him with the mouse including up and down and a full 360 rotation. If you hold down the mouse button it rotates faster which I found myself doing a lot. It's a single click to interact with the world, move or pick things up. Right click opens your inventory which shows all the items your character is holding and gives you access to all the documents you have read. The puzzles in this game are very strong. I enjoyed them a lot. Most of the puzzles have quite a cryptic solution, but the documents you read contain clues, and they are just the right balance, the puzzles really are some of the very best I've ever seen in an adventure game as the difficulty to satisfaction ration is spot on. This is a game that will make you think. Which I very much enjoy. There is only one puzzle that relies on trial and error which is kinda a negative however the documents make you aware of this.So why is this game only getting a slight recommendation? Well there are a few reasons. The graphics are fit for purpose but they're not really anything that special, considering they are pre rendered too, although I don't see this as a bad thing. The game has a very eerie and oppressive nature to it, and as such there is a lot of dark rooms with low lighting which makes finding items annoying. Some rooms I had to enter and leave many many times before finding what was actually quite a big item. This is helped somewhat by a cursor that changes when it is moused over something intractable but you do feel that you are back in the old fashioned pixel hunting days. Although this may not be a bad thing, adventure games need a little bit of frustration otherwise they end up far too easy. Also the amount of reading you have to do is likely to annoy some gamers, but that kind of gamer probably doesn't like adventure games. I am someone who likes flavour text, I read all the books I found on skyrim and I read mmo quests so this didn't phase me.  Is this game art?The philosophy behind art is a hard one to pin down on, I used to think that if a game makes you think after you have played it then it qualifies. Something mindless and instant gratification doesn't count using this rule, but can you really say space invaders isn't art? Hmm....well this is a discussion for another time. I do think it is an arty game though! It has a very tense atmosphere and it treats you with respect with its puzzle design. The shadowy operations of the bunker and the more philosophical aspects of this game will give you pause for thought and I expect to take the memories of this game with me for quite some time as I reflect on what was quite a detailed storyline.I can imagine the people who like this game feel the same way as me and the people who dislike it will really hate it. It was a positive experience.6/10 Slightly above average - It's certainly worth a play if you already have it like I do.			"

												At first glance you might be mistaken to believe this is an RPG or Shooter with the subject matter.  However what we have here is a typical point and click adventure game.  Its short clocking in at about 1-3 hours to complete, which is nice as a mini game or proof of concept but not really a full game.  At least in the short time that KGB is with you its fun.  It has decent puzzles with straight foward elements that will be solved easily by adventure vets.  The story is a decent one until the last 80% when it goes off the rails in a roswell aliens sort of way.  I really think a more serious attempt at a plot and about 3x the length would have made this a classic.  There is so much history and cool themes they COULD have used with this story yet for some reason they decided to go silly.  Its poor ending and microsopic length hold back what could have been a very deep and rich adventure game.    My score  = 68/100   Poor to fair			"

 This is a fun point and click game that creates really amazing atmosphere and knows how to show its story rather than bluntly shove it in the players face. I can't understand all the negative reviews for this game, it is overpriced (get it in a bundle or on sale), its short and it is def very frustrating at times (use a walkthrough) but it is fun and creates amazing atmosphere; it lets you inspect and read all kinds of things that explain the setting and flesh out the story, and let you interact with cool things (the radio was my favorite), the music and sound effects build the mood of confusion and isolation, and the graphics are really good. The controls are what you'd expect, you can do everything with the mouse and the game lets you know when you can pick up or interact with something - so no pixel hunting. And speaking of walkthroughs, they should have included one like they did on the disc but you can translate this one: http://www.adventurespel.nl/walk/1953kgb.htmIf you’re a fan of the genre and like creepy claustrophobic games check this out.

												Since adventure games are my favorite genre, I was looking forward to playing this game as it looked really interesting when I first saw it. The game is set in a WW2 Soviet bunker or some kind of an underground facility where the player finds himself trapped in. He knows nothing about how he got there, but we learn throughout the game more and more about him and the world around us. The game is played in first person view.The best thing about this game is the atmosphere, at times I'll admit I had a chill feeling going down my spine, yet there is no real threat in this game. Extremely well done on that part, and the gameplay is what you'd expect of this kind of game.  All the puzzles make sense and you have to find clues in the environment to solve them and are never out of context.The game itself is not very long 4-5 hours to finish and it kind of ends leaving you wanting for more, at least that's how I felt. Too bad, because a proper ending would add more to the overall score.So, to sum everything up:+ great atmosphere+ interesting puzzles+ good story- but ends abruptly- shortI recommend it to all adventure fans looking for a nice, atmospheric game to activate their grey matter. 7 / 10			"

												1953 - KGB Unleashed is a point-and-click adventure that tries to be suspenseful and scary, but the execution comes off weak. I'm still a little confused with the story, especially the ending. I also had a difficult time figuring out several of the puzzles. Many of the clues were overly cryptic. The game is quite short and most of the play time will be spent figuring out these cryptic puzzles and reading random documents. For me, the atmospheric music was the highlight of the game--setting a very eerie mood.Although it wasn't a bad game, I really can't say it's something I enjoyed.""Live your life so that people remember you with a kind word."" Sound advice, but if you can figure out how this fits into what I played, let me know.			"

												I'm a fan of Point and Clicks, I'm a fan of crazy Russian stuff, I'm also a fan of The X-Files. You'd think KGB 1953 would be really fun to play with all those things considered, but it strangely wasn't. It was actually pretty frustrating. I'm left wondering just where the story started and at what point it ends. There are plenty of documents and files to read as you progress through the game to flesh out the situation and provide hints and clues to puzzles (and why you're in the bunker) but you never really get any resolve. It's just one big 'what' moment.One big 'what' moment dotted with lots of smaller 'what' moments in the form of some of the most mind numbingly frantically click and hope puzzles I've experienced in a point and click. Some of them are pretty clever, while the majority rely on you being able to distinguish collectible items from the backgrounds they're hiding in.  So you'll find most of time just clicking and hoping and wondering where the logic/reason was behind the solution. In the end KGB 1953 is a game that should only be experienced by people who want to experience just how odd this game is. Point and click fans might be disappointed by it, and those new to the genre should avoid this completely.			"

												Definitely an interesting game. The gameplay is as simple as it gets and the story is interesting but did leave me with questions. There is not much I can say except that this game requires some serious thinking, the puzzles left me confused for a long time until I went back to my documents to re-read everything or until I decided to look around more and see if there was anything I missed. The enviorment is very atomospheric and immersive, it made me feel a bit paranoid and cautious of everything I did. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys some good old point & click gaming.			"

												While I know about the problem around who should receive the money now, I wasn't aware of it when I activated the game. Anyway, the story is about a Soviet waking up in a strange place, just at the moment when Staline dies. Your goal is to solve puzzles to escape this weird bunker.I don't know why KGB Unleashed but it's clear that the game wants to show secret experiments and that as you lost your memories, you don't even remember how come you've arrived. Besides, you will have many many questions, that will be still unanswered at the end of the game.Anyway, it's a point-&-click game, where you're solving puzzles thanks to clues around - some are easy, others are harder to understand. You're travelling from a room to another room and several times. You're also guided by a mysterious voice.The graphics are correct, though you're into a bunker or an underground facility, meaning that the ambiance is kinda cold as you're alone. Everything is set to make you feel like anything can happen, as if there was a mysterious entity. Anyway, as you're stuck into a KGB secret location, you bet that you'll find an ambiance of ""WTF happened there?"".The voice acting was correct too, like was the soundtrack.1953 is an average adventure game, one that will not mark your memories so much, yet still enjoyable - though some puzzles will require some work. Anyway, while I recommend it, don't forget the controversy surrounding it before making a choice: buying it on Steam or try to find a key elsewhere for a little price.			"

												I actually had high hopes for this one. I'm pretty forgiving of point-and-click games, and honestly more things should make use of the brutal, almost alien Soviet aesthetic. It started well enough, with my character waking up in the bowels of some Cold War bunker with only emergency lighting to guide him. The rooms are pre-rendered and you can pan your view around to examine them, but movement is solely clicking through different static scenes. There is shockingly little to interact with in each scene, and your character will only comment on things that block his progress, and infrequently at that. The atmosphere starts out plenty oppressive and mysterious, but the puzzles and the terrible voice acting quickly do away with that.And my God, the puzzles. It took me over 10 minutes to solve the very first one in the game because you have to find a loose panel under your feet in the dark, and then solve a math problem based on a number you might not have paid any attention to. I quit in the area after that after finding a punch card, a pencil, a key that did not unlock any of the three locked doors nearby, and a radio that you could tune that might be a puzzle. I can't see anyone but the most meticulous puzzling grognards having fun with this.If your dream game is boring, obtuse Soviet MYST, then you might like it. Otherwise don't bother.			"

												1953 - KGB Unleashed is a first-person point & click game that takes place in Moscow at the end of the Stalin era. Your goal is to recover your memories and escape.LikedGraphics. Great art direction, gorgeous art, backgrounds and extreme attention to details.Music. Good sound effects, giving you the feel of really being there.DislikedGraphics. No distinction between interactive and non-interactive objects.Story. You have amnesia, you recover your memories and get out, that's it.Content. Short, they expect you to waste time solving ridiculous puzzles. Too much text and important information mixed with not so important things inside all that text.Gameplay. Unavoidable cut-scenes, that still stuck you long after the audio has finished.Not a horrible game, but due to some weird design choices, there are better options out there. You'll be wandering a lot in circles without a guide, since it's linear and includes pixel hunting.★★☆☆☆ | Disliked it "

												This is a very short (2-3 hours) point-and-click adventure set in a Soviet bunker.  You wake up not knowing how you got there and you try to find your way out through a series of annoying puzzles.I felt the story had potential although the end was stupid; It felt like they were building up to something cool, something that would've made the game worth it, but they just dropped the ball.  It's also pretty annoying how after every cutscene there's about 5-10 seconds of silence where you can't do anything.There's no way this is worth $10, or even the historical low of $2.50, but if you get it in a bundle and have nothing better to play, then whatever.

												Short of it is the devs made game heavily based on story and then didn't finish the story, so I wouldn't recommend it. KGB Unleashed is a horror point and click adventure game, so I'm gonna break this review down by story, puzzles, art direction, and sound design. For those on the fence about buying it, please note that I tried to keep spoilers at a minimum.The story that's there is fun but incomplete. The story is you're a soviet electrician that wakes up stuck in a bunker. Alarms are going off, so either something really bad happened or it's time for a regulated soviet union smoke break. Either way, you probably want out, so that becomes your drive to rifle through everyone's office supplies to try and figure out what your comrades were up to (not your drive to figure out how to exit the bunker somehow.) 90% of the story is presented through documents just lying around, and the other 10% presents itself through glorious C-tier voice acting. What I could make of the overarching story was good fun, but again, by the end I really felt it wasn't finished and that's really hard to look past. It's unreasonable to expect the game to follow up on every little game world detail, but KGB Unleashed introduced concepts that could have had huge ramifications for soviet electric man, then did nothing with them. The ending doesn't acknowledge or talk about anything in the bunker at all, which soured most of experience for me.I didn't care too much about the puzzles. They're very cryptic in the ""I didn't even realize I could do that with the camera"" sort of way. I got stuck in the very first puzzle room for like 30 minutes, so I ended up using a steam guide from then on for the rest of game. That might discredit me quite a lot in talking about this, but having beat it, I can safely guess that I would have given up otherwise. It's a mixed bag of hard puzzles that require ingenuity and puzzles that just require you to figure out what background object isn't just part of the background. The store description for KGB lists ""Staggering puzzles and many challenging mind game"" as a feature, which is accurate, but I would argue that's not really a good selling point in the way it's executed.Art in this game is mostly okay with some sparse highs and lows. Before go on, I feel obligated to point out that there are no resolution options or meaningful graphical settings to change. I'm not sure how average that is for these kinds of indie point and clicks, but I thought that was weird. That being said, stylistically it does achieve it's goal of making you feel like you're wandering around a 1950s soviet bunker. It especially excels when it starts getting into some of the later stages of the game because of how much it contributes to accentuating the fact that you're alone and vulnerable. Moments like that where the art lends itself to a greater purpose are few and far between though. As for the lows, I'm just gonna say all in-engine cutscenes.Sound design is bad. It's really bad in the beginning with the alarm that goes on until you finish the first puzzle. It's nothing I feel that needs in-depth discussion though. Most of the time I didn't think anything of it. In what I felt was this game's highest moment, it opted for no sound.All that being said, I would not recommend this game. If you're looking for a good point and click or a good horror game, this is not what you're looking for.			"

												I'm generally not a big fan of point-and-click type games, and this experience won't change that. However, I did have a thoroughly enjoyable experience thanks to this game immersing me into a largely suspenseful and paranoia-ridden environment. __________________________________________________________________________________________Setting the scene: I wake up in a small room with no memory of how I came to be where I am or any clues as to what my purpose ever was. The only objective being, to escape and find out what happened along the way. Immediately you'll have to dust off your thinking caps and slam those bad boys on, because puzzle-solving is key here. Observe your surroundings, be perceptive, and try to build up the story behind the place. I honestly went in with no expectations and got a fun 4-5 hours out of it. It might seem a little dull at first, but it gets far more interesting in the second half of the game. Some puzzles are easy while others require a little more thought put into how they are solved. A couple times I almost gave up because it didn't seem at all logical. But persevere and you'll get your money's worth. I admit, this game could have been made better in regards to finding certain objects that require you to progress further. It just shouldn't be that hard at some points. But it is and can get quite frustrating finding some small object or knowing how to use it. Another thing that I found this game lacked is a little more closure once you neared the end. Some questions were left unanswered and I really wish they hadn't done that, seeing as how I was so drawn in by the atmosphere and dark story-telling. Overall, I would recommend this to people who enjoy adventure games in general, and to those who love a bit of 1950s Soviet-themed (fake) history with legit themes thrown in. I especially enjoyed reading the patient files and information files on the poisonous gases (they turned out to play a part in the game). The radio puzzle was a nice touch, though I'm not sure if the speeches/songs featured on the device are actual recordings or just created specifically for this game. Now, for some inexplicable reason, I seem to have a craving for some creepypasta...			"

												DISCLAIMER: Not a fan of the horror genre or abstract puzzles.Purchased game myself through a bundle deal.1953 - KGB ""Unleashed"" is a rather static feeling point & click semi-horror game set in 1950's Soviet Union.Nothing you haven't seen before in hundreds of other ""restore the power to escape"" horror games.With a cookie-cutter plot:""You have amensia (shocker), you don't where you are or why (gasp!)You only know you are alone and must escape. But of course, your not really alone (you never are in these scenerios).""Graphically the game looks too spartan/clean and just doesn't have enough detail in it to make the world you are in very interesting.The little tid bits of past events you discover are somewhat interesting, but not enough to make you stomach the boring fetch quests and abstract puzzle elements.If I had a $1 for every horror game that had a super-complex method to just turn on the lights I could retire to the Bahamas.I wish developers who want to make these type of games would stop coming up with puzzles that only someone who made the game would know how to solve, or at least use common sense when asking the player to figure it out. We can not see into your brain's devs! Stop making stupid puzzles that only make sense to you.If I have to look online or try every single item in my inventory no matter how stupid it may seem, just to figure out how to flip a switch, then you have killed any fun or enjoyment the game may have had.The worst sin of this game is the time. Depending on your ability to randomly guess the right solution to the ridiculus puzzles and how well you can do Google searches for the really obscure answers, the game might last you 2 to 3 hours tops. For that little time, and such low enjoyment, you would be better off spending that money on a qualityhorror flick.Anything Good?Well... I can say that as far as ""horror"" aspect goes, this one doesn't really bother me.I have PTSD from events in my past career, so any game with jump scares or the elusive super monster that you can't outrun, outthink or kill is a huge no for me.This games 'horror' is more of the psychological type, which is actually a better way to create fear and unease.Bottom Line:I really can't recommend this game to anyone, even fans horror or obscure puzzles (ya freaks ;) as it costs too much for what little you get.

												You wake up in an underground bunker, the year is 1953. You have no information regarding how you came to be trapped within the cold, concrete walls of this abandoned Soviet project, and you have little memory of your past. Left to uncover the horrors of what occurred here, and you must find a way out. You're alone, or are you? A mysterious voice emanates from an overhead speaker; is he real, or is he in your mind?The set up to 1953 - KGB Unleashed is promising, and it's a pretty unique concept when it comes to point and click titles. Though the game fails abysmally in every category, making it a ""bottom of the barrel"" pick for its genre. It also includes a lot of gameplay features that make even veteran fans of point and clicks cringe. Note that the store page says that this game is horror, but there are very little horror elements to be had; a couple of very fleeting moments could be classified as eerie at best. The title functions in a 3D manner, meaning that you can freely pan your mouse around 360 degrees rather than having a stagnant scene like a lot of point and clicks. The visuals are nice, though the bunker looks far too pristine in my opinion. The audio, music specifically, is practically non-existent save for a couple of scenarios. The on-screen inventory system is probably the least complicated feature of the entire game.The tortuous pixel hunting and terribly ambiguous puzzles are both unforgiving, and unforgivable. Without a guide to follow, most players would likely give up on ever solving the true-to-life KGB mysteries and just resort to a search engine for further historical information. This tedious gameplay mates with excruciatingly dry written text, culminating in an experience that's best left alone entirely. There are tons of documents scattered around the scenes in this game, but many are nefariously long and textbook in quality. You would think learning about the abominable experiments conducted by KGB would be more interesting... but sadly, not in this instance.It all ends with a very confusing, yet uninspired, scene that contradicts the rest of the game; ultimately, an ending that's not worth the hassle of reaching. If you're using a guide, 1953 - KGB Unleashed will last you anywhere from 1-2 hours. If you're not using one, well then may the gaming gods be with you. Perhaps if you enjoy a story that's as dry as the desert itself, or reading textbook-like documents, as well as clicking on literally everything in sight to find what you've missed so you can progress, then this might be the game for you. If none of that sounds fun, well then we're on the same page. Though the idea could've been phenomenal, this is one game that just fails to deliver in every way imaginable.Rating: 1.5/5.0 - It's Bad.𐌕𐋏𐌄 𐋏𐍈𐍂𐍂𐍈𐍂 𐌽𐌄𐌕𐤔𐍈𐍂𐌊 Curator | Group 𐌂𐌋𐌆𐌂𐌊 𐌅𐍈𐍂 𐌾𐍈𐍂𐌄			"

												in a nutshell, a mediocre point and click game in a pseudo-3D environment made of panoramic static images. You'll spend hours on this game simply hunting pixels so you can pick up an unusual assortment of items, and then spend hours still researching by means of reading the wealth of written material in this game in order to pick up hints on how to use said-items, in an attempt to escape an underground Soviet bunker.Potentially quite clever, as it forces you to learn about cold-war-style operations in Russia leading up to Stalin's death, but the inclusion of an all-too-paranormal 'storyline' does little to impress, though to its credit, a couple of scenes are rather dark and intimidating to begin with.I'd actually advocate the use of a step-by-step guide to finish this game, as you'll get the enjoyment of the good bits, without the laborious hunting for pixels and reading through reams of fictitious documents in order to figure out that you need to tune the radio to a particular frequency so you can open a secret door you had no incentive to hunt for.Usual thing - pick it up in a bundle or if it's on sale - but get a guide, and play it that way, you'll thank me later.

												1953 KGB Unleashed is a horror/scary point and click adventure game, the puzzles are hard to follow and the game doesn't show what to do or how to do anything. I ended up having to Youtube tutorials.The game is quite short, 2-3 hours, the game is definitly not worth its full price of $10. The only time you should even consider getting this game is if it is very cheap, and you have nothing else to do. This game isn't recomended, especially with its high price of $10. 3/10			"

												They really did a good job with the atmosphere of the game - the documents and the scenario makes you feel in a Cold War scenario. The puzzles can be frustrating and sometimes, you might have to go to Youtube to figure out how to deal with them or just be patient and read all of the documents you got. Buy it on a sales season, since it is to overpriced.			"

												1953 - KGB Unleashed is a point and click, first person adventure game.  I booted it up the first time, checked the settings menu (there were no advanced settings, just feature called ""Turn off Special Effects"" that didn't explain what it did), couldn't adjust my resolution, started the game, found the mouse drag controls to be not to my liking (couldn't adjust horizontal inversion in settings), attempted the first puzzle, couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do, ended up clicking everything I could see to attempt the puzzle, and couldn't find anything.  Oh, and the loading times are abysmal.15 minutes with this game and I was done.  Wouldn't recommend it.  If you really like point and click adventure games and can overlook poor settings options this might be for you.  There are better point and click adventure games, I'd recommend you go play those instead.			"

												Creepy, atmospheric point and click adventure. Short but challenging, maybe unfairly so. Puzzles are pretty vague and often operate on adventure game logic, so probably just for fans of the genre. I enjoyed my playthrough, but probably only because it came in a bundle. Worth trying out if you happen to already own it.			"

												After finding this game from some bundle I honestly don't remember I thought I'd give it a go. Right off the bat, it commits the cardinal sin of Point-and-Clicks: Pixel Hunting. The only way to start the generator is from one specific angle on one of the 3 screens in the 2nd room, at a tiny hitbox in the floor.It's not that I don't know how to complete these puzzles, it's that they're unnecessarily complicated, awkward, unintuitive and frustrating to boot. I didn't encounter ""use banana with telephone during rain on tuesday"" at any point which is a point in it's favour, but the endless reams of text serving as ""backstory"" don't help either. Yes, the game's setting and art can be atmospheric but that illusion is instantly ruined by the main character talking english in a very thick American accent, when this game is supposedly set in a soviet bunker.The final nail in this game's coffin was the lack of subtitles and inability to change resolution.I would certainly not recommend this game at full price, and unless you're willing to put up with a lot of irritating poor game design choices I can't recommend it in a sale either.

												1953 - KGB Unleashed is an atmospheric point & click adventure that takes 1-3 hours to complete if your very good at puzzles but if your average like me with puzzles then you'll be turning to some help to this game. Anyways from my short experience with this game it had some ok puzzles (There was one part of the game that I liked where you used an eyeball to open a door), great music, The voice actor for the main character's paranoia was ok & an interesting tale about Russian prisoners being experimented on to play as telepathic puppets for Stalin since I read some files about those prisoner's experience with telepathy which involved a lot of torture but the lack of info for the story (There  was a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥to read but the game still didn't explain itself properly story wise) & the ending to this game ♥♥♥♥ing sucked so I don't recommend this game. (There are better point & click games out there but my main issue with this game is the store description where most people would confuse it as a FPS or an RPG but just to keep this short it had a good idea but the devs didn't know what to do with that good idea)			"

												This is a classic style point and click adventure game. I mean it is just like the old ones that used to be popular in the '90's, right down to a fixed aspect ratio of 4:3, and no High Resolution support, which is pretty inexcusable for a PC game that came out in 2012 (2013 US). It is also very short, easily able to be completed within 4-5 hours. It does feature some interesting atmosphere and story, dealing with a sealed and evacuated KGB bunker, many notes you find providing background, furnishings and propaganda posters you find are evocative of the 1950's. The story ultimately revolves around human experimentation, and features a twist near the end, along with a manufactured and unsatisfying ending that doesn't really come off as believable. The game also suffers from the kind of problem many adventure games have had since the original Myst, namely to advance, sometimes you have to do exactly what the game designers had in mind, using the precise tool on a specific piece of equipment, at the specific time the progression allows it, and not before. More than once I couldn't figure out why perfectly logical combinations didn't work, because only one specific one out of the multiple ones that would have worked was programmed to. Also at least one puzzle I couldn't solve because I was apparently trying to solve too early, the event refusing to work until I ran down other, incorrect leads. All in all, the game has zero replay value, and I would say it is worth playing through once, but only if it can be bought for very cheap, like say less than five dollars.			"

1953 - KGB Unleashed - This is the perfect example of a game with so much potential but is ultimately ruined due-to really poor execution. While this game has a deep atmosphere, a dark and intriguing back-story and somewhat realistic graphics, it is all downhill after the first room. The basics are summed up on the store page so we don't need to go into those little details. The game itself is a Point-&-Click puzzle game, a genre that certainly isn't for everybody but can be very enjoyable if done correctly (see Monkey Island for example), 1953 - KGB Unleashed is not one of those games. For starters, the interface and menu style feel really amateur when compared to the rest of the games art style. The puzzles that are presented to you almost instantly are either extremely difficult or make little to no sense, the examples I'm about to give may spoil the game for anybody interested in trying it out so read on at your own risk. One or two of the tasks you have to overcome are relatively easy, such as the voltage puzzle in the first room (even though this involves the dreaded pixel-hunting at first) and there is another puzzle a little bit further in where you have to repair a cable, these are examples of the easier puzzles, and then there are those that make absolutely no sense such as tuning a radio very specifically to open a hidden passage... yes... seriously... these are the instances I'm talking about that make absolutely no sense. You get vague instructions and hints from picking up documents and reading notices as you go through the game, plus you have to look very carefully at everything you come across to get hints and pay close attention to the little details of the rooms you are in to acquire certain objects that are important, or again, pixel-hunting, these aspects are interesting but equally annoying. If it wasn't for an online walkthrough I stumbled across, I don't think I could have ever figured out that the radio tuning opened the secret passage. There is also a part where you have to place a certain object in a certain room atop a certain crate, something that you could only figure out purely by chance / trial and error.Finally, the game is short, very short, the hours of play people build up are purley based on the amount of time it takes you to figure out some of the absurd and extremely difficult puzzles, once you are all clued up and give it another play through, it can be completed in no less than 20 minutes. So that's about it for this game I'm afraid. I don't like giving games negative reviews, really, but all good aspects of this game are hugely overshadowed by all of it's negatives. This could have been something much more, it's a shame. I would say buy it in a sale or a cheap bundle (like I did) if you're still interested in trying it, but it is highly likely that you'll have to consult a walkthrough more than once.			"

												This game has its good parts and its bad parts, like any other game. However I feel like this game is nowhere near worth what the asking price is, and even though I only got it for a buck or two on sale, I still regret buying it.I love cold war era stories, and so I thought this game was right up my alley. It's a point and click, and while I'm usually hesitant to BUY point and click games (some of my favorites like Submachine are free) I saw the cold war style and thought it might be worth the couple dollars it was selling for.Boy was I wrong. This game has a great story (albeit very short) and I thought it was pretty interesting. The puzzles were hard, and kind of abstract, but most point and click games are like that anyways so that's kind of a moot point. The music is pretty awesome, the graphics are beautiful, and the controls are pretty straightforward. The game is pretty reading heavy, and while I'm fine with that, others are not. The biggest gripe I have with this game is the english voice acting, because honestly it's subpar at it's best. You can obviously tell the cinematics are tailored to have the dialogue go on longer, and it seems like the voice actors for the english translation just wanted to get through with it as quickly as possible. The main character had an okay voice, the loudspeaker voice was just laughable because he sounded like he was just reading the lines, and honestly, the best voice actor in the game was the one guy you talk to on the phone for like a minute.The biggest problem overall is the fact that this is a pirated english version of the Russian game ""Phobos 1953"". I don't know if the whole quarrel between the Russian developers and the pirates has been settled, but when I learned about this, I felt wrong buying it, even if it was like two bucks. Overall, don't buy this game. If you are so curious, watch a playthrough of it online or something. Just don't buy it, it will be a waste of your money.			"

												My recommendation for you is buying this game when it's heavily discounted, and then finish it by using a walkthrough in your Steam Browser (I used this excellent guide: https://joen1blog.wordpress.com/2012/07/06/1953-kgb-unleashed-walkthrough/). I'm saying this because the puzzles are way, way too hard for a casual gamer or a gamer who doesn't usually play these kind of games (like me). By using a walkthrough, I was able to enjoy the atmosphere and the story to he full extent without beating myself over the puzzles. The atmosphere is terrific. You can feel the desolation, desperation and hopelessness in the claustophobic environments. The graphics are nice, the sound effects are superb, and the soundtrack fits the game like a glove. The story is very intriguing, and it has a very big potential but the lackluster (though the word lackluster is a massive understatement here) ending ruins the gravity of the setting. It feels like they had to rush the game at the 90% mark. Do I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you're willing to play it like I did. If you're going to solve the puzzles yourself, don't bother with buying this game.			"

												The story was pretty impressive, but in the end it made me laugh by throwing in an eye in the shower. The only thing I liked the game was because of the story and atmosphere. There are many things I didn't like though. If I never opened youtube for some puzzles, I would have probably given up the game right at the very beginning, when I had to use the angle grinder to cut the door. Also the cigarette case puzzle for the safe was another point where I was stuck. Not to mention the leak in the laboratory, when you had to take an antidote. The puzzles were really hard and frustrating, which destoys what the story would build up. After all an ok game for one night, otherwise you will never play it again. I got it in a bundle, so cannot complain about the price. For some people it may be worth to pay the listed price for it, but when it's on sale it's a bargain anyway. It was pretty short, but sometimes depending on how good yo are in resolving puzzels, you may need to check a walkthrough.For the devs: Next time you should put a hint button on the HUD, some people are stuck and there's no clue what they should do next. I don't like the kind of games that make you go on youtube to find out what to do next. It was a bit dissapointing for me. It ruined the wonderful experience I may have had by enjoying the story.

												KGB Unleashed is a mediocre game. It suffers from a classic problem among many adventure games in that the clues and puzzles are simply too obscure. Using a blowtorch on a liquid nitrogen can to activate an electrical switch? Some of the items have annoying primary uses; I spent forever trying to saw a door off, only to realize that I had to use the saw on an electrical switch, to turn it on. Makes sense in the practical sense, but in this context the game was suggesting sawing off an outlet, which makes no sense.The game has a good atmosphere and alright voice acting, but the puzzles' reliance on random items combined with the obscurity of your overall goals were deal-breakers for me. Not a fan. I'm not advocating mindless shooters instead, just a more intuitive puzzle game.			"

It tries to add a supernatural mix toward the end of the game which I found a bit cheesy. The ending was also really boring. I have no desire to play this game again after completing it, and thus deleted it from my computer.I also had to play it in 800x600 resolution for some reason otherwise it would give me a black screen, a resolution I haven't played a game in since the early 2000's.

												I recomend this game only if you enjoy Adventure games. There is some controversy as to whether or not this is an English pirated version of a Russian game. They can sort it out in court. I got this at a bargain price of $2.50, regular price is $10.00. This is an Adventure game done Russian style, The controls are a little different, but you'll get the hang of it. It is a Dark, Mysterious and Creepy game with some challanging puzzles that you will need to crack, just read the documents that you will be picking up as you progress through the game, they provide the clues. The graphics and sound are typical for these types of games. The only bad thing about this game is that it is extremely short. I probably would not pay over $5.00 for it. After you've been through the game once, you could probably go through it in an hour the second time, not much of a replay value.			"

VERY difficult, and to be honest, i don't know if i would have been able to complete this game without using one of the guides. 1953 - KGB Unleased isn't like your everyday  'Point & Click' games, it has that, eary, conscious feeling through-out the whole game, the puzzles are very very hard to solve, especially if you don't have the patience to wait and think things through... like me! Another frustrating thing was, even though there doesn't seem to be the presence of any AI or anything that could be with you, there's a few times where you have to backtrack to a previously searched location to find an item that wasn't there the first time... Besides the frustration for the first hour or so before consulting a guide, it's worth a play, providing you can get it cheaper than the top price, the eariness keeps you on your toes from start to finish. 6/10			"

												This was so-so for me, but it's got two rather glaring problems that keep me from recommending it. First, some of the things you need to interact with are very small and/or obscured. In fact, I got stuck in the first five minutes because the thing you need to find is tiny and in a very dark room. Were this a 2D game, I'd call it pixel-hunting. And second, this game is SHORT. I finished it in two and a half hours, and 30 minutes of that was spent pixel-hunting.To be fair, It does some things VERY well, it's got fantastic atmosphere, and the puzzles are clever and fit into the world perfectly. But this game is not worth the purchase price in my opinion.			"

												To be honest, I'm not a fan of pont and click (short: p&c) games, even if I played through of some, like Midnight Nowhere, Atlantis 2 or The Longest Journey. Either had their good points, mostly they had a story, atmosphere or visual. Now KGB Unleashed has these.The visuals are really fine, somewhat photorealistic. The lights and shadows are making the atmosphere creepier, which is a good start from the base of the story. Who haven't heard about the brutality of KGB? Or their interest in paranormality and the borders after ethics in science? Well, the story isn't the strongest part of the game, and could handle more (in fact much more) about this stuff. And thus, it's making a short game, easily played through not even in 3 hours, But hey, the atmosphere makes it up. The puzzles aren't in the game: they are in your head, when you are trying putting together what has happened in that facility and the test subjects...So basicaly, it's a good detective game, making you to think about and putting together the pieces. Never expect he would do it instead of you.			"

												I'm not saying it's a bad game, but it lacks originality, and its kind of boring, unless you're one of those who really likes point-and-click puzzle games. It reminds me very much of those old-school FMV videogame that plagued the SEGA CD. The story  maybe be somewhat good, but the gameplay makes it boring and 4:3 locked resolution and pre-rendered graphics doesn't make it better.			"

												I've always wanted to know what happens to the circus animals when circus's get boycotted? I now have come to realize that they must somehow retire into game design. Welcome to '1953 KGB Unleashed' where nothing makes sense. Seriously! Nothing!Before I start on my usual throw this abomination into the 410 shredder let me just say that there will be spoilers in this rant especially regards to the ending. Personally I feel that I am not ruining anything, but saving mankind in general (never thought of me as a savior did you?) from a fate worse than being locked in a room and forced to watch pride and prejudice.How about we first start off with the mystery that no one knows even if this is an illegal game on Steam or not? A Russian web site link here provided http://gmbox.ru/…/igra-fobos-1953-byla-nelegalno-vypushchen… claims that '1953 KGB Unleashed' is a pirated renamed English copy of their game 'Phobos 1953' and that they have not been payed a single cent for what they are entitled to according to developer George Beloglasov. While other rumors have begun to circulate that the original developing company Phantomery Interactive Studios have since disbanded and again other rumors state that the developers signed over full rights unknowingly to the publishers and have no entitlement. With all that being said, basically no one has any idea what the truth is, as no one has confirmed or denied any of these rumors. In fact some rumors have even stated that the developers knew what a dogs breakfast this game was and even chose to sell all rights to it. What is the real reason? Only time will tell.The game advertises itself as a First Person Adventure and I myself personally bought it under this premise. This is very misleading, it's simply a point and click adventure, a 2d game disguised to look like a 3d game. To be even more precise its an extremely anal pixel hunter as the frames to click on are often so tiny and obscure, that it will often take you a billion random clicks before you find what your suppose to click on. This is done purposefully as the developers themselves know that the game is extremely short and the amount of puzzles needing to be solved are a handful, so they have evidently chosen to stretch the game out by making it a laborious click and find chore.The graphic presentation in this game is actually really well done and more often than not it is nearly quite photogenic. The game begins with Moscow as it would appear during that time period with life buzzing around the streets, the camera then pans down through the ground and into a secret bunker under the streets where the character you play begins to gain consciousness with memory loss as to who he in fact is. Paperwork on him suggests that he is some type of maintenance man and he has awoken in a closed section of the a bunker with a blaring alarm caused through some type of industrial accident.It is actually quite an impressive introduction into the game, but unfortunately then the game begins. First your greeted to the sound of an emergency alarm which is more grating than an alarm clock on a new years hangover. Seriously it just doesn't shut up, couple this with the fact that your in a dark room and you have to find something to click on which is the size of a penny does not make for a fun time.As you progress further through this bunker your character begins to remember that he was in fact a maintenance man sworn to secrecy not to divulge any secrets about the experimentation's that they were performing here. He was hired on a whims notice given the task to fix certain machinery which was crucial to 'the experiment' before the accident happened and he awoke. Wandering further and further through the small labyrinth of corridors and rooms you learn of the KGB's secret experiments that range from biological to electro-therapy and even into ESP and telekinesis. Here's where things begin to get creepy. Certain documents littered around the floor show that those being interviewed were able to control objects with their mind and even people, forcing them to do things that they normally would not. They claim that in order to do this they have to empty their mind and that sometimes they can even bring a dark presence back with them.Before you know it, now enters the concept of the supernatural as the 'experiment' that they were fundamentally interested in is communicating with the dead, especially with the people that they had just killed. Your character is then given the task to reproduce the experiment in order to understand fully what was going on.Before I go on, I forgot to mention that you soon discover the fact that your not alone and that there is both someone who is somehow tracking your every movement and communicating to you through the loud speaker. He sounds like Mr Jigsaw from all the 'Saw' movies and talks in riddles as if this is all some sort of test. You further communicate to someone else over the intercom who you find is trapped in another compartment in the bunker.Ok going back. While you recreate the experiment you discover a door where your esp begins to flare up and tells you that there is something extremely evil on the other side of the door. Don't worry you never find out what it is, it might be more of the mysterious shadows that seem to zoom around  and chase you getting your heart all in a flutter.Anyway, after recreating the experiment successfully you mysteriously black out and awaken in another foreign part of the bunker not far from someone who has been freshly murdered, probably the same person you just saved over the intercom. If someone who was part of the original experiments were forcing you to black out and commit these atrocious acts is never really explained, but it is possible.So far the story at this point is somewhat semi plausible and interesting, this is the point where as I can tell two things must have happened. 1) The original developing company here disbanded and 2) The circus animals were allowed to take over and finish it off.Are you seriously ready for this? Your character through the power of his mind he is able to create a subway tunnel to appear in a toilet. Here, he discovers he can do practically anything with the power of his mind given the right fear. In fact he was even able to use a not connected eyeball, place it under the door, and by using the power of his mind, see the lock on the other side of the door, and open it. After creating a whole subway tunnel with the power of his mind, he then goes on to live a normal and happy life. After all this your forced as a gamer to ask yourself 'what the hell is this crap I have just sat through?!'Would you honestly pay a builder who only builds you half a house? This was an awful lot like that. Why would anyone want to buy this when evidently only half a decent job done and the rest of it is just a rushed, cut every corner you can, story?The game was originally designed to be a prequel to this movie.. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489253/ In final Thumbs down for something that could have been very promising, but unfortunately badly orchestrated and even worse delivered.

I had to follow the walkthrough on Youtube for the whole game. Even after I beat the game I still don't fully understand what the game all about. If you are Deaf or want subtitles stay away from this game!Yes I know the store page said it had no subtiles but I got this as part of Humble Bundle.			"

												Atmospheric point and click. You wake up with amnesia, and are trying to piece together your location and purpose. This game is quite short, can be completed in around 2 hours. Most of the story is gathered from picking up documents or the very sparse cutscenes. There is a good eerie atmosphere that permeates throughout.The graphics leave a lot to be desired, and many of the points of interest feel like pixel hunting. The resolution is quite low, which can make objects hard to find. The voice acting can be hard to hear and understand at times.Overall, I don't feel this stands out against the many other great adventure games. It is short enough for a quick playthrough in an evening, but I can't say it's worth the time.Grade: D+			"

												If you look for more Sublustrum style of point'n'click adventure, don't look further. It's exactly the same, but it takes place in 1953's Moscow's underground bunker and revolves around paranormal and human's brain experiments. Again, it's extremely short: about 10 puzzles in few locations. They're logical and you can solve them without looking into solutions or walkthroughs. I think that abandoning the sound-based puzzles helped a lot (you had to have a genius-kind of ear to solve the last Sublustrum's puzzle). The only exception to that is the cigarette-cases order: I would never think of connecting the actual hint with them.The atmosphere though is absolutely stunning. With little budget and resources, the graphics and minimalist effects work great.  I liked the flashlight's effect in a shooting gallery, connected to subtle sound/voice effects. Although extremely short (takes ~3 hours to complete), it offers a solid dose of bonus exploration: notes, reports, photos, book fragments.			"

												A point and click game, with ""puzzles"" which consist of doing round-trip on a small map with bad lighting, to get the right items to reach the next room. The atmosphere is creepy (and well done), the story has potential, but the ending is (really) bad and spoils the entire sensation created so far. The navigation is mediocre at best, each movement also resetting the point of view, which combined with the dark theme, only adds to the confusion.I'd recommend this game to anyone who is used to play puzzle games or escape games without tutorials or any other help and has very good eyesight (as the game sometimes consists of finding small objects in dark rooms). Otherwise, save your money for another game.			"

												Now that I have played through the game once, I have to admit that I am rather disappointed by the final version of that game. the concept and screenshots presented in the greenlight campaign looked promising and made expectations rise that the developer is going to create a first person adventure, mixed with horror and/or mystery elements as well as the appearance of a fearable opponent/monster - set in the 1950's soviet union period.Well, it took me about four hours to complete the game, and the end is, as some reviewers already stated, confusing and dissatisfying. The impression that I get is that the game was cut somewhere in the middle of the story line, for whatever reason. The end and what you experience minutes before just don't fit together.Some players already said they found the puzzles hard to solve. I think that most of the time there is a logical way to solve them - you get a lot of information you need by reading the reports you find. I missed a clear signal that I really solved the puzzle - for example, when I got the right frequency on the radio.About sound and graphics: Although the soundtrack is atmospheric and very generic, the places you visit are insensate and rigid. At one point, you inhalate some sarin which makes up some nice effects like a blur (no, not motion blur.) or blood red framing. but that's it.Graphics are ok, but you don't go for the high end polygon count in a game like that.One groundbreaking gameplay element that should be mentioned implicitly is the door-opening eyeball. You have waited a long time for developers to come up with some nice gameplay thingy that cuts the edge. Simply put the eyeball through a hole to get to the other side from where the door is locked, and the eye will open it for you. nice.If you are not in for the eyeball, I cannot recommend this game at all.

												my lead-ins vary in their quality. I just kind of bang it out, but I make sure it’s at least proper. for this time, going into the game’s dumb title 1953 KGB UNLEASHED, there’s one monument I can give to this game that lets it stand above anything else. the first ten minutes of this 1954 KGB UNLEASHED are the most annoying out of anything, ever. it is dark, so you aren’t allowed to interact with anything, except for certain things. since it’s dark, making out anything is a chore, and once again, when you do make something out, it’s dark still you dork. figuring out what to do isn’t an explorative trial and error, but a frustrating trek of prior knowledge. that wouldn’t nearly make it to the most annoying thing in a videogame ever, however, there’s one other great affliction: a siren is blaring. every second your earholes are graced with BEEEZT BEEEZT BEEEZT BEEEZT beating over your skull that you haven’t solved how to turn on the lights yet. absolutely insulting. maybe, brilliant, in how it’ll never fail to get a rise out of a person.right, so, I’m already majorly off-topic and off-voice for recent track record, so I’ll hit to the heart of the above: the game is pretty good after the opening. just realize it’s absurdly hard. the only adventure game I’ve personally played that came close in abstraction was anchorhead and I know there are many more, so if you want super extra hard puzzles this kgb unleashed has them. its crowning achievement was when it expected you to tune into a very specific station with the proper settings on the radio, alluded from two very different documents, and being on that station opened a door in the cupboard of all the freaking places. absolutely schizophrentic, I love the ideas at play here. however, it could have really benefited from a hint system. it might seem counter-intuitive to their cryptic philosophy, but if the player has no drive to paranoically pour over everything they’ve read in game to make a vague connection, then they will quit. the drive only comes with investment and that’s not something you should expect from twenty minutes of the game.so, it’s not accessible. it doesn’t offer any renovations to the myst formula, quite honestly the movement in the game is oversensitive and confusing, so I conclude that phantomery really didn’t care about engaging the player. the curious dread kgb unleashed instills doesn’t rear until the second half, so it’s not as if it’s interesting to carry itself, especially considering its terrible introduction sequence. in how strictly it adheres to a traditional aesthetic is commendable in note of its logic smashing difficulty. commendability doesn’t equal fun. whether you can stomach the game is up to how much you’ll forgive. despite so much good about the game, it’s forgotten what year we’re in. being traditional is one thing, it is mostly a very good thing, but ignoring modern development in that process is being blind. it wouldn’t have ruined anything to make the game comfortable to play.most striking about the game isn’t its graphics - though they’re close - what’s striking is its very accurate translations of text. excuse me for calling them historical, because I’m not well versed in what the KGB was actually like, to me they read in way that can only be called authentic. the quality of the period documents is on par with the 39 steps and that is a very high compliment. I wanted to find and read all of the papers because I’m a writing nerd. each one kept me rapt with its attention to detail. if anything keeps up the unleashed’s forced russian setting, it is these documents overwhelmingly. interestingly, irritatingly, the translation efforts to the things the characters actually say, you know the game’s story, is pitiful in comparison. nevermind the banal voice acting. I’m getting ahead of myself, there’s some more good to be had.I didn’t know this game was horror. by the way, this game is horror. gotta play games blind that’s the wasnotway. honestly, it’s good horror. it is not ashamed of delving into stereotypes. it’s about paranormal radio frequencies and voices of the dead. super powered ghosts and whatever. it tinkers around with baby philosophy like a good b-rate. most of all, though, it instills actual dread. whenever the lights are off and you have to navigate by flashlight it’s nerve-wracking. ambience will play identical to normal sound effects and you’re not sure if you did something on accident or if… well, if you’re not alone. as you unravel what happened, whatever happened also draws closer to you. you’re stuck being oblivious and unknown, while being overwhelming by the main character’s physical sensations of fear. documents you read cement these symptoms as a common reaction to being in the facility. irrational, absolute fear, that isn’t created by the person, but was bodily - as the unleashed says itself, was always there, pressing down.the art is splendid, if funneled in vision. I can’t comment on its accuracy because I haven’t seen a russian bunker, or been trapped in one!!!, but despite the game’s documents, accuracy really wasn’t their deal. with the palette in mind, phantomery wanted an organic but oppressive environment. they use descension and darkness as tricks to speed it along, because there aren’t very many locations, and nothing up until the end really has any fantastical or shock factor to it. I really liked what I saw in the game and I feel like they could’ve have done it. their ambition to go above and beyond being a warehouse prison never fully materialized though. I stand by that the art is splendid, it is just stuck on a dull note. it works to cement, it’s just not quite impressive. too familiar for a horror game set in somewhere which by all respects should come across as unfamiliar.unleashed’s setting does more harm than good. though I admit I don’t know what was lost in translation, nothing besides the already immortalized documents give any authenticity to some kind of KGB UNLEASHED. you do explore a soviet bunker. beyond that, nothing at all is about soviets, or the KGB. nothing was unleashed. that boils down to a poor title choice, which is something I don’t need to rip at too much. what does exist is an absolute contrast to the writing found in the documents. the main character and the few people he converses with are unconvincingly acted with generic motivations, the rooms could have been part of any underground installation, and the paranormal aspects of the story don’t depend on being rooted in the past. the greatness of its accuracy becomes a weapon against itself because none of the game relies on it. it’s just situated, reminding you that this is about the KGB UNLEASHED, in a place that has no trace of the kgb. without all of the narrative linking up, the game’s purpose falls a little limp.what 1953 kgb unleashed delivers is a no-holds barred, no luxury given, absolutely traditional point-n-click with an interesting but not fully developed story. if you can forgive everything for the paranormal, it’ll be more than satisfying, because those aspects are done well. if you lust for a national treasure level of abstraction in your puzzle solving, phantomery has your bases covered. if you’re looking for a polished and sophisticated game, this ain’t got those definitions. if you want to relax, be lightly stimulated, and unwind to a good story, then there’s hundreds of other games to play. the unfriendliness and uncomfortability of unleashed drives in its oppressive atmosphere, yet that’s defending bad design choices in retrospect, masking their lack of awareness to a greater purpose. I’m alright with doing that. it’s a hell of a disorientating ride, its bad gives its good the proper momentum to overwhelm, and that it does.			"

												It looks great and the actual interaction interface is very well done. The mouse pointer gives you sufficient feedback and you don't need the keyboard. These are good things. But I've played a lot of adventure games, point and click games, escape games etc and this one does one very important thing wrong. Puzzles that make no sense.I don't want to spoil the game but here's an example that happens soon after you start playing, a puzzle that requires the player to combine random number found in random place with another random number found in random place in a random machine for something to happen. I can see where the developers were trying to do, they certainly are influenced by the same games I played. But the context has a strong influence on how to construct the puzzles. For example, in a more abstract game I'm in a white room with geometric shapes on the north wall and numbers on the south wall, then there's a door requesting a number code. In this context I know the numbers are connected to the shapes on the opposing wall, I can infer that information from the context, basically because that's all it gives me. But in KGB unleashed I'm in a bunker, reading diaries and magazines, I need more information in order to connect the pieces together. The fact that these numbers are on the same wall mean nothing here, I need to know who built the machine and what was important to him. Did he like football? maybe that football poster over there has a clue! That kind of thinking makes sense. Finding the combination by trial and error is not solving the puzzle.			"

A narration on how all you did was *spoiler alert* meaningless and does not influence the rest of your life at all *end of spoiler, if you can call that a spoiler*Oh, and it leaves loose ends all around, so if you want a story that has a good start, a good plot, and a good ending, look elsewhere, cause this one does not have any of those.Did I mention it lasts between 3 and 4 hours?The only redeeming factor of this game are its nice aestethics and ambients. Watch a HD playtrough of the game without commentaries and you will get the same experience as if you were playing it, except you can use those $10 on something that is actually worth it.			"

												Sadly I can't recommend this game.Pros: The mood, atmosphere and music for this game were all great. I love when games provide a lot of extra information in the form of notes and journals, and this game has a lot of it. Some of the puzzles were great.Cons: A LOT of the puzzles often come down to random guesswork. There are also a lot of situations where if you don't drag your mouse across the entire screen, you won't find some small vital piece of something. This is just not a great puzzle game. Since this is the central gameplay, it should be more solid.Some of the written material could've been better (the ""Confrence Room"" sign is one of the many notable editing errors). It felt like these materials were ambitious in scope, but could have used a lot more work. The books and magazines felt especially rushed.Overall this game was more frustration and looking at walkthroughs than it was enjoyable gameplay.			"

												The game is too short and the puzzles are obscure (even by point and click standards.) It's a short game but most of my gaming hours into it came from confusion rather than game play. The art style is wonderful, though, and the music really sets the scene. I wouldn't, however, recomend it. I got it as part of a bundle, so I can't complain about its' purchase, but if I had paid for price for it as a single title I would have felt ripped off. I think you'd have to be a hardcore fan of point and clicks, and the film this is based off of, for this game to be worth its' price tag.			"

												I'm not an usual Point-and-click adventure player so at the start of the game I felt a bit lost. However, as I moved on and got to know more about the story, I became more engaged and things started to make a whole lot more sense.The game graphics, sound effects, puzzles and documents all come together to effectively delivery an ominous and opressive atmosphere which very much matches the atmosphere you'd expect from a deserted bunker.Some of the puzzles are quite accessible while others proved very challenging. You can solve all of them without resorting to guessing and random experimentation but some might have elements that confuse you more than they help you (""check button"", I'm looking at you). Reading and paying attention to all the documentation and notice boards is critical to your success and make sure to note any unusual writings or numbers.The story of the game was very engaging as you start to collect more data and more information about what was done at the facility and what happened. The ending, however, was kind of awkward and, to be honest, a frank letdown given the direction the story seemed to be taking. And while I appreciate when games/videos do not provide all the details so we are free to use our imagination to try and come up with reasons and explanations, I feel that this game, specially near the end, took many liberties in that regard. My playthrough took close to 5 hours but an expert P&C player might be able to do it in less time.Overall, I'd give this a rating of 6/10. And a definite recommendation if you're a fan of the genre.			"

												I didn't enjoy this game. The game was bad and the plot was pointless what they showed at the beginning. Even moving though the story only the second part of level when I got out of the room is what really all I did enjoyed. The rest of the game I had to look up tattorials. The game didn't have much to offer. I rate this game a 1 out of 10, 4. If you like playing games that were just thrown together by all means go a head, maybe you'll enjoy this but I just didn't get that out of this I got so hype at the main menu and my hype just immetly drop because of the gameplay. It just destorys all that hype with the first part third part doesn't take much away from my disspointment only frustation.			"

												Ok, full disclosure, I hate point and click ""adventure"" games - I would rather give myself 1000 paper cuts on my eyeballs than play one. I did not know it was a point and click. However, that being said, it's a god awful point and click. Please see ANYONE ELSE'S REVIEW to see why it's so bad.My pointers to the game designers:1) If it's a point and click, make it EXPLICIT, so no one has to suffer through it.2) Don't make it. If you ever consider making a point and click, you need to stop making games. Maybe you should become a farmer instead.I put myself through a gruelling 10 minutes of wanting to rip off all of my fingernails one by one if it was an alternative... just to leave this review. £6.99? You couldn't pay me £699 to play it. "

												I bought this game thinking it was an interactive story telling game like Dear Esther. It is in fact a point and click game. I have no problem with that, I like a good point and click game. The atmosphere of the game is excellent, very dark and oppressive. The world design is very detailed and complements the atmosphere. However the puzzles themselves are convoluted and frustrating. The story starts off well and builds up the mystery but then never really amounts to anything and the resolution of the story is unsatisfying. It is relatively short too. I think if the story had been fleshed out further and extended this could have been quite and entertaining game but as it stands it just feels like unfulfilled potential.			"

												I Loved this game. Its actually should be called Phobos 1953. It's somewhat cryptic that i had to resolve to a guide :D. But when you figure out its is very rewarding.  It's a short game it took me 3-4 hours. so its not worth full price 9 euro thus get it in bundle or on sale if you can. Story is a bit confusing because it was a mini-game for a movie Phobos is Russia so the budjet wasnt directed to make a game. Thus you needed to watch a movie to undersatnd most of the plot in the game.			"

												Do you enjoy games about Russian history? If so, I might recommend something like S.T.A.L.K.E.R or the Metro series before giving 1953 here a shot. Let me tell you a bit about KGB Unleashed.First things first. I got this game in a bundle, can't recall which, and as such I feel no moral responsibility for owning it. That said, this game was apparently stolen (boosted code, rival developers, whatnot) from the original Russian developers and then put up on Steam, so if you can avoid puchasing it, all the better. If you still feel compelled to play, there are a couple of caveats one should keep in mind.This is largely your standard point and click adventure game, with the unique part being that everything is viewed from a first person perspective. Everything is put together like those weird panorama view pictures everybody thought was so cool in the early 2000's, which to be fair is a neat effect, if not for the fact that nothing stands out. As a result, that boils the game down a glorified pixel hunt. The only way you actually know if something can be interacted with is this little light in your cursor that glows when you hover over something useable. Unfortunately, it doesn't differentiate between things that can be picked up, things that can be looked at, and things that need items, once again causing the general ""flatness"" to be a bit of a hindrance.The overall narrative also seems to be that of suspense and mild, non-supernatural horror, but (and this may just be me) it seems REALLY hard to get invested in the game when it seems like somebody is following me around with four curtains and pressing them up against my face. Atmosphere is tricky to get across in a box.No stars. (I lied. 1 star, for visual style. It may be bad for gameplay, but it at least looks cool.)			"

You wake up somewhere not knowing crap about anything(gee, I've never been in that situation before in any other game at all), and then you solve puzzles.The epilogue? A narration on how all you did was *spoiler alert* meaningless and does not influence the rest of your life at all *end of spoiler, if you can call that a spoiler*Oh, and it leaves loose ends all around, so if you want a story that has a good start, a good plot, and a good ending, look elsewhere, cause this one does not have any of those.Did I mention it lasts between 3 and 4 hours?The only redeeming factor of this game are its nice aestethics and ambients. Watch a HD playtrough of the game without commentaries and you will get the same experience as if you were playing it, except you can use those $10 on something that is actually worth it.			"

												Sadly I can't recommend this game.Pros: The mood, atmosphere and music for this game were all great. I love when games provide a lot of extra information in the form of notes and journals, and this game has a lot of it. Some of the puzzles were great.Cons: A LOT of the puzzles often come down to random guesswork. There are also a lot of situations where if you don't drag your mouse across the entire screen, you won't find some small vital piece of something. This is just not a great puzzle game. Since this is the central gameplay, it should be more solid.Some of the written material could've been better (the ""Confrence Room"" sign is one of the many notable editing errors). It felt like these materials were ambitious in scope, but could have used a lot more work. The books and magazines felt especially rushed.Overall this game was more frustration and looking at walkthroughs than it was enjoyable gameplay.			"

												I didn't make it too far in this game, wasn't able to decipher the clues. Here's an example of one of the clues. 1. There is a date shown on a desktop with the day being March 8th, Sunday. 2. A piece of paper in another location, titled Work Schedule, lists days of the week and names of towns. 3. A bulletin board shows a broadcast that will be taking place for a few months on a certain radio frequency. 4. Press a button on the radio with that frequency then turn the dial to the spot which happens to match the name of one of the town listed on the Work Schedule (Although there are five towns listed on Sunday, you are supposed to know to look at the second one because it's the second Sunday of the month) There is no noise of confirmation that you have done anything correctly at this point. 5. Open a cupboard near the radio. Voila! Secret door leading to the next set of difficult puzzles. Not the game for me. Drawing these disjointed lines between something titled Work Schedule somehow being a secret code on a radio is just now how my brain works.			"

Posted: October 10, 2014
												I’ll be honest, I’m not the biggest fan of point-and-click games, but I do enjoy them on occasion. In KGB Unleashed it’s the usual journey of solving various puzzles and figuring out the meaning of various objects in each room. This game features more of the latter rather than the former. More often than not, I struggled to progress due to the obscurity of some elements, and despite the fact that I agree with the logic of each puzzle and the idea behind it, I believe it could have been far better designed. Many elements were misleading, or failed to emphasise the reason for its use. There are several examples I could give, one of which was a simple switch in a safe which gave no indication of what it did, yet it unlocked a door in another corridor that I did not realise until I had backtracked through most of the game to try and discover its purpose. In another part of the game, you have to descend a trap hole and there is a crate in the hole. Your cursor highlights to indicate there is something you need to do with the crate, but while I spent almost 10 minutes trying to open it, turns out it was actually where you had to put the tape recorder. Confusion like this could have been easily avoided by making the object anything other than a crate; a crate I had to break open not two rooms before.I almost quit outright in frustration upon the first 10 minutes of starting the game. I don’t know if it was just my settings, but the initial two rooms are dark, so you have to strain your eyes to hardly see anything and the incessant alarm tone became annoying and headache inducing very quickly, beating the puzzles to the punch. The game significantly lacks any Russian undertones, with the main character voiced with an English accent. Aside from some radio stations and a few scraps of propaganda, the game could be set in the USA or England and you wouldn’t notice any difference.The ending became downright bizarre, ending very abruptly with little resolution. In the last area, you find a glass (hopefully) eyeball which you roll under a door. You can then look through the eyeball as if by magic and somehow that opens the door. Now here is a big spoiler for you, but the game stops, tells you that guy who has been talking to you is dead and then shoos you out the exit. The exit, by the way, is a subway tunnel that somehow goes directly into a bathroom and the wall just disappears after you pick up a subway token. It almost seems as though the developers gave up at this point, or just didn’t know how to end the game. It was an abrupt and confusing ending that severely jarred the experience.Aside from me failing at puzzles, the game also failed on technical levels in many places. It’s very slow to load, which is very unusual for my high-end PC. It could take as long as ten seconds to load one room, yet I can load Fallout New Vegas with 50+ mods faster. It only had to do this once per room though, which reduced the annoyance, but it’s still unusual for a game of this era. I also had trouble with sluggish cutscenes that left me locked in the cutscene long after the dialouge ceased. There was also no option for subtitles, which was a bit problem for me when there was poor audio quality dialogue and I couldn’t understand what was said, making me miss what may have been important plot points.The game looked decent, and the mood was set as it should have been, but it felt empty and void of any character. With constant backtracking to and from rooms, I tired from walking the same slow corridors over and over. It became a grind and that’s no fun at all.An engine that just isn’t up to scratch, inconsistent gameplay and design ruined this game, which showed great potential. Some may enjoy the puzzles, I know some people who will get more satisfaction from games such as these than I do, but the price, the length of only a mere 2 or 3 hours coupled with all the letdowns made KGB Unleashed a great disappointment.And where was all the Vodka? You can't have Russians without Vodka!			"

												""1953 - KGB Unleashed"" is one of those games that could have been great, but sadly is not. As a point-and-click adventure game, it does create a nice atmosphere. Some of the puzzles did not seem logical to me, so I had to consult outside help (a.k.a. YouTube) to get past them. The voice acting is a bit weak. I expect there was little to no direct given to the actors to let them know the context in which each line would be used in the game. I also had a difficult time understanding one of the voice actors because he was speaking so softly. Curiously, none of the voices have a Russian accent. I noticed several typographical errors in written documents. Given that the game was most likely originally written in Russian and later translated to English, I can understand these mistakes can happen. None of the typos affects the ability to enjoy and play the game, though. The ending is rather abrupt and seems to have been quickly added to complete the game as though finances had ended. Strangely, the ending does not answer any of the questions and seems more like the ending to the film ""Raising Arizona"" than a game titled ""1953 - KGB Unleashed"".All told, I cannot recommend the game at the current price $9.99. I can, however, fully recommend the game if it is on sale or part of a bundle. It is unfortunate that Steam does not have a ""Mixed"" option for the ""Do you recommend this game?"" question.Following is a list of tips that may help you get more enjoyment from the game. Those that do not want help, should skip this section.1. This is not a hidden object game, so do not try to play that way.2. The mouse cursor will change when it is over something with which you can interact.3. If the mouse cursor indicates you can interact with something, but clicking on it does nothing, maybe you need to use something from your inventory.4. The beginning of the game is very dark and I could see very little. After increasing the brightness setting quite a bit in the game's settings, I was able to proceed with the game.5. You will need to do some backtracking, but not an excessive amount.6. Read all of the documents. Not only do they provide a great deal of the post-WWII Russian atmosphere, they also provide clues.

												KGB is a short game about you getting, unfourtantly, stuck in an KGB bunker.  There are a ton of cool elements of suspense, horror, and adventure which never quite connect in the game.  The game definatly shows it's age due to the mind numbingly poor puzzles that it inflicts on the user, at some point you'll just pull the walk through to see if there is some plot or redeeming value to the story.  Unfourtantly the end leaves you asking more questions, resolving very little and either screaming for a second game or determined too leave the player in a stupor.			"

												I'll be honest and say that I bought 1953: KGB Unleashed thinking it'd be a shooter or a Horror game like ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"", so when I found out it was a Point & Click Adventure game, I was a little disappointed and tossed the game aside for nearly a year before giving it a fair shake.When I finally decided to give this game a go, I was pleaseantly surprised. This game has a great atmosphere, well done (albiet tough to follow) puzzles, and really unnerving documents that fit the setting. You really get the sense that you were left for dead in a old Soviet bunker and you're discovering through rooms and the many found documents of brutal experiments and executions that have taken place there. If only the game didn't end so abruptly... Just as you find yourself getting deeper and deeper into the bunker, the game is building up to finding some really horrific stuff... A wall blows up and you walk out and the game ends.. And not only that, the character goes on to narrorate that he lives a long and happy life not once even referencing or questioning the events that took place. It comes so sudden, its almost like you can literally see the point where the devs hit the budget limit. Its a real shame.Regardless of it's awful ending, I do recommend 1953: KGB Unleashed.			"

												1953 - KGB Unleashed is a first-person point n' click that focus on a strong atmosphere and a keen eye to progress.I've finished the game in about 3 hours, and there is not replayability, unless you didn't understand the backstory and want to go back and read through the notes once again.This is a weird game. And it feels rushed at the ending, but I'd say that the path to get there was certainly interesting, at times unexpected.I went into it thinking it was an actual first-person game with free movement. As a result, I was significantly disappointed when I found out it was a point n' click. It makes for a clunky movement throughout the different sections of the game, and the mouse controls feel awkward at times.That said, you can look virtually everywhere around you.The game is set in a Russian bunker in a post-(second)war era. And it feel almost like Russian literature. This game is slow paced and very dense. Prepare for a whole lot of reading and trying to link what you read to the different puzzles within the game. This is not quite a horror game, but it certainly has some moments that might make you uncomfortable. Not too much of that, just enough. Those moment are only psychological, not visual, so worry not if you're sensitive to graphic violence, there's almost none of that.I'll start out by the worst of it. The game is very poor from a technical aspect. I didn't encounter any bugs, or major problems, but the game has no resolution options whatsoever. You play in FullScreen and in a fixed resolution, which is fairly low. Some cutscenes also take way too much down time, after they're over. They always take a few seconds to slowly (very slowly) reposition the camera... It's not a major problem, but it can be very annoying.Now, regarding the graphics. As I said, there are no resolution options, but the game can still look pretty good, and fairly realistic. If you look too closely, texture quality is surely dubious, but unless you're actively trying to do that, the game looks good. It's nothing impressive, since you're inside cimented walls, but the it does the job well. Nothing more, nothing less.Sound design is one of my favourite aspects of this game. Despite having almost no music, everything fitted perfectly. Even when you're reading notes (which you'll do a lot), the background noises never stop, and you can hear sounds from outside from time to time, reminding you of where you are.It's very ambience focused and minimalistic, but I think it was very well done! The game is fully voice acted, but it has no subtitles. One complaint I have with the voice acting is that it sounds American, where it should sound Russian. Since you're in Russia, the voice actor should at least have a characteristic accent... But there's none of that, unfortunately. But aside from that, the voice acting was fairly good.I will not spoil the story here, but I'll say this:It's supposed to be based on real investigations made by russian scientists during the war, and the way the game is structured fits that idea well. But it threads into paranormal territory, which I cannot say for sure wether or not it was even investigated or just game material. Either way, it was interesting, the way the story was told (or rather discovered). It was a bit short and felt rushed by the end, but I think it's a cool idea that could be fleshed out into something really good.Now, the most important part of this game: the puzzles and general pace.As I said, the game is very slow, and there is a lot of reading. But I say this not as a negative, but as a positive. And a warning.This might not be for you. You'll find a lot of notes and papers that either give you little clues to progress, or just some backstory to the game, for you to understand what might have been going on in that bunker. This makes it absolutely necessary to pay attention to everything you read and other world details, otherwise you'll get stuck and frustrated.I've seen some people say that the puzzles are illogical... Don't believe them. At all.The puzzles in this game were far more intelligent that I expected. I liked it. The problem with it is that something, some solutions are very apparent and require you to backtrack to places where you had already been.Your actions do have an impact in other rooms, but it's not very clearly what that impact is, most of the time. And that's the big problem here. One can't be quite sure when he has to go back or is simply missing something.But, that out of the way, every puzzle can be solved if you pay attention to the notes you read and they're very logical, in my opinion.There is no hand holding here. No hints, no anything. I'd recommend using a guide if you're not into solving these puzzles, but I think it takes a good part of this game out of it.This game was definitely a surprise, and despite the technical issues, it's was a very cool experience. The story surely gets weirder and weirder as you go along, but it has interesting ideas! If you're looking for a more psychological point n' click, go ahead and try this one one. But it's very short and doesn't feel quite complete.			"

												Short game. Has an interesting atmosphere. You spend a lot of time seeing if you can interact with things rather than having an idea of where to look. You are sometimes given the sense of urgency, which would tell you to solve a problem as quickly as you can, though you must go through several steps to do it that seem to be counter intuitive to this sense of urgency. The story was very interesting, though, ending is abrupt and almost unrelated to the game at all.Recommend it for maybe $1 or so. Not much bang for your buck. It took me about 2 to 3 hours to complete.			"

												I was going to try to do a couple posts a day for a while but I hit a brick wall this weekend because I felt like absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥due to tooth pain. Oh well. I did manage to get one more game played and I'm on track to beating it before long, if what I've read about it being about 2-3 hours long is accurate.1953 - KGB Unleashed is a first person point and click adventure and it kind of reminds me of Myst. Which is really not a good thing to remind me of. Because I never liked Myst. I don't think it's particularly remarkable, and I think that having the environments completely cluttered with♥♥♥♥♥♥to force you to slowly mouse over everything in every room is a pretty unforgivable design flaw. On top of that, I'm generally annoyed by its tendency to just do huge infodumps on me. I could read the stuff and maybe try to immerse myself more in the thing, but it's honestly just not interesting enough to bother.I don't think it's a really BAD game, I just don't think that it's very well made and the atmosphere it tries for doesn't really work and I'd rather play just about any other point and click game ever but i guess that makes me an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												This is an interesting game... The biggest downfall of this game was the fact that the game is very short as far as a story line goes. It attempts to draw out how long it takes you to beat the game by drawing the time out using lots of reading which most of the time doesnt even help you progress in the story. It also makes the puzzles hard without any real hints to try and draw out your time a bit more. When I first started playing it took me a solid ten minutes or so to figure out the controls and what to do.My one passing thought is be sure you save randomly and a lot. Sadly this game doesnt auto save as you progress and while thats not a horrible thing it managed to force me to start over three times because of it. Sometimes it was a crash that took my save other times it was a random bug but most of the time it was a random crash.All that being said I wish that it had more to the story it progressed a little to fast for me to get REALLY into it. Near the end I was just pushing myself to finish it to say I finished the game. While I enjoyed the story behind the game and it seemed like a solid story though short it had a few parts to it that felt more like fillers than a story line it left me a bit confused. As far as the gameplay itself goes it has some enjoyable puzzles that take you a bit of time to figure out. Though after I moved past the few puzzles that were hard around the start as I got near the end and had to ""restart the game"" it only took me a solid 30 min or so to finish the game from start to finish if I skipped all the reading. I feel people that are good with puzzle games this would give you around a solid two hours of gameplay with reading depending on your speed. :)			"

												Just finished this game. I got it through a bundle. It was very difficult and had to watch walkthrough videos to finish it. It looked nice and the atmosphere was great due to the soundtrack (I'd recommend to play it with headphones) but I would be disappointed if I'd paid more than a dollar for it because it's quite a short game.The puzzles are beyond reason, they often make no sense whatsoever. I doubt anyone has finished the game without help.It was however still satisfying to finish it even with help so if it's a game you can obtain cheaply and you like scary, atmospheric, puzzly point-and-click adventure games then I'd recommend it.

												Pretty mediocre, ultra-linear point n click with some uninspired puzzles. To be fair, I'd actually disagree with a lot people saying this game is the ultimate pixel-hunting offender. I don't think the puzzles are good or interesting, but clickboxes for most objects are large enough that if you're just moving your mouse around the screen a couple times attempting to find interactive things, you'll find them.The best thing it has going for it is the atmosphere it creates, undoubtedly. It is genuinely creepy, nervewracking, and just... it just feels wrong at times. Like you're investigating an unholy site that needs to be forgotten, and I suppose that's what the game tries to convey so it succeeds in that respect. The ending is complete and utter♥♥♥♥♥♥and makes 0 sense, and not in a good way where you're asking questions. In a completely anti-climactic way that makes you wonder why you wasted your 4 hours. Probably one of the worst, most ""OK! Cut! We're outta money/ideas"" endings I've ever seen in any piece of media--movie, video game, book, tv...anything. It's awful.Sorta just not really worth the time.________________________________________Pros:-Creepy, unnerving atmosphere.Cons:-The worst, most awful, dumb ending that shouldn't have made it into a product that leans on it's narrative and theme.-Boring, dumb, occassionally unintuitve puzzles. Nothing hard enough to make you go insane in my opinion, at least in the general landscape of point n clicks. But just uninteresting, generally.			"

I used to play games like this a lot, and I'd say I'd still have no idea what to do at some points without a solution. Overall, can be good if you grab it cheaply/in the bundle, but I wouldn't pay full price.			"

												A challenging point and click game with an great and intense atmosphere.The riddles are fair but not too easy to solve, the art is pretty original and the story seizes the idea of a project, wich can easily be compared to real military projects of the 50s.That makes the game pretty immersive.Though, it is a really short game and 9€ are too much for it in my opinion.I'd still highly recommend this title, if you can grab it on sale or something.

												KGB : Unleashed is a pretty descent ""point-and-click"" game. Combining a solitary experience, with atmospheric music and a grim setting, makes way for a compelling game, filled with puzzles designed to excert your brain. However, what starts off as a great game seems ruined by a rushed ending, which I find is the most important impressional part of a game. Despite the ending and the short length, the game remains a great experience recommended for ""point-and-click"" players. Just hunt for it when it comes on special.			"

												A neat point-and-click game. The puzzles themselves can be quite tricky if you're not an avid point-and-click adventure player, not really holding your hand, but still giving some (sometimes not so) subtle hints occasionally.I can't say much about the story, I've already forgotten most of it, but that's most likely not the game's fault. The game is pretty short, you can almost count the amount of rooms with your hands. Still, you'll probably spend at least a couple hours figuring out the puzzles.Overall, for the amount of gameplay you get, the base value of the game might be a bit steep.			"

												This is one of the most dissapointing games I have ever played. I wont over- embellish, but let me sum up why I am so dissatisfied with it. Main point - it is so short that it literally felt like the demo version. In fact, I have played games whose demo is longer than this entire game. You are thrown into the game as quickly as you are thrown out. There is no ""welcome to the game"" feel. Most games slowly set you up with simple tasks which prepare you for more challenging ones later on. With this you are thrown into a stagnant, colorless environment where nothing stand out, making it very frustrating when it came to solving a puzzle. The game actually started to get amazingly engaging and exciting. The music and sound effects are excellent, as was the direction of the story. This game really has amazing potential, but it ended so fast that it felt entirely meaningless. It is a weak, easy-to-forget game, simply because I just played and paid for a demo. Not recommended.

												Developed by Phantomery Interactive, 1953 – KGB Unleashed is a tense and atmospheric First Person Adventure set deep within the bowels of a Soviet bunker during the Cold War. Players must uncover the dark and horrifc secrets buried within, fighting their own paranoia along the way as well as the possibility of all-too-real terrors within the bunker. Are the voices emanating from all around you real, or just an hallucination resulting from your isolation? Will you manage to escape into the warm embrace of daylight, or will you be trapped within the foreboding menace of the bunker? Only in 1953 – KGB Unleashed can the answers be found! “1953 – KGB Unleashed” is based on real projects conducted by the Ministry of State Security of the USSR (the former KGB). During that time they pushed the limits of human endurance, testing for the possibility of telepathy, as well as researching the psychological impact of fear on the human brain. The photo-realistic visual style of “1953 – KGB Unleashed” recreates the USSR of the fifties: the underground shelter’s interior is constructed using real Soviet military plans, and the materials found there are based on historically valid documents. Explore a hidden laboratory where such experiments were conducted in order to learn the truth behind the terrifying events that led to the closure of the project and the liquidation of its staff. An atmosphere of isolation and suspense pervades throughout, bringing you face to face with your own fears, while the voice of invisible “observer” broadcasts over the internal communications system. Is this observer a friend, or an enemy? Your exploration of this perfectly-preserved complex may uncover what these experiments unlocked deep within the human psyche — but will you survive these revelations intact?			"

												This game is BORINGGGGG. Boring rooms, boring puzzles. It was so hard for Lexi and I to find out where to go. And the means of solving puzzles = you having to write down all these numbers and specific words. Pretty brutal. The most annoying things we're the 20 second pauses after a cutscene and someone talking. You cant move at all after those for some reason. Then the area of the game with the projector that would not let us put the damn card on it. This game was very frustrating and didn't make us want to keep playing it at all.Here's our gameplay video for those interested!

												In the little time I invested in this game, I somehow fell in love with it.I guess it's my strange fondness of cheap, bizzare, not necessarily too good, video games.It isn't anything too impressive, your classic low-budget point and click game if you look at it from technical aspects.Still, 1953 - KGB Unleashed does a good job with creating an atmosphere like no many adventure games do these days. I wouldn't describe it as a ""horror"" title, but it's definitely eerie and would make you feel isolated and uncomfortably tensed.The story started a little bland to my taste but it gets interesting. Not stunning, but intriguing enough.The game usually reveals the story througg notes and reports scattered around you, much more the your traditional dialogues and cutscenes which are almost completely absent in this product.The puzzles here are clever, a little too clever, and obscure at times. I difinitely wouldn't beat the game without a walkthrough, although I do think it's possible, if only you'd be REALLY persistnet about it. I wasn't.I've still enjoyed playing it, the little parts I solved on my own and the other parts I solved by reading a walkthrough.For the current price, it's worth it, if only for the great atmosphere and feeling and the little story it has.I must warn you though, if you've read this far, the ending kind of ruins it all. No spoilers here, but really, don't expect too much.This is a game for those who'd appreciate a good atmosphere (getting a little repetitive am i?..), which would really want to take it in, enjoy the exploration and investigation, and wouldn't mind spending 2-3 hours of their time on this unusual adventure.

												A Russian Myst clone with a seriously creepy cold war-horror vibe.  Play it for the atmosphere.  It's short and worth that alone.The puzzles are not hard, but like a lot of Russian games tend to be obtuse at first and often give little to no indication when you do them correctly.Still I mostly enjoyed playing this game for its attention to detail and the level of effort put into fleshing out the world.

												To be honest I'm quite dissapointed in the game, partly because of my expectations though.Its a very short P&C game that you can complete in under 2 hours.I'd guess I'm dissapointed cause of how great the idea is and compaired to that how poorly executed. That and the price is way off.Don't get me wrong, if you can score this game for anything under 2-3 bucks and like P&C games, I'd recommand you'd get it anyhow.In general I'd not recommand it cause I doubd only I'd have the expectation and reality bump when playing it.

												I enjoyed most of my time, but the rest of it was filled with annoyance/frustration of poor game flow and lack of a simple guidance.The game simply drops you in, and you gather knowledge of the story by reading notes scattered about. In fact, most of the clues for the ""puzzles"" require you to pay attention to the surroundings and decipher some things on your own, which I did like.But as other reviewers have noted, there were many parts where it's not easily known where to go and what is needed (I had to use the guide a few times just to get over the mindless wandering, much credit to Vic=HKC= for the great guide.) Is that door unopenable or does it just need a key? This box shows it's interactable, but why? Compound this with new areas sometimes opening but there were no visible/audio clues that tell you so, other than backtracking and reviewing stuff to find out.Personally, although you discover some grim things for the story, I didn't find the game scary/creepy/spooky or whatever at all, whether due to it's age or the fact that nothing much actually happens throughout. Plus it didn't really end on a high note.Overall, it's a decent game if cheap. I'd say your better off with the Amnesia games instead, though.			"

												This is a fairly well made point and click with a pseudo 3-D interface (stretched images, much like Google Street View).The usual puzzle solving and so on keeps you occupied as you go through the story. Unfortunately the developers didn't think people were using PCs as they wrote this game for the PC, so you can't change the resolution (or aspect ratio - so I hope you have kept an old 4:3 CRT monitor in the house if you want to play this). Also for some odd reason they decided to invert the mouse X axis when you hold the button down, which is the complete opposite of modern UI convention, which is just annoying.Lack of scalability and UI convention make this game sadly not enough for a recommendation.

												I don't recall ever buying this game but it seemed interesting at least from the pictures the store page had to offer. After playing it I can say that it was not what I was expecting at all. First off, I strongly believe that the description should include that this title is a ""Point and Click"" game because it just states it is a ""First Person Adventure"" game which is very misleading. After a bit of digging I found out that one of the tags was ""Point & Click"" but it was hidden in the additional tags area which I had to manually click to check. For new buyers who seem mislead by the game's description, just be aware that this title is in fact point and click and not what the description might make you perceive it to be. You will not move around with keys, but move from screen to screen with clicks. As for the game, it is in my opinion not tense at all nor is it the least bit horrifying. It can be atmospheric in terms of ambience at times but it is stricly puzzle based. It's harder for Point and Click games to be tense and scary at times because of the fact that they're simply point and click. Some games have pulled this off successfully but this one unfortunately did not. The puzzles are very cryptic and not unless you're a puzzle guru, you'll be begging for a hint every 5 minutes. I've cleared about 70% of the game before heading to a guide for further assistance. The difficulty of the puzzles ruins the feeling of horror (If there was any) for as you're just sitting there frustrated wondering what the hell you're supposed to be doing. As mentioned, the game is extremely puzzle based. That being said, the game is about 90% puzzle. No matter where you are in the game, you will be there because of a puzzle. It requires some complex thinking that isn't 'impossible' but is mind boggling enough to urge you to find the nearest Google search bar. I'm no puzzle master nor will I ever be. I enjoy puzzles and challenging my mind to an extent but I'm not a strong strategic gamer. I enjoy having a mix of many genres but in this matter, I was being thrown puzzle after puzzle after puzzle. It was fine the first few times but after a while it's like, alright, where's the scares? Is there anything else to the game?The game also states itself to be an adventure game but there is actually little adventuring going on. I guess trudging through a couple bunkers and some tunnels can be considered an adventure, you ARE going somewhere. But that's not how most people perceive an ""adventure"" to be. It can (in technicality) be anything that has a destination or objective, but when people hear ""adventure"", they usually associate it with ""action"" which this game lacks much of. But hey, if you love puzzles of all difficulties, and some history about war, and can have complete disregard of any other genre and still have fun, then this might not be too bad for you!The entirity of the game is you running around finding stuff, reading stuff, backtracking with stuff, reading some more stuff, finding some more stuff, putting some stuff with some other stuff, then reading some more stuff, make some final adjustments, move on to a new screen or room, and repeat. There was no build I felt that could possibly make me feel uneasy or even wonder what was going to happen next. The only thing I had thinking was ""When is this game going to be finished"".  In the end, I do not recommend this game because it wasn't my cup of tea. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad game, it's just a preference, but the description of the game is very misleading and that in itself is unacceptable. It is a complex puzzle game with minor elements of adventure and no elements of horror (unless you count ambience as horror). It wasn't what I expect nor what it stated to be (not in the good way) and I can only conclude this review with what I mentioned earlier: ""If you love puzzles of all difficulties, and some history about war, and can have complete disregard of any other genre and still have fun, then this might not be too bad for you.""(For you puzzle gurus that are considering buying the game):The price tag, no no no. Get it on sale, that's criminal.TL;DR: Refer to headline (Blue text).			"

												It’s not a very welcoming game for newbies but seasoned puzzlers will encounter brain-teasing puzzles that test you.The graphics look adequate, it’s easy to know what you’re looking even though puzzle pieces blend into the scenery (both a blessing and a curse). Voice acting does it job to introduce characters and move the plot...even though most of the plot is inferred from scattered pieces of paper and other documents. The story is a mixed bag, the ending is particularily unsatisfying.Movement is room based with directional turns. still with the normal issues,such as objects only being available from a particular angle. Luckily the rooms are rather small.The game excels at the puzzling aspects. Unlike Myst and other games in this vein, you have an inventory, which lends itself to the simpler puzzles in the game. The puzzles themselves are also thought-provoking. For instance, no tips and tricks and no reminders for what you need to find and obtain to complete the puzzle. It’s somewhat more realistic, but at the same time you're not always given a reason for doing these actions.Other situations are just as difficult and less justifiably so.Warning: The game is HEAVY on reading, as it is nessecary to find solutions to some puzzles and to continue on with the storyline.Overall, I’m a sucker for puzzle games and experienced in these adventures. I was stumped several times in my 2 hours and 30 minute playthrough and i can see why some might resort to a walkthrough to help them in a tough situation.Beyond being difficult, puzzles will eventually become solved with some hard-thinking!In conclusion, this game is highly recommended to puzzle gamers who are looking for a challenge.

First, the settings are sorely lacking, there isn't even an option to change the resolution. Second, the game feels directionless almost from the beginning. There are several puzzles that don't seem to offer any indication as to whether they are successfully completed or not.

For new buyers who seem mislead by the game's description, just be aware that this title is in fact point and click and not what the description might make you perceive it to be. You will not move around with keys, but move from screen to screen with clicks. As for the game, it is in my opinion not tense at all nor is it the least bit horrifying. It can be atmospheric in terms of ambience at times but it is stricly puzzle based. It's harder for Point and Click games to be tense and scary at times because of the fact that they're simply point and click. Some games have pulled this off successfully but this one unfortunately did not. The puzzles are very cryptic and not unless you're a puzzle guru, you'll be begging for a hint every 5 minutes. I've cleared about 70% of the game before heading to a guide for further assistance. The difficulty of the puzzles ruins the feeling of horror (If there was any) for as you're just sitting there frustrated wondering what the hell you're supposed to be doing. As mentioned, the game is extremely puzzle based. That being said, the game is about 90% puzzle. No matter where you are in the game, you will be there because of a puzzle. It requires some complex thinking that isn't 'impossible' but is mind boggling enough to urge you to find the nearest Google search bar. I'm no puzzle master nor will I ever be. I enjoy puzzles and challenging my mind to an extent but I'm not a strong strategic gamer. I enjoy having a mix of many genres but in this matter, I was being thrown puzzle after puzzle after puzzle. It was fine the first few times but after a while it's like, alright, where's the scares? Is there anything else to the game?The game also states itself to be an adventure game but there is actually little adventuring going on. I guess trudging through a couple bunkers and some tunnels can be considered an adventure, you ARE going somewhere. But that's not how most people perceive an ""adventure"" to be. It can (in technicality) be anything that has a destination or objective, but when people hear ""adventure"", they usually associate it with ""action"" which this game lacks much of. But hey, if you love puzzles of all difficulties, and some history about war, and can have complete disregard of any other genre and still have fun, then this might not be too bad for you!The entirity of the game is you running around finding stuff, reading stuff, backtracking with stuff, reading some more stuff, finding some more stuff, putting some stuff with some other stuff, then reading some more stuff, make some final adjustments, move on to a new screen or room, and repeat. There was no build I felt that could possibly make me feel uneasy or even wonder what was going to happen next. The only thing I had thinking was ""When is this game going to be finished"".  In the end, I do not recommend this game because it wasn't my cup of tea. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad game, it's just a preference, but the description of the game is very misleading and that in itself is unacceptable. It is a complex puzzle game with minor elements of adventure and no elements of horror (unless you count ambience as horror). It wasn't what I expect nor what it stated to be (not in the good way) and I can only conclude this review with what I mentioned earlier: ""If you love puzzles of all difficulties, and some history about war, and can have complete disregard of any other genre and still have fun, then this might not be too bad for you.""(For you puzzle gurus that are considering buying the game):The price tag, no no no. Get it on sale, that's criminal.TL;DR: Refer to headline (Blue text).			"

												It wasn't until toward the end of the game that I started to ""get"" what the story was, but by then I really no longer cared. The puzzles harken back to the days of King's Quest I, where knowing that you can ""eat house"" to progress the story line isn't as abstract as it sounds. Sadly though, where KQ1 has a cute charm to it 1953 - KGB Unleashed has no charm and the voice over lines from the speakers eventually are enough to make you want to scream. The horror of this game is in the English voice over. I finished the game out of pure determination, I don't expect most to get that far. Go pick up the King's Quest series instead of this.			"

												Verdict: MaybeBEEEEEEEEP BEEEEEEEEEEPThis is a point and click adventure with what seemed to be a nice atmosphere. Unfortunately, I couldn't get past the first two rooms and there was an annoying BEEP from a failing generator the whole time.I used to love the Myst games. The thing about the Myst games though is that even when you were stuck, there was always something to /do/. There were interesting sights to see, or things to click that did something. Here, I was stuck in a dark room for 15 minutes.Dani and I wanted to see more, but I'm not sure we have the time to find the hidden clickable areas.			"
