												I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYMORE.This game used to be fun.  Key is USED TO.  If you played in earlier versions you will understand.  Every new patch he changes things to force players to do things his way.  Things that are(were) fun are being nerfed all in the name of because you are not playing the game in his vision.He has removed the ability to craft things manually and now force you to make these one-off machines because these are 'new machines'.  So now players need to make a production chain just to make some of these infrequently used intermediate items instead of allow players to craft by hand which many of has only a single purpose.Not even considering previous nerfs, the current nerfs already announced include the inability(or limited) use of the grapple so they will not work in certain areas as well as the inability to smelt anywhere but on the surface.  AND NO... CC Furnaces does not count as that requires a separate PAID subscription to patreon to access currently.  And the newest nerf announcement of limiting the amount of ores you're allowed to carry so you have to play the game as he sees fit.The nerfs aren't even the largest issue.  The attitude of the developer is just bad.  Many of his replies on this very forum are just condescending replies.  So instead of discussion he would routinely just reply ""You do know there's a machine for that, right?"" or the ever helpful ""You have read the help files, right?""Fundamental changes should have been done from the beginning.  The game has been in Steam's Early Access since 2013, but waits til NOW to make some of these changes.  Which brings up the final point.  All these changes are always justified because of 'serious discussions with other players and we feel it's for the better...' type posts.  These are usually the hardcore players who sit on his daily stream and chats.  These evangelical players are not always the best gauge for tuning and balancing and you will see them defending the developer tooth and nail for these changes on these same forums.  I fully expect many of them to vote down once he tells his stream viewers but many things needed to be said.  IMO if you are interested in logistics and think this is factorio in 3D, you would be sad.  If you wanted a sandbox game, this is not it.  If you enjoy survival, there is only one single aggressive mob in the entire game.  And he's stationary.  99% of your deaths will be because you fell or you stood in fire too long.... or you stood in cold too long.  So if you're wondering about the great number of hours put in, I've played this since v1.  And reading this last round of nerf announcements has finally made me take a step back and reevaluate the game as a whole.  It is no longer fun and for the past several patches this is the direction it's headed with no signs of changing.  And so unfortunately I can no longer recommend the game anymore.I'll re-evaluate the game in some more patches down the line and see if it feels like it's getting better or worse.			"

												Greetings dear reader, and thanks for taking the time to read my input.  Before I proceed, I have a suggestion; Do the following:Step 1.) On the Store page for this game, where it tells you whether the reviews are Positive, Mixed, or Negative, click on that (It says mixed for me right now, but there's no telling what it says for you).Step 2.) You should see a Heading that says ""Helpful customer reviews"".  Observe the filter.  I suggest you click on ""Negative"".Step 3.) Read a few of the negative reviews.  I read about 6 of them and noticed a trend.  See if you notice something as well.Step 4.)  Now, keeping everything you've read in mind, go back to the main store page and scroll down until you find the link on the right that says ""View Update History"".  Compare the content of all those negative comments with what you see now on the update history.Now we may proceed.Did you notice a pattern?  A trend?  My observation was that it appears that the bulk of the negative comments on this game consist of individuals who do not comprehend the meaning of ""Early Access"".  I say this because, before writing this, I did those above steps.  I read what they had to say, and compared it to what the game is now, as of this writing.I found all of their arguments invalid, because they failed to understand that what they were playing was a work in progress.  Their complaints are/were all worded in such a way as if they were reviewing a finished product.All too often, we see detractors whine and complain saying that ""Early Access"" is an ""excuse"" for their poor quality.  I suggest that people who make this argument are either trolling, or lack the intelligence to comprehend what it is they are saying.The entire purpose of Early Access is to allow the community to support and be involved in the direction and development of the game.  If you expect a game to simply spring forth, fully developed with all features intact and no bugs to speak of, then you aren't looking for an early access game at all, but an ordinary full release product like any other of an endless list of games elsewhere.  You cannot influence a game that is already finished. This game was very rudimentry when it was first made available to the public.  Some basic block placement and a creative mode.  That was IT.  Early reviews claimed it was a ""Minecraft Knock-off"" and ""Boring"".  This is why I asked you to read through all the negative reviews.  Because if those people were to say those things about the game now,  any reasonable person would wonder if those people were even playing the same game.  Remember this when someone says that saying ""Early Access is a cheap excuse"".  Because those people obviously lack the reasoning to understand how this system works.There are few games on Steam that I have seen with the level of developer interaction and update frequency observed on this game.  Look at the discussion threads.  You will find that the developers actually engage in conversation with, and consider the input of the players.   That interaction is the POINT of early access.  We as players get to influence how the end-product turns out.  You can't do that with a finished game (barring MODs of course).I have no way of knowing what your experience with survival sandbox games consist of, but if you're reading this review, there's a strong chance that you are not new to it.  If you are new to it, then you are fortunate to arrive on the scene when you have.  The genre has evolved quickly, and it is continuing to do so.This game is still early access as I write this, and that's why I wanted you to follow the steps above before reading what I have to say.  I hope that ultimately, if you do decide to purchase this game regardless of it's state of development, that you will be pleased with the outcome. I myself enjoy this game.  I have watched as new features are added, changed and removed, tweaked, or radically altered.  Ultimately, only you can decide if you like it or not.  But I hope that you'll be able to make a more informed decision whether you want to invest in it's development.  Or if it's done by the time you've read this, only you can decideif it's worth your money.My humble opinion is that it is/will be.   Here's why (took me long enough didn't it?) :FortressCraft Evolved takes the basic block-based voxel genre and adds automation, tech trees to research, and ever increasing risks and rewards for exploration.  Furthermore (depending on the difficulty setting) you'll find complacency to be ill advised.  There are threats looming on the horizon and you can lose.Some of the more rewarding technologies require exloration into hard to reach areas, requiring you to upgrade your survival suit in order to acquire them.  Some of these areas require an investment in infrastructure and defenses.  Whether you are playing single or multiplayer, you'll find the whole thing challenging and rewarding.Again, this is just my experience having played the game from very early development until Early Access 1.20. I have no regrets.			"

												How best to describe this game.  Take the technic mod from Minecraft and make it 100 times better.  This is one of those games that are pretty simple to figure out, but as you progress it gets a bit more complicated.  Mainly this game is all about logistics.  Getting resources transported from your mine to your base so you can smelt it and make new items and do research.  All while defending your base from aliens that attack you if your base threat gets over 100%.  If you like a game about logistics you will love this game.  At first it starts off very slow and you manually do everything, but as you progress you start to automate.  It is when you get to the point where you start automating everything where it can either be a whole ton of fun or a logistics nightmare.  You have to make sure you have enough ore coming in to feed your smelters.  So you are always looking for new veins of ore to tap and send up to your base to be smelted.  Plus having to figure out how to get power down to your mine and also keeping a nice design of your base.  One thing to remember is you can just about move anything except for the CPH and the research station.  So don't be afraid if you build your base one way and want to change it later.  I have done so many redesigns to my bases because I didn't play far enough ahead and had to tear most of it down and rebuild it.I am not going to do a Pro's and Con's list.  Because it is still in early access and things change almost on a daily basis.  Also remember that this game is early access and things do change.  Overall it is a very enjoyable game and I have put in tons of hours into it and I am looking forward to new things as they get added so I can implement them into my base design.  I do recommend you run the Bleeding Edge beta if you are planning to play it because it has all the newest stuff in it.  Also the Dev is really awesome and have talked with him several times and he loves input about the game.  I stream this game and he has watched my stream several times and has even helped me out a few times because I didn't have things setup properly and he walked me through it.  He talks with others in chat in the stream and answers questions people have.  This is the first time I have actually seen a dev actually watch a stream of their own game and ask for feed back from those watching and from the person streaming.  My overall opinion of this game is grab it.  It is ton of fun and you can also play with friends (just gotta open up a port on your router).  One of the few games out there that is truely Co-op.			"

Early Access Review
								Oh boy this game was a bit of a turd when i got my hands on it last week i believe. It was rough, a lot of things didn't function properly and I was confused as hell. Went to the forums and almost 1:1 the dev was posting back and talking, on all the forums I checked. Big ups for that. What about the game? Well its minecraft style construction and world building but that's where the comparison ends. You extract ores to creat ingots to create new machines to support your lazy butt because the name of this game is automation. There's been more than once where I just sat back and let my machines work to produce some ingots i needed or research modules. This game has some serious depth to it and with all my hours I have in the game, they're all in ONE SAVE. Last game I played that let me do that was Dark Souls. So Yeah this game deserves your attention. It doesn't look the best but the gameplay is fulfilling and there's tons to work towards. SOme crack head said one of the end game items was a 20 hour work, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 50 hours in and i ain't got it. I just finished the last of the tech tree so now I get to build the fancy♥♥♥♥♥♥i researched. So pick this up because its worth your money and if you're having issues ask the dev because i've had full conversations with the guy. He's really cool and helpful. He takes your complaints and suggestions into considerations.They fixed more bugs than i can count when I started this game. I love it.			"

												Well after only 900 hours into this game I think its time to write a review. This game SUCKS my time. I can't stop playing it. Every time there is a couple of new updates (at least once a week) I start a new world to see the new stuff. I have yet to finish it. Something new will come along and some of the stuff on the old world just isn't as good, so start again. Every time I get a little bit faster and a little bit further along but I just like to try to build all the items and see how they work. I only wish that you could download all of the different versions to really see how far this game has come. The developers are on the forms constantly updating. The only problems I have ever had with the game is trying to run an old version after a major patch and then some items mess up. So what, start again and see all the new stuff. My favorite part is that I don't have to finish the game to play it. It's not linear. Do what you want. Have fun, mess up, start again.			"

Posted: November 1, 2016
												(TLDR at bottom, if you don't want to read it all.)As far as I can tell, if you read the most helpful negative reviews, you'll find everything I would have said myself (lack of game presentation polish, business practices, rude developer and rude close followers of said developer). Even the ones that are a little aged at this point still ring true in a lot of ways.A lot of people compare this game to Factorio for its similar logistics puzzle/mining and refining automation premise, and to Minecraft because they both have a ""blocky"" world that you can dig around in, I guess. If you liked Factorio, then I feel that these are the main differences you should be aware of before you try Fortresscraft out:-While Factorio is much looser in how it handles player progression (It's there but you don't really have to follow it very closely), Fortresscraft has a far more linear progression path in general. Sure, you can expand your mines, or your filter systems, or anything else when you want to, but the developer has a very strong vision on what he expects you to be doing at X point in the game, and the game is made to remind you of what you should be doing at any given time. Constantly. You may like it, you may hate it. I grew to dislike it, and you can thankfully turn some of it off, but not all of it.-Unlike Factorio's two dimensional world, Fortresscraft incorporates a third dimension into gameplay. This is probably where the Minecraft comparison comes into play. You can build into the sky or dig into the ground for what looks like far longer than it would take to hit any sort of world border, but you should know that there's nothing in the sky (that I know of), and that after a certain depth, there isn't really a point in digging deeper (that I know of).-Fortressscraft is far more complex than Factorio. Sometimes this is interesting and adds some fun to the equation, but there are other times where it feels like needless padding of gametime being moved onto the player. There are a lot of machines that craft one item, and only one item. Some of these machines aren't very used either, just collecting dust until the off time you want it to craft whatever it crafts.While the differences between the two games are largely subjective tastes that you may love or hate, here are some cons that you'll see in many other reviews:-The UI, while often displaying a lot of information to the player, is often unintuitive in how it displays this information, and in my opinion can be quite ugly. It also often lacks basic convenience features found in many other games, such as the more common stack management keybinds. Be prepared to click and drag your items a lot.-Progression is slow for anyone new to the game, or anyone not interested in busywork. There are many systems in the game that function at a snail's pace until you sink in the time and effort to expand your mining or logistics systems considerably, and it often feels like an artificial means of padding the game's gameplay hours for marketing purposes. While some of the information is there, a new player is probably going to have a rough time learning the game's complicated and often nuanced systems. The in-game documentation can help, but seems to often be written from the perspective of someone who already knows the nuances and doesn't really see why they need to be explained, in my opinion. This attitude shows in bright colors if you try to ask for help on the forums, and that's not really just in my opinion. More on that below.-While there are some very nice and helpful people in the general community, you're going to get very familiar with the same gaggle of people who seem so passionate about the game that they come off as passive aggressive, snarky or downright rude. A quick browse of the comments in the review section will show you about a dozen of them. Unfortunately, this attitude is often demonstrated by the developer himself. If you're coming in expecting baseline respect and consideration for you as a community member, or even as a paying customer, you should prepare to be confused and disappointed, especially if you have any questions or constructive criticism of the game. Replies include ""Maybe you just don't have the IQ for this game :)"" and ""Well, it was obvious to me, so I don't see a problem with how it's presented"". There's a small book that could be written on this point, but I won't get that deep into it.TLDR: I don't really want to rant any longer, so I think I have a nice summary of my feelings about this game. In a word, I feel it's all about patience. The game was fun to me after, and only after I was patient with the game's unpolished presentation, the unituitive in-game help system, the pretty steep learning curve that's partially caused by the lacking tutorial/in-game help and the deplorable help often received on the forum, the clunky control scheme, numerous naggings to do exactly what the developer expected me to do in the game, the abysmal way I and others were treated as community members and customers by the developer and his followers, knowing little to none of the concerns or criticisms of the game would ever be taken seriously by anyone not paying into the developer's Patreon, and finally, the clear financial infleunce the developer's refusal to get a job to support the game has on the game itself. The game is still definitely in early access, and being ""released"" was to get more sales. It means absolutely nothing for the game's state. There's work done on the base game still, but the game's clearly going to be sold in DLC parts now. Frozen factory is a huge part of the game and it's looking like there's another DLC release coming soon. No game should be unfun until I'm patient with it and the aspects related to it for a number of hours.Finally, to the four followers and the developer who are undoubtedly going to thumb down and debate this review in the comments like children, I'm just going to tell you now that you shouldn't bother. I have the IQ for the game. I know how to play. I muscled through the crappy tutorial and the crappy UI and watched video after video teaching me what I should've been taught in game. I loved Factorio, so this ""genre"" is for me. I actually enjoy the idea of a more complicated, more content rich Factorio in three dimensions. What I don't enjoy is how this idea was implimented in Fortresscraft. There's too many valid criticisms that are just being ignored, and often openly ridiculed for being provided.Fortresscraft could've not only been as good as Factorio, but it could've easily been better. It feels like such a wasted effort to me, and the fact that Factorio has over 10 times as many concurrent players than FC is completely understandable, not to mention an all time peak that crushes FC's. That's not even mentioning that Factorio has a standalone client off of Steam and it's only been on Steam for a relatively short while, so it's even higher than that.But hey, I'll just take the wise advice I've seen given on these forums. ""Haha. That's great. Please by all means take your attitude elsewhere. We have no need of it here.""			"

												EA Escape review...I have been playing this game on and of since I got it over a year ago, and the following is my thoughts on the game and it's development since then. Pls.forgive spelling :)When I first got the game I saw great potential in this game, I mean.. SPACE, Building, Tower defence, and combat... how could I go wrong. Well I will till you this, my first opinion was a negative review, the game was a resource hog, there wasn't much to do, was able to beat the game to my satisfaction in just one sitting on the weekend (-8 hours). But hey, it was EA and as such I do not give bad reviews to EA games that are still being worked on, because you never know right? However if I had, I would have given the game a 3/10.Over the year I have been part of the ""Bleeding Edge"" bate patch group. AKA the, ""this game is now broken"" patch where new stuff was tested. there were several hickups when patches were relised, however all you had to do was report the issue and 9/10 the problem was fixed with a new patch in just a few hours. NICE JOB DEV'S. main patches we constent 1-3 days apart, except when RL issues delayed the Dev. However being a one person team sometimes this happens. It was not uncommon to even have several main patches a day if the DEV was on a roll. So is the Dev dedicated to this game??? I would have to say he is more dedicated then 99.9% of the Devs out there. Just for that point alone the game then became a 6/10.What's my opinion now that the game is out of EA???  Well I have to be honest, the game isn't done to my hopes and dreams that the potential first showed. but I need not worry because the Dev still plans on putting in just as many hours a week now as he has in the past so MUCH more stuff to come. the game is still a bit of a resource hog on top settings, just when you take in consideration when I fist started the game I was on the lowest settings and getting lag, I can now play abouve recomended with little no no lag... 1000% improvment Many items, and tings to do have been added taking an 8 hour game well past 150 hours (depending on your play style) the dificulty with the added features have made a game that I use to play on hard settings into a game I need to play on below normal (still learning the new stuff). I have been typing to long now so I will give you my ""out of EA"" rating. I would love to give this game a 9/10 but due to some bugs and glitches still active I can only give it an 8/10. losing one point for the glitches (all games have them even ""finished"" games) and losing one just because you can always improve the game right? BTW 8/10 is the highest rating I have ever given a game... so that alone is a ""WAY TO GO DEV""			"

												I bought this game in early access because I thought it showed promise even though it was a clear Minecraft and Factorio clone and the developer has had very public arguments with the creators of Minecraft over the issue, I was wrong. Since then it has degenerated into the mess that it has become today, an unfinished hodgepodge of ideas found in other games with no clear direction, no character and no fun. The mob graphics are shoddy and the loot system is incredibly weak. Players consistantly complain that they find progression to be awkward and the game has no real aim or endgame amongst other flaws in basic game design which prevent them from working through the messy research system but the one-man-band developer refuses to accept their concerns, maintaining that his design is flawless, and original of course, so they walk away having wasted their hard earned cash on a bad clone. This game should never have left early access at it stands and shouldn't really even be on Steam.I asked one of the devs why there were no building blocks available in the survival part of the game and they told me... and I quote from Skype...  ""I can't be bothered to write the recipes""  I later find that they're selling the survival game blocks into the game one by one to Patreon supporters as though they're a commodity.  I've never heard of anything so stupid.  A voxel block game with no voxel blocks until Patreons 'buy' them for the playerbase?  What a joke.If you're considering purchasing this game you should know that even though the base game is unfinished, the developer is now concentrating on a paid expansion pack which he intends to sell for $8 (subject to Valve approval). If you buy this game now you will not be able to use the resources you see ingame unless you pay an extra 8 bucks for the expansion. No, he didn't tell the rest of us that either and while comparable indie games like Space Engineers and Factorio are a huge success with 1,700 players ingame consistantly without this kind of failed-game pay-to-play mentality, these guys are either too lazy, inept or don't have the brains to see past their own short-term pockets and even though this game has been on Steam for years, are attracting less than 500 concurrent players ingame and trying to make up for the shortfall in popularity/profit with useless paid DLC. I'm all for buying good DLC for a good game but the game has to be finished and popular first.  God knows how much I've paid for Payday DLC but those guys deliver content.I'll move on to content after the next round of developer downvotes.The biggest problem with this game is it's developer's attitude. A very rude guy who doesn't listen to players, is struggling to earn a living from the game because of that and is now begging for money in his stickies on the forum with threats that he will stop development and go & find a job if the game continues to fail.The developers were also begging players for positive reviews a few months ago because the game had a red 'mixed' review tag, now each time a negative review is made he sends over his 50 cent army to falsely manipulate the Steam rating system and argue with the reviewer, incredibly obvious because the same names appear in the comments section of each negative review and they are mostly using fake, private profile, Steam level zero accounts. The same fake steam accounts are also being used to pump up the positive reviews for the game. Steam really should do something about it because they are cheating customers. People from the publishing house with financial interests in the game no doubt and it certainly doesn't help that a steam moderator is involved with this game's development, also fairly despicable that the same Steam moderator is fully aware of and allows this kind of manipulation of the Steam review system, time for Steam to remove him I think.Now for those who don't know, the developer's previous job was working in a limited role on Borderlands 2 which obviously didn't include game design. Most if not all of the 50 cent army downvoting this and and all other negative reviews for the game have only Fortresscraft, Borderlands 2 and a couple of other free games in their limited Steam level 0-5 game list. What conclusions can you draw from this? The developer's friends from his previous job who've been gifted copies of Fortresscraft are defending him? Or the developers friends have been gifted both Fortresscraft and Borderlands 2? Either way it sounds like they're cheating Steam and their customers to me.  2K Games employees too, that should be interesting.While the game developers and other financially or emotionally interested parties keep sending the 50 cent army here to downvote my review, abusing the Steam rating system I'll remove their abusive remarks and downvotes by posting it again, they just keep reminding me of more flaws in the game to add to the review & that way it will stay on the recent review list forever until they learn to accept genuine reviews with genuine ratings from genuine customers and stop manipulating the Steam rating system and cheating Steam customers.

												With over 2,000 hours playtime  you can believe me when I say, YOU WILL LOSE TIME PLAYING THIS GAME.If you enjoy resource management under pressure then you will love this game. If you are creative and love building with blocks then you will love this game. The Devs are passionate and update the game very regularly and follow bug reports closely on the forums just make sure reports go in the correct threads or they may be missed.The Survival part of the game has a good Tutorial to start you off but be prepared to use your brain to work out advanced systems to build a huge mining operation on a hostile world.The Creative side of the game gives you unlimited resources to build almost anything you can imagine, with the ability to create detail blocks to give even more finesse to your work.You get one huge and addictive game for your money, so go for it.

												This Game is a gem that not enough people know about.   This is NOT a minecraft game, do not let the voxels fool you!If you like an game games like Factorio, Industry Tycoon, or any supply chain game were you start with nothing and you need to design infrastructure to make more and better things in order to make even more items.  You do all this with an endgame of course which I will not ruin.Be warned, that this game has a learning curve due to the sheer volume of things you can do.  If you are stuck, there is a great community to help guide you along.    If you are an intellect that loves a game with a challenge and  has over 200 hours of gameplay, this is for you.Note: the Dev has been doing Monthly releases updates and new content.  The dev is very active and even live stream his development sessions so that you can interface directly with him.If there is a problem, it would be fixed quickly.Please disregard some comments of crashes recently, this is due to a bug in the Unity engine and there are work arounds posted and release candidate patches to fix the problem.  These fixes will be in the update release at the end of the month or you can get them sooner if you do not want to opt in.			"

Early Access Review
								review of 1.9 EAOK, it has blocks, crafting, and mining. That's where the similarities end really. My daughter plays Minecraft, she plays it for hours. However, whenever I sit down to have a go, I get bored after about 20 minutes. You dig. You build. You dig. zzzzFortressCraft is much more immediate than that. Your power is running out, you're going to freeze to death, so you need to organise. This forces you to think stategically, about power, about distance, about supply lines (and presumably, in the future, defending them from other players). It kind-of feels more like a RTS, but with blocks.If you're used to other Mine games, this one IS even more complicated. But part of that is due to a very alpha GUI, things aren't as obvious as they could or should be. This will be fixed! for example, bringing up your inventory, you have a bunch of blocks. What are they? no idea, a mouse-over tooltip would be nice :)Also, I'd rather you only had things in  your toolbar that you actually owned, it's too confusing with *every possible thing* being shown, yet you can't use 90% of it. Again, early access, these things are to be expected.One thing that is immediately ""wrong"" with the game - shelter. If you build a ""house"" over your base equipment, put a torchfire or two in there, surely it should be warm enough inside that you don't freeze? What's the point of building a ""Fortress"" if it doesn't have any benefits lol :)I absolutely recommend this, if you're a fan of Voxel miners or even RTS games. I see a bright future for this game, because unlike others, there is actually a game to be played, a point to it all. (you can, of course, go into creative mode and just build pretty stuff, but I kind-of don't see the point of that unless you can then turn the world into a survival one for you and your friends. No doubt that's coming too eventually).Buy it, try it. If you don't get on with it, try it again the next update. and the next. It's going to be a good one :)			"

												I play every 4x/base building game that comes out. In almost every game, I find myself wishing that X would be automated in some way. Such as, hiring bots, employees, or machines to do marketing, sales, shipping... whatever the task happens to be in the context of the game, and I'm invariably let down every, single, time. No developer has ever gotten this workflow right. In fact, some even argue that too much automation takes away ""work"" from the game. I've hand delivered X item to X person 100 times now; Why do I have to keep doing this same damn mission over and over Elite Dangerous? I literally can't hire a space mailman to deliver packages? I gotta do it myself? Jesus. Thankfully, FortressCraft: Evolved has none of that grindy crap and they did automation properly. I spent a 1100hrs playing this game. I've been on Steam for 6 years and never bothered to write a review before. You need to buy this game. The entire purpose of this game is to automate production. You build a machine that poops out other machines, which poops out crafted items. Automate all the things!! In one sense, that does make it feel like Factorio, and it has blocks like Minecraft. But boiling this game down to simply those observations shows how little you actually understand. FortressCraft has snap-to production building like Big Pharma and tower defense like Clash of Clans. Unlike Minecraft, there actually is a goal to achieve in FortressCraft. Quite simply, this is the best game of 2016 and I doubt you've played anything like it before. If there were any downsides to this game, I'd say it will take longer to win than you think it will. You will lose a few times because you don't know how much power all the guns take. So, you try to half♥♥♥♥♥it and get power. But, then you find out you need 10x power you though was required, and your production chain is a mess. So, you have to rip things up and move them around. Some  people don't like ripping everything up and redoing their base design. But, that's part of the experimentation and learning process everyone goes through when they play this game. The ""winning condition"" is to power the orbital transmitter, and the expansion goal is building a machine that will drill down to planetary magma. Pro Tip, you can not power the damn thing with just 10 generators you started out using in the beginning of the game. Don't be ""that guy"" who complains the game is taking days to power the Orbital Transmitter because you are using coal you found in the beginning of the game. If you find yourself complaining FCE should build products like Factorio, then the problem is that you are not automating properly. See, as long as you have the technology in Factorio, you can build products without setting up the proper production chain, and that's cheating. In FCE, you need to place the wire maker down, and supply it with copper, or you will have no wire. No Factorio style cheating here. What I'm getting at is that the game isn't badly designed. You are simply being lazy and spolied. If you can't be bothered to place your own machines and conveyor belts, then you can just go play any LEGO game where you mindlessly click on some self assembling blocks and be done with it.Additionally, the limited graphic style of Factorio means it's all 2d. But in FCE, you build 3 dimensional. This creates interesting tasks to do for people that like to do things ""just so"" in a quest for perfection. The most inefficient automation is always better than manual effort, and multiple solutions will all work, so don't worry about perfection. The thing to remember is if the game feels ""tedious"" then you're not automating enough. Like if you find yourself shooting enemies with your pistol, that means you haven't built enough gun or missile defense. So, stop trying to gun down bosses with the god damn pistol. If all those guns you made drain your power, then guess what? Yeah, the next thing you need to do is build more power. In fact, it's the consumption of power that drives the game foward. More power creates more enemies, which require more guns, which creates more loot drops, used in machines which requires more power, etc.There is enough stuff to do that you shouldn't be sitting there watching machines tick away. That's means you're wasting time. Yes, that landscape clearing machine does work slowly. It's supposed to. You're not supposed to sit there and stare at it like a tea pot. Give it power, and go do something else for ten minutes. Mine more coal, research something, harvest some crystals, and by the time you get done with that the base will be clear. This is what makes you fell like real game progress is being made. You will literally be absorbed into 10 things going on at once before the sun comes up. If you're bored because ""things take to long"" then what you need to do is multitask.Unlike every other ""something-Craft"" game, there is no ""build order"" to follow by rote memorization, or a plan to spend your power efficiently. Such as; make 10 tin, then make exactly 2 hoppers, then make 2 lasers... No no no no. This isn't StarCraft. Consume all the power you can. When you run out, just build more generators. Build thousands of missiles, burn hundreds of coal a second. Consumption. This game is a consumption simulator. It doesn't matter that a quarry is less efficient than an excavator. Because the whole point of this game is to build all the machines, power them, and have them do stuff automatically! What I said will take the average player 100hrs before it finally clicks, ""Oh, build lots of everything. I get it now"".The developer made sure you can play the game ""to the end"" without needing the expansion. The thing is, much like a Star Wars movie, you've just watched Star Wars, and your NOT going to see Empire Strikes Back... are you crazy? You have to see Empire! So, in that sense, Frozen Factory is a ""must have"".			"

												EDITED - AFTER 500 HOURS OF PLAY TIMEThis is not an easy game to review.  And I am not a reviewer.Played a full game on Rapid/Plentifull settings.  Took about 350 hours.  Was awesome.  I'm mid-way in a coop game with a friend and I just started a new world, solo, with slightly less beginner-friendly settings.  Still love it.  Still discovering new strategy.This is the most addictive+long lasting NON-MMORPG game I've played.   Ever.   Over the course of the last 30 years... !First, I want to give my 2 cents about the comments from some reviews about ""the developper"".  It seems that some people have some problems with some aspect of the game, report it to the developper, who refuse to fix it... and then down-vote the game.4 things about this : 1- This game is pretty ""elitist"".  It's slow paced, strategic, atmospheric... not easy and not for everyone.  It can be quite punishing at times, but also very rewarding.  Some aspect that do not suit some players are there on purpose because the developper (and the targeted players) love it this way.  It's not lazyness.  (Not the way I see it)  Exemple : there is no ladder to ease vertical movement.   You have to deal with failing hookshot.... or build/manage elevators... or, later on, teleporters are jetpacks.  A ladder would just make it all too easy !2- The developper (a single guy) actually reaches a new level of customer support/interraction, the way I see it.  Not only does he spends time on Steam forums and comment/answers on many posts, but he develops the game while streaming near-100% of it, while interacting LIVE with the payers.  I actually posted some questions in the forums (for the general public ! I was not targeting the developper at all !) the DJ (the dev) actually answered 3 out of 4 of my questions himself ! Kinda awesome.3- Some people complain about ""core parts of the game are locked to supporters"".  That is not true.  Developper gives early access to the patches he is working on to the early supporters so they can TRY (and help debug) the UN-COMPLETE, ""IN PROGRESS"" patches.  But they get no bonus materials ""in game"". Except maybe a few more ""skins"".  Nothing ""un-fair"".  So yeah, he may take decisions that you do not like.  But..... that's too bad !4- EXPENSION PACK (FROZEN FACTORY) : Some people complain about ""DLC"" and its price.  This is not a ""DLC"" as per now-days definition.  This is an EXPENSION PACK, like in old times.  The game alone will give you 100++++++ hours of game play.  When you're DONE with the base, you can optionally buy the expension pack to reach deeper layers of the game.  It's a full fledged expension pack bringing an additionnal 50+++ hours of gameplay !  And the expension pack content ""begins"" after the base game ""end-game""...  (and obviously it's not ""free"" since the developper needs to... you know... eat !)Now, the game.A cross-over between Minecraft and Factorio.  That's what it triies to be, and that's what itis.  With some features that differ from both games.  It has its own identity.Part 1 - Compared to Minecraft :The ""surface"" of the world is no fun to explore.  You space-ship-crashed on a desolated, icy planet.  The surface is very rough, with huge mountains and huge holes and caves.  But it's a single biome.The exploration is more vertical.3rd ore begins to spawn under -180-ish.4th around -300-ish.6th around -400-ish.... !  (the max depth is like, -2^64 (or -10 quintillions.... or infinite, basically), but for now I think there's nothing new under -2000)And you will find HUUUUUUGGE caves to explore.The games allows some nice little twist to instantly build whole lines of block and such, which can allow you to build a 50x10 plateform in about 15 seconds.  This is nice.This game is NOT centered on building random, useless strucutres for no reasons.  Materials are ugly and the planet is somewhat dark.  Even during the day, you never get a beautifull sun that will make your structure shine.It's all about being functionnal and automated.  GEtting your ressources manually won't work.  You need to build machines to automate the ressource gathering and transformation.Which  brings us to :Part 2 - Compared to FactorioSimilar yet different.I LOVE Facotrio.  Factorio is ""all about building your base"".  No exploration.  No digging.  Just gather ressources, and build. In 15 hours, in Factorio, you'll have a huge, top-tier base.Since Fortresscraft has a whole ""digging"" and ""exploroing"" part and you have to deal with the 3rd dimension, it'll be much slower.In 15 hours if played on ""casual"" settings(default), you'll barelly have time to automate the extraction and transformation of the 1st tier of materials... !Factorio is somewhat linear and never felt overwhelming (to me).  What you first build will be used to build the next tier, which will be used for the next, and so on.  Your first building are never rendered useless and you always grow from what has already been done.Fortresscraft allows more freedom on those aspect and can sometime feel overwhelming !  So many possibilities !  And news building CAN make older ones useles.  So spending a lot of ressources on early stuff CAN eventually feel useless...A bit more hardcore.... not a bad thing : I'm just saying.Edit - I triied the ""faster"" mode.  Extractors can hold more ores, power is abundant, receipies requirement are divided by 4... I did in 2 hours what took 20 hours in my other game.  This is good news for people who are in a rush.  The difference in pacing between the various game settings are huge.So yeah, I give it a huge thumb up.It's cheap : if you think it's your kind of game, please do try it.			"

												Well, since the single developer kicked me from the discord channel today and announced that he hates me and called me an antagonistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I figured this is a good time to write a review of the game.1. Game design seems like the dev did try to cover many bases and be thorough.  I left the game several months ago and came back a few days ago, and a lot of tech has changed dramatically and there are many more buildable structures.  It has become much more complicated in a matter of a few months.  I.E., you might have to relearn a lot of things if you leave and return later.  The overall concept of the game seems to be focused on automation, which is expensive short-term and time saving long-term, as in many automation games.  1.25. As someone else has said recently, this game's progress is very linear compared to games in a similar genre.  They also said it better than me when they described the dev's forcing of a set pathway based on his vision of how the game should be played, and how relatively inflexible progress is in this game. Some changes/nerfs that have been implemented have forced that, for example making underground smelting extremely impractical or non-functional.  It forces everyone to do things one way: The dev’s way.  I have often thought that the dev doesn’t want anyone to do anything he didn’t originally plan on them doing in his game.1.5. Automation elements similar to factorio include building ingots from smelters, heavy use of conveyers, and eventual (much later than in factorio, except research-fueling parts) automation of building components to build higher tier products.  This game uses storage hoppers as the primary transfer device instead of inserters in factorio.1.75. There is a tech tree and research, probably continually getting updates along with the tech.  I've never had any major issues with it, but the components for research were very simple several months ago and are probably still the same.  It's the volume of resources needed and the power consumption of a research lab that limit research speeds.2. Music is not very good IMO, about on par with Empyrion for that.  It's adequate.3. Game seems generally stable, not many crashes.4. There are still some multiplayer glitches (such as doubling items) mostly related to delays, lag and bandwidth oddities that result in items not being picked up promptly, objects not loading visually correctly/delaying being shown, etc., plus IMO the game demands pretty high bandwidth from users when doing multiplayer servers with large bases.  Maybe he's corrected this, but I doubt it. 5. The game has what I would consider a pretty rudimentary tower defense system.  There are flying enemies (insectoids) that surge at intervals and attack your central hub, originating from 4 directions at approximately 90-degree angles away from your hub where there are hives or overminds (or whatever he calls them).  There are no pathing considerations, excepting that I think they do not go through original/unaltered naturally-formed mountains.  Otherwise, they travel in a straight line from source to target (hub).  There is a spiderbot utility NPC which can be used to aid in tower defense and now has several upgrades to damage and power reserves, etc., and I believe your personal helperbot also has a basic gun upgrade.  You have several tiers of turrets and a range of consumable missiles to defend your hub with.  Defense of the hub involves destroying the enemies before they can inflict enough damage to bring your hub down to 0% life.  The enemies drop items, mostly inert items that can be recycled later in the game, and a few items that are useful (perhaps now even critical to building certain things) and drop rarely.  The dev long ago told me that he didn't believe in the philosophy of losing progress through enemies destroying your base/etc., so that philosophy affects how the tower defense is played.  Today, just before banning me, the dev told me that pathing calculations for a 3-dimensional game like this would result in unreasonable amounts of calculations, probably especially for an online multiplayer game, so that's why enemy pathing isn't implemented to go around your buildings/etc.  The enemy spawns increase in frequency, number and tier/HP based on something called ""threat,"" which I believe is affected by how much power you generate (and possibly other factors I don't recall).6. The game IS steam-compatible for public servers, but right now there is only one public server (and another one for patreons) and AFAIK it has stayed that way ever since public servers were made available.  The dev says at present there are about 140 private servers, but the central communication hub for the game (discord channel) doesn't have more than 1-3 of the servers' users/admins on it usually, and one of them is the public server owner.  Private servers and password-protected servers are not listed in the server list in-game, so it makes it feel very quiet.7.  Last time I made a large base capable of charging OET (several months ago), I had significant framerate drops in the above ground world running the game fullscreen on a 1080p display on my i7-4930k @4ghz, 16gb 1600mhz ram, GTX770 graphics card, Samsung EVO 840 ssd in Win7Pro, medium settings.8. The dev has a massive chip on his shoulder.  He is sarcastic, rude, and verbally abusive if given the chance.  He has the potential to be very helpful, but your words have to conform to a specific format for him to be receptive enough to give helpful information without also being extremely rude.  He and I do not get along, mostly because I have differing opinions and express them freely.  The dev does NOT like (and in my opinion doesn't comprehend) impulsive initial impressions of things, although his own highly reactive manner (like putting a 9-volt battery to your tongue) suggests that he bases his opinions of people and their statements on knee-jerk reflex responses, very much like most people with a persecution complex.  He would disagree that he is very intolerant of other opinions and feedback that differs from what he believes about his game, and he would disagree that he is unfair to many people, but in fact he is very clique-ish and only tolerates certain types of feedback, his methods, etc., from an established group of people.  The easiest way to get on his bad side is to say ""this item/equipment/etc. isn't very useful,"" at which point he will almost always highlight how invalid and wrong you are, then sometimes demand to know why you feel that way so he can tell you that’s wrong too.  Today, he accused me of disagreeing with him about pathing being too computationally demanding for the enemies (which I did not disagree with, I only stated that there was no pathing and it results in a more simplified/limited tower defense system).  It didn’t matter that his accusation was provably false.  I asked him not to talk to me because all we do is argue, and he used it as an excuse to ban me from his discord. He stated that a number of people had blocked me in the communication, which while possibly true does not change the fact that he was the only person I “sparred with” in the entire time I was talking, and then only because he always reacted to everything I said because I have opinions that don’t often conform to general views and I defend my views as vehemently as he forces his.  It takes 20 minutes to prove yourself correct, but only 2 seconds to be wrong in his eyes.  You are guilty until proven innocent.If you are very fresh, he will tolerate you briefly.  However, if he doesn’t agree with you almost immediately, he absolutely wants to believe you are wrong and will push that personal agenda.He is, at once, the single most important aspect of this game and its biggest detriment because of his extremely thin tolerance of other views.  I recommend the game, but the dev is not a nice person.			"

												FortressCraft Evolved has the automation aspect I wished existed in other voxel-based survival games I've played.The dev is also committed to releasing regular significant updates as long as he can afford to, both as free updates for all players and paid DLC aimed at players spending 100s of hours in-game.If you like factorio, minecraft with automation mods, and/or infinifactory, then you will love FortressCraft Evolved!

												Update3: Some of the points mentioned here have been addressed with multiple updates. I've not yet seen everything from the new stuff so some things may be outdated.This game is voted more negative has it should be. It's quite interesting and plays like a big Minecraft mod but without some of the normal Minecraft features.Things that could be better:- needs cables. Using batteries as a replacement for cables for small distances is expensive at the beginning and also quite inefficient. The laser energy transmitter are bad for diagonal stuff. There should be something like cables for medium distances.- there are hostile creatures by now which have several issues. The hitbox is often weird and they often glitch into blocks. It's not clear what to do with the big ones like the worms and this giant thing ""overlord""(?), some kind of information system like Navi/Phi/Midna from The Legend of Zelda would be great that give some hints after trying some things out or doing a research project about them after encountering them, like ""Oh seems like they are not affected by your gun attack, maybe ...[hint towards what could help against them, I still have no idea]"".- lack of reasons to do stuff. You are only playing to produce more ressources to build more machines to produce more ressources... (minecraft and other games are having the same issues though) [this has been a bit fixes with the attack waves but those ""calming stations"" can be used to stop attack waves completely]-- feels like there should be more survival in there. There's only energy and temperature, build a solar station and you are fine forever. Needs food and the need to hunt creatures and build farmes. Creature breeding would be nice too, they could give ressources needed to craft stuff.-- there could be more interesting stuff deep down. Like stronger creatures who need better weapons. Like Minecrafts nether or ender world. The ""goal"" of the game could be to get super deep to the strongest creatures and best materials, build the best equipment and fortify a base in the hostile environment. [this is kinda the case by now, there are hostile enemies and things deep down which I have not yet seen everything of]- the weather and ground level. It's snowing all the time and snow everywhere, that's depressing. Needs some sun and grass or sand or other variation. [this has been slightly adressed by now but it's still a rocky and snowy desert]Update due to good point from from WolfWrag:The development seems really slow considering it's not much cheaper than Minecraft. I thought it was free or cheaper, maybe I got it cheaper due to a sale. It seems to be a side or hobby project of like one developer. I don't know how many people bought this game so it may be a bad ratio of invested time vs. earned money for the developer. Though even the full price is relatively cheap compared to normal/typical games (thought even Minecraft costs ~20€ I think). I played a lot so my ratio of playing & ""had fun time"" vs. price is still super good, especially compared to those triple A games for 70€ where you are finished and bored after like 20 or 30 hours (or even after a few minutes). So I would still recommend it for people who like Minecraft and want something different with a different focus.Comparing it to Minecraft is also a bit harsh as Minecraft was a much bigger success, has a higher price, has/had more developers and was developed over several years until it was like today, as most people know it. I joined Minecraft in Alpha or Beta stage and that was much more buggy, unfinished and had less features as FortressCraft has now. FortressCraft could add more stuff like survival with farming, animals and maybe something like the logic stuff with Redstone in Minecraft and it would be quite comparable to Minecraft feature wise (both would have stuff that the other hasn't but the amount would be comparable).

												'We'll fix all the playability issues after we make enough sales from our full version release.', said no developer twice.I still don't recommend this game. The developer has now declared that it is finished, and all he'll be doing now is fixing bugs. Here are the remaining issues I have with this game:1. Consistent UI for machines. This one tripped me up repeatedly. I'd go to a hopper and press E to interact with it, because E opens the UI for pretty much everything else in the game, but the hoppers have no UI. Honestly it makes more sense to use T to Toggle the hopper settings, instead of Throwing selected item on toolbelt into it. Would be Consistent to have a UI for the hoppers, see exactly whats in it, then you could pull specific things from it.1a. When I finally started tossing iron in, I would have to press Q repeatedly to get everything out of the smelter feed hopper. Then drop the iron in, and if I dropped in anything else, it would randomly select what to make next. So I'd have 1 iron bar, and then a bunch of copper and tin. Although, it's indicative of not random, but a LIFO type system. Last In First Out. Since copper and tin were already automated to that hopper.... So in order to get JUST iron out, I'd have to rotate a belt, empty the hopper, put the iron ore in, wait for the iron ore to finish processing, then rotate the belt back, and drop stuff in again. 2. Mobs pathing through solid objects. Got a nice recording of a slime inside my CPH and also inside the crafting machine. Can't shoot it there.2a. Kinda got lucky on my base placement, although at the same token, unlucky. It's been a while since I've started a world and had my base nestled at the foot of a mountain on one side. Because the last time that happened, I had to DIG OUT a mountain side, because the green balls of wasp vomit? poop? were flying out of the mountain side at my CPH. Once I dug out enough, I found 2 wasps just chilling inside the mountain, shooting at my CPH. Like solid walls? who cares! we don't have the programming to respect solids. With the slime just willy nilly oozing into and out of my CPH, I'm going to have to assume that nothing else respects solid surfaces either. Arther sure as hell doesnt. 3. No display showing how much charge arther has. At least he's no longer holding a digital sandwich board, cracking jokes, but it's impossible to figure out how much charge he has now, except with a charging station I'm told. It's nice that his text now shows up over your toolbelt, but the sound is a bit obnoxious. Reminds me of an old NES game, where when the characters talk, it would make little blip noises with each character... like Zelda. 4. Arther upgrades still reside in your inventory, and same with suit upgrades I'm assuming, since pressing S in the inventory screen opens a screen for suit upgrades that looks clearly incomplete. I made Arther's power core, why the heck does it live in my inventory? Why doesn't it go to it's own area? IIRC, you can take arther's power core out of your inventory and put it into a storage box. As long as you pick it up before you log out, and it's in your inventory when you launch the game, Arther counts it as having it. 5. Still wish there was a compass. The holobase does seem much better somehow, and there's these red arrows in it, no idea what those are about. 6. Logistics Hoppers, the white ones, although they still didn't spit things out as fast as a Large storage hopper, you could use them to empty a mining drill and send the contents onto a belt. Now they are slower some how. The point of the logistics hopper was to get the ore out of the drill and into transport. Now there's no choice but to stick a storage hopper on them. Which also seem slower in their dispersing speed. 7. New Issue. The automation machines, the stamper, the extruder, the coiler, and PCB maker, used to just zip right along. Since they updated the recipe for laboratory pods, to use 1 PCB per three plates, for a total of 2 PCB to 6 plates for each lab pod... I would build a belt turntable, put a hopper on top of it, stick conveyers on each of the outputs, 3 sides leading to a stamper, 1 leading to the extruder, coiler, PCB maker, have the belts meet at the bottom and move up into a second hopper at the same level as the first one, so you could waste less resources and make lab packs... The whole build occupies slightly more space than the New and improved Behemoth of a CPH. But seeing as the speed of those automation machines is excruciatingly slow now, it causes a backlog, throwing the ratio's off. That's when I decided I'd had enough FCE for a while. The early game of FCE is Excruciatingly slow. Now with the improvements to the speed of the automation machines, it's going to be EVEN SLOWER... What FCE feels like to me: Solitary Confinement. When I shut the game down, I don't feel like I'm leaving FCE, I feel like I'm escaping.I'm really happy I got two copies at such a cheap price, but to be honest, unless it goes F2P, I'd leave this alone and spend your allowance on a game that was made by a developer that cares more about giving you a quality game, rather than how much money they get for making it. I will delete comments on this review at my discretion. I'm tired of being harassed by FortressCraft Promoters for expressing my opinion. I'd like to lock it so no further comments can be made. But apparently I don't get that option. So if you love FortressCraft Evolved, write your own review and stay off of mine.			"

Early Access Review
								Watch out! This is an actual review with actual details about the game and such. you may not want to read this. I know most people like to read / write reviews that only gives 1-2 vague sentences about the game.I’ve been playing FortressCraft for 4 years now. I originally bought FortressCraft on the Xbox when it first came out back in April of 2011. I have played the Xbox hundreds of hours and have been there through all of its development. I can sit here all day and tell you all about the Xbox version too, but this isn’t about that version, this is about the evolved FortressCraft, FortressCraft Evolved.FortressCraft Evolved isn’t a port or a remake of the original FortressCraft, it’s a reimagining. The game has been completely rewritten from the ground up using Unity as the game engine (They were using XNA framework on the Xbox).This review is of version 1.15d. I’ve owned FortressCraft Evolved on Steam since the beta for the pre-alpha (You had to know someone to be able to play it, wasn’t available for purchase on Steam yet; It was hidden).Story:There isn’t one currently, unless you count the 2 paragraphs of text in the help menu.Main Menu:Currently, the main options in the main menu are the 'join multiplayer server"" option and the world select option. You can create and select at least 10 worlds currently. You may be able to make even more than that, but I have never had need for more than 4 worlds at a time because the creative worlds are so large, I can just go find another place and start building.Graphics:The graphics are great. There are shadows and mist, and dynamic colored lighting. The textures are HD and the models are very good.You can change the resolution of the game, whether it is full screen or not, and the quality of the graphics.Controls:I read a lot of reviews that say the controls are horrible and this and that and I don’t know about them, but I don’t have any troubles at all. You move with wasd and any command you need to press ‘on-the-fly’ are all within reach of your left hand. Keys that aren’t are things such as: The Help Menu (h), Toggling the headlight (L) (which requires power and glow sticks are better (g key)), Inventory (i), and that is it. As for creative, you will have to use the F9-F12 keys to use the special build commands, such as super build and copy / paste.Any complaints about the buttons being in a bad place are really rather dumb though as you can customize any button. When you first launch the game, a configurator appears and you can scroll through every ‘control’ and change the key and also change / set a secondary key. Don’t like the “Toss a glow stick” key being G? Change it.You can also change the sensibility of the mouse in both the X and Y position and you can invert it.Playability:The game does have a few bugs and mishaps, but as far as playable, it is very. I can get on survival mode and play for 5 hours straight and have almost no issues. Almost all bugs are found pretty quickly and are reported to the developers who are actually pretty active. For an Early Access game, I would say it is high on playability. Is it perfect? No, but it's...EA...Annoyances:You can not change worlds without exiting the game. This will be changed before it leaves EA though.You can not change the graphics and controls in-game, only in the startup menu. This does not include sensitivity.Creative mode:This first mode is creative mode. This mode has transformed a lot over the years and I think the best thing about creative mode are the custom blocks.Custom blocks allow you to create...custom blocks. You create what is called a ‘workshop’, which is a hollow cube that is 2x2, 3x3, 4x4,..., and 8x8. You can place blocks inside the workshop, like normal, but once you leave, anything inside of the workshop will be compressed to a single block and you can then go and place it and use it. Check out the 13th picture in the Steam picture roll for the store page to kinda see more about what I’m talking about (The train).The other special feature about creative (and is in survival) is called build-to-me. You hold down control and click on a block out in the distance, and it will build the block all the way to you along the axis. This feature is amazing and I wish more games had it.The other two nice features about creative are super build and copy and paste. Super build is kinda like WorldEdit (the Minecraft plugin) but way better. You can see what the build will create in real time and you get a simple GUI to customize the super build you are about to make instead of typing a bunch of complex commands. You can build a sphere (you can edit the radius), a rectangle (you can edit the width, height, and length), and a cylinder (you can edit the radius and height). You can change the size from 1 to 64 and you can make it hollow or solid. You can also make it build with the selected block, or you can change it to dig, so it will essentially add air as the block. Copy and paste also works sorta the same as WorldEdit. You select one corner, then you select the other corner. You then get like a preview type of a thing and can see exactly what you just copied and what you are about to paste looks like. You can rotate your paste and see it rotate in real time. You can simply press the paste key and it pastes. You can paste the same object as much as you like, it doesn’t go away after the first time. You can also save what you have copied and the developers have said that they will one day add a workshop where you can upload the copied items to.As for blocks, there are over 200 different blocks you can currently choose from.A REALLY nice feature they added recently is called the paint gun. Some of the blocks are ‘paintable’. You can change to the paint gun and change the colors of the R/G/B. There are 16 of each color, so you can make a wide range of colors. You point and shoot and the colors of the blocks will change (but keep the texture). The feature is topped off with the fact that you can point at the block and middle click, and the block will be selected as your current block and keep the color that the block is painted.The last significant feature is the Storm Staff. With it, you can use the scroll wheel to select different features and: change the time of day, make it sunny / thunderstorm, and spawn a meteor that starts in the sky and crashes and explodes wherever you point the staff. The latter is super cool to use and spamming it creates an awesome lag fest of awesome and explosions.As a final note, the world goes 1,000 light years in all directions. This is different in Minecraft because Minecraft only goes about 1 million in length / width and about 128/256 in height. Another note is that while the world is still 1,000 light years down in survival mode, once you get at about 5,000 depth, the world gets super hot and you will die from hyperthermia. Survival:Survival mode is totally unique and really awesome. It has machines, kind of like Tekkit, but not really. When you start, you start off with a way to generate power, a crafting table, a smelter, and an ore extractor. Instead of health, you actually have power. If you fall, you lose power and depending on your conditions, you lose power more quickly.===================As it turns out, my review is too long.

Early Access Review
								This game has quite a few negative reviews and i have to say not all points are justified.I really enjoy this game (i only play on survival) and it's a verry good spin on the many voxel block games out there first off it's not focused on being creative as in making big castles etc ( i guess you could but there are other games that are better at this) Where this game shines is in optimizing your base you're building a huge factory/mining operation and everything needs to be powered by different means which makes it a little of a puzzle game in my opinion.people have commented on the fact that the tier 1 takes too long and it's too hard to get to tier 2. I have to say i love starting over and beginning from scratch I actually do so after every bigger update (even though it's usually not even necessary).other people have commented that the development is too slow or non existent and although it may seem like this the last few months if those same people would follow the twitter they would see what the devs are really working on and at this point that is mobs and battle this is not a small task so the smaller quick updates may be gone for a while untill this is done.I'm not saying this game is perfect yet (far from it ) but isn't that what the early acces warning is for.Too many people ragg on the early acces games giving negative reviews for things that are bugged etc that comes with the territory. People pay money for something and expect it to be a fully functioning completed product even though there is a big blue warning saying EARLY ACCES. Guess what i just bought a house thats not even finished building yet and i'm not at the construction site with a big  sign saying this company sucks my house doesn't have a roof and the toilet doesn't flush etc. same thing.

												Its an awesome game, gives you a more industrial view of voxel games as opposed to the typical ""build stupid pick axe, mine till you upgrade stupid pick axe"" games.  The devs are very responsive to the community and often respond within a day or less.Edit - as of releaseStill awesome, still a lot to do, a lot of improvements have been made to give you a more ""isolated"" feeling like you really crashed landed.  The difficult of this game can go between easy and holy crap stop it hard so I think thats a good range for both new and old players to voxel type games.  I can literally lose a weekend to playing this.  As to the rumors that it's buggy, unfinished, or abandonware.  The dev believes in complete transparency, he announced a feature lock on what would be in the release, and even slipped in some extra goodies in his spare time.  There are plans to add even more features beyond the hundred or so game hours you can easily sink in to the existing ones.  As for the bugs, this has far less than pretty much any AAA title on its release day (lets not even bring up every bethesda game ever), most of the so called bugs are not bugs, they are misunderstood features or someone feeling butthurt for being stupid, those that are real bugs, usually get patched within a day or two and eventually cycle up from the bleeding edge version to the mainline.

												Think....Minecraft meets Turret defense.The game is pretty solid in the minecraft department. It has all the fun and creativity of minecraft, but takes a lot of the tedious repetitive things out. There is also a research system, which works pretty well.I've focused most of my time into building my base, making my mining operations efficient, going deeper underground, and where I'm at, I find that the balance of unlocking research, upgrading mining systems, digging deeper using automated methods...etc, its a pretty solid game.Another bonus, if you check the forums, the dev is pretty involved in helping the community out and explaining things and looking to improve always. I'd give a 9/10 and I'd recommend to anyone who enjoyed minecraft even a little bit.			"

												Great game.Objective is to mine ore to be able to build faster more powerful equipment to power and mine deeper. Eventaully the game becomes a defend your base type game with waves of flying insects. The bigger your base becomes the harder the waves get. A lot of the fun is figuring out how to make your base more efficent by building more ore transports and researching new tech and then upgrading your base.Game is updated almost every 4-6 weeks for release buids of game but there are also bleedign edge builds that are updated multiple times a week.This is a great casual game. Great for kids. If you are still on the fence, watch some videos on youtube. Thye may look very complex but it really isn't too bad and the game spoon feeds you new blocks so you don't get too overwhelmed too quickly.Some of the negatives of the game is sometimes it seems you are waiting around for ore instead of doing something fun. You could always be making your mine shaft bigger but in the begining you don't know how much space you will need. There really isn't much guidance after a very short tutorial. Also, if your base gets killed, it is no big deal. It repairs itself, So there isn't a real reason to defend it. Of course that might not always be the case since the game does get updated often and there is a large DLC being created that should be out this year. "

												Its a very nice 3D version of Factorio (+minecraft). I know it isn't exactly like it, but it has just VERY strong Factorio vibes to it.  Not as complex in the long term maybe or maybe it is... (and not as polished yet) , but thats balanced out by the 1st person perspective and the 3rd dimension. That makes things much more interesting, immersive but also nicely confusing.  Walking THROUGH a messy (first) factory is a greater experience than watching it from far above.  And of course there is the 3rd dimension thing.  It goes DEEP. Setting up a little base in a huge cave 500+m underground feels good but is challenging due to the balancing issues.There isn't really a goal and target though. Maybe thats why it's going for somwhat more micromanagement. It  adds a strong Minecraft part to the thing, which makes it different to factorio.  But thats the world, the blocks, the digging (though MUCH faster) and the mining. The crafting on the other hand thankfully feels much more intuitive, much more Factorio then Minecraft(+Tekkit&co)Some balance decisions are a bit questionable. Like the first real ore smelter being so far down the research tree. You're stuck with the 1 free one for a long time and can't even move it for a long time. Also wrong choices in research can get you seriously stuck (Suit heater&Toxic filter!).Especiall since you see no tech tree. Only google tells you, what you need for what later on. Not going into too much detail but generally crafting end research gets too grindy later on. But can be adjusted by editing xml files with an text editor.Also due to all storage systems being (imho) seriously undersized, it remains despite automation, more manual and demands more micromanagement in the longer run.With the little tutorial, ingame help, trial and error and not too much google/youtube, its not too hard to figure out how things work and get something going.Once you know the basics, and (like in factorio) with the first conveyor systems and automations it gets more complex, more interesting. The first attempt will never be great. But you learn from it. But thats not a con for me if some balance is kept. Thats part of the charm of such a game! As it is in factorio.It doesnt need a longe step by step tutorial to the perfect facility for me. Although i would have appreciated the information that conveyers simply transport stuff vertically as well. Its mentioned nowhere. Thats VERY helpful to know if your miner is at -170m. Also that new torches are made automatially from coal in the inventory, when placed and don't need to be crafted with a recipe. Its literally the only item that does this and thus not expected....The world/game creating options have several parameters suiting new players. Like keep inventory on death. I can't possibly imagine doing the deep game without ""dying back home"".Maybe with much more experience.Prize wise, especially with the expensive Frozen Factory DLC (which isn't necessary for new players!), its probably worth, waiting for a sale. But if you liked factorio and look for something  kinda similar but in 3D AND can forgive a few rough edges, its really worth it (maybe at reduced prize).Just don't hit it with expectations like for a 40€ AAA game. That's silly.PS: It runs stable for me, native 21:9 support, Graphics not amazing but nice enough. Lighting at times can be annoying. But overbright pipes have been fixed in recent update. Steam workshop support (though not that much content). All is well on the technical side. Can't tell about multiplayer though. Also mods disable Achievements. Which is the single most stupid idea game devs ever came up with.PPS: There is no Steam or game option, to change language. So its only available in english.PPPS: Warning: This game is as time-eating as Factorio. Everytime you look at the clock its two hours later then you wanted to stop playing.			"

												I don't normally write reviews, but this game deserves a review. I absolutly adore this game and has tons of wonderfull ideas and features with literally constant updates. So lets get into the game. What is it? You could say its minecraft but in all honestly...it kind of isnt. It is its own unique game with tons of unique blocks and features that I would love to have in minecraft, that not even modded minecraft can offer. So lets get the good and the bad in the game listed in a nice little list. This is a little lengthy so if you dont want to read all of this and want to know the short versionSHORT Version: Its a good game lots of features and updates, little bugs, if there are it gets fixed pretty quickly, dev streams and listens to his watchers. Also they look at feedback and love to get feedback on the game.LONG: If you want more depth here you go.PROS:-It is constantly updated on a daily baises. There are new features almost weekly and when they did a poll on their twitter, literallythe next day there was a solution and was implemented within a pretty short amount of time. A day or two before it was in the game.-Bugs are quickly addressed when reported and usually will have a patch in a decent amount of time, depending on how game breaking it is of course.-Multiple tiers that you work your way through as you go deeper into the world.-Researching those tiers. The deeper you get the more Research points you get (RP) The more blocks and flora you scan the more you unlock.-Replayability. Theres a lot of replayability in this game and with constant updates and a lot of features being planned it is always a new experience. (Especially if they add the planned features like space)-ARTHER. An amazing little robot that you can dress in a top hat, eye monocle and an good looking moustache. Love it! Though hes really useful ingame with status updates and back up power if you run low.-Much more to list that would just make this ungodly long.-Multiple game modes that are pretty fun ranging from hardcore and rush mode one or two others that I cant think of atm.CONS-Not everything is implemented yet. Some stuff is in there but it hasnt been properly fleshed out. (Though this isnt in early access, it still technically is because of a lot of reasons that you need to game developers point of view to understand. (Which the dev actually explained to us in a stream in depth which gives you a big understanding of the gaming industry. Like the top games make 90% of the money. Even though fortress craft is in the top 500 for steam games they still struggle, so even though this is the con section, I highly suggest if you buy the game you buy the DLC with it to help support them))-Things can be a little difficult to piece together, even with the handbook, so it may take a little bit of time to figure things out or do a little research (Again its being fleshed out and the handbook is still unfinished so its understable)-Your kind of stuck in spot defending the same area. Now Im sure they have plans to change that especially when they plan to implement space, so for right now your kind of defending your castle.Honestly Im just prying cons out of anything I can just to make this seem fair, but there really arent to many cons. If you cant launch the game then talk to the dev. They'll try to help you. Trust me, they want to help you and expand their player base. You can listen into one of their streams and their ideas and viewpoints are really nice to listen into and really put time into their game. It is a bit of a tedious game so it takes time to make things but once you get the hang of it you will surely have fun. This is truly a fantastic game and you should give it a chance. I would honestly even say that this game should be valued way more then 10-15$ for the amount of work they put in, so its a pretty good deal for a game like this.			"

												FortressCraft Evolved is the love child of Minecraft and Factorio.  It's done beautifully well.  It gets daily attention from the developer. adding new content and making improvements.  It's incredibly stable - nearly 50 hours of play and no crashes/issues.  It's definately worth picking up.			"

												If you like Factorio or Minecraft with tech mods, you must buy this.If you don't know what I'm talking about, but you like Automation, Logistics, Production, Multi-tasking or games that can actually feel alien, hard or challeging, then you should try it out.Although the 'FortressCraft' name may make it seem like another one of the infinite Minecraft clones and knock-offs, the only thing it shares with Minecraft is the voxel-based world. A bunch of other things can resemble modded Minecraft, however, it's still unique and easily stands on its own.FCE is all about exploring and finding resources, and getting machines to exploit those resources for you. Instead of spending most of your time manually digging and mining, you'll spend your time actually thinking, planning and implementing solutions of all kinds, expanding your base and coming up with cool machine designs and setups to do boring work for you while you run around using your time where it really matters.I've first played FCE years ago, and now that I came back to it, it's much different. There's a lot of improvements, from visual, to technical and gameplay improvements, which really makes it all an even more solid experience.If there's one thing I would complain about FCE (and how it changed), is that some things take insane amount of resources to craft. Indoubtly those were (re-)balancing attempts, but I'd prefer more sensible requirements. I'm still barely on the mid-game, though, so I can't give a proper, full review on its balancing and wether such high requirements make sense.To be really concise, FCE is not for everyone. So I do recommend you check videos out if you can.It can be time consuming and it will make you think about solutions and designs when you're away from the game. It might make you draw setups in notebooks. It might make you want to stick solar panels wherever you can.The developer, after all those years, still works on the game. Which is why I'll be buying the DLCs soon - it's really admirable to see someone working on something for so long after it's release, without it being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t features or updates.There's something satisfying about striking the earth, exploiting an alien planet's resources, and using said resouces to murder the innocent creatures that lived there before you.Become an Evolved FortressCrafter today.PS: I should mention: This game has the most cool, fun and satisfying ""grappling hook"" I've ever seen in a videogame yet.

Posted: May 17, 2016
												I became addicted to this game in the oddest way. There were probably three or four minutes in the entire day of total playtime that I actually enjoyed myself. But the more I invested myself in the game, the more I felt determined to get something out of it, and the more time I shoved into it. I spent almost all of yesterday (5/16/2016) playing, desperately trying to make progress.There are several problems with making progress.First off, this is not a single player game. It may have the ability to be played single player, but it's not single player. There just isn't enough progress for it to be single player. In order to make a reasonable amount of progress on my own, I edited files in order to vastly speed up my gameplay. Somehow, that made it go from very boring to incredibly boring.Nothing happens quickly on your own. Even with the game settings set all the way to the quickest, easiest, fastest settings. You need 32 bars of something to build x. Well, settle in, that'll take a while unless you've already got five or six systems running. And it's not like setting those up is quick. Or cheap.And don't get me started on how long it takes to research pretty much anything once you've got the laboratory. The projects take ages to complete, and enough resources that after a day of highly sped-up gameplay, I was barely able to make some of it.But that's not the worst part about this game.This game is NOT finished. This game was early-access, and still should be! It's nowhere near complete. I find bugs everywhere I go. I come back to my base and all my turrets are facing firmly in one direction, a giant laser firing out. The ship I crashed in is on fire (it's only been two months in-game since I landed, I'm sure that's normal). The CPH is projecting some kind of field that is making it awfully hard to see. Various other things are making all sorts of very bright frames of animation that make it practically impossible for me to see what the hell is happening in my base.My laser turrets are still working fine. It's just impossible to tell that.I place another laser turret on top of another block I've placed, and all the bugs disappear in an instant.Before I do that, the ship hurts me if I get too close.Now? No worries, I can walk straight through it.I assure you, this is one of many, many bugs that I've encountered. The list got so long I didn't bother remembering them.Then, there's the simple fact that some things are either badly implemented, have missing icons, mismatched icons, or maybe their help file doesn't exist.Make some iron pipe if you can. Or find something that requires iron pipe and look at the picture. As of this moment, the picture is a big red x and the words ""NO ICON"". Go grab some cave flora from the cold or toxic caverns. One of each. Then, place them. Place them against a wall, and turn them twice, so they're actually right-side-up. Don't ask why. Now, compare the flora you just placed to the icon. They're mismatched. A is B, B is A, C is D, etc.How about auto-excavators? Place one on a wall, and you'll probably think it can dig a 3x3 hole horizontally. Maybe if you place it on the ceiling, it can dig down, instead of up! Why would you think that? Because the column of light indicating where it can dig shows that!You'd be wrong. Once you power it up, no matter where you're trying to 'aim' it, it shoots up.The list goes on. There are things that are just plain problematic. Things that are useless. Things that make no sense. Things that are poorly implemented, buggy, unfinished, and more. It is, quite frankly, awful, and if you look at the pictures saying ""Oh, I want that!"", then either join a server with a dozen other players or be prepared to keep playing for WEEKS (Actual time played, not number of days you played for a little while) in order to get there.

												After about 100 hours pure playing time, I can definitely recommend this game to all those who liked/loved Factorio or similar games.You are stranded on a foreign planet, but somehow a small friend called Arthur and a giang spider-bot survived the impact (or you built them after the crash, I don't know). The world looks like Minecraft, but feels more realistic, and your task is to gather ressources and build up a working factory (not like a big plant, but several small pieces put together to smelt, craft, shape, improve, research many things you find on the planet) so that you can finally be rescued or something (don't know, I didn't came so far yet). But (same as Minecraft, Factorio and similar) you are not alone on this planet. The more you proceed down the earth (or however this planet is called) the more you attract some kind of insectiods, which will visit your factory from time to time and check if you need anything (like terror and death). They seemed driven by a higher intelligence, and yes there is something like that. Either somewhere burried in earth are some huge globbing eyes hidden behind a undiggable wall of ... don't know what, looks like the stuff from the Alien-Movie. Those ""Eyes"" send small creatues to steal ressources from unprotected conveyors to reach with their ugly arms after your factory. The other ones are vastly huge, four-headed, brain-thingy, glowing ... things. Well, you will recognize once you see them. And, I don't know wether I was day-dreaming... but I think I saw something like that worm from Star Wars that was hidden inside that asteroid trying to eat the Falcon... Conclusion:Quit your Job, break up with girl-/boyfriend, close windows and doors, headphones on, uhm... maybe VR if you have  and buy the game. You will not regret (as long as you belong to the above mentioned target group) !			"

												Let me start by saying that this game IS FUN.  I have played for many hours(although a lot of that time was spent afk... I tend to forget I have games running) The basic concept of the game is great, gather resources, build massive assembly lines, defend against attacks, all to save yourself when you crashed on a freezing planet.  So then why the negative review?  The game appears to be a released title but upon deeper investigation (after I had bought the game, stupid me) I realized that it was still in Alpha/Beta but the developer wanted to make more money so he ""released"" it on steam.  The game has missing icons/textures, wonky AI, and is still has a MASSIVE list of features to be added, bugs to fix, and balance issues to address.  I havn't encountered the game breaking crashes/bugs others have reported.  IF I WANTED TO PLAY EARLY ACCESS I WOULD BE HAPPY.  The game is being updated and features are being added.  The negative review stems from the fact that it is not a complete game even though it appears that way at first.Oh, also the dev has stated that he is breaking the game into several expansion packs.  So you only get part of the content for your initial purchase.  However he only recently decided this(or made it clear).  I can understand wanting to get paid but it is sneaky and dishonest to publish an unfinished game and then charge people more money if they want the finished product.  If all this were clear on the store page I wouldn't be writing this review(and would probably be fine with it... although i would have waited until the game was complete before considering purchase).  The sneaky way it is handled is what bothers me.So FOR NOW I do not reccomend purchasing this game.  When it is finished (provided it get's there, i've had baaad luck with early access titles, I will rewrite this review. "

Early Access Review
								Totally recommend this game, 10/10 even at pre-alphaIf  you are a creative person and enjoy building, then in this game even at pre-alpha you can build anything you can think of, your imagination is your only limitation, if you have the patience to learn how to use the tools in this gaame to create whatever your imagination inspires then you will love it.     You may like to check out the many screenshots and guides in the community hubOne of the main features i love about Fortresscraft are the creative tools we are given to make our creations.....for example...""the workshop"" a  plaace you can build and save your own custom detail blocks to then use to build your own creations, best of all you can create well in excess of 1,000 of them if you so wanted to.""superbuild mode""instantly create small or huge square areas of blocks, do the same for a cylinder shape, and also create Spheres, either sit back in amazement and watch as they build in front of you or go and build something else while they are being built for you.""copy & paste and schematics""wow........just...wow ....select something you have built like a house or in my case a Robot made with 50+ custom detail blocks, then copy it, then paste it somewhere else or save it as a schematic then go to your schematics at any time and select it and paste it whenever you want to. You can eeven rotate the whole thing before you paste it.... amazing""lighting""configurable lighting at that!!!! configure the colour strength and distance and even shadow type, individually for every single light you place.I could go on and on but then if you are liking whats mentioned above then you are most likely going to enjoy the game and enjoy exploring everything else out once you start playing it and creating anything you can think up.I hope this review is of help to you. For other info check the Community hub guides and screenshots, and if you purchase the game then i hope you enjoy it as much as i have been.			"

												I'm now 30 hours into the game and only played singleplayer, I have to say that after KSP it is the best game I played in the last 5 years!It is still in development, and I think great work is being made to gradually improve the game while still providing an excellent game experience in an unfinished game.I love the automation possibilities the game is offering, and it just feels right in terms of balance: the time it takes producing resurces to automate things forces you to pay attention to things like defence and backups to your existing mines.I recommand this game to all those people that like to use their brain while playing!

								So, i'm about 60 hours in and i must say, i recommend this game.Fortresscraft Evolved is an early access game, and as such it has it's kinks (not that many though), but the content so far is great, and over the past few weeks that i have owned the game, i have seen a lot of development activity and content added.I also think the developers show great transparancy, through detailed patch notes and the ability from the player side to choose what build you want to run, as in you can choose to run the stable version, beta version or bleeding edge if you want to be up to date with the newest of the new developments.*update*I'm at 90 something hours played now, and entheusiasm has not faded a bit, i'd just like to add that; It has been my experience that the devs, to me, seem very open to ideas, but also eager to resolved issues and bugs, i've not had a single bug report or feature request that hasn't recieved attention from the devs yet, seems to me that the developers are very active part of the community.

								This game gets worse reviews than it deserves. Keep in mind this is an early access game guys, it's not complete don't expect it to be.The gameplay is pretty decent, it's all about automation and machines. A skilled player could make some truly complex machinery which would be super fun. It's minecrafty but unique, a great play for minecraft fans who are tired of playing the same game all the time.I personally find the identifying blocks and researching things to be very entertaining and satisfying.

												I hate giving this game a negative review, because I really like it. But I've a simple rule: Games that are incomplete and not marked early access get the thumbs down. There are many resources with descriptions like ""not implemented yet"" or ""has no use yet, but will soon."" There are big mechanics of the game (losing a base assault for example) which don't do anything. The game is quite playable and enjoyable, but it's not even in beta yet.Alot of people were complaining about this game, and honestly I think it was because they didn't understand the mechanics. I remember one guy complaining that generators don't work underground so you can't go very deep... i guess he didn't see all the power transmission devices? But then, blocky games with ""craft"" in the title are clearly targetting the minecraft audience, and I think this game requires a bit more maturity to understand.The game really is pretty good, although a bit rough around the edges. I think the game could use a rebalance to make resource management less cumbersome. Specifically, late game components (mk III lasers for example) take quite a few resources to build. But hey, it's an automation game so that's perfectly reasonable, you just need to build more mines. The problem is that if you build enough mines to keep those your factory making those at a reasonable pace, the storage of resources becomes a nightmare.In my situation, I've got two or three machines making late game components, and my storage facility (which is really big btw) is either completely empty, or overflowing to the point where my transit lines jam up. I'm constantly running up and down my mine to turning drills on and off so that my storage won't overflow, becase honestly (and here's the important part) it's easier to turn them on and off then to make a storage facility large enough to support the flow.I often see the developer on the forums asking things like ""what would you like to see?"" I'd like to see cheaper storage and transport in the early game (so you can ramp up faster without all the waiting for tin bars), and higher tier transport and storage in the late game. Just something as simple as a ""super hopper"" that's expensive but holds 1000 resources would go a long way. A faster transport system then the tubes would be nice too (or maybe mk 4 lasers and more powerful matter-movers). Just something along those lines.Anyway, that's my take on it. I love the factory games, and this is the best 3D one I've found, although it still has a long way to go. To those who like the automation aspects of this game, do make a point of looking at Factorio though, because it is the best IMHO.			"

												Do NOT be fooled this is NOT a minecraft ripoff, although it is a blocky game.This game is about base automation and defending that base from hostiles.There is an aim and end too this game. Not just dig dig dig.Yes it has blocks and looks a bit like those other blocky games, but it is not ""just another rip off"".This game is about -resource management-strategy and proritisation-energy management-logistics-efficient layout-organisation of your base.  Then there is the tower defence side of things too.Pro's -process automation-runs well -active developer-developer engages with the players-developer is passionate about the game-Survival and creative modes-generally better graphics than many other blocky games-Need to think differently to get the hang of automation-Strategy -Good for an indie game-Co-op Multiplayer-Ongoing development of new features-Ore scanner - I love the ore scanner!!! Con's -Need to think differently, can take time to get head around automation-Tower defence may not appeal to everyone-Not perfect (but no worse than a lot of AAA titles I have bought)-Can lose hours of your day without realising-Some mobs are a little annoying-Some animations are glitchy-Learning curve can seem a bit steep, until you change the way you thinkNOTE I have not had the pleasure trying the multiplayer so I can't comment on the state of it but it is present.

												I've been around a long time and played a lot of stuff, so hopefully this statement will have some gravity: FortressCraft Evolved is easily one of the most engaging, intellectually stimulating, enjoyable experiences I have ever had with a game.  No caveats.  It's not just good ""for a game developed by one guy,"" it's good period.  On top of that, it's backed by a strong and helpful community, and a dev that engages with us on a daily basis to take in feedback.  Depending on how you play it, it is also extremely challenging, in a way that, rather than testing your ability to move and click your mouse as quickly as possible, tests your ability to problem solve.As I'm writing this, I'm noticing that the price for the game is $4.41 (base), or $13.90 (with all DLC) because of the winter sale.  That's insane.  At 576 hours played, that's a little over $0.02/hour.  I guess they say the best things in life are free... or at least close to it. "

								Fortresscraft Evolved. This game to me has become (evolved) into a game that compares to the likes of minecraft except in my opinion it has become better and is constantly improving.  With the likes of HMKAGM, myself and a few others who are in contact with DJ the developer we are constantly advising on improvements for the game and subsequently the game is constantly evolving.  If you like minecraft I am 90% sure you will like this game, give it a go. It is the 1st game I have ever given a review to as it is the 1st game I have found that warrants it.  5 star rating all the way Keep up the great work DJ.			"

												This is an updated review. Recommendation remains the same.I hate tower defense games, and I despise them with a passion. There are a few exceptions, if they are cleverly hidden or done in such a way that a player does not feel punished for playing an overly specific strategy. FortressCraft Evolved, accomplishes this feat, so I give it a glowing recommendation.Let's start this off by saying it is less about ""building"" a base in the sense one would in other survival games. You are essentially building yourself a self-sustaining factory that will get increasingly more complex, and better defended in a nearly endless cycle. Oh, and you're going to have to do this with a constant threat of aliens that will scale their attacks to how well you are doing.This does not mean the game is punishing you for doing well, but rather rewarding you with better loot, and always having some sense of urgency. There is a tipping point where you can outright utterly crush the alien threat if you so choose. With the Frozen Factory Expansion, ending one threat allows you to focus on a new threat, or fight both at the same time if you are feeling adventurous. With many survival games, it gets boring once you hit a certain point, but in FortressCraft Evolved, the game will try harder to wreck your progress.Naturally, the player is not going to want to lose all that progress after investing many hours into their elaborate base. This is not a problem, because once the aliens kill the CPH, they all leave. They don't blow everything up to get to it either, so they rush that part of the base and only that part (with exceptions). Your goal is to have enough firepower to prevent that. Which, with a giant mechanized spider warmachine, turrets, missile launchers, and your crappy laser rifle, give the player lots to work with. Of course, keeping missiles stocked, turrets powered, and the spiderbot fueled is the player's responsibility.This may irritate some players, as they'll either feel ""too rushed"" or ""not rushed enough"" which comes down to player preference, not balance. There are also some people who feel the game is too grindy, yet there are settings to speed things along, so if this is a complaint, they never bothered to actually use them. Many of the negative reviews are people who either A) Didn't follow the integrated tutorial. B) Did not check any settings ever. C) Had issues that Unity caused, not the developer. This isn't some rampant fanboy comment either, as the same issue arose in several other games at the same time!To add to that, the developer is active, and involved with the community. Visiting streams, streaming while working, and on several occassions personally fixed a bug on the spot. I'm not joking, I had a bug and brought it up on stream, and that bug was fixed within minutes. There are few developers that care that much. Yes, they are blunt too which might seem a tad arrogant, but at least you know where you stand. Sometimes a suggestion is met with a good discussion about ""why that won't happen"" which means that the developer has a vision, and not prone to ""feature creep"". Despite a few heated discussions personally (usually on why not x feature from Factorio), I still felt respected as long as respect was given. For a game review, I mention this because developer interaction is important, even long after the game has left Early Access.If you can swing it, I'd highly recommend the Frozen Factory Expansion as well. It adds more stuff, a new enemy threat, and is a seemless transition from vanilla to the expansion. With another Expansion down the road, there has been a lot of new free content that has been added as well, so the game is still going strong.Overall, I recommend FortressCraft Evolved. I would like to mention that as a fan of ""logistics"" style games like Factorio, this game feels right at home so I enjoy both for different reasons. Co-op is stable, and quite fun. I play with the same group for a lot of different games, and every playthrough we're always trying/finding something new. For the hours I've put in, the money I've spent (even on the dev's Patreon) has been well worth it.System Specs CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K Processor @ 4.40GHz CPU Cooler: Corsair H100i GPU: GeForce GTX 970 G1 Gaming Memory: Corsair Vengeance 32GB OS: Windows 10 Pro "

 2017 Update It still amazes me that 1 Dev built this game... This is not a game you pick up and spend a few hours and get to see most of the game, the base game, start to finish for a ""new"" player could easily take 150-200hrs (learning curve, experimenting) You will have a massive ""factory"" style base with tower defense action by the time you are done. Its quite amazing setting up new, efficient production capabilities within this game. You could compare this to Factorio in some aspects but it definitely takes it own spin and style.  Cons: - Not friendly to new players - The first 75hrs you put in, you can probably do in 20hrs in a second attempt- Early Grind - This actually turns off 80-90% of the players from the last statistics I saw, it sucks, I still hate it but its a new game grind that the Dev keeps in this game for some reason.   My biggest gripe to date: It's still being tweaked and updated with expansions (your probably wondering why thats bad)... Well, its a one man team and for me, optimization took a drop following Version 14/15 and we have an expansion on the near horizon. The lag spikes and issues get more apparent the larger your base gets, he has released performance improvements in the past few updates but it still doesn't feel that it is helping much. This pretty much made me shelf the game. Recommendation: Its definitely worth every penny. Just be prepared for some issues mid to late game until he has more time to focus on them.  "

												The indie games I've played over the years have typically been solid ambassadors of their genres and as such set a high standard and I'm sad to admit that fortresscraft evolved is not a great game. Playing it will require you to plough through any of the inevitable boredom or irritation you will likely initially experience. I wouldn't be surprised if only 1% of the people who bought this game played over 10 hours. If you consider yourself a tolerant and patient person, and loved factorio, then perhaps this is a game for you. You may even love this game as I did. I would especially recommend it on sale.If you do decide to buy this game, I recommend watching some playthroughs on youtube, specifically Tango Tek or direwolf20. They are both entertaining and provide a great tutorial of at least the early-mid game. Enough to get you started. But yet again this comes down to the effort you are willing to put in. If you have a life rather than a sinkhole of hours, this game is not for you. I very much enjoy this game, but the game suffers numerous flaws.I'm going to say what I didn't like about the game, as I feel it would be more useful to the reader. Main points are emboldened, so just read those unless you want some detail.--  Lack of a proper tutorial  --You start with a bad joke of an unfinished tutorial which is totally unbefitting of a game as complex as fortresscraft evolved. There is a LOT of material you need to get to grips with, while the tutorial shows you the basics in as minimal a way as possible.Granted, there is a brilliant help mechanic known as contextual help, showing you suggested items found at your stage in the game, selected hotbar items, current research etc. I found this essential on my first playthrough, and it's more helpful than I feel I'm making it sound. However as useful as it is, it much feels like dragging my eyes through page after page in a sort of wiki. This game has a  HUGE  learning curve. It really just needs a proper optional tutorial.--  Game is Buggy/Unpolished  --This game is very raw and has quite a few bugs. It should certainly still be in early access. Some even accuse the developer of trying to get more sales through an incomplete release. All the 'little things' that fill out the detail in a game and give it life often just can't be found, which I believe is due to a complete lack of motivation when it comes to the developer refining such aspects.The UI is quite ugly. There aren't any sorting algorithms in inventory. Item transfer to storage is poor, totally manual, and tedious. Animations are short, or non-existant; dying in every way will result in a message popup on screen before you respawn. Alien attacks consist of 3 (sort of 4) enemy designs, (most of which you won't see for a very long time), all fairly basic and all essentially only feature variations in health; a total lack of effort in that field. There are about 7 enemy creatures in total. Progression is a little erratic, which I pin to bad design. You can see through unloaded chunks in the game and see certain objects. The game has placeholder items that do not yet exist. Crafting recipes that are 'to be removed'. Some items are missing icons. Game progression is clunky and non-uniform. This game should NOT have been seeing a release for quite a while. --  Gameplay and progression is slow, unintuitive and erratic  --This game is entirely about gameplay.That said the gameplay in this is so slow that it's comparable to a civilisation game. This is not a bad thing in itself, but the game is not entertaining enough through all portions of this time. The main reason this game takes so long is the learning curve, but also the complexity of the game. If it were employed correctly, this complexity would be a delightful thing. Some of the complexity of this game could be considered to be filler, 'fleshing out' time where it doesn't and shouldn't really exist. Looking into what's been [partially implemented/recently introduced] into the game so far, it looks like this isn't going to improve. The game is also a little asymmetrical in terms of its progression. Certain things will be required to progress, which may depend on luck, and can be infuriating, especially given how unintuitive parts of the game are, and how there can be missing information that should be in the game, or on the wiki, etc. For example, organic rock and the smelting bottleneck. Perfect eyes as the T3 (and T2 and a half) barrier and hardened resin. These examples are those on luck. It should also be noted that in my playthroughs I've been quite fortunate, recieving comparatively large ore veins so that I had to do less restructuring and relocating in between other tasks. Others may not be as fortunate and may have to spend time backtracking in addition to the awkward progression. Certainly no fun when you're waiting on resources for conveyors. A positive element of the gameplay would be the tower defence, which I quite enjoy and wish there was more focus on, providing a logisitcal challenge, and later even a minor tactical one. There is an emphasis on efficiency in general in this game, which means it can be quite rewarding of good ideas and consideration to the mechanics. —  Graphics  —The game is generally quite ugly. Very little emphasis on visuals and even less on visual effects. Some effects may look quite cool, and some machines unique, but the rest of the game in general just looks bad or plain.However my beef here is with the lighting system. It makes everything look completely crap. Bloom everywhere where you place lights, or during the day, and total pitch black darkness everywhere else anytime else. This area really needs some work.--  DLC, the dev and the community  --While nowhere near as bad as say... Payday 2, DLC is certainly starting to become a noticeable concept within this game, which can only barely be considered complete. they're even selling skins for your character at this point in development (despite being first person). A full display of the dev's priories.The community is toxic in some spaces. It's like a stream of people with the attitude of professional youtube commenters come for a ride on any fortresscraft forums. Lots of baseless hate. Some pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. See other reviews for more detail on that. Dev is sometimes a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥himself where he can get away with it.I'd love to see more games settle in this genre, it's generally fun, but poorly executed in this case, maybe because of the small idea-pool. Overall community response to dev and communication with the community from what I've seen is displeasing, despite the game supposedly having been in early access. Maybe someone can pick up the baton, perhaps even the dev, even if only little further.			"

												I've played this game more than any other game, well over 700 hours.  I will play for a few weeks every day and then move onto something else, however FortressCraft keeps pulling me back, at which point I start a new game.  The game is constantly updated with new stuff. You start at the crash site of your ship, with a few machines and a brief tutorial.  When I first started over a year ago, the game didn't have a guide to the early game.  Now in the corner of the screen the game will suggest what you should focus on.  You can follow that or not, but I think it's helpful to new players.  The game becomes like a tower defense after your base threat level reaches 100 or higher.  Your threat increases the more you build machines and generators.  You can build Threat Reduces to bring that number back down, something I did when I first started playing, to avoid the wasps which shoot acid at your Hub.  I have since found out that it's better to focus on defensive turrets and arming your SpiderBot with blasters.  At threat level 100 to I dunno, a few hundred, only a few waves of some wasps will come at you.  The higher the number, the more waves of higher numbers will come.  Eventually when you get into the 1000s larger bugs will attack and when you get higher still giant creatures will spawn.  The focus of this game is automation.  I used to try to do everything manually, taking 100s of trips up and down into deep caverns to retrieve ore.  Many new techologies have been added to the game such as transporters and lifts to automate the process.  BTW don't use conveyor belts below like 75 or 80m because creatures will spawn on them and consume your resources.  I should note that I play on ""scarce"" resources and power, meaning it takes more ore to smelt into each bar and less power generation.  I also play on Clumsy death, meaning I drop my inventory items upon death and have to make a corpse run.  ""Scarce"" difficulty really increases the time needed to progress.  After spending 100s of hours discovering new, better ways of doing things, I think I have a pretty good system going.  I haven't really watched any videos or read any tips on playing this game.  I prefer to figure out things on my own.  There are videos and guides out there to help you get started, offering tips to optimize your efforts/resources/time, etc.  I could've saved TONS of time by watching these but I like to discover better ways of doing things on my own.  The game seems intimidating at first, but it's addicting!  The developer has added beginner tips and technology guides you can see by pressing ""H"".  Also before researching, highlight a technology and press ""H"" to see what machines the research will unlock.  This is relatively new and very helpful to make research decisions when starting out.  I recommend suit upgrades, mining upgrades, and power upgrades first.  Also mine as much coal as you can!  You will need tons in the early game before better power generation methods are available.  I recommend starting on the default ""plenty"" resouces/power.  It will greatly shorten the time needed to really get going.  Research requires research points which are gained by scanning unknown plants and materials.  Scan everything!  You will eventually gain enough research points to research everything, but it's best to choose carefully in the early game so read the help guide to make the right decisions.  I highly recommend this game, it's one of my favorites and it's always fun to discover better ways of doing things.  If you want a game with fast progression and quick rewards, this may not be the game for you.  Researching in the early game takes a lot of time and you can quickly run out of coal to generate power.			"

												I rather enjoy the game. It has been interesting to try and make systems, upgrade, and expand them effectively while maintaining defenses. The various game modes / difficulties allow for a tailored experience to your level of time and involvement.Edit: The game is a minecraft like world based around automation. It has tower defense like objectives of defending your base.			"

												Great game. Been changed so much from last christmas and keeps getting better.When i 1st played it all you had to do was mine and automate production. That was last year, now just mining is only half of it. You gotta set up defences with turrets to save ur main base from attack from mobs (the more u produce you more come) You gotta protect your belts for moving ore up from the mines with turrets also to stop the hiveminds from claiming the ore back (Dont feed the hiveminds!) You've been warned. The tiers of equipment just keep getting bigger and better when i 1st played tier 1 to tier 3 was all i had now its up to tier 5 with 4.5mil storage! Multiblock batterys, solar arrays, labs, jet engines and other equipment all to help you advance just keep you wanting to keep building for faster lazers, more lethal turrets and faster energy makers. Every 300 blocks down or so there are special areas to keep you on ur toes these change the game around .Normal conveyor belts are that depth freeze so you need to upgrade to quicker ways to move ore like minecarts or air tubes. Its a very fun game where tactics and planning ahead will help you alot.			"

								I've played a few games where you go around gathering resources and building stuff, and this is my favourite. There are obviously a few games in this genre, and most of the ones I've tried grab you pretty quickly, but they also let you go pretty quickly.This one, I'm still gripped, and with 37 hours showing, I can see 100's of hours still to be played, there is a lot to do in this, and it is still in active development, which is great.You start at your home base, with nothing. (As standard.) You wander around, dig stuff up, look for stuff with your scanner. Go back to base. Check out what you've found, discover a few new things to build.Dig up more stuff, build more stuff, research more stuff. That's the basics.You can sculpt vast areas, build huge supply chains to feed the machines you build, build bigger machines, set up defenses against the evil natives. And the more you do, the more you are thinking, ' Just need to do that, then I can do this, and that let's me do that, and then.....' and so it goes. This is a damn big game, and very addictive. Like I said, a lot of games in this genre, but this is the ace in the pack.Look at the price, it's an absolute bargain!			"

												One of the few games were countless hours of planning truly pay off.  It makes me think of time as a resource.  It  provides me with the keys to allow me to automate my operations.  I'm the kind of player that will build and break down something twenty times over to squeeze every ounce of efficiency out of it.   Fortresscraft rewards this kind of attention to detail.. Just when you think you have it figured out and the resources are rolling in, you go deeper in the world and find more challenges to work through.  Dev is active, honest, and smart.  Community is helpful.  Game is patched and improved very often.  If you are the anal, obssessive, and detail oriented gamer that I am, you need to go ahead and buy this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Note: This is an Early Access review and may not reflect the finished product.After spending aproximately 170 hours in FC:E I feel that I am able to give a fairly accurate review of the current state of the game.FC:E basically has two modes to play in; Creative and Survival.CreativeThe game looks and feels very similar to many other voxel based games out there - notably Minecraft. However, FC:E stands out from the crowd due to the rather powerful tools that are available to the player. The various tools that you are able to use allow you to make very large and very intricate creations. Copy/Pasting sections of the world can be done very quickly and the ability to create your own blocks using the ingame workshop function allow a level of creativity that has not really been seen in such voxel games previously. I myself have not spent a huge amount of time in creative, however from the limited hours I have put in it became clear rather quick that those who enjoy the freedom of making anything they want will really benefit from these tools and this level of freedom.SurvivalHere's the mode that has stolen a huge amount of my time. In basic terms the survival aspect draws many of the gameplay aspects of those in Minecraft - mining, resource management etc. but here's where FC:E does it differently. A huge focus of FC:E's survival mode is based upon automation and logistics, creating large transport, mining and power networks to build a base and gather resources.The blocks that exist in the game all have useful functions and although can be a bit daunting at first, are quite easy to use and options for creativity open up once you get the hang of things. If you've played anything like the Feed the Beast modpacks for Minecraft or Factorio then this is the game for you.Current state of the gameAs far as I am aware the engine for this game was built by the developers themselves, allowing them to tailor it to suit the needs of a game like this. It's definately not perfectly optimised, but I have certainly seen worse and the development team are constantly working to improve on this as well as fix bugs, this is to be expected in an Early Access game.There's a decent amount of content in the game to allow you to spend quite a few hours building and creating what you want. The development cycle is quite fluid and the creators are quite active on the forums, responding to questions, asking for feedback, addressing issues etc.Mobs and combat are the next big thing to come, which will add quite a bit in terms of gameplay as you will need to defend your base and resources.Multiplayer in Creative is complete and as far as I'm aware pretty free of bugs. Survival Multiplayer is currently in a working condition although there are some bugs still to be ironed out, but as mentioned previously the devs are quite open and transparent about this and work on this is constant.Overall I believe this game is a steal at it's current price. Judging from what is already in the game and what has been discussed as the future of FC:E on the forums I really think this game sets itself apart from all the Minecraft clones on the market.			"

								Brilliant concept and tons of potential, but has failed miserably.Bought this game over a year ago. Nothing has changed. I saw the devs update less and less. Then Nothing. Then almost Months later come back screaming ""where not dead!!!!."" with no updates since then or anythign else done.Its my assumption this game is dead.Sure, some fun things to do in creative, but i bougth this for survival. And so its unplayable. So many bugs and glitches. You dig a hole and the wall disapears or you fall forever. Dig a deep hole to mine. No simple later to climb your way back up. Just that grappling hook which is ridicously stupid since you will grab a wall and will just fall instead of holding onto the ledge to regrapple to the next higher area.No enemies even though they sit there. You can't find any specific ore, or be able to access the ones you need.The robots or other tech to help you gather the resources don't work and create a really big irritant. I spent majority of my time running between sites trying to repower them so they could work a little more.Then you die by freezing to death. Go underground Freeze. Search for deposits, Freeze. Lose your energy, Freeze. No way to locate your base? Freeze. Repower yourself and end up burning yourself Alive.Speaking of which, No compass or way to find your base again! Yes the map is small (which is another issue), but you can't find your base, because everyhting looks the same.The map is small and you can't find any materials you need. I kept digging and digging, not a single material i needed (Lithium) *cough* *cough* could be found.I thougth this game would feature defend you minning base or somthing cause aliens will attack. Nope....And oh yes the UI.... Looks like a kid in HS made it. I mean its bad. Majoirty of the items in your inventory don't have images. Half the items don't work. and when would I make more than one item at a time? unless I'm in creative mode where I'm just messing around. At that point its boring to me. Sure maybe for you artsy ppl this is great. but for me its a waste of time and I find no entertainment out of it.Overall, A great concept. But executed so poorly and lacks so many updates. it is the worst game on my steam account.			"

TL,DR: If you like complex games that make you think and experiment and don't mind a little rough around the edges gameplay/difficulty curve typical of a one-man development studio, you'll most likely get your money's worth out of this title.An interesting and fun take on a survival, factory building, and tower defense game. After crashing on a frozen planet, you're forced to bend that planet to your will in an attempt to destroy the native life threatening your very existence. You'll dig deep and unearth the resources to build ever more complex machines and the defenses to protect them. Don't let the voxels used in the game fool you, this is not a Minecraft clone even though there is a creative mode available. The real draw is survival. If it's too difficult, you could always bring a friend as FC:E is also multiplayer with both local and dedicated servers available!This is a true indie gem written solely by DJArcas who streams most of his development and is accessable via Steam forums. This title has come a long way since it has come out of Early Access and now has a full expansion titled the Frozen Factory, which further utilizes the chilly methane gas filled caverns found hundreds of meters beneath the surface of the planet. There is another planned expansion that will focus on even deeper layers near the planet's ""core"".DJArcas is also toying around with bringing VR to FortressCraft: Evolved. You can't do much except for touring your factory in VR, but it's still pretty neat. You do need a pretty hefty PC to run the game without VR, and enabling VR makes this requirement even more paramount.Most of the negative reviews are from veteran players that are upset about ""recent"" changes to the game that force you to *gasp* build machines and production lines (a.k.a. play the game). These changes include not being able to carry unlimited amounts of ore in your inventory and being unable to smelt ores underground. This is done to force the player to utilize the plethora of machines and automation at their disposal to accomplish these tasks and craft their factory. I'd like to reiterate that these negatives will have no impact to new players of the game as they haven't been spoiled by these shortcuts. This is akin to the players complaining that there is now fall damage in-game and now have to work around it (yes, this also happened). If you absolutely have to cheat, FortressCraft: Evolved is also Steam Workshop compatible and has mods available that basically enable cheating.			"

												You'll see a lot of people complaining about how this ""used to be fun"", and upset because reasons. To sum up:This is a game about automation; they are upset that they have to automate. This game has always been about trying to automate things and, yes, forcing automation, because it makes the most sense. How many people here can build a plastic gizmo by hand? How many people here, if given that task, would go buy a 3D printer to do it?If you are a new player and don't have the expectation that you can carry around 70K worth of ore in your magic pouch, then you'll find this game fun. If you are a new player and expect to have to automate things (and protect them!) then you'll have fun.  "

								Okay, I don't really know where to start.  Should I start with the amazing superbuild tool or the awesome weather staff?  I don't know.  I guess I'll start with the pros.  Two of the biggest advantages of FortressCraft (gonna call it fc from now on) are the superbuild tool and the copy/paste tool.  I find both of these EXTREMELY useful.  I can cut the time in half by just holding down ctrl + m1/m2, whereas in a game like Minecraft (I'm probably going to compare/contrast fc to Minecraft a lot in this review) it takes much time, patience, and effort to build things on a large scale.  Also, the way that the terrain spawns is pretty cool.  It moves in to take position instead of just appearing like in Minecraft.  Next, the list of blocks to choose from, in my opinion, is WAY bigger than that of Minecraft.  Configurable Lights, Ore Extractors, heck, even a huge laser gun!  Now before I start getting a lot of nasty comments on this review let me make one thing clear:  I do NOT hate Minecraft.  I actually like it. In some cases, I prefer it over fc, but remember:  this is the pros section. Okay, where was I?  Oh yes, the large library of blocks to choose from.  Ok, so moving on.  I also particularly like the lighting of the certain blocks that produce it.  I also like that the blocks to choose from are mostly sci-fi themed, whereas Minecraft has more of a 'survival' themed list.  Alright, I think that covers the pros!  Now to the cons.  Fc is probably one of the buggiest games that I've ever played.  Now, hold you horses!  This is an EARLY ACCESS game.  You would be a fool to think that an early access game wouldn't be buggy.  I'm sure that all of the glitches/bugs will be gone in time.  Also, after you fly around for a while and you land, your sight radius dramatically shrinks.  Sometimes, I can only see about 10 blocks in front of me, and that's it until I restart.  Again, early access game.  It will get fixed in due time as with the efficiency of the servers.  One last thing:  I know that it's being built/programmed as I type this review, but as of this moment, fc is ENTIRELY single player.  PLEASE don't leave comments about how it's being made right now.  I'm just saying that if you're planning to buy it right now then be prepared to play ALONE.  Obviously, the pros outmatch the cons by a landslide, so I give this game a 2 thumbs up!  I can't wait to see how this game adapts and evolves!!!			"

								This game wasted so much time of my life but i can say it was worth it. I played it since early stages and seen it evolve and I can say that devs are really working hard to make this game aversome. There are of course bugs, but they not game breaking, and you can easly ignore them. What i feel playing only survival mode that it's Minecraft on steroids. You get building gun that has VERY long range, infinite world with no bottom and TONS of things to craft. And its not simply digging a few blocks and just making them into some items. You need to use machines to mine ore and coal, power it up and get ore to smelter to get bars for stuff to make. You need to research new machines and tools, and some research proyect requie several machines setup and TONS of power and metal to get.But the best thing about this game is building automation. You can set up a mine, connect to storage, to engine, load with coal and just come back for ore later. Or you can connect conveyor belts and your ore is transported to smelter, power mine from some sorts of power that is supplied by coal from other mines and your mine will work by itself until it runs out of ore. You can sort your materials, set up complicated structures and watch how its nicely work by itself.The only think that it's lacking is info how things work. You get short toturial, but basically you need to figure out how each machine works, and there are few dozens of different machines.This game is great. Maybe not perfect, but it's something I've been looking to play for a long time.			"

												From the brief time I have played this game thus far it is a great game!It has a great concept and hopefully continues to evolve over the next few years as the developer hopes!The sad thing here though is that 'out-dated' negative reviews are killing this games progress as reviews do not expire as a game evolves.I think the review system on Steam is flawed in that respect as it does not retire reviews after a certain period of time, especially if the devs fix the issues, instead if a game has a rocky launch(as this did) it is forever doomed with that mark on its name, even if the dev fixes the issues.Looking at the negative reviews a lot of the negative reviews are from a long time ago before fixes etc and some things claimed by some users are no longer valid.That aside,Gameplay wise, this is a voxel technology/research game.You need to build systems to power your base, and research new technology to progress.If you enjoy tech mods in minecraft, this is definately worth a look.In my opinion it is very generously prices.. I have paid a LOT more for games I have played a lot less off.This being said, and I will update this review in a week or so after I clock up some more hours.For the time being, I love the concept and how the game plays and want to support it by adding a positive review!

								This is set to replace minecraft for me as a primary always return to game, Fortresscraft Evolved handles all my logistical needs and deserves much more visibility than it currently recieves.  I am a survival player and while I saw this a while back at the time it was a creative game.  The survival element is perfectly executed for those who like the playstyle of modded minecraft.  If you looked at Fortresscraft Evolved in the past I'd recommend giving it another look.If there was any room for improvement, I would say that a dedicated server would be a welcome feature. and as soon as it is available, (preferably for linux) it will sit up there with my other 3-4 hosted games.

An extensive in-game help and mission system help to shorten the learning curve to get you automating and growing your base. You can even create a dedicated server and play with friends!Modding support offers a custom game experience that helps squeeze even more enjoyment and challenge out of the game. And the Frozen Factory expansion is well worth the price adding a huge amount of content.And as a shameless plug, if you get stuck on something I have over 300 videos on Youtube going over every aspect of the game.

								In a nutshell review, Early July 2015:Strong RecommendGameplay hours: at least 20+Beta version updates happening weekly or better - very activeDevs active online and taking feedback, adjusting bleeding edge beta almost dailyFor now, it is a mining game: you'll have the most fun if you enjoy building an industrial town/machine and gradually automate your mining operation.Depending on how much you like to tinker, there is at least 20+ hours to get to current endgame (quarry), but that can easily extend as you learn to use the various components to achieve certain things you thought couldn't be done. A lot of the core fun is to figure out a way out of these challenges.Work has just started on PVE, you might want to avoid the Bleeding edge version of the beta until you master the basics and stick to stable or standard beta until you know what you're doing as they are tweaking things and adding stuff continuously.

(If you think its a clone, go ahead, play it, form your own opinion)Detailled review:I have played the game in very different stages in its development. It changed vastly, and IMHO it is ALOT better!Since I moved to bleeding_edge updates there is an update at least once a week.That is a very nice update paste and its very calming to my mind, that if I find a bug its fixed rather quickly.Now to the features:Machines, machines and even bigger machines. Automation is a key feature in this game. From time to time some mob waves attack you, which can be fought with LASER turrets! I mean, LASER TURRETS!Is there Multiplayer?- Yes there is and its fun!Is there more content coming?- Yes, alot is planned, but it obvisously takes time to implement and test properly.Do I recommend the game?- Yes, I fully embrace you to buy this game and play it! It really is fun to play!PS: This is MY opinion. If you don't agree, well, thats your opinion then ;)			"

												Starting to lose a lot of time to this game...  It's fun.First off, this isn't a clone of a well known game.  After researching this game I knew I wanted it.  Spent almost an entire night reading and watching videos for this game.  Happily, when I woke up the next morning, this game was on sale.  Immediately bought two copies: one for me and one for a good buddy.I am having some occassional issues with crashes, but mainly when I do something graphically intense, such as ping colored ores.  I have not yet even cared to try the DirextX9 workaround, because it really doesn't crash all that often.  And most times it does, it's after hours of gameplay and I just take a break anyways.The game is still being updated and bug fixed by the dev, which is good.Alright, I'll address the elephant in the room:  yes, it looks like Minecraft.  Yes, it's similar, in regards to you are a guy that can craft and make things and uses the world around him for resources.  However, it is so much more than a clone.  It's very much like a really good immersive mod for Minecraft with elements of HQM (hardcore quest mode) which add the purpose to the gameplay.  So, if you enjoy all those cool Feed The Beast and ForgeCraft/Tekkit mods/reworks for MC, you'll really enjoy this game.Automate all the things.			"

The settings for survival make it so, that you really can play 10 hours and are just starting to play this game.You gather resources to get more resources, that is still true. But now you get so much info in game, you really don't need a wiki or forum for a long time.You get a super cool elevator, so you don't have to walk all the way up and down.Everything is simple to use but but you have to think about it how to use it best.The game is just pure fun.I was always looking for a Tekkit-Lite (MineCraft mod with technology) alternative. This might just be it.I love it, that the destroying of blocks is so easy, that the building is so easy, that you have no ""realistic"" ground where you always fight to get it nice looking. Here you work with cubes in MineCraft size, the difference is, everything is fast and looks good and there is so much to do.What I saw and what makes me wanne play a lot more but I  don't have the resources for it yet:- Defense turrets- Spiders- Threat scanner- Power storage- [...] (I have researched not much yet)And this is just the beginning. This game is now so good.If you like MineCraft-like games, then this is a must have.Really, this is not anymore a nice-to-have, this is a must have!------------------------------------------------------------ old -------------------------------------------------------------------old: version 1.80dMine to be able to mine moreFortressCraft Evolved is a nice game.I did for sure not see everything about it, but I tried survival, did many things the wrong way,got LOTS of help in the forum (1 troll, but lots of nice helpful guys) and had lots of fun and frustation.I have to say, the frustration came from me reading the guide, which is a kind of tutorial, wrongly.I was just to stupid to understand the guide correctly.Nevertheless, that WAS my experience and it WAS frustrating.You are in a cold environment and your armor can only keep you a living being if you give it energy.That is easy enough, because you have a starting base.Then you start to gather ores to smelt them into ingots to create thingies which help you to gather more ore.That is it, it seems, for now.In the internal version (like betas for other games, via Properties-beta) you can get a newer, perhaps less stable version of the game with more features and bug fixes and new bugs.Perhaps the game has a target, perhaps you can have lots of fun, but I did not come to that point.This is an alpha version.And it is currently already fun to play.Building is REALLY fun!The game is easy to play, you can have some fun.I really hope for it to get ""faster"" or just telling a new user like me better, why he should bother to gather more ores to be able to create machine which allow him to gather more ores.But currently it is just not enough to keep me playing.I will for sure start it from time to time, because it is even in the alpha state fun to play it a bit.But it is for me no 24/7 game. By far not.If you are bored with your current open world building, mining, crafting game, give this one a try.It is not yet very good, but already good enough to be fun for minecraft fans.			"

								This game is amazing! It has such a gigantic world for exploration, mining, design, automation, tower defence, and discovering a plot involving the mysterious crash of your shuttle onto this world. Will you be able to escape the planet? Will you be doomed to perish in the cold unforgiving wasteland? Or will you be killed by a nest of angry insects?I also play many other games of this genre, but this one in particular has many unique features and concepts on top of its own storyline. You will enjoy this game far more than the small purcahse price suggests.			"

												PROS-Has a good chain of progression, so you can't just build the best stuff right away.-There is always something to do, usually a long list of things.-If you like building complex logistic networks of machines, you'll like it. It's funner than it sounds.-Spiderbot is awesome, buggy, but awesome.-The ""Build to"" function is incredibly usefulCONS-If you don't like building complex logistic networks of machines, you'll probably hate it.-It locks up a lot and needs to be restarted.  This happens at least once an hour.-AI is really stupid.-Lots of clipping issues.-There is no pause, so if your base is under heavy attack and you need to go to the bathroom, you can't pause the game.  You have to exit the game completely.-Help file doesn't give you nearly enough information.-Inventory sort by type option makes no sense at all.  If I sort by TYPE, I would expect all of my ores to group together, all of my bug parts to group together, all of my machines to group together, but it just seems like the sorting is very random.-The organization of the crafting menu is very odd. It desperately needs a search feature.-As you progress, the game gets buggier and buggier until large chunks of the level just won't load at all no matter how long you wait.  At this point the game becomes unplayable, which is really frustrating since I was getting close to beating the game.OVERALL IMPRESSION-Overall I really enjoy the game, however I wouldn't recommend buying it until the bugs are fixed.REQUESTS-I would like to see hostile monsters in the underground caverns to make exploration more exciting.-Lower the volume of the power storage cubes by at least 50%. That constant hum gets annoying after a while.-Make the smaller enemies attack you if you get near them.-Make it so you can delete the ship wreckage, maybe with the level 2 build gun.			"

												This game isn't for everyone, that's a fact. The game is mostly about resource gathering, processing said resources and the infrastructure between. The game is slowpaced, it WILL take time before you have everything set up as you like it and even then you are very likely to rebuild it later as you figure out better ways to do things. It will require quite a bit of thinking ahead and possibly a few world restarts once you reach a point in your current world where rebuilding everything is just too much of a hassle. Each restart will be much easier than the last though as you learn more tricks. What took you 2 hours before, may now take 30 min and when you have played for quite a while not even that long. The time it takes to do stuff is usually down to player skill, be patient and you will get a lot from it.If you do decide to stick around for the first 10 hours, you are very likely to play at least a 100, and that is without the DLC Frozen Factory (have a look at the positive reviews, most have well over a hundred hours play and still haven't run out of content). For 13 euros this game is definitly a bargain.A common complaint about this game is that it feels like Early Access with all the updates. Do note that the game has had a working end goal for well over a year and hence can be considered complete. The larger part of each update is also available for free, no paywall here unless you've already spent said 100 hours and want at least 50 more. There are a few bugs, but hey, you just spent a dinner for two and the bugs will disappear at the end of the month.And lastly as I said this game may turn you off quite quickly, please have a look at lets plays before you consider buying and if you do, you won't regret it.

Posted: March 27, 2016
												Wow, where to begin with this game. Let me first start with my opinion. I love this game. However, I can not recomend it as of yet. I spent 24 hours fo game time as of the time I've written this, and I still don't really have a clue what's going on. It's advertised as a tower defense mincraft clone, but I've never played minecraft, so I'm not really sure if it is. I really like the idea of having to dig to find minerals, the blocks you can remove, the things you can research, but I don't like having to search outside the game or go through a million other steps to get a general idea of what I should be doing.Let's start off with the 10 second tutorial. It sucks so bad, after the first time I booted the game up and watched the unskippable (in this day and age, really?!) opening scene, I had no real idea of what to do or how. Sure, there is a help menu that gradually fills up with more information as you need it, but isn't the point of the tutorial to teach you what you need to know? There's no real explination of day or night, no real explination of what you can craft, and nothing tells you what you're research unlocks until you've already researched it.Now the community is great, and all the answers can be found someplace, but to me, that takes time away from the game. It's advertised as a tower defense, but it's more like a base defense, eventually. I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty, but this game needs a ton of polish before I can actually recommend it to anyone. The learning curve is HUGE in this game, and I'm still finding things out the more I play, but if that's your thing, feel free.Update: With the new patch that came out, I truly do love this game more. I still can't recommend it though until it does some serious polishing. No game ever should keep basic things away from the player, and that level of transparency is exactly what this games lacks. It's also unbelievably slow. I've been playing for days and there are still things that are hidden from me and I have no idea what they do until I actually spend the 5-6 hours unlocking it. As a player, it's truly the only reason I keep this game thumbs down.			"

								It's a good game for the price. It scratches the itch of a building game.However, it has a lot of bugs a glitches, has no tutorial at all, and most of the features that make it really cool are difficult to figure out and find. It's almost as if they don't want you to know how to do some things.I don't understand how it has been in development for so long and yet seems to be worse than the xbox version.I know most people will say ""it's not finished"" but I purchased it on xbox years ago and it's not any better now so I think it's safe to say this is all you're getting. It's not a whole lot, it's confusing and buggy, but still a good building game for the price.			"

												Highly polished for a work in progress game, I have been throughly enjoying it so far. Every step I take in the world, I just want to learn more about it. Mostly how to make my factory actually turn into a factory... but thats most of the fun in this kind of game for me. Unlike Minecraft (and most other voxel games), which plops you in a forest and says ""Have fun surviving day one"" Fortresscraft has a short, ""Rember how to punch the tree"" tutorial that helped me get used to the control scheme. Also unlike minecraft, it has more of a longterm goal list then ""Punch tree, make bed, find diamond, now what?""As you decend into the planet you also face progressivly tougher chalanges, from both the alians and the enviroment itself.  it forces you to think out every action.Overall, it could use a little bit more work, but what would you expect from somthing labled ""Work in progress"" Can't wait to see the next update.

If you can explore a whole map then you are not human.Survival mode is a challenge.When you get into this game you run the risk of addiction. Cave after cave call to you to just take a quick look, only to find another cave, another look. You will have to build up your equipment so you can travel further, deeper, longer To find more and more of value to support your growing need to expand and upgrade.I highly recommend this game!Edit:A year later and the game has only gotten bigger and even more involved. The developer is very active. Live streams on Youtube as the developer works on the game with input/participation by the users. This game just gets better and better. You couldn't spend a better $12.99 on a game.			"

								After 150+ hours I think I can say : this is a great game! I am a veteran of Minecraft, FTB, MITE and various other custom maps and challenges particularly in survival mode. FCE is similar, but different, to all of these and is centered around your base. You get most of the tools you need from the beginning, and from there it is up to you to build your base around the ore you find, and to automate it. Automation is really cool - you can do things the hard way, yourself, or build a conveyer belt and laser power and it does it all for you! You can just stand there and watch it go, and I often do! After a while you will have to deal with mobs too, so base defences come into play. There is a tech-tree for you to discover which unlocks a lot more of the game, and the ""limits"" are not what you are used to - there is no bedrock, you can just keep going and going. Super-dig and build-to-me features are ""wow"" as is the x-ray vision mode, grappling hook and jetpack.You might think that after all those hours I have done everything there is to do in this game. Well, I have played out a few worlds but no, I still have plenty of things I want to try.Even though there is Witcher III and Fallout 4 (coming), I'm already calling this my ""game of the year"". Stick with it and you will find it great fun. Sure, it is still in ""early access"" but this is already better than a lot of fully released games. What are you waiting for? get it now!ps. I am in no way affiliated with the devs, I am purely a player.			"

A little rough around the edges due to being an indie game, but great value for the price. Highly addictive gameplay.A lot of the negative feedback seems to be due to the fact that the developer is actively engaged with the community on the forums but doesn't have a fawning corporate customer service attitude. He is forthright and will contridict people without hesitation, which seems to hurt a lot of feelings.Bottom line: the game itself is good and the dev is still actively supporting it.			"

												I highly recommend this game because it has so much going on and does everything well. You are given just want you need at each stage of the game to work on building up your base toward the next tier of tech. And then on to the next tier. And so on. Each tier brings more fun things to build, optimize, automate, and improve.The game world is huge and you dig deeper and deeper as your need for more precisous materials grows. The art style is fantastic and many of the machines are wonderfully animated. This game definitely looks amazing and has equally amazing mechanics in how each machine interacts with the others.The learning curve for the mechanics can be a bit steep but once you get the hang of it you'll spend hours building and changing things and still have more things to do! Defintely many many hours of fun to be had.For single player I'd give it 9/10 and for multiplayer I'd give it 8/10.			"

												Thought I would finally write a review.  The game is awesome, but if you are looking for a quick experience where you can play for 15 minutes and get some good loot this is not the game for you.  The game can be boring for the first few hours as you get your base set up and start getting resources in. So if you are writing a bad review with less than 2 hours in the game because you wanted to make sure you could get a refund within steams limit you are missing out.  Sure the game is not polished yet but content and updates are constatntly being added.  I had my doubts when I first started as well and it took me more than .4 - 2 hours to get hooked but as you can see with my time spent in game I have gotten my moneys worth.			"

												One of the most epic games I've ever played. FortressCraft sets the standard. For the price tag it is a steal given how much content it has. This game deserves a much higher review rating. Constantly updating and coming up with more content. We are talking huge updates, not sissy fake updates where you don't notice anything.This game has spoiled me and now I don't even enjoy the other more simple games (which is all of them except Factorio). Steam really needs a new genre/tag for this special type of game. ""Logistics"" or ""automation"" is what I recommend. Do not get this game if you have any loved ones. They will not see you for weeks.			"

												The game is great, runs smoothly and is updated regularly.It's a cross between minecraft, factorio and a tower defence. You will spend tens of hours exploring the world to find ore to mine and creating all the infrastructure to bring it back to your base and process it into usefull stuff.Pro:- hundred of hours of gameplay- good variety of transport system (for the materials, not you) with good set of rules allowing you to make complex automated production line- multiplayer works fine and if you have a few friends who like this type of game a dedicated server is a blast.- the developpers are very present on the discussion page of steam and the comunity is very welcoming.Con:- the tutorial is very basic and can leave many player confused on how the game works but after a few hours it will all make sense ( press ""h"" for the help menu and look for the starting guide for all the commands)- some bugs but not often and nothing gamebreaking, usually restarting the game fixes everything.

Early Access Review
								Loving singleplayer survival aspects of the game, great concepts, great gameplay. Multiplayer with friends with decent internet is totally fine (even though it may take maybe 0.3 seconds to get a player position update) but nothing too extreme, you can still tell where people are and what they're up to. Just need a bunch of people that actually want to spend time building a base\factory thing :(Never really did much with creative, so i cant comment on that...Multiplayer's backend could do with some work... I mean, it works fine but not with people with absurdly bad net. I'm not really sure what can be done though, not even the RightShift + F3 option works for him, which sets the update packets extremely low. Im sure this is just a problem with his net, but other games with procedural gen work alright...			"

												Slow, tedious, not worth your time.Does the idea of taking 6+ hours to achive even basic automation which you could accomplish in Factorio or modded Minecraft in under 30 minutes appeal to you? How about 2 hours to be able to safely explore away from your base for more than 5 minutes at a time? And that's in what this game calls easy mode - ""Casual"" mode it literally say is for people with jobs and families. (Who is the target audience, then?)Every upgrade and machine will cost more resources than it should, and perform below expectations. The game's basic generator can only function in the shallowest biomes (not enough oxygen deeper apparently), and even then it will decline to near 0% efficiency before you reach the next layer. Said layer will freeze you to death in under a minute until you build a suit upgrade... using ore from the layer below it. Everything about the gameplay feels like it's punishing the player.Apart from the mindbogglingly slow gameplay: The graphics are generally unappealing - it tries 'realistic' textures which don't look good in voxel games in my opinion, but I will acknowledge that's subjective. The surface is ugly as sin - you will never go exploring looking for a pretty place to build an outpost, because none exist. The 3d models are passable for an indie game. Animation is barebones.The sound design is decent, the effects get the job done, some of the (brief and intermittent) background music is nice.I didn't notice any bugs whatsoever, so good job on that.Much of the flavor text in item descriptions includes the author's attempts at forced humor, which I found grating.I actively played this game for about 15 hours, with several more afk idling while waiting for automation to process materials. I did my best to give this game a chance, I kept waiting for it to become fun, and it just never did.If you're one of those GregTech-type masochists out there, you might enjoy this. (I don't understand that either, but to each their own.) Anyone else, avoid.			"

Early Access Review
								No.Just no.- Devs (I think there's only one dev - Adam Sawkins) are making FortressCraft since approx 2 years. We can see that on their Youtube channel, FC videos are 2 years old or more. After this long time FortressCraft is still in early access with lack of most interesting features. I'm wondering why this game development is so slow when the original FortressCraft was sold and earned milions $... Or maybe they lied about FortressCraft success?- Game is still in early pre-alpha version where we have ONE world that looks similar every time we want to create it again, why to the♥♥♥♥♥♥there's always snowy biome?! Every new game starts in the same way, the same world, the same origin.- Lack of block, there are maybe 40 blocks in whole game- The original FortressCraft was one of the best-selling Indie games of all time. Maybe it was... but this one will be dead soon, only 300 reviews in one year. 100 of them are negative. People are not intrested in making ripoff of ripoff again.- Unique survival mode based on... well... nothing, because there's nothing hard to do. You as player, you are not forced to defend yourself using weapons, walls, shields, cannons or something. Game isn't challenging. The main difference between survival and creative is simple - there's no flying mode and you have to craft stuff. That's all.- You can achieve all avaible stuff in this game in just one day- There's nothing much to do, devs should play Factorio for some days and look how factory-based game should work- There's no in game tutorial which could teach new players how to play this game, there's just some info what cartain block is doing, without example.

								What a game it works well but... it is a very complex and unfinished game. now don't get me wrong most of the gameplay is done, but there are a few bugs and most of the documentation needs to get done. and trust me, the documentation is always the last thing you tend to do. it can change and become outdated rather fast, so why would you write something about how something works oneday then change it the next?needless to say the game is fun and adicting. it is right up my ally and i really wish this was a total conversion mod for minecraft... but it is not, and i don't really care.for the most part the temerature mechanic is broken. it is not very realistic, and i can't see temps going from 100 degrees celcious to -5. granted it is not unlikely, as a fire in the dead of winter kinda works that way, but you can still feel the heat from a few feet way. then with enclosed spaces, especially underground that heat retains and continues. so if you have a heat source you undergound it should heat better than out in the open, i don't see this happening. it seems that the code does not diferenciate between materials and how enclosed something is. i built a building heated it, and the differance of temperatures was not really that great from when it was not enclosed. then there are the graphics issues. i want less bloomnow i may sound like i am ratting on it, but i really do like the game, I recommend you give it a try especially is you play minecrat the way i do, with the goal of automatinge EVERYTHING.

												Let's start by saying that this game is still being heavily developed despite being out of early access.   Some of the newer stuff doesn't have icons but besides that the game is basically 100% completable in what constitutes a pretty decent end-game that can take 50-100+ hours to get to, with additional difficulty settings for pretty good replayability.The game does a good job of combining a minecraft style sandbox with tower defense.  It takes some of the slow and annoying parts of minecraft and removes it and gives the player a lot of tools to assist them with common tasks such as building.  building 50 blocks in a straight line in survival mode is very convienent, not to mention no wait on breaking a block and protection mode from breaking multiblocks.  The grappling hook is quite fun to use and makes grappling up a verticle mining tunnel a lot of fun.  On my 4 year old computer the game runs smoothly even with a lot of stuff going on.  Overall when buying this game remember some developers wait until they have everything that they can possibly do to the game done with before exiting early access, this allows them to make excuses for whatever bugs are in the game.  This developer has done a great job at leaving early access and releasing a very stable main build along with a constantly updated bleeding edge build.  The game might not be as complete as some other games that have exited early access, but it is stable, there is a lot of fun things to do, and my biggest complaint about the game is that $12 is just way too cheap.  I would of gladly paid $20-$30 for it possibly $40			"

												FortressCraft is an interesting concept, and I do enjoy solving the logistical puzzles the game creates, even the spelunking and tunneling was enjoyable in its own way, with the grappling hook adding a lot to the experience. I know base building is a niche sort of genre, but it's my niche and I enjoy it.Unfortunately, the negatives of the game heavily outweigh the positives. DEVELOPMENT: FortressCraft is incredibly graphically buggy, to the point that the engine itself seems broken. Lights and phantom outlines of things flash all over the screen, sometimes at random, sometimes continuously throughout the whole gameplay experience, and they do so with such glare and rapidity, that it will eventually give you a headache. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE EPILEPTIC. SERIOUSLY. Whole sections of the map will often fail to load as you travel along it, leaving huge holes in the world that, while you do not fall through them, still impede progress because you cannot see the terrain you are walking on. (Also, if you build a block on top of yourself using a low ceiling, you can see through all of the walls.) Speaking of not loading, the most frustrating load failure comes from the overminds and the sandworms, which both kill you instantly and without warning if you come anywhere near them. I like playing most sandbox games on ironmode so there are consequences to my actions. It adds a sense of danger and suspense to the gameplay. But being randomly and instantly killed by a hazard that cannot be seen or anticipated is not shocking or suspenseful. It just sucks. Finally, if you play above simple graphics, even on a well built gaming rig, the game will gradually slow down over the course of an hour or so to the point where you will have to exit and re-enter to reasonably play it without killing yourself during a lag altered grappler jump. The game invariably freezes and then crashes out when you choose to exit, and triggers a windows forced shutdown box during archiving, every single time. It's a mess.GAME DESIGN: There are some great things here. The alien world, when it isn't bugging out and searing your retinas, feels very much like a dangerous, foreign environment. Random noises will occassionally cause you to twitch spin, but it is just creepy enough to get the blood flowing without crossing over into a darker genre. The sheer number of machine parts you are provided is fantastic. There are many, many different ways to go about building your supply lines and machines, and a decent number of hazards you have to find ways to work around. Also, the smart help menu, is a feature that should exist in literally every game of this genre. That kind of genius deserves a patent.However, the other aspects of the game are not as well fleshed out as the supply line/base building elements.The task of defending your base from attackers and eventually returning fire on the overmind gives a sense of purpose to the hours and hours of logistical puzzle solving and resource grinding, until you realize that the enemy never changes. It's a bunch of wasps that fly in a straight line and only shoot at the generator in your base. That's it. They don't shoot at you, they don't hit your defenses or the supply lines for your defenses. They fly in a straight line to the base, and shoot at the generator. In any setting except for the very highest difficulty, the cost for losing to their attack is roughly 30 seconds without power from that particular generator. Any machine not tied directly to the central generator experiences no consequence whatsoever, so there is basically zero consequence to losing to the attacking swarm and as a result, very little reason to defend against it. If you venture farther into the game, the wasps will eventually become larger wasps with more hp, but they'll still do exactly the same thing the smaller wasps do.Defending the base basically comes down to buying the same cannons, but with varying color and cost, and placing them along the straight line the wasps always travel on the way to your base. The primary tactical challenge to defense is figuring out how to keep the batteries charged on the cannons throughout the zerg wave. So much more could have been done with this aspect of the game in order to reach a much, much wider audience. As it stands, this is mostly a game about building machines that allow you to grind enough materials to build slightly more complex, and exponentially more expensive machines, for hours and hours, until you can build a really big and really expensive machine that ends the game.Unless, of course, you get insta-killed by an invisible pop-up sandworm that ignores your health and shields. Or walk up a hill and suddenly insta-die, because there is an unloaded, invisible overmind sitting on it. Or plummet to yet another insta-death in a mining shaft without any warning, because your grappler gun doesn't work properly at a certain depth underground.I respect and admire the effort that DJ and his team have put into the game, and I'm impressed by his responsiveness to fans of the game online, but the broken graphics and the lack of so many of the most important basic elements of game design (for the love of god, take out the warningless insta-death mechanics!) make it impossible to recommend this game.Sorry guys, it could have been great.

The Devs keep well on top of this game as well and there is no doubt they are serious about crafting a work of intricate design. The biggest draw right now, as an early access title, is the machinery. It is one of the focal points of the game and you can craft a variety of machines to do much of the mining, crafting and distribution of materials so you can research, mine and craft even more powerful machinery that takes increasing power to run meaning you will need to upgrade your power network to keep up with the demand of an ever growing base of machines. I like machines.There are still issues with the U.I. and there are gameplay mechanics not yet implimented but the Devs are attentive to their community and listen to suggestions. This is one early access title thats gonna go the distance.  "

The game keeps you busy as there is always something to do but even when things start getting automated you still find yourself running around like a loon on the next project.I love building up my automation really slowly and planning thing out, this game allows you to do that.. even tho I am a real life automation engineer :DPlayed a good 20hrs atm and have no regrets about spending that time with this game... loving it!

												A highly polished work in progress game that has consumed many enjoyable hours of my free time. Whilst this game may be sort of like minecraft, it has many defineing differences. Namely the ability to build factories to automate you resource gathering. Also turrets to defend your base and factories from varying types of enemies which as time progresses will be added open. As for the game itself can at times have a bit of a learning curve and be slow in progression at times, but once you figure stuff out it can be quite fun. They community is always happy to help to when you have any issues you need help with. There is also a goal to work towards in the end game instead of just hey I found diamonds in minecraft and built the strongest armour. Now what? In the future many more end game goals are planned to be added in and even building of space ships and space station is on the table as one of the possible future additions. The developers are very active too, provideing updates to the game at roughly every to the bleeding edge  branch 1.8 days - 1 week and and activly read their discussions on a day to day bases. All things said I look forward to many fun updates and hours of play from this game.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR - If you want a finished, bug-free game don't buy it, if you like Minecraft-style games and don't mind waiting for new content and patches buy it. Frustrating at first, but already the developers have made it much better.I've never played Minecraft but have always wanted to, but when I went to their website and would have had to sign up for an account before I could even see how much the stupid game cost, I became annoyed. I read on another site it was $30 (which I'm not sure is true or not, regardless I became more annoyed). Lo and behold, that same day on the front page of Steam I see FortressCraft for $4. Needless to say I got it.The first hour was an incredibly frustrating experience because I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and the help menu wasn't helpful at all. Thankfully they have made it much more in-depth, so new users shouldn't have nearly as much trouble as I did. I read a guide and got into it, having quite a bit more fun even though finding ore was tough at first (they have also made this easier, using one key and scrolling to find the ping you want, whereas before there was a key combination for each ping type).Now that I'm getting my base set up and things automated, I'm having a lot of fun! It's always cool to see your progress so clearly.There are some bugs which is to be expected since it's an early-access game. Most annoying is that the x64 executable likes to go missing, so I've been playing with x32. There are infrequent crashes, and if you quit when anything is in your smelter the items get lost. Not a bug but slightly annoying when I first started playing: menus that don't completely work. Now that I know the features haven't been implemented it's fine, but before I was clicking and totally confused as to why nothing was happening.The roadmap the developers have is great, and they seem to be very active here on Steam. Nice to know they're listening! Things I would like to see added are some ideas or guides for power plants and things like that, more detailed graphics (though I'm fine playing with the current ones), and maybe trees that regrow themselves. That would be cool. Seeds and stuff would be neat too.Anyways, it's a great game and awesome for the price and all the stuff they have planned.			"

Early Access Review
								(This is a long description, skip to the pros and cons below if you don't want to spend much time on my review)My initial impression of the game wasn't great, which was largely thanks to the greatest difference between stable and beta branches in a game I've ever seen.   Once I opted into the beta, and selected some easier difficulty options, I found a game that was somewhat similar to some of the tech mods for minecraft, but with far more depth and coherence.   But this game, unlike minecraft, or most other mining games for that matter, requires you to build infrastructure that mines and processes for you, rather than you mining yourself.   The early mining process requires you to locate a sutible ore vein, plop down a ore extracter on it, stick a storage hopper on it, and dump a bunch of power into it, and leave it for about 10 minuites before coming back, recharging it, and taking the ore to refine.However, every step of that process is automatable, from the very start of the game.   Progression gives you faster, more efficient ways to mine, and automate the mining devices, while encouraging you to dig deeper to get access to more valuable ores, to research and build more advanced and effective machines.Pros-Advancing tech keeps you building and modifying structures-Tower defense aspect adds mid and end game goals-Scanning and visual tools lets you quickly plan out the most efficent way to set up and debug structures-All the information needed to progress can be found in game, no immersion breaking forum trips needed-Large difficulty range-Multiplayer (Still buggy, will likely be improving with time)-EXPLOSIVES that you can make as powerful as you have power for (maybe not so great in multiplayer)Cons-Not much in the way of a wiki to look up information for optimizing setups, particularly base defense-Single threaded- hard to run unless your computer has relatively good single thread performance (I have an AMD 3.7 GHz processor, and I have to run it on a lower graphics setting to avoid framerate drops)-Mob difficulty tends to get grouped- if you want things to fight back, you also have to deal with ore eating mobs that spawn on your conveyers.-Falling too fast kills you, makes it somewhat hard to go down mineshafts, you have to spend a fair amount of time building and navigating stairwells or platforms-Some dead spots while waiting for materials to be mined or refined			"

												After finally charging the OET, I feel like I can write a bit about FCE. I nearly gave it a thumbs down, but I think, overall, it deserves a recommendation. Most say it's a combination of Factorio and Minecraft, but it largely reminds me of Power Towers, a TD custom map that involved defending your base with towers that needed to be routed power from power generators. I enjoyed the grand majority of my [thus-far] 150 hours in FCE, despite ignoring the missions most of the time and playing my own [undoubtedly slower] style. Even not on sale, it's easy to get your money's worth out of FCE, with plenty to see and do. If you don't like busywork, there's plenty of tools for automation to build a base limited only by your imagination [and PC specs]. My biggest complaint is lack of polish, including user customization; for example, the music is ofttimes just whistling tones, just begging to be turned down or off [there's no setting in the options to adjust only the music volume, nor a setting to disable music all of the time - it must be switched off every time you play] - just little things like this that drive home that this is an indie game that needs some more love around the edges. Dev seems to listen to the community and continues to add content [even as DLC - which costs more than the base game?!? - it's an excellent value]. In-Game handbook and wiki seem to be incomplete/out of date, but I think there's some focus on improving this coming up [why the official wiki doesn't have info built directly from in-game data beats me]. I only ever played single player, so no comments on MP.+Gameplay+Style+Fun factor+Value-Lack of polish and easy-to-find answers-Occasional community hostilityOverall: 8.5/10tl;dr: If you like base management, defense, mining, and don't mind indie quirkiness, there's no reason to not check out FCE. You could watch for a sale price, but it's well worth the everyday price.			"

								Caution:  You may forget you own other games!     I have 6 other new games (some big titles) that I bought right before seeing this one on sale.  That was a few weeks ago and I haven't even installed them.  In this game, there is always something else to explore, some cavern to go splunking in, or that next attack you need to prepare your base for.  My favorite part is the fact that this is a giant open world puzzle game that takes constant tweaking to optimize your setup.  There are some unpolished areas and annoyances but the developers are responsive and put out an impressive amount of work for the small team they have.  I can't wait to see what the next patches bring.  This game is well work the price and I have not regretted buying it.  I can't wait to see where the future takes it.			"

								Great game if you enjoy automation and factory building!  The game focuses on pulling resources out of the ground, and automating the process.  There is also a fun base defence aspect where the threat increases depending on how big your operation is.  The game allows and encourages you to really scale things up to a massive operation with tons of defences.This is completely different game then Minecraft, but it is very similar to Minecraft with industrial and automation mods.  The key difference for me  is that it's much more cohesive and balanced then slapping tons of mods on to Minecraft.			"

First it has many machines, power which powers these machines, and the world is really deep. I think there is no limit as I haven't reached the bottom yet. Additionaly you can automate things like mining, and much more. Overall if you like minecraft and other games like it, you will proboly like this game as well.			"

								Wow. Just... Wow.Where to start? This is a really well thought out, high quality game that encourages players to take advantage of its in-depth building system to achieve levels of creativity not found in other craft games. Mixing exploration with creativity, the game world modes cater for just about any gamer. Survival mode is possibly the most interesting, feeling fresh and challenging to just about any gamer. Survival mode gives a subtle drive to the creative player, besides creating visually stunning environments.Other modes offer a more relaxed experience, with vareity to suit the player. All modes are customizable in terms of difficulty and resources, in order to create the most suitable game world for the player.Though in terms of fun, multiplayer is where it's at. Co-op mode is a blast and working alongside your buddies to create and delve is great. Visually the game blows most other craft games out of the water. The textures have a hand made, consistent quality not often seen in games today, and compliment the models considerably. The sheer level of effort put into the visuals is very noticable, and the torch light in underground areas is pretty cool, gives a real sense of exploration.The sound effects are great and the music is decent, complimenting gameplay. Listening to the ambient wintery wind howl as you dig and search for resources in survival mode is pretty awesome. Gives a real sense of being in the game.Best thing though? The deep building system. You can do all kinds of cool stuff like powering generators with coal or materials for equipment energy, check out objects to find their hidden secrets with your laser scanner, craft new gear with materials you find along the way. It has to be seen to be believed really.Sadly the game has had some slating in the past owing to early beta releases, though in comparison the game has gone leaps and bounds miles away from what it came from (and I hope past reviewers amend their posts.) and exceeded my expectations.Overall, the game is a great choice for craft game fans and players who want to dip their feet into the world of creative games. Highly recommended. 10/10 "

												Disclaimer: A key was given to us by the developers to review the game.Hello everybody, Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) here to bring you a short overview of our review for FortressCraft Evolved. If you'd like to read our full, in-depth review, you can find it here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/fortresscraft-evolved-overview-and-review/I've been watching FortressCraft Evolved evolve over the course of its development ever since we first previewed the game quite a long time ago and it's become an incredibly impressive and fun survival based game.I'm normally the type of person to avoid survival based games in truth but out of the many that we've previewed so far FortressCraft remains one of my favorites, with it's incrediblly massive world to explore, tons of craftable equipment and excellent gameplay, it's a joy to play.I will also say that the game requires an immense amount of time and patience to really get anywhere and since I lack the patience to create vast mining cities I found myself a bit bored after a while. This doesn't mean the game is bad however, it's just that I can't play a game for that long haha.Definitely a recommended title though and I enjoyed following its development from a relatively small Early Access title to what it has become now. Still much more to come I imagine, 8.6/10.			"

								First off I say to the developers drop multy play and finish survival and other stuff first. Survival is NOT finished.The game is cool,I do like building and mining. Survival is fine but there really is no point in building defences there is no monsters no danger like in survival Minecraft.The constant fear of freezing to death is very annoying,make sure to bring lots of torches if you want to explore and mine,everyone says upgrade your suit but its kinda hard when ya have to find the minerals to build the stuff to upgrade your suit. Most of the minerals are very hard to find except for the basic ores or if you do find them you don't get much of them,so its hard to upgrade your suit when the ores ya need are hard to find.The graphics are nice.Over all the game is cool but its still in early development hopefully they fix things.I reccomend this game but don't expect it to be a clone of Mincraft,feels unfinished.

There is no Teir 4 or 5 ore useage in the base game which is a complete let down.I will not be supporting this game development further.			"

												If you enjoyed Minecraft or similar games, you will feel right at home here.  FortressCraft adds a lot of machine building, automation, factory design, and ""tower defense"" elements.My only complaint so far is that most of the game is underground (all the mining and exploring).  However, you have to build most of your power and automation on the surface.  This basically means you'll spend a lot of time figuring out ways to ship ore to the surface.   Not a bad thing really just got a little annoying after a while for me.			"

If you read the negative reviews you will find they are ALL either because their computer sucks or they want the game to give them everything easy, how sad is that.  If they say save your money and just buy factorio they are insane, yes some aspects are very much like factorio but the games are totally different. The major one being this game is first person and Factorio is not. Saying that your electricity goes out all the time and that causes your computer to crash and then give the game a negative review is just stupid. Bottom line. BUY THE GAME, ITS AMAZING.			"

								Over all the game is taxing, the learning curve makes it fun. The scanning and progression system give it a unique feel to it, helping it stand out. It isn't trying to become a minecraft clone either which is refreshing. While they may share some qualities and similarities. The two are vastly different and a good modding community would also push this game further than most. Now they have come a long ways within the short time I have been playing the game, and polished it quite nicely. As for mutliplayer I cannot say much as my usual internet is total♥♥♥♥♥♥ making hosting a server or playing with friends difficult at times. But for the price and the fact the game can come in a two pack. It is well worth getting a look, and I cannot wait to see where it will end up next.			"

								This game is great!  They give you a little survival guide that helps you figure out how to survive initially.  Without that there's no way I would've made it.  It's like minecraft with reasonable graphics and a fun space theme.  The worlds are huge, it's easy to get lost and fall down to somewhere far below your base, but that's what the grappling hooks for!I don't have too many hours into it yet, but so far I haven't seen many bugs.  Occasionally the blocks go transparent if you're standing too close, and the pause menu doesn't seem to actually pause anything.  If you're going to walk away from it for a while, make sure you quit to desktop.  That'll save your world and you won't come back to the game to find you've died and reloaded to a terrible place you were lost at two hours ago.  Can't wait til it's finished, but for a $5 alpha FC can't be beat!			"

												Don't play this game if you intend to keep a personal life. It will eat your time and devour your soul. You will start dreaming about conveyors and power distribution grids. In a game where you will automate almost everything, you will start thinking what else could you automate next.It's a 1-man-team game so bear that in mind if you buy it and want to complain. Even at the full price, it's a bargain as the time spent/cost ratio is going to skyrocket. It is constantly under development with a major patch coming out each month and a testing branch to test out the newest feature before they're implemented in the main game (experimental so back up your worlds).Active forums with lots of experienced people who will help you out, no matter your problem.So stop wasting your time irl and waste it in this masterpiece of a logistics game.

								FortressCraft Evolved is not about building your house on an infinite voxel terrain but organising the vertical transportation of ores and power to develop your base. Luckily resources are plentiful as you'll need hundreds of thousands of ingots to accomplish your mission.As of version 1.19 FortressCraft Evolved is a fully-fledged logistic nightmare which will fulfill the most demanding OCD sufferer. You will find a mix of sandbox, management, research, tower defence and a little survival.ProjectorGames has been in overdrive for the last months to push the game out of Early Access, and as such you shouldn't take into account comments written before version 1.18. So many things have been added, among which a tiered research, mobs, a tutorial, and an easy mode to accelerate the otherwise challenging and lengthy beginning.If you like building long assembly lines and accumulate resources to build even more assembly lines, do yourself a favour and buy it.

Early Access Review
								I bought this game because I loved Minecraft with the Buildcraft/Industrialcraft mods. Research and automation are the core progression of this game. As this game is in early access, it does need some polishing and bug squashing.So far (15hrs), I've found 2 bugs: A minor issue where I had to re-open a UI (such as an inventory screen) to get my cursor to work instead of mouse-look, and an issue in multiplayer where other players could not see my placed blocks. The multiplayer issue was annoying, but the devs are actively working on addessing multiplayer bugs in newer builds.FortressCraft appears to be built on Mono, instead of the resource heavy Java that Minecraft used. This means it runs in 64-bit, can be multiplatform, and runs very, very smoothly. "

												Basically Minecraft with techmods without all the weirdness that comes from Minecraft with techmods (pickaxe into nuclear reactor, what?).It is very addicting to automate everything, but this is not all. This game has also tower defense elements, as you have to protect your base and certain buildings from regular waves of enemies with turrets and proper logistics, to keep them working.Sadly the game also has some drawbacks. Especially the depth of the map is annoying. Just getting from T1 to T2 ores needs you to dig hundreds of blocks down which also means you then have to create ways to transport energy down, ressources up and a way for yourself to get fast up and down. And this game has actually four tiers. There are ways to make this easier, but those arrive quite late (e. g. a quarry that digs a 3x3 shaft down so you can immediately use a elevator).Also the tech tree is quite weird at times. For example, it takes hours till you are able to use mincarts and when you have them, you simply don't need them anymore.The game has also some technical issues. The UI is ugly as hell (and feels like it is done for a tiny resolution) and the draw distance is quite low. Also items on conveors are invisible regulary.Other than that it is a fine game if you like fiddling around with machines and automation. It is better than Minecraft with mods in that area.			"

												WARNING...This game is so addictive you won't be able to stop....seriously....For a guy who owns 100+ games on steam with over 10,000 hrs of gameplay I am pleased to announce that this is probably one of the best survival games I have ever played.....This game doesn't allow you to travel to other planets like Empyrion, it doesnt allow you to travel to the nether like minecraft and it doesnt have mobs chasing you the whole time..... This game is an INDUSTRIAL oriented game, being an engineer makes it even more fun as I plan my production plan for a certain resource. You have questions like how many extractors I need?, how many conveyer belts per resource? should I create a line of robot arms to selectively pick my ores or should I seperate the belts? What  will my production be with one smelter....how about two...how about a hundred? What would the energy requirement be? Can I fullfill it or should I tech up?....and the list just goes on....Bottom line this game is huge, with thousands of mega projects that you can endorse that can keep you entertained for hundreds of hours.......(note: I just reset my account and I play offline quite often).This game is a must buy for anyone who loves survival games or even if you want to try one....this game is the way to go.For all the guys who write hateful reviews, just ♥♥♥♥ off you minecraft lovers.......This game is for big boys.11/10 Would repel a 100+ Wasp invasion with Arthur.

								I love this game so much! Sure it has some bugs and glitches but it is barely done! I want to go over the glitches and bugs before I get to the best parts first just in case someone wants to find out what the issues may be in the game. The glitches are quite bad sometimes and can seriously affect the gameplay, the glitches come at random moments, usually when you least expect it. We have the problem with not being in control any more, this happens a lot, it causes your player to just fly up into the sky when you press space bar, this can also make it impossible to float back down and usually I just turn the game off after that. We also have the copy and paste option, sometimes it leaves blue and green lights stuck on your walls, sometimes the wall has holes in it where the copy and paste didn't work properly. You've even got a glitch that makes you walk around when you don't want to and you have to just move to a block and wait until the player stops moving, then slowly tap on the 'W' key to make sure he/she doesn't do it again. There is also even on fastest graphics mode it can have a huge drop in frame rates quite rapidly. Don't let this scare you from buying this game.I think this game is a must have due to its great potential, there aren't a lot of blocks but they are still developing the game and once it is done I am hoping it will have a larger collection of different blocks and materials. It's also a really big world and plenty of worlds for you to make, the copy and paste functions is pure genius and will definantly help to build huge structures! The little robot that follows you is helpful to show what block you currently have and for some reason it looks kind of cute. I'm very serious when I say this game has huge potential! I hope that more people buy this game so they can get more money to develop it better and faster! If you're looking for a game of fun and adventure then this game is for you! If you don't mind the bugs and just get on with it then this is extremely fun, this is my own opinion though so don't take it all to heart. But if anyone wants to join me when they have finished constructing the multiplayer then please feel free to add me. I hope this game gets the recognition it deserves! I remember first playing it on the xbox and it was a really good experience, I felt like I was playing something so different to games like MineCraft and it was a new adventure for me and that is why this game brings back that good feeling of change in the sandbox gaming category.

Early Access Review
								FortressCraft Evolved as its name implies is the evolution of the original installment FortressCraft that appeared on XBLIG in April 2011.  Taking advantage of the power of a modern PC with several times more RAM and processing power compared to that of the aging console, FC:E offers a more expansive world than ever before.The game builds upon its success from the console version by offering the best creative tools available in any vox game including:Superbuild - An interface to quickly build geometric structures of thousands of blocks to save time for the detail workPaint gun - Paint select blocks using nearly any color you could dreamDetail blocks - the micro blocks of the XBLIG version have returned with even more flexibility.  Choose from 2x2 - 8x8 blocks in your detail block design to add a finer touch to your world.  The PC version allows a nearly inexhaustible collection so you'll have plenty of options to add more detail to your world.Copy and paste - Take a unique design and reproduce it to fill in your world with color or simplify a large project by reducing it to a set of duplicable pieces by copying and pasting elements of your world.Build2me - Excellent for covering roofs, building bridges, or filling in gaps build2me allows you to place an entire line of blocks from your target all the way to your current location.High graphical fidelity  - Incredible texture resolution, whole array of shaders, and a lighting engine that must be seen to be believed makes an incredible project look that much better.All of these provide the player with the tools necessary to build beautiful constructions of a scale that until now has been unimaginable in a vox game.  In this regard it is a huge step forward from the console version.  As of the time of writing this review the primary missing feature from the creative toolbox is animating the detail blocks.  This feature has yet to return but remains on the roadmap so expect it to appear before the full release.  I highly recommend checking out some of the Top rated screenshots to see some of the incredible things players have built already using the engine.One of the most desired elements that I had waited on with the console version was the development of a survival oriented game to make the most of the engine.  That time has finally come as the survival mode has seen its public debut and with only a few weeks of development time it already shows promise for an entertaining experience that will last many, many hours.  The player is dropped into a world where the environment itself is hostile.  The early game has the player battling the cold by sustaining a supply of energy to power his high tech hazard suit to prevent freezing to death by hypothermia.  The suit also appears to be designed for heat, radiation, low oxygen levels, and toxic environments so expect to see a variety of hazards to face from the world itself.  As of the time of writing the cold is the only threat.  Although the suit can be heated up by standing on a torch there is no danger from heat yet.  It will attempt to consume energy to keep you cool however.The gameplay centers around the idea of your suit energy being your life and that venturing far from your main energy network is a great risk.  You'll spend much of your time developing a network of power distribution to your mining network which is driven by machines called extractors which collect ore from resource nodes albeit at a slow pace.  This process is slower than the player's own mining ability however it is more efficient and automated as long as you sustain the machines with energy.  Later on you gain the ability to make batteries to store power and provide it to your machines, lasers which are used to move power between batteries, a generator for burning coal to produce power, hoppers to collect the resources from the extractors, and robots to move items among the hoppers.  The end result is the complete automation of your mining operations and the ability to generate and move energy around your base of operations to keep everything alive and moving including yourself!A few other relevant bits about the mode: torches can be placed as a source of light and heat.  They serve as little beacons of safety in the harsh world.  The player is provided with a grappling hook to quickly climb from the depths as the world goes down many light years.  Surival mode currently only utilizes the first several hundred blocks down but will eventually stretch to several thousand meters underground.  The player has a handy ore/cave sensor which consumes a quarter of your suit energy but provides an indicator of the closest ore/cave from the player.  This removes some of the tedium associated with finding resources and just getting about underground.All of this is only after about a month of development.  There is already a list of planned features to expand upon the mode including suit upgrades such as increased energy storage, greater insulation from the cold, upgrades to the ore sensor to identify specific ore types, and more.  The first mob was added to the game which is a real treat.  The details of which I won't provide here as they are more fun to discover on your own. :)  He isn't much of a threat yet but I'm sure that will change as the tools necessary to combat him are added.  In the current state it takes several hours to proceed through the current tech tree and with additional features promising to fill out the game the survival mode is shaping up to be an incredibly entertaining experience that will be even more fun with friends given the natural scale of the game.It is now I should probably place a reminder here of the normal warnings of early access games.  This is an early access title so it isn't complete yet.  Among the features still missing that is probably most desirable is multiplayer.  It is on the roadmap and even in development right now.  The devs have the game roadmap[www.fortresscraft.com] including multiplayer progress on their website where you can keep track of progress if you don't wish to buy in immediately.  As mentioned above the animations are not available for detail blocks and survival mode is only a month into development.  Other areas that still need work include the menus where many options are still unavailable and do not use a mouse interface yet.  In the end I guess the question that matters most is: Is it worth it?  If you enjoyed the creative experience offered by the XBLIG version or are looking for a more powerful block builder than you can get with other PC titles then FC:E is already a must buy.  If the survival experience is more what you are after then the answer isn't as clear.  Although the game is progressing very quickly it is still far from complete and there are many features required to fill out the experience.  There is also a lot of bug fixing and optimization needed as so much is being thrown into the game so quickly.  If you absolutely must have the end result then it is worth buying now at the introductory rate which is said to be 40% of the final price and will increase with each major milestone.  If you still are unsure then be sure to check out the forums regularly as new patches are released multiple times a week with fixes and new content.  At the rate the game is currently moving it will be making a big name for itself in voxel gaming this year.			"

												UPDATE for this review: Too many things have changed that I no longer play this game.  Not only was it the mobs, but it was also not being able to use generators where we wanted to.  You can have a generator in a game to provide power, but lasers were unfortunately more favored over generators for some reason.  One day, a game will come out, that will be a factory game, no mobs, and no BS, and that is the game I am looking for.  Full automation with no interruptions.In the end, no I do not recommend this game.  I have edited this review to show that I was 50/50 on my review, as a full recommendation for the game.  Now, I am 100% dead set, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.  I have been playing the game with no mob AI and have actually been loving it.  It's a nice change from playing Minecraft all day long.What I enjoy most about the game, is the fact that you need machines to gather resources, mainly your ores, and that you can use conveyor belts to move all your materials around.  I've worked a warehouse job where it was conveyor belt city almost, and one conveyor belt at this job, took 10 minutes to get the product from the machine to me, where I had to sort it with other packages.  So the game in it's current state is pretty wild.  So I recommend it based on how it's different from Minecraft, you can build and destroy blocks from almost any range, and how its got all this factory stuff.  I believe there are mods for Minecraft for factory, but I enjoy playing this game as it offers a much different feeling and gives a different look.Recent changes however will be approaching, and this is where I am undecided on a full recommendation.  Changes will be coming that will give the mobs an AI, meaning they can drain power or screw with your machines functioning unless you plop down turrets.  To begin, alot of items to build are very expensive, and that problem needs addressed.  Another recent change to the game was how generators work.  Before, you could use generators anywhere for power.  Now, generators will only work so far underground, then you are forced to use lasers.  My laser system is getting to be pretty crazy, trying to drag down as much power as I can, and it feels like a never ending battle to even be able to keep power running.  There have been recent game code fixes to the lasers in how they operate.  I personally dislike the lasers altogether, but I'm really trying to give them a chance.The other problem that I have, is that, I would love to just be able to operate a factory, with no interruptions, but that isn't going to be added as a seperate option.  A simple option to start a new game with no mobs, cannot or will not be included.  A few people have asked for this, but all have been given a ""no this is not an option"" answer.  The way indie games are made today, community input is helpful, and when that input is actually used in the game, that's even better, and I believe that indie developers should always keep an open mind about different things they can and cannot include.  What I'm saying is, if the game Minecraft can have a no mob option, come on, it really shouldn't be that hard for you to include it as well.  But I'm not saying that it needs to be included right away.  I'm just saying, it is an option, and it shouldn't be ruled out so quickly.  Once the game gets more closer to completion, then add in the option to turn off the mobs.  Personally, I'm not looking forward to the mobs in the game, because I was hoping to just run a factory.The more you cater to your players and fans of the game, the more they will see you in a better light.  Then, mix it up a bit and change something that players wouldn't feel is too game breaking, or that on a forum, you have ideas and can go over those ideas with your playerbase.  This happens already, but that transparency is what people want nowadays, and the developers have 100% transparency with their playerbase.It's really just the no mob thing.  Never entirely rule something out if it can be a possible option added in later on.  I play Minecraft so much, that I'm getting tired of mobs.  Which is why I have so much play time with this game.  It's pretty much you building and running a factory, but then here come the mobs.It's a good game, and if you like having to use machines to get things done, then you should get it.It is still in its early stages so it will be going through many changes I'm sure.EDIT:  So I'm not really sure what stage the game is in now, but my final ruling is: NO I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME, AND NO, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.

												Good concept. It's fun to build massive machines and conveyor belts. Not a fan of the voxel cube looking games but this has so much more. It should still be in early access honestly, it seems a little unfinished some items do not have icons and I feel like I lost some direction and purpose at this point in time so I got a little bored, but it is a good game overall and fun to play. Tutorial still needs some work. No major game breaking bugs or issues. I will come back in a few months and hopefully by then it will have some boss mobs and more things to do. Developer is very active with the community almost every forum post I've seen has a reply from him directly. If it was just the one person aking the game then he is very talented.			"

												This is hesitant negative review, the game does have a lot of potential and has provided nearly a 100 hours of fun game play despite a lot of short comings. And in that sense it's a good purchase. It has fairly unique feel to it and in the beginning the open world mantra of feel your way around to figure out how things work and what your goals are is a lot of fun.In this phase you can overlook a lot of little things, odd interface for dealing with inventories, an apparent disdain for chests to the point of letting you hold 1000's of bars in your inventory. No RPG like interface to hold upgrades for your character ( which are essentially armor upgrades ) so they just sit in your general inventory. Tons of little visual and animation glitches that don't affect the game play. Some odd sound choices like your power storage ( batteries ) making a lot more noise than your generators, which leads to the odd situation where when you run out of power and your generators power up , it suddenly gets quite. But at some point all of these little things start to get harder to overlook and the game starts to change from fun to a grind that will have you leaving it running in the background while you do other things.The big problem is near the end game, the design philosophy suddenly changes from one that provides fun and rewarding game play while designing your automation systems to one of forcing you into massive grinds. You are no longer automating for the joy of designing virtual machines or because you feel rewarded for doing so, but because the game forces a lot of pain on you if you don't.In the end I don't regret getting the game, I had a lot of fun with it for a good amount of time. I do regret getting the DLC and that's about the only recommendation I can make, make sure you complete the first part of game and are ok with how it plays in the end before committing to the DLC ( although in fairness even with the cost of the DLC it was a good value )			"

It can be difficult to start out with, and some glitches end up being weird, distracting, and annoying - but it has been a long time since I've seen a game so creative, logical, well-designed, well-paced, and most of all - so well supported. The dev behind this game is an awesome guy, and he is constantly working on it. You can tell, when you start up the game.Well, back to playing.			"

Game has infinite replay value and costs less base wise than most games like it by over half.Alright I started playing this game in early acces around patch 4. We are know on patch 10, beginning work on 11 soon. The game is fantastic. I found this game on the featured part of steam one day and thought, ""Hey I like modded minecraft, this might be fun."" I had never heard of games like factorio, but This game introduced me to that as well. Both of these games are similar and while  Voxel Games tend to be considered a minecraft copyright just due to popularity,  these are not that similar in gameplay. I consider this game to be much more mentally challenging than simple despite using a cube world generation (which actually makes the game much more enjoyable when compared to non-voxel games like Space engineers which does share some similarity to a vague extent with this game). The game starts you off with a nice tutorial introducing basic concepts. An ingame help entry is available for every block, machine, and item you see in the game. The game tests the players' ability to create well balanced logistics systems, mining operations using automated technology, and tower defense skills.I never understood what big meant in a voxel game till playing this one. Minecraft worlds are 256 blocks tall. This game's first cave systems is found at -256. World's currently include content that is fully implemented all the way to -2000 meters down. 10x the depth of minecraft and 100x the content. There are around 11 different resources that need to be automated and all of them come with unique challenges involving their logistical transport. some are so far down that cargo lift elevators are needed to move 1000s of items at a time from deep underground to the surface for smelting. The game takes the logistics fo factorio, the easy to grasp gameplay of minecraft, combines them into a 3d world, adds unique challenges and mobs, throws in a bit of towerdefense early game, and a VERY UNIQUE enemy later with the first DLC that adds literally the same amount of content as the base game alone. These all combine to create what has been one my favorite games of all time. It's still updated almost daily on the beta branches and a new patch adding tons of content comes to the stable mainline every month. The 800 hour reviews that don't recommend the game simply have salt with the developer who I have never had an issue with and I've given him proably 50 ideas that have been shot down with logical reasoning as to why they shouldn't or can't be implented. Love the game, love the devs, and love the cost. I honestly don't see any downsides, and the game comes with over 12 different difficulty combinations that you can use to fine-tune the challenge to your liking. 200 hours seems like a lot for a full playthrough? drop it to Casual mode and you can speed run the thing in around 40. It's not nearly as hard, but it's still extremely fun. And upon completion of the survival mode, alternative game modes are unlocked offering new challenges. There is so much content in this game and even if a few things here and there aren't everyones cup of tea, $13 is not something that anyone can complain about. Call of Duty and other AAA games offer less content for their respecitve genres, less community interaction, and most of all, MUCH less balancing of implemented features based on player feedback. Buy it. Just do it. Thank Me later. And if you honestly don't enjoy the game as much as everyone else does, then refund it and say ""I tried something new and didn't give it an awful review on YELP"" No harm, no foul.			"

												I can't recommend this game enough. It can be difficult to start out with, and some glitches end up being weird, distracting, and annoying - but it has been a long time since I've seen a game so creative, logical, well-designed, well-paced, and most of all - so well supported. The dev behind this game is an awesome guy, and he is constantly working on it. You can tell, when you start up the game.Well, back to playing.			"

Building, automation, and explorationThe game just left Early Access, but it's far from being done. I mean that in a good way: The devs are committed to adding features as long as they can afford to.Your job in this game is to build a massive industrial complex to save yourself and escape the hostile planet you've crashed on. If you find yourself doing something tedious, there's probably a machine you can use to do it for you instead.Pros:Zillions of machines to automate your baseFun tower defense aspect can be ignored if you don't like itWorld size is basically unlimited. Dig as deep as you can!Good graphicsMultiplayerCreative mode allows construction of amazing thingsCons:Documentation is mediocre. (Used to be poor, so it's improving.) Best source of info is the Steam forum, which is disorganized because it's a forum.There are some rough spots in scaling your industrial output. There are no machines to gracefully handle thousands of resources. (But they're working on it.)Not much plot or story; if that's what you're looking for, it's not here. "

												Contrary to what people seem to think about a game with blocks, FortressCraft Evolved is in NO WAY a ""Minecraft clone"". It shares nothing in common with MC other than being voxel based.I've sank over 50 hours into FCE since purchasing it a bit over a week ago. The developer is constantly working on patches and feature updates, often streaming on twitch while he's working on them.			"

												It's fantastic. Plain and simple. It's like someone played MineCraft and thought, ""Well, this is pretty fun. What else can it do?"" So they dug through mods and found Technic. Then they played that for a bit and thought, ""This, too, is pretty fun. But it wasn't really made for this...I bet I could make something like this, but better."" And so they did. Starting out can be rough, depending on your world. I tried a couple before I found one I was happy with. It will take time.The game is heavily based around automation, so you can continue to dig deeper and find new things, then automate those new things to get it all back to your base. At first, you will have to babysit things. You simply don't have the resources to get things rolling on their own for the first hour, maybe two. Watch a couple of videos on it. You'll see how others do things, you'll get a good understanding of the basics, and you'll have some ideas as to how to set your own system up. It takes a lot of time to really get a lot going on, but if building up to that isn't your cup of tea, then I might advise a different game type. There are several more mechanics at play here than in MineCraft, and pretty much any other game in this vein. It takes a lot of the concepts explored in Space Engineers, removes space, and instead focuses on mining materials and setting them up to work for you. Never played anything else quite like it. As of this writing, the devs have moved to a new engine and made several quality of life improvements. There are more updates coming, and the community that I've interacted with is outstanding. This is a prime example of an early access game taking full advantage of what gamers can bring to a development cycle.			"

								If you're a fan of FTB or Technic modpacks for Minecraft you'll be right at home here, automation and machinery galore! If you like your games less complex though this may not be your cup of tea.As I strive for faster mining and processing the efficiency of production goes out of the window somewhat. Resources are plentiful though so it doesn't bother me. The CO2 emissions seem to bother the indiginous life though! I guess I'll just have to line my base with gun batteries and subjugate them :)			"

												A voxel based survival / sandbox game with a big emphasis on power production and power usage e.g. every action has a power cost and you must mine and forage to feed your growing power cost. Nice use of conveyor blocks so that you can build vast mining operations to feed your main base and many blocks to craft buildings and the like.Graphics are simple but not in a bad way, sfx mmmmm could be better but not a reason to complain.And there has been very regular updates and improvements (the most i've seen from an EA dev).8/10			"

												Alot of people see the graphics and thing of the other Voxel Based survival game, however this game is in a league of its own. From the grapping hook used to travel to the build tool that lets you build an remove objects as far as you can see. So many things in this game work so well.I currently have almost 200 hours put into a game that I payed 12.99 dollars US for, even for a single play though of the story you are looking at a 100+ hours of game play.Not to mention that the developer is all over the forums, Twitch and updating the beta build of the game often multiple times a day. If you play the other voxel based survival game you should do yourself a favor and try out this one, or check out one of the several streamers on Twitch, or YouTube. We are trying to get the word out and dispel some myths about this game.If you like Factorio and Voxel Based games you really need to check out this game.			"

								For 8,99€ it's a great deal, if you like to mine, craft, automate, experiment and optimise!Sadly it becomes boring as soon as you researched all the stuff. The ugly snowy atmosphere doesn't make it better, but you can easily spend a week of intense playing until you get to that point. "

								This game still has its bugs.Despite that, playing it is kind of soothing. I mostly play games like terraria, FTL and minecraft. I make a new review so that I can point out the positive pieces.Energy system, ores, ingots, intermediate building materials such as PCB:s, copper plates...It is a bit difficult to move far away from your home base since the power quickly drains. Besides that, I say it's a challenge. So far, I haven't got to the point where I think this game has ""everything"". The most bothersome challenge is moving far away from the home base and finding the resources that you need. Canalizing coal into the main hub is one of the most usual things that you will do in the beginning. This is done by hand (taking coal from a mining block into your infinite inventory space, then staying at the base until it has enough power).I imagine that a larger operation would take a lot of time. I sporadically play games with or without liking them, so I would usually not recommend this game because ""bitterness"". But I got into it a bit more by watching someone making a let's play on it. For example, the tutorial in the beginning was added with the latest patch. Before that, I had to watch the let's play in order to know what to do. Mostly, games like minecraft gain introduction level experience by being simple. As complexity adds to the time that you spend fumbling around, these ""cellular automata"" games almost require an intro course.I have no idea how to get the complexity that the game promotes by its videos. As usual, the actual gameplay is similar to any minecraft-like game. As usual, there is some difficulty getting to the point where you feel you've achieved something. Things like putting coal in the main hub will predate the point where you've found your first source of copper.Tips:X <--- changes to block breakerM <--- changes to block scanner/pingerL  <--- turns on lights (drains energy)The scanner is necessary to find the first piece of copper deep below ground.Right now, candles are extremely cheap (infinite power!) and craves coal which you get cheap in the beginning (most of the times)C <--- open crafting menu, where you can craft candles on the go			"

												This game isn't for everyone, but oh man, if it turns out you're one of the people it IS for, then prepare to spend weeks of your life in this game.  Builders, perfectionists, architects & problem solvers - read on, this game is for you.You toil endlessly creating complex systems to do some work for you so you can go back to toiling endlessly, but with a goal to achieve.  Sounds like torture?  Skip it.  Sounds like fun?  Buy it.It's like Factorio got moved into MineCraft.  A 3D block environment where you dig and mine, but not to gather resources.  You dig and mine so that you can place down machines to gather the resources for you.  Then you build a transportation system to move those resources to your base to be turned into more machines.  So you can dig and mine deeper, to place more machines to gather more resources.  Thats the ""Craft"" piece of the game.The ""Fortress"" piece is about defending against the waves of attackers.  Fortress isn't really an apt desription, I'd say its more of a camp with a heart that you defend with craploads of guns.  Again, you don't do the defending so much as your machines do the defending for you.  Granted, the waves of attackers are a bit simplistic - very much like the waves in a tower defense game, they mindlessly hover toward the exit (in this case not an exit, but the core machine in your base).  If they reach it, they attack and you 'lose'.The game has several tiers, each reachable only by solving the previous tier; and a little bit of the tier itself that you're trying to reach.  Problematic enough to cause some frustration along with the satisfaction of having overcome that obstacle.  Several times as you try to get to the next tier, you find the machines you have access to come up a bit shy and you need to temporarily resort to doing things by hand again for the earliest parts of of 'leveling up' to the next tier.  How you go about solving it is all part of the fun, and there isn't just one right answer either.This sort of problem solving, improving and perfecting is found throughout the game.  For me, it was an everflowing cycle of frustrating problems and dopamine reward.  Like I said, it's not for everyone, but if it is for you, then easily expect triple digits of playtime next to FortressCraft on your Steam profile.			"

								If you've ever wondered if the Unity3D engine can do games like Minecraft, then this game answers that question. Its a port of a game that's been on consoles for some time now, and is still a work in progess so things are going to be pretty rough. Despite its shortcomings this game has a lot of potential to be serious competition for Minecraft, which up until now has had no real competition on the PC side.There are things that need to be fixed. You still get the Creative Mode item list in Survival Mode, making it hard to determine which blocks you have available, and you cannot use the mouse in your inventory screen. In fact, you can't use the mouse in any of the interfaces for the game except for the ESC button menu while in-game. This needs to be addressed, especially for this PC port of the game.As I said, this game has massive potential, so while its not quite ready yet if you buy the game now you're helping the developers out so they can finish it that much faster. So, while its very rough as an alpha this is one worth investing in.			"

												I have been playing the game for approximately 150 hours since 2 months ago and it has all the elements of a game I like: quite addicting, balance, challenge, creativity, fun, longevity and strategy.  I still feel I'm maybe only 1/3 into the game and there's still so much more content to keep exploring in the game with all the machines, ways to use them and interoperability, it's great. There are not any noticable bugs which I have noticed and I have personally seen how the developer has dedicated his time by watching his development stream where he is creating and growing the game.  That being said, I recommend you watch it to get a feel for his passion for improving this game continuously and takes direct customers input to add content and keep rebalancing the game.  He does this because he loves his game and it sounds like it will be around for a long long time and I am tempted to become a patreon as well because the game has so much already paid for itself in pure enjoyment.That being said, if you happen to be reading any earlier reviews about bugs/etc, I would take them very lightly because they most likely have been resolved and the game is very solid.Hope you pick up the game!

												It's like minecraft, but without all the boring♥♥♥♥♥♥Dear lord, this game is fun. It has all of the creative potential of minecraft, but automation removes all the boring negatives like manually mining and smelting and even building block by block. Instead of wasting time on that boring nonsense, FortressCraft Evolved allows you to focus on advancing your tech, building your base, and defeating your enemies! There are tons of awesome aspects of the tech aspect of this game, with my favorite being the ability to build blocks from a specified block to your location using control-click. AFAIK, minecraft doesn't let you do this. At least, it didn't back in the day when I played it. Also, this game has a grappling hook. Let me repeat that for you. THIS GAME HAS A GRAPPLING HOOK. AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO UNLOCK IT. There are multiple power source types for your machine, and your enemies (bees native to the world you're stranded on) provide you with valuable building materials. There's a lot of variety in every aspect of the game: building, smelting, mining, etc. Also, this game is gorgeous for what it is. I'm running it on an intel g3258 that I haven't gotten around to overclocking yet and an AMD r9 270 and it still runs decently on high-ish settings. And it works on linux! :DThere are a lot of complaints from earlier in the game's development about the creator abandoning the project. He came back, and has been consistently releasing updates since the beginning of the year. He's a bit snarky, but he's really fun to interact with, and he actually listens to player feedback. Basically, this game is everything an indy game should be. Fun, inventive, varied, cheap, and available across all platforms. What are you waiting for?? Buy it!			"

								So far, I do really like the game. The concept of the game is awesome, but gameplay is a bit confusing. Tooltips would be great on graphics options and maybe a bit more perfomance optimization because I seem to get a huge amount of lag, whether I'm recording or not, and I've turned all graphics settings way down. The lag is a lot less, but still too much with all graphics settings set so low. That being said, the game is in early access, and there's always going to be issues with early access. The future of this game could bring a lot of positives, and I am hopeful for this! Keep up the great work developers!

								So far, I do really like the game. The concept of the game is awesome, but gameplay is a bit confusing. Tooltips would be great on graphics options and maybe a bit more perfomance optimization because I seem to get a huge amount of lag, whether I'm recording or not, and I've turned all graphics settings way down. The lag is a lot less, but still too much with all graphics settings set so low. That being said, the game is in early access, and there's always going to be issues with early access. The future of this game could bring a lot of positives, and I am hopeful for this! Keep up the great work developers!

								I wish the Steam reviews rating system gave more ""score"" to reviews written after big updates because this game has developed so much in the latest releases... FE does'nt deserve the Mixed rating, is so much better than that. Sure, it's still rough around the edges and has still many (non game-breaking) little bugs, but the developer is very active and patching and updating the game constantly so that you can solve little problems in as short as a few days span.Now about the game:- Minecraft inspired (blocky world and such)- Story driven: you crash on a planet with your ship and only have some basic stuff to survive and your final goal is to find a way to go back out there where you came from- Creative mode too (with much more stuff than survival mode)- Most of the game is about setting up a mining operation and get the necessary resources/ores to finally build the stuff you need to leave the planet (game end)- Mobs / Tower defence mode has been introduced: so while building/exploring the alien planet you also need to fight and/or setup defences depending on how much you get noticed by the local aliens- There are ""Hive Minds""! O_o- If you like crafting and building automated stuff this is the game for you!- This is mainly a single player game IMO but they put in a multiplayer mode too (I don't use it) which is a bit awkward to setup, but they're still improving itSo basically my tip is to go buy it!If you're not convinced by now then just wait for the next sale and grab it, IMO you won't regret it.

												Ok so, I got this game about 2 weeks ago (I can only play a tiny bit on weekends) but I've already fallen in love with this.  I mean sure it might have its bugs, but hey, no game is 100% perfect and tailored specifically to everyone's wants.  If you ever liked minecraft mods that include machines and stuff but don't really focus on the building, this game is absolutely perfect for you.  This game is AMAZING. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend, even if you don't like minecraft, give this game a try you never know what games you might fall in love with (because I already have with this game after playing for about, idk, 1 hour). Again,  I HIGHLY recommend that you give this a shot, no matter what kind of games your into.Pjbomb2, end of game review (first game rview I've done, so yeah, it's that amazing)			"

												So i bought this game looking for a voxel that was more complicated than minecraft.  I enjoy playing something that requires a bit of OCD, creativity and structure with its playstyle.  What can be more fun than building your own defense while mining and exploring i thought to myself!  600+ hours later i still enjoy the game, starting a new world and looking for the ore to upgrade my base.  I enjoy how i can automate the entire production of items and ore.  Place things as far away as i want and transport them to where i need.  I do not really have anything bad to say about this game, specially since many of the complains that i did have are now mute since the developer pays special attention to what the supports of this game wants to see.  At the most i would like to see a veriety of different enemies instead of just wasps that fly naturally instead of their direct path.  this game easily scores an 7/10 and climbing.			"

												Similar to minecraft, in that it is a block based, 1m x 1m x 1m type game. The similarities disappear shortly after that. The build gun is an amazing tool for building or removing blocks at long range and is capable of building large platforms or walls very quickly. Most of the game is based on automation of resources or manufacturing, similar to Factorio. The game play in single player seems to flow through 3 distinct types of gameplay: you start off in a survival game, fighting the elements and trying to just manage; mid-game is filled with automation of all sorts, from power generation and transport, to quarrying, refining materials you obtain, and auto-crafting items; end-game is similar to a tower defense game, fighting hordes of enemies, trying to keep them from destroying your Central Power Hub and resetting the charge on your end-game structure. I thoroughly enjoy it, and can easily say that it's worth the full price.			"

												First up, I have 183 hours playing this game so far, it's by far my favourite block game there has been so far.If you enjoyed modding Minecraft with things like machines and power, then this is basically that done properly.For anyone thinking or expecting a Minecraft clone however - it's far far from Minecraft's gameplay.The immense fun in this game comes from building bigger and bigger..  More power required, more ore required.. More, more, MORE!  You always want and need more!  But that's a balanced gradual process and before long you have a sprawling power network powering deep mines and a massive turret network on the surface to defend against the planet's creatures' attacks which ramp up and up as you grow.It's constantly being developed (sometimes 3-4 patches a day on the bleeding edge line) and the main dev is fantastic and very active on the steam forum, always listening to and answering comments.If a bad bug is spotted it's usually fixed that day, sometimes within the hour even.  I wish all games had development this great.TL;DR..Buy it now.			"

												As it is now, I can't reccomend this game. It's hard even on the 'easy' settings to do anything really. With the combonation of heat/cold, energy storage of your suit only one begginer smelter and a whole lot of things early game take way too long! It is a time sink that is in my opinion far worse than other 'builder' games. I will compare to one that most everyone should know: Minecraft.Comparing Minecraft to Fortresscraft*You can easily build multiple smelters right from the start really/ Fortresscraft you may finally unlock a basic smelter after a few hours play.*Ores are generally spawned with more of a pattern/ Fortresscraft is more luck based. Meaning it may take a few hours to even build the basics.*You already know all crafting, you just need the proper tool/ Fortresscraft you need to scan almost everything, and research it. Use the researcher to gain building rights. Making the beginning game so long and tedious.These are just a few issues I have.One could argue: Recode the recipes in the data files. I shouldn't have to. One could say use creative mode. Then I lose out on needing anything and lose on battling enemies. Plus you don't get all the energy stuff or anything. Or none that I could see.I wish there was a kind of hybrid creative/ survival mode. Kind of like how you can switch between the modes in Minecraft with commands. And the creative mode in Fortresscraft had ALL the blocks plus being able to battle enemies should you choose to.So unless you have hours to sit down and figure this game out, don't expect anything to be built quickly. As it is, I can't reccomend it. Maybe it's not for me since I don't have hours and hours to sink into it to find everything and such. Which is why I like Minecraft better. If you want something that does similar to this but qucker, Try Factorio. You can even cheat if you wish, and I don't feel cheating ruined the game for me on that as I still do a lot.It has potential. I love the idea of having a factory with belts/ transporters, and building a defensive base and all that. So I WILL check in on this game from time to time as I do like the ideas. It just needs to be a little more open I guess you could say. Allow us to do what we want, if we wish to speed things up some allow commands to do so or something. I'll keep watching it for updates and such and may update my review at a later date.			"

								This game is fun to play around in as you can see by my amount of hours I have logged so far. At the moment the player just has to worry about building, gathering resources, and surviving the environment. However, in the future there will be hostile mobs added to the mix along with some other interesting little things that will serve to challenge the player(s) and their survival. The Devs are pretty active in the forums with the communitite and answer our questions for the most part. They also will use ideas and thoughts we have for the game if they like them and will add them to the mainstream game if it is feasable to do so.The only down side to the game for me honestly is the lack of things to fight while playing and no defenses that work at the moment. Thought I know that will change when they get to adding these features.Overall good game with a lot more to be added as it develops.			"

												FortressCraft Evolved! scratched all the itches I had playing other sandbox games. I don't care about survival and crafting; that isn't what this game is about. It is about exploring and designing your own systems and gradually opening up more options to make things more efficient. Constant revisioning and redesigning my systems is the best thing about it. The search for efficiency is my motivator throughout. I like playing this game in an information vacuum because I don't care how the other players are doing it; I want to work through it on my own.With the nature of the development there is a fair bit of jank in the game but it is coherent enough to let me forget it after I learned the basics. It is a hard sell to friends that are used to very complete tutorials. This is not a game that holds your hand and it expects you to do some research on your own. I'm fine with that because it is a good game. Any less and it would have sat in my back log.Finally, you can really tell the game is a labor of love and if I were the developer, I would be very, very proud of this achievement.			"

								First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/fortresscraft-evolved-first-impressions/Note: These are my first impressions based off of my first play sessionFortresscraft was first released in 2011, on the Xbox 360 and went on to become one of the most downloaded Xbox Arcade games ever. Fortresscraft Evolved is a complete remake of the original Fortresscraft in the Unity engine and was released on Steam Dec 10, 2013.A lot of people will go ahead and compare this game to Minecraft and, while it does share some similarities with my all-time favorite game, it is actually quite different, especially in terms of creative building. There is a survival mode in the game, but when I tried to start a new world with it, I was placed in creative mode. No idea why that happened.The creative mechanics in the game are fantastic. There are many features that make building a lot easier than what you'd probably expect from a game like this (try shift+left clicking with a block in hand). I was even able to whip up a quick tree house in about 30 seconds, and this was no ordinary tree house, it was massive. I really love what the devs did to make creative building as painless as possible.The game does have some technical issues however, with the game sound being my major complaint. They seemed to lag behind. Oh, and is there supposed to be game music? I heard some at one point, but, other than that, it appears to be nonexistent.Anyways, the game is fun, if you know what you're doing. The survival mode, however, simply is not as fun as I had expected it to be. Recommended purely for its creative capabilities!			"

Easily worth more than the asking price, FortressCraft sets itself apart enough from the crowd within the new voxel sandbox genre with innovation and practicality.  The controls are a bit intimidating, the sound is funny, it's definitely early access, but there is already enough here for a polished AAA Creative / Survival game... & there is much more on the way~			"

												    The only real complaint i have for this game is the first few hours of this game it does feel a bit slow, but after that it gets incredibly in depth, with tons of machines already in the game and loads more being added with each patch. As of now i dont know a single game that can be compared to this other than factorio, but even then both games are quite different. The models of the machines look great, performance is usually quite good, and most of the machines are decently balanced / well put together. The help files are quite handy at times, but usually the tooltips are enough for non-complex machinery.     I do love making massive automated factories and fighting off hoards of enemies, so if you are into those things, this is definitly worth the money. "

												Just a great game.Not since Civ had I had a game that keeps me going until I realize it's morning and time for work.  As a player, there is always something more to do.  And, you get to set the pace.  A great job was done allowing the players control of the game and still keep it chalanging.  The developer is always looking for way to improve the game.  Is it finished?  I thing a better question is... will it ever be?  I mean that in a very positive way.  With a great base and invested developer, there's no saying what's next.If you like finding your own way of doing thing you'll love this game too.Thank you for giving us this very enjoyable adventrue.

												A very good base building sandbox game.  The developer is very active and actually reads and responds in the forums which is a big plus to me.  There are updates about every 2~3 weeks now that it has been released, which I am ok with (I am refering to the Patch # content, which are rather large updates). A lot of people have compared it to minecraft but main difference is that there is no weapon or armor upgrade for your character.  This is mainly because this is more of a tower defense type game, so if you are looking for a shooter this won't be it.My only gripe with the game is that you cannot move your starting Central Power Hub (CPH) which basically forces you to build at your start point since that is what you have to protect.  It would be nice if you could relocate your base.			"

												I discovered the factorio demo a few months ago--loved the idea.  Waited for the sale--although I try not to spend more than $5 on a game, I figured I'd go to $10 for that one.When the steam sale came, it was the only game in my list that didn't go on sale.  With tears in my eyes I started looking at related games, the first one of which was FortressCraftI was somewhat burned out on the Minecraft type games so I was reluctant, but on sale it was a good deal and looked interesting so I tried it.LOVE the game.  I've spent way over 200 hours on this now. On top of that, I've recommended highly enough that another 6 copies have sold to my friends and family (Including at least a couple of the expansion).  I see a few of them on playing FortressCraft into the night.  I'll probably buy the expansion eventually at full price just to support the dev too.If factorio had gone on sale (Or fortressCraft hadn't), I'd be playing that (But I'd probably be doing so alone since it's not available for the Mac like FortressCraft is).

												After a relatively short scene-setting intro and a very quick tutorial, FortressCraft Evolved has handed you the basics and expects you to get on with it, which is a refreshing change from too many games with 20 minute pause-button press-pause tutorials that seem to be the trend recently.That said, the tutorial does give you the basics of how to figure everything else out for yourself with fairly extensive in-game help and tooltips, so with a bit of trial and error along the way, for which the game imposes no penalties on the easy difficulty settings (my personal recommendation until you know what you're doing), you soon get into the swing of it. Automation is a major part of the game, and your strategy of implementing this will heavily determine the pace of the game. Want it to go faster? Simply increase whatever factor is limiting your progress, be it power, materials, or machine throughput. Just as you're getting the hang of all this, you'll come across the Threat Analyser and probably end up building one out of curiosity. This will warn you of incoming attacks and keep you informed as to how much attention your base is drawing from the native life forms. Very useful in determining when you really need to change your focus to building defences against said life forms, but again on the easier settings the only penalty for failure is that it temporarily stops your source of comepletely free power.I've restarted this game several times now, because after developing my base setup a certain way I get further then come up with a better way to do things, which would almost certainly be easier if I did it from the very beginning. The fact that this game can still cause such epiphanies is to me a mark of a very well thought out game indeed.  That said, I could just tear it all apart with no penalty, and rebuild, but I prefer a clean slate.The game is undergoiong continual development on a daily basis. This does not mean that the game is unfinished, having watched the developer's daily live streams of the work being done I can say that it if the game had stayed in Early Access until he ran out of ideas and had implemented all the current thoughts he has for late-game content, it would still be Early Access ten years from now, and the game already far surpasses many titles that I've seen launched from EA.It's true that the developer is planning explansion packs as a way to introduce large chunks of extra content to the game, and a lot of people have slammed this decision, despite the fact that he has clearly said that if he can afford to do so, these will be free expansion packs rather than paid.  Given how many games are released in an almost episodic fashion these days, this is by no means unreasonable, especially given the exceptional value for money the FCE represents. How many games can give hundreds of hours of enjoyment for £10? At this price give it a try, it's a steal and if you enjoy any kind of tower defence, voxel building, crafting, gathering or logistics/assembly line games you should have a blast.Tl/dr: A great game that keeps getting better.

												Sometimes I really wish that there would be more options when reviewing, but I just can't recommend this game. Not because it's a bad one but because of the sheer amount of wasted potential which is very disappointing. The game is pretty much the work of a single dev who cares for his game and puts a lot of time and effort into the development. Unfortunately all of that falls short because of the poor execution. FortressCraft Evolved is a great example why you can't develop a game on your own after it reached a certain level of complexity and player base. The dev is no doubt a skilful coder but less talented in the other aspects of game making. FortressCraft desperately needs a texture+model artist, ui programmer, and sound designer. Right now the game is completely out of balance. The poor visuals are overcompensated with needlessly high poly models and excessive lights. The game takes advantage of the engine's most cutting edge features yet you can't turn the music off or go back to the main menu once you've started playing. Distant blocks fly in with fancy animations but the machines right in front of the player are still popping in and out regardless of the graphical settings. These and many other issues lend the game an unpolished feel and greatly hold back it's success.Off course you can find people with insane in-game hours who just love it, but you have to keep in mind that the gameplay is heavily inflated. Early game is especially slow, all you do is wait on resources. I have 200+ hours in offline play but I was afk half the time - shopping, cooking or watching TV while the ores were mined and smelted. Every attempt I made to finish the game ended with abandoning the map after 15-20 hours, I always loose interest. To make matters worse there aren't any explanations how the dev intended the machines to be used, figuring out the right setup is almost impossible, you just don't have enough information about the blocks. You have to watch countless hours of Youtube videos in order to avoid frustration. Sadly giving feedback about your issues or interacting with the community in general is not a good idea. The game is surrounded with a ring of diehard fans who are unreasonable and the developer himself can be very unprofessional.A lot of reviews are complaining about the DLC but I'm OK with it. It has one of the worst marketing I've ever seen in my life which makes it appear as another greedy cash grab attempt, but actually adds a fair amount of content for a reasonable price. It's a good way to keep the dev motivated as I still hope that my issues with the game will be addressed one day.FortressCraft Evolved could be one of the best games this genre has to offer. It could be an excellent game to introduce new players to ""blocky"" games while still challenging veteran players. Unfortunately in it's current state the game is totally unappealing. If you are a hardcore fan of the genre you will be able to overlook the numerous shortcomings otherwise stay clear, FortressCraft will yield you nothing but anger and frustration.			"

												I wish, I really wish I could recommand this game. I loved factorio, and I love the idea behind this game. A mix of resources management, base building organisation and tower defense. However, this game is really, really unstable. It is really hard to have a 4-5h game session without having the restart the game. After 25h+ on the same map, i just had the game crashing 4 times in a raw in the 5min after loading the map. I'm running on a Inter Core i5 6600K alongside a GTX 980 TI, but the game is hardly fluid for the server and clients suffer crazy lags after a few hours in game.			"

												I normally don't review many games, however, I feel like this one deserves it. It's not your standard dig and build. You really need to put thought into how to get ahead.

Pros: - Really colourful graphics and textures- Environmental effects (AFK in the middle of no where with no heat... you'll die of hypothermia)- Huge environment- Tons of items to research/build/craftCons (1 dev? And still alpha)- Not very intuitive controls (took awhile to figure out what each button did)- Not many creatures to hunt/killOverall, I find this game very enjoyable and hope to see the production continue. Mod support... could only imagine the stuff people could make. For the price, and to support an indie dev... definitely worth it.(And yes, low hours shown on Steam, but I do play this offline and on my other computer so it's not being added to the total)			"

												This review is from when I played the game back before the semester started when it was still in early access. This game is interesting and has some fun ideas. If you liked the old Tekkit Minecraft mod then you will like this game as well. The game involves finding resources, automating those resources to bring it back to base, and setting up defenses against a world that doesn't like you. A very fun game but, like minecraft, will absorb your time. If you need to keep a GPA up I would probably wait till a break to play the game, otherwise give it a try.			"

												This game is very addictive.  There are tons of things to build that is in the spirt of minecraft but with a very upgraded and far more satisfying sense of accomplishment and reward.  From the beginning to late game, Fortress Craft never gets repetive or boring.  There is always something new to try out.  The game plays like the developer actually played the game over and over while programming it, and thus the pacing of the game is amazingly well done (in other words, you dont advance too fast or get stuck too long while building or researching), epsecially considering the large amount of content in the base game.  I just bought the Frozen Fortress DLC which expands the content!  If a Factorio, Minecraft, Tower Defense  sandwhich sounds good to you, then you're in for a real treat!			"

Posted: March 8, 2016
												Well... This will be complicated.First off, full disclosure: I recieved this game from the Dev after expressing my doubts and disbelief on the forums. The topic can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/254200/discussions/0/528398719792747294/And on to the review itself...Fortresscraft is something I have difficulty playing objectively. I snagged the original back when I was a gamer on the Xbox 360 before switching to PC, and I was not impressed. It was a 'Minecraft clone', in the sense that it was blocky and HD and there was not much value in it other than blowing up the water and watching the broken physics for it cause it to spread across the entire world, but only after you had reloaded the level.Upon seeing this title on Steam, I was, understandably, not impressed. So, after downloading the Dev-given game and booting it up, I found a few things out.First, the game has some derps and issues. The tutorial can be confusing and derped at times, leaving you with little idea of what to do. I have heard there's a wiki up at this point, but there was not one when I started.You enter with little idea of how to do things, which can honestly be great. I've played Dwarf Fortress with less. Still, however, it's not a great introduction.Further on, I can see hints that this is something that I might enjoy and thrive in if I could only get it, for lack of a better word. It's not that the game is complex, it's that I just can't figure out where to go, after a bit. So many things that would really improve things for me are either missing, or I am not finding them.I know, and I can see, that this is really a good game, especially where it came from. I did have a bit of fun, and the mechanics are mostly solid, but I just couldn't get very far.Overall, the reason this is 'recommended' is because, in the end, I know it's a good game. It just isn't my type of game. I'll stick with my complex RTS addiction for my fix.In numbers: 6/10. Above average, at least. Steam really needs a 'mixed' review setting.			"

If you played Minecraft with tech mods (IC2, TE, Gregtech) and liked it, you will love this game.Very cool cold and toxic caverns, a lot of fun exploring big caves without any map.Good-balanced hard mode, which is rare, provides nice challenge for automation and logistics, and at least 300 hours of gameplay for sure, even more if you go blind without any info. Sadly no survival challenge except defending base (which can be ignored until you need loot from mobs, or charge OET, which is deep end-game)Would i spend 520 more hours designing logistics network and automation? Damn yes, 10/10 Arthers , would also suggest for everyone to buy DLC and support DjArcas for his massive work and answering our stupid questions on stream :)			"

												The game has recived a lot of free updates past release (in addition to a paid DLC/Expansion).Update 16 which came out a few days ago added a full overhaul of the game for beginners by adding a nice tutorial which starts the player on the right path to automation.It also adds missions to guide the player in his progress through the game.I've just returned to playing the game again after several months of playing other games and I'm impressed by all the work that's been put into this game since last I played.Still very much an enjoyable game with a very active and helpful comunity.--I love this game.The dev's are very active on the forums and updates to the bleeding edge happens frequently.And by active I mean he's actually reading and responding to threads on the forums.Even helped me out with my mynock problems x)Edit: After many more hours of playing I still LOVE the game.This is my reply to a question of ""Is the game worth it?`"" asked on the forums now when I've had about 80hrs of gameplay underneath my belt:YES!Now let me elaborate:I loved Minecraft, especially along with Buildcraft, Industrial Craft etc.I also enjoyed Factorio and other similar games.And I absolutely LOVE this game!// Rambling startI've played about 80hrs now and still having a blast!The developer is really active and working hard, his plans for the future seems (in my opinion anyways) awesome and so does his attitude.In it's current state I already do love the game. I would easily spend another 80hrs or more on this game in it's present state without any updates. With the updates then I expect that number to grow to insane amounts :=)Speaking of updates, you can either play on the regular early access branch or you can opt into testing the latest freshes code. The latter will crash and break so you'd HAVE TO MAKE BACKUPS (DAILY!) , but you would get frequent updates and get to test everything as soon as it's coded!Awesome!If you'd rather want things a bit more stable then don't opt into the Bleeding edge and you will be fine. Keep in mind however that this game is under developement and it's NOT a AAA+ development team behind it, but some indie dev which means this a true early access game.If you can't stand work in progress games, then you'd better wait untill it's more polished and done before you jump in :P// Rambling endTL;DRI've spent around 80hrs and will probably spend another 80 in it's current state (without any of the updates) which means it's worth EVERY CENT I've paid for it already!10/10 from me.

												Fortresscraft Evolved is similar to the major tech mods for FeedTheBeast, with an emphasis on defending your factory from waves of enemies.  The graphics in FCE are good, but you can still play with an older PC - I'm using a GTX 650 and it's fine on medium settings.  There are many features that make it easy to build large structures - cosmetic and functional.  The Frozen Factory DLC is highly recommended - it adds a significant amount of content to the game.  The difficulty settings focus mostly on ""how much time do you want to grind away"", so if you are a busy person, you can still enjoy the full content of the game without ""grinding.""  The game is more about building, planning, and some exploration - it's not as action-oriented as FTB.  In fact, the monsters mostly ignore you in FCE - the monsters are all trying to attack the center of your factory.Summary:   If you enjoy tech mods for minecraft, check out Fortresscraft Evolved.

												TL;DR, extremely good (really) infinite survival sandbox already !Even if it is still under active developpement (it is live on https://www.twitch.tv/Djarcas) the survival mode is really fun to play and discover, you can spend hours optimising your resource collection and smelting lines, then you sit back for 3 minutes to watch it go around like an automated mechanic symphony and then get greedy and start going deeper for more ores and new metals !!!The linux version works really fine, the *linux* dedicated server can be achieved with some small scripts to launch add the needed command line arguments even if that feature is not officially supported right now !!!No bugs so far (windows 10 or Linux), and a very clever world compression system !

Early Access Review
								It definitely needs a lot of work, but it's definitely worth checking out.  Don't be fooled by the voxel graphics, it's quite different from Minecraft, or at least it seems to be from my limited experience.  It's more like a standalone MC tech mod if anything, you pretty much go straight to power, machines, and automation.			"

												This game will either be really fun, or rather boring depending on what type of games you like. If you like building complex machinery chains to automate everything then this will be a good game for you. If you like fast paced, action games... This probably will not be your cup of tea. That being said lets go over some of my thoughts on this gameThings that I like about this game. Self contained machinery, automation, building, and resource gathering that plays much like a minecraft modpack based around a single tech mod. The graphics, while based around cubes for the terrain, is actually pretty good. It has vastly improved since I got this game a year+ ago. Caving is just fun in this game. There are massive cave systems that put other digger/builder games like minecraft to shame. Example, there is a cave with a ravine right next to my starting base that is almost deeper than the entirety of the building area minecraft allows (at least vertically). Things I dislike/are Meh aboutSome aspects of the game are rather grindy, even on the ""fast"" paced version. Ore collection and smelting takes time, and as you get later into the progression tree you unlock things to speed this up. Unfortunatly the cost to create everything also gets pretty high. Energy production is really small unless you are playing on the fast version, Solar panels are almost worthless unless you choose to have eternal day.The ""expected"" time to reach the endgame (OET) is not bad, but the charge time is really long. Although this gives you a good reason to make a well fortified base!Overall those detractor points are rather insignificant to me, as they just extend the time until I ""beat"" the game and then get bored. Heck.... I haven't even gotten to the end game yet and I'm almost 50 hours in! This game is well worth the money to me and DjArcas is great developer that is active within the community! "

												This game is amazing!     if you like Minecraft, Factorio, Space engineers, games like that, you will LOVE this game!It starts you off with a power supply that lasts for a while, And gives you a help guide in-game to       tell you what's what. its kinda like minecraft, but with machines, and crazier mobs, and logic, and all this other stuff that minecraft has mods for, but fortresscraft needs no mods for you to have endless hours of fun! Devs, if you are reading this, don't stop making this game better and better! the people who have negative comments are usually people where fortresscraft is just too cool for there computers. the problem is not fortresscraft, their computers are just potatoes. SO TAKE UP YOUR NON-POTATO COMPUTERS AND PLAY IT!			"

												Just posting my $.02Great game if you like the factory / automation / (to some degree) exploration sub genres in a fully 3d world. For 12.99 you could do far worse.*Note* if you can't accept the fact the dev has his vision of the game and will only bend that with ""solid"" reasoning and not ""complaining or whining"", then look elsewhere.

												Well 270h of playtime over multable patches so when i say its a good game i mean it.Yes its like MC and yes its like Factorio but its so much more. Its also only a 10er so if you love any of that stuff this games for you.Some reviews say the devs bad, hes not. Some say theres no freedom i would agree, however its not suppose to be a 1 man factory game. You use machines and are limited in some ways in order to make the machines worth while.Overall id give this game a solid 9/10 and its not finished yet. Yes there was dlc (frozen factory is a must if you like the game) but the free content so far has be plentiful and regular.At least its not abandoned like many other EA games.			"

												This is a great game and has the potential for hundreds of hours of gameplay, or thousands if you are hardcore into gaming. It has been about 6 monthis since I have played, as of writing this review, but it was a very full and complex game. First starting off is very intimidating and hard to get the hang of but it very quickly becomes second nature to use the controls properly. I plan to purchase the Frozen Factory DLC and am happy to pay $15 for it as I fully support this game and its developers who have put in so much time and effort. A highly recomended game if you love complex builds and a very stimulating game with a massive amount of content that is well made and constantly being updated by the Developers.My only cons for this game are the graphics, light glare and the hitboxes for certain blocks and items.

And when you finally delve back in again to continue playing for real, your plans in mind, you suddenly realize how much other stuff you still need. There is always something to drive you forward.

												This game is worth every penny spent on it. It's addictive, difficult, and interesting. It's a game that'll have you playing for hours on end. Besides that, the developer is active and engaged with his community. This fact is worth it's own merit since most games nowadays have beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers who lack any care for their community. Overall, this game is great as it is and it has for more potential being added every day.Edit: Some people are commenting about a virus link within the help pages via. a mislink to a youtube video. They are saying the developer doesn't care enough to fix it, etc. Currently the developer has a fix releasing in the next patch releasing in a few days. The reason he can't release a hotfix is he simply doesn't have enough manpower to update four  platforms running different versions easily and release the new patch on time. The developer also adressed this issue and replied to the thread talking about what he's doing. Some people simply can't think and start blaming a developer for ""having a horrible attitude"", when they see a small issue not being fixed quickly enough (it's been less than a week...). Just keep stuff like that in mind when planning to buy the game. It's worth it if you're into factory, progress oriented gameplay. Don't let rash people change your mind.			"

												I have played this for a few hundred hours no.it looks incredibly grindy at first, but if you do even the most basic of automation you'l find that it's not.I suspect that the game will provide me for at least a 100 hours more of pure entertainment before i'l think ""and now what?""Frozen Factory expension comes out soon wich will add more stuff, defenitly going to get that.10/10 no regretsSlight edit: i saw a lot of people claiming this is a minecraft and factorio clone, it's absolutly not. Not to mention the fact that this game existed even before factorio existed. and calling it a minecraft clone is just plain ignorant since the only thing it has in common with minecraft is that it's a voxel world. paople also complain about the developer, but he's a very nice person, go watch his steams if you don't beleive me!

												Although the game has a great design, has deep gameplay and shows a lot of promise, I cannot recommend it in its current state. It currently makes an unpolished and buggy impression, which may be acceptable for an early access game, but not for a game that has been officially released.For example, it took me several hours just to get my interface working. It turns out that the game seems to assume a 16:9 aspect ratio of your monitor. When I tried to load the game with my monitor's native resolution, which has a 4:3 aspect ratio, the interface was completely buggy. For example, windows were overlapping that were not supposed to, so that I could not see the entire interface. The game does not provide any warning when selecting an unsupported resolution.Other bugs that I have encountered include items on conveyor belts not being rendered at all under certain conditions (thereby making them invisible) and turrets not firing at the enemy, but instead making jittery movements. Also, I have encountered several bugs in the user interface. Additionally, the game crashes frequently when doing certain things, such as scanning for ore.Because this game has a great design and shows a lot of promise, I hope that the developer will fix these issues. Afterwards, I will gladly change my rating to a positive one.Meanwhile, if you are interested in resource management games with complex assembly lines, I would recommend buying the game Factorio instead. Even though it is officially still in early access, it is already a lot more polished than FortressCraft. However, the main disadvantage of Factorio is that you are limited to two dimensions (i.e. the surface of the planet), whereas in FortressCraft you can also build in the third dimension, digging deep into the planet.

												Good luck scouring forums for any sort of help at all. I advise to steer clear of the developer because he will just be sarcastic and rude with all his advice and assume you have been watching his twitch for months on end and that you have to know by now what each research unlocks and how to build some of the more complex setups that he cant be bothered to write in the help menu inside the game. after a few months i returned to the game saw some updates and progress and started a new world only to find much of the research had been jumbled up a bit. not a huge issue but when i had asked the dev where certain things were he just said ""its in the help menu"" well the item was in the help menu but all it told me is what is crafted with the item not how to craft it or unlock it in research... he swore up and down that it wasnt in the lab and that it was researched early on ingame. it was in fact in the lab and using the lab is a hit or miss on getting what you want unless you search the forums....searching forums would be great and dandy but the information is not always current like i said he moves things around changes where they go which means an old topic could tell you to research something entirely different and researching in the lab isnt an easy thing that takes a little power and a few moments.-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-until the ingame help menus actually give helpful information i cant reccomend anyone buy this game and put up with this cranky developer. its still a fun and interesting game and i will continue to play but i cant advise anyone to pay full price for this game. pick it up on sale or spend your money on a better game, also the early rush from EA was a bad move and its really not ready to be sold as a full complete game.

Think back to the time you just found minecraft, started playing and then realized how awesome it is, i have 1000's of hours into minecraft but it gets stale at times (modded anyway), Fortresscraft is something new and NOT a clone. the only reason i mention minecraft because of the feeling you got when first playing it and also voxel based. I will be putting 1000's of hours into this game because its that good. The developer patches frequently, listens to the community, and even responds to tweets :P The whole experience is refreshing! I will be setting my streaming rig back up so i can stream this a bit, the only thing im sad about, not many people stream it, that is the ONLY problem :P More people have to discover this game, it is GREAT!20/10			"

												Hey guys,this is my first review ever. Really like this game. I find it hard to remain interested in games after a day of smashing them, but im still playing this one. So that says something pretty big. Also my mrs is starting to hate this game as im on it too much.Pros -Exceptionally fast load time. once you double click the games shortcut, you are in world within a 15-20 seconds. great for those of us impatient or busy people. I really really hate bull**** loadtimes. I want to play a game not make a cup of coffee and come back while waiting for the main menu.-Good game progression.  for once a game that doesnt bog you down waiting for research, construction, or resource gathering/grinding. It has a nice balance of automation to the point where all that stuff can be done while you are off exploring. Ive often been off exploring a cavern and come back only to find that the slowest part of the system is myself and it is easy to get to the point of automation that most things become trivial (Wtf do i do with 5k copper now?)-enemies and death. you can make the game as hard as you like, and the consequences of death as permanent or trivial as you like in world gen. Which is really nice when you are still learning how to grapple around a massive cavern or falling down a really big hole.- The world. OMFG it is huge. The underground caverns are enormous, like really really really big and the terrain changes with depth, always serving up something different.-in game help. it is incredibly intuitive. It could be a little more indepth with some items but still very well thought out and just a blessing.-holobase function. you can track realtime how your network is functioning and where any bottlenecks are-good steam community who have most answers for you.-developer that is active on forums and takes interest in our feedback.cons-there is no way to pause the game as yet. you can camp out next to a torch or leave and come back (which is not that big of a deal due to fast load times) but pause would be awesome when you have the mrs trying to talk to you or a baby screaming at you. I understand the dev has said that it is a survival game but it could be a deal breaker for some gamers.-controls take a while to get used to. now and again im still trying to access hoppers with e. -the options could be a little more in depth with the sounds and music. took  google to find out how to turn off music (ctrl -m)-a coordinate system would make digging holes to your mining operations soo much easier. all in all a great early access game. very well thought out and designed. a clear development roadmap and it gives you what it promises. anyway back to the mrs tasks			"

												Before continuing into the meat of this review there is something you need to be aware of, while this game is aesthetically similar to minecraft it needs to be made clear that it is not a clone. The world made of cubes and mining had already been around before minecraft, and moreover its an aesthetic that is not something minecraft owns. If you can't get past the ""all cube based games are minecraft copies"" then stop reading here, onto the meat.Pros:1. This is a common one yet still important, the option to play with high or low difficulty in finding ore, the strength of hostiles, and even obtaining the energy you will so dearly need throughout the game. This is important as being able to enjoy the game from both a higher level and casual standpoint is a must.2. The hostiles, they are exactly what should be in a game like this, instead of only straight forward hit you and the face type ememies you have an enemy that will attach itself to your conveyor belts and such and devour all your ores making its nest ( the hivemind ) larger, and a little stealth cube thing that will drain power from your mining set up underground. Better yet, they still include a straight forward hit you in the face mob, and a little or dropping resource mob to boot for your tin needs.3. Instead of making you dig out a staircase, one of the most tedious  hardships one usually faces in ""cube games"", this game offers a high powered grappling hook, you can dig straight down and then grapple back up, this may seem overpowered however it will already take you quite some time to acquire resources and set up your automated mining and power system, if getting back to the surface were to take forever each time this game would be rendered unplayable by those of us who just dont have enough time.4. The automation that can be achieved in this game is satisfying, when you go from having to run back in forth to your copper mine set up to watching the copper roll in on a conveyor into your hopper then into your smelter, and at the moment you are looking at the 200+ stack of copper, you will feel a level of satisfaction on par with properly heating a plate of pizza rolls and not burning your tongue and throat.Cons:1. Despite what I said earlier about the hostiles, the game could probably use a bit more in this area, if you know what you are doing they are pretty easy to handle as is, there doesnt need to be too much more of this but some for sure.2. The learning curve, if you dont watch some videos, you are likely to flounder about having no idea what you are doing, this does hurt the game quite a bit. If you are against checking out some videos to figure things out this might be the deciding factor for you.3. Being a little to intense with the autmation, if you arent a fan creating (sometimes) complex systems to acquire, smelt, and convert your ore into useful objects then this game just isnt for you.4. The name, if you have played the old fortresscraft, then you go in expecting something quite different from what you will get, it is misleading and could be the leave a sour impression depending on whether you did your research or not.Conclusion:I gave an equal number of pros and cons, what comes down to is if you enjoy automation, and thinking, then theres a pretty high chance you will enjoy this game, if not continue on, and if you arent into that, but you still want to give it a go, thats awesome.

												Honestly I'm not a great reviewer.. BUT This game is insanely addicting and would suggest trying it out. It does tend to be a bit difficult and sinks a bunch of time, What else do you need though? It's fun slowly progressing and feels great making those leaps. You definitely get your $'s worth.			"

												First couple minutes of the game I had absolutely no idea what was going on. It didn't take me too long to get used to all the games mechanics. Before long I was rolling around in piles of my Ingots. With each research complete I was getting more and more excited to see what the end-game would be. Now that I have gotten to that point I have a huge challenge ahead of me and I can’t wait to see what I can do with it. I've had the game for 4 days with roughly 90 hours of gameplay. Most addicted I’ve gotten to a game in a long time. Buy it!			"

												Just started playing about a week ago, after finding DireWolf's YouTube videos. BEST. GAME. EVER. I cannot stop playing. How do you not have millions of players already? Every day/night, I think to myself, optimize one more line, or just get the next bit of research started, and bam, 2 hours later I am still playing. Love, Love, Love this game. Please keep up the excellent work. BTW, I have put in at least 60 hours so far and can't do 90% of the stuff in the video, so I know there is tons of stuff left to discover. I don't think I am anywhere near running out of new blocks/machines/tools to unlock.			"

												At the time I'm writing this review, I've got a tad over 50 hours in, and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface.The game is incredibly deep. It has found the perfect balance between difficult and fun - nothing comes easy, but everything feels great once you get it. To the same note, the game has an incredible amount of complexity, but with the research system, it's rarely (if ever) overwhelming.Even more than this, the developer is really responsive. You can just tell that this is his baby, and he is doing everything that he possibly can to make this everything we (the community) wants. -- And to that note, he has succeeded.I've recomended it to multiple friends, and we've all made the jump past the event horizon together. I'm not even sure if this message will reach you. If it does, know that there's another EPIC world waiting for you, but know that there is no return from it. You will be leaving your former life behind. (Trust me, I bought this less than a week ago, thinking this was just a casual game for my spare time. Now I'm pretty sure my family has contacted the cops and reported me missing)			"

EDITGetting a trojan warning from fortresscraft's .exe  [See Comment section]How peculiar:http://puu.sh/nIHwo/d104fdc49a.pngIntroductionComing into FortressCraft my only survival building game experience has been minecraft. So I'd like to say my expectations were high. I had read FC Evolved was similar to Tekkit modded minecraft and I was getting excited. Firstly I dislike space themed anything - and this is definitely space themed - but I've found it to be fine.My first 10mins of gameplay I was confused AF. It's fun to learn and work out what you have to do - which could be avoided by watching a gameplay of FC Evolved on YT, but I wanted to throw myself into the deep end. I'm at 20+hrs in, 17hrs of which in this one world, where I like to pretend I know what I'm doing. And I feel I've barely scratched the surface.  Once you figure out a methodology and approach, and are fast acting on it, I think you could have a world up and running a LOT faster than what I've done in this first attempt - and that's one of the selling points, become efficient.Pros/ConsPros:+ Loads of gameplay+Looks pretty [I run at good, and occasionally stutters - my gfx card runs Farcry 4 at decent settings]+I love the mobility [compared to MC]+I love the grappling hook mechanic+I love ctrl+clicking to build 30blocks in a straight line+I love seeing a base grow and become automated+I love pressing K to find where I placed that ore extractor, because I totally forgot where I put it+Addicting gameplay+Always something to do/alter/change/move/collect/kill/mine/ping+You can leave it in the background/ALTTab and even on single player, the world continues to simulate - so if you have automated mining set up, you can do other things away from your PC and come back to collect smelted ores.Cons:-I wish there was lights - early on. Throwing a bright green torch is ugly and hurts my eyes :')-I wish conveyor belts could be placed with ctrl+click, as that would save me time-I wish the music was better? A lot of annoying sounds. I find it actually nicer to play with sound off becaues of this.- Confusing progression.Overall, I paid ~$15.00 for it[?], and it has been worth it. I plan to put a lot more hours in.PS.S.I walked upto that giant squid monster and instantly died. My reasoning being I saw an unknown block at it's centre and I wanted to collect it :^).			"

												If you like minecraft, factorio, infinnifactory, you'll like this too. Fairly mindless block bashing, slightly complex resource management, dumb mobs. Pretty too.My biggest issue is not being able to see what is inside your storage hoppers when there is more than one item in there, they don't act like chests as in being able to open them and view what's inside, but more like stacks, where you can only tell how many items are in the stack and only see the top one.Another is the spiderbot, which is supposed to defend your base, however it is a rubbish shot, and it spends its time getting in your way or damaging the terrain around and under your base making it difficult to move around. Need a way to switch it off or disable it.EDIT: Recent update made the Spiderbot better. No weapons at the start, upgradeable weapons thereafter and they've apparently made it a much better shot with the ability to target up to 5 mobs simultaneously. It still leaves holes and loot all over the place though.			"

												Having never played minecraft, I come at this game fresh.  If you like a nice logistics game with good graphics and a blocky environment, I recommend this game.  It's fun and moderately challenging.  I do however feel it isn't really fully fleshed out.  There isn't enough challenge.  Unless you are grossly incompetent, you won't lose the game, and there is no feeling of dread that you are in deep doo doo and might lose.I do recommend the game and I do find it fun, but after awhile you realize you have reached a point where you have so many resources, you just don't have to worry about nothing and the challenge is all gone.  What the game needs is random events of some type that force you to cope with the unpredictable, or some sort of boss creature that attacks once in a while and might destroy parts of your base.			"

												So after more than 100 hours in game, I can finally make my review: This game is very unique (in my opinion) to the other games. This game MAY be blocky as minecraft, but the textures are detailed, and pretty, with out them being blocks. They do have blocky hit box, but hitboxes aren't that important ;). So beck to the topic. You can build BIG mining operations, and factories, and what not, on pretty much anything. Because of the worlds size that is 200 LIGHT YEARS (or 1892146155423912000 meters !) long in every direction from spawn, you can build what ever. It's kind of hard and challenging to start up, but when you get a bit automated, you are all good (and challenges are fun, right?). Now lets talk about mining. You get an ore extractor, that mines ore veins. Each ore vein is different in size. Some can be up to 32 mil. ore!. That is going to last a very long while. But to do that you need to send power down, and then with conveyors, pipes, ore matter movers, up to the surface and smelt it.Goal in this game (right now) is to kill 4 overminds, with orbital strike. Now there is at least 100h of gameplay. But this is not like factorio (I still love Factorio tho), that you win, and not play anymore. If you win here, you can still do stuff! But if you kill them, nothing will attack you (for now)Now about updates and performance. Well, updates are often, and also you have different ""betas"" to play on, like Bleeding Edge. That is game where is new stuff, that will be put into mainline. But this comes at the risk. You can crash, your world can get corrupted, and bugs. Well, that is why its called ""Bleeding"" edge ;). Preformance is pretty decent. I have 8GB, and this game is in Unity 5, and I use only 40% of memory. FPS are very high, but if you request too much FPS, your world may not load fast.Now final part, the devs. As far as I know. There is one Developer working on this game, DjArcas. He has few other devs to help out. Also he streams on Twitch like 8h STRAIGHT! He shows all the programming, and how he works the game. Also, because Direwolf20 have played this, more people came in :D. But I don't think that DJ is getting enough $$$, for what is he doing. He indeed deserves more. You know, he needs food, and personal things. Also you know how models of blocks can cost?! Up to 10k$! those are some big bucks. But this means, more people = faster game development.So from this review, you can tell that I LOVE this game. This is legit, the nicest comunity, that I ever met. You need help with Game? just post a thread, and people will anwser :). Lots of nice people, and if the thread is something big (sometimes even small), even developers themselves will help you! Actually, they are on 80% of the threads, so that speaks for it self :). Thanks all! Keep it up! "

But backwards compatability is great and he's recently (with one of the beta branches) totaly rewamped the terrain generation making a much more lush and interesting landscape. The developers does stream his development quite frequently and he's usually quite easy to ask for answers for various issues.			"

												Fantastic game if you like building factories and advancing through a tech tree. This is the best mining/crafting/base-building game I've seen yet! At time of writing, there's over 20 hours of non-grindy mining and crafting before you get to the grindy end-game content. It's still being worked on, but the lower tiers of tech are highly detailed and optimized. You won't feel like anything is missing until you get to the end game content.If you liked Modded Minecraft, Space Engineers, Terraria or Factorio, FortressCraft is going to consume your life for about 5 days. Make sure to book time off work and make peace with your loved ones before you start playing.			"

Dev seem really on the ball with whats good and not good content.NOT A MINECRAFT CLONE.. Better in many ways!			"

												Update - I wanted to update my review to note that the vast majority of multiplayer issues have been remedied: I am now able to play the game with my kids without constantly restarting or replacing someone's suit upgrades because of sync issues.  Hooray!This game's been out of early access for a couple months now, but it gets more content in its free monthly patches than a fully supported Blizzard game.  There is an upcoming, 8 dollar expansion pack that I'd gladly pay for (Dev's cat's gotta eat) based on what I've seen thus far.  To anyone confused about the patreon bit: A patreon sub enables a very small handful of cosmetic, VIP ""bling"" blocks if you will, and early access to the expansion.  It's a donation with a tiny thank you; not a sales' offer.My original review, less my comment on multiplayer:Factorio meets Minecraft, kind of like playing feed the beast/Industrial craft mods but with the cohesion of a single dev behind it rather than 100 separate mods in a package that never works or updates quite right.If all of that's greek to you, the game consists of finding raw materials, and constructing the logistics to extract, move, and process them, either into more logistics, research pods, or defenses against attacking wasp things.  The GOOD:Engaging base building gameLots of recipes to craft across several tiers of stuff.Good visual feedback on logistics letting you know what's working or notStill being actively developed (IE more's coming)The BAD:Currently there's very little variety in the enemies that attack you, or your defenses to deploy against them.Gameplay between the last available research and charging the OET (winning) is currently just a huge grind for more power generation.  I expect this gap will later be filled with more interesting content, but were the dev to win the lottery and stop making the game, it'd be poorly balanced in its present state.Overall, I could recommend this game: it's less than the cost of minecraft and basically takes the most interesting parts of minecraft to me and expands them.  WIth the mulitplayer issues fixed I expect this will be a fantastic game to play on LANs or with a small group of friends.			"

												So I've never writen a review but since I love this gameso much I figured why not? Pretty much minecraft and factorio got together. had a baby and named it Fortresscraft. Dig deep under ground, build a base with what you find and defend it from bigger and bigger hordes of enemies. Almost has been getting updated almost every month with new stuff! Easily a 10/10.			"

												Used to play FortressCraft Chapter 1 on Xbox Live and loved that game. I am so glad I can play this on Steam! I can spend hours and hours just building random things. I made a world once where I just blew things up (FUN! i know!). On Xbox the game had a limit you can dig. However, on this game I've dug so much that it could not load in time and had to wait. HAHA My two most favorite features are the creative mode and workshops. I'm not a survival type gamer, I do love to create. The creative mode is the reason I love it so much, I'm not into crafting I think that's too much work just to create something. Gotta love unlimited blocks. The workshop feature just extends the already limitless possibilites. Great game, I highly recommend it for players who love building with blocks! Word to the devs!			"

												A technically complete game that is still being worked on, it's easy to dismiss this as a ""Minecraft Clone"" due to the voxel based game world. But there are aspects of FortressCraft Evolved that blow Minecraft right out of the water (and I really like Minecraft). For one, the world size. It's massive. I have found cave systems that could contain the build height limit of Minecraft, and then some. I have tunneled straight down and have so far gone well past 7,000 meters below the surface level, while Minecraft goes from 0 to a comparatively limited 255.As for the gameplay itself, it can be very technical. You have to build a logistics and mining network to defend your base from attacks, generate power, and be very careful not to feed any near by hive minds.In terms of how long you are playing? Well... I'll admit I'm probably not the best player, but so far I've put in 112 hours and haven't reached the ""End Game"" as of yet.			"

												First thing: This is an early access game, things won't be 100% polished. In the state it currently is, it's extremely addicting and fun to play. You could spend 200+ hours even in it's current state and enjoy every minute. The developer, a single person, continually releases patches on bleeding edge. I'm in the beta (which is a step higher) and even there you get a lot of nice updates still. The core version won't tend to see updates often, so i recommend opting into beta.Onto the review!There is so much potential for this game. If you like minecraft but sucked at building and making things look nice, or like playing with redstone, then you'll love this game without a doubt. It also makes buidling a breeze with the ability to place an entire row of blocks in a single click. I don't usually go out and buy games, espically if I've never head of it. But after watching video's of it for a bit I really became interested. And man it's the best game under $15 i've ever bought. You won't find much of multiplayer quite yet (it's still somewhat of a wip) but there is so much to do even so. The future of this game will only get better. Even if it's current state was it's final state, I wouldn't feel like I wasted my money. So come join, support this game, tell your friends and your free time will never be used for anything else again.			"

												This game has had me obsessed for a couple weeks, and I gather it is still being improved.  However, I'm taking a break from playing it because it is getting tedious.  First, the game puts you on a short leash because of your need to keep recharging your suit.  After a lot of research and obtaining some iron and lithium, you can set up a camp on the surface to charge your suit and Arthur (your advicea and power done), but all the goodies are underground, and it's easier to not get lost if you dig your own tunnels.  There is also a short leash because your one and only smelter can only smelt 100 ore blocks at a time, yielding 25 metal ingots each time, and there are projects you would want to do (like get ore distributed to your doorstep) that require hundreds.  I've spent most of yesterday babysiting my smelter, and doing a little exploration while it's smelting the latest hundred pack.  Expect to do a lot of gophering before you can automate anything.			"

												put factorio and starforge in minecraft, and you get this game. Obnoxiously large world, vast, HUGE expances of caves, like Hang Son Doong big. Think it's just night because you can't see the cieling big. Recreate Dwarven cities big. This game revitalized that sence of wonder, being overwhelmed, and exploration that the first time I played minecraft did. Those that like Minecraft, and are a little done playing modpack after modpack and geeting burned out on it should DEFINENTLY play this game. and come on, it's only $13 (on 2/15/2016), why WOULDN'T you get this game?I must say though, that if your computer is a toaster, it'll get frustrating with the game turning into a slide-show. This game isn't exactly friendly on your ram or proccessing capabilities, but you can drop the detail and graphics WAY down and still have a good time, it'll just look like it was done on the N64. But, normally this game is gorgeous, provided you have the computer to handle it.For those of you who are experienced in minecraft (particularly tech mods) you'll discover that you will be making LOTS of controll based mistakes. Also, you'll have a decent understanding of tech progression, however, it is dificult to know ahead of time what you need to do. I would recomend that you play a few worlds to better understand what to do, and what way you prefer the most to do it. Your first few worlds are likely to fail in your eyes, this is fine, and fixable at just about any time, but you can always start fresh.I would like to see a more comprehensive creative mode, as it does not lend to helping you actually mess around with logistical ideas, and what not, which I would like to see. currently, if you have an idea to use a system, you have to just try it out, which makes experimentation a potentially costly endeavour.The short version is that this game is amazing, and any fan of starforge, minecraft, and/or factorio should most deffinently fork over the cash and get this game. it's not even all that much cash in the first place.

Resource management is a huge deal as well as careful planning of your power systems, ore mining, and item transport systems. Also, as your exploitation of the planet grows, your base starts getting attacked. So you build defenses to protect your base and your precious supplylines.			"

												I don’t normally write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so because this game should really have more concurrent players. I say that because the amount of content in this game is astounding compared similar games.  I’m a long time Feed the Beast player, from the original builds to the newest FTB Expert / Skyblock Expert.  This game feels every bit as complete and getting more content quickly.I originally purchased the game last winter sale and while I liked the game, it didn’t take to me yet, but knew I’d like to come back once some of the bugs have been ironed out.  This has happened in the last 9 months or so and this game will be one of my goto building/tech/factory games.If you like FTB and Factorio, this is the perfect meld of these two types of games.  Give the price the release cycle of FCE, BUY IT NOW and support a developer that listens to the community and updates their games often with quality updates! "

												Many people seem to complain about the game being too grindy or the tutorial being not helpful because it only teaches the basic basics.Many people are apparently not playing the game in the way that this game should be played: by automating everything.The early game can be a really bad and boring grind, but only if you are either sitting at your base and waiting for your ore extractors to dig up some ore and then grab it to smelt it at your base or exploring too much too early and as result of either, not having enough automation going on, which results in slowing the game to a crawl.If you truly feel like the game is far too grindy, my advice would be to look up a tutorial or something that teaches you how to *actually* play.Oh and the latest patch brought a rather large amount of improvements to early game progression to help starting in a new world.The game itself can easily called a 3D factorio, although that would be a bit too simple - Fortresscraft has many features that allow it to be similiar and yet different, such as the world being literally infinitely deep and having massive underground caverns (which make the ones in minecraft look like caverns for ants) to explore.Overall, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to fans of basebuilding, automation and tower defense. (The upcoming expansion will also add tower defense comparable to the Creeper World series, which is great too!)			"

												FCE is a lot of fun in my first 10 hours of play. The feeling of progression is great as you explore, build, and automate. The system building is the part that has hooked me most, but there's no gameplay element that I dislike.My one complaint is that the learning curve seems steep. I had to lookup how a lot of the basics work because the tutorial is so short and doesn't really give you much information. Even now, research options don't always describe what they'll achieve, so I have to search online for more detailed summaries. Contextual help in the game gives some details, but even then it's not always clear.All in all though, this game is worth the learning curve. I seem myself playing this a fair amount going forward. There is constantly new things to do and improve. 10 hours in, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.			"

												I'm loving this game!  For Factorio fans, this is a 3D version with it's own twist.Basically, the game is all about creating factories and the infrastructure around supplying your massive factory.  You'll need to engineer ways to keep the resource supply running and work around the issues which that creates.  Logistics is always a problem ready to be solved in innovative ways and this game gives you the necessary tools for that job.Of course, you will then need to defend your factory from the local fauna which will inevitably be angry that you're messing up the planet.I'd give this game a 10/10 as it scratches that itch so well.

								I could never seem to get into Minecraft.  It always felt dull to me.  Trust me, I've tried quite a few times and friends have gone as far as letting me use their accounts to try and get a good full few days worth in it.  Nope, still didn't like it.  I was suggested to try some mods.  Now maybe it's just me, but if I need to also download some mods to make a game a little more enjoyable, it's already lost me.  Now FortressCraft Evolved, considering I never really understood how I could like these types of games really caught my eye firstly by it's price.  I think the price is too low.  Then by the quality and the world.  I can't fully compare Minecraft to FCE but considering FCE caught me instantly and i played 9 hours the first day straightw, I'd say that says something.Not to mention the lighting effects are beautiful.  For it's price, it's a steal.			"

												This game is like a supreme 3D version of Factorio. It has much more content and takes MUCH longer till your reach the endgame. Having the wohle thing in 3D makes it a much more engaging experience due to how you can also dig up and down.It is very demanding for new players, the tutorial only covers the basic stuff and its up to you to  find out how everything work and wow is there alot of different things to try/figure out. Atleast there is an tutorial now (just got patched in) but its like 20% tutorial and 80% of trying out how the stuff works.Story? not much. You crash land on a hostile planet and you need to make it out alive by building an huge Orbital Energy Transmitter. Thats basicaly it.The game is purely a sandbox game, dont expect any handholding. Dont expect to play 2 hours and make a huge progress. Dont expect to even finish the game under 100 hours.There are differen tier of ores and each new tier is deeper under the ground with new dangers and stuff to discover.If you want to know more or just want to chat about Fortresscraft, just add me on steam.

												Love this game! It's a awesome mix of voxel building, and survival through tower defense.  If you like to design and build large complex machines on a massive scale then you'll like this game.  If you like to manage those machines to get the most efficient designs, you'll like this game.  If you're really into tower defense, you might be a bit disappointed.  There are a good variety of enemies, but generally all you do is build A LOT of guns around your base.  The only strategy that comes into play is keeping them efficiently powered through your machines.To win survival mode, you really need to think BIG.  Expect some of your structures to expand 1,000 blocks away from your starting base (although the majority will likely be within 500 blocks).   A general rule that worked for me is whenever I first build something, I make sure to leave space around it to build 4 or 5 more in the future because it seems like you always need more than you expect.  You'll feel like you have a lot of empty space around, but by mid game you'll be wondering where all that space went.One complaint I've seen people bring up is that they get bored waiting for materials to be crafted.  If you're bored, you're doing it wrong.  This game is all about building big machines to automate production.  If you're sitting around waiting for research to complete - how about using that time to build more power generators to vastly improve research speed?  Don't have the materials to build more power?  Then go explore the world for new ore veins and build more machines to harvest it for you.  You have the tools and resources to build more mines and assembly lines to create more supplies than you know what to do with.My only knock on the game is that a lot of information is missing from the in-game help.  If you want to learn many helpful tips that will take your base to the next level, expect to spend some time looking online or in the steam community pages for information.The positive spin on this is that the developers are very active and are improving the game and adding new items/features on a near-daily basis so perhaps they haven't found the time to finish the help menu or aren't settled on the final stats of an item yet.

												If you like Big Pharma, Inififactory, or Factario you might want to check out this game.Personally I think if you like Kerbal Space Program, Rim World, or Prison Architect you might also like this game.First thing, even though this is a voxel based game, it is far from a minecraft clone. That was the biggest thing that made me hesitate buying it, but I am glad I was wrong about that.The game is far from perfect. There are bugs and annoying things. However, the dev is constantly working on it (and if opt into one of the branches you get nightly updates).In the course of a year, the game will seem like a completly new game with all of the the additional features and content. Yes there is DLC, but there are still free content updates as well. However, even if there was not, you are more than getting your moneys worth with this game.I find it rediculous how peopel will hem and haw over buying this when it is on sale to like $5. If you like the game you get 100's of hours of gameplay (Many players get 1000's of hours). If you don't like it, you are only out $5.The fanbase is supportive enough that many people donate to the dev through Pateron. This is one of those games (like Dwarf Fortress) that will continue to be in development for years. I won't go into the details of the Pro's and Con's or anything like. Plenty of other reviews do that. I will just say to check it out.EDIT:Just a thought I recently had. The 3D FPS nature of the game will mean that setting certain things up will take longer than in games like Factario (even ignoring Factario's blue print system). Thinking about it, I just wanted to emphasise the similarities to Infinifactory.			"

												Nothing but problems.1.) Lighting:The lighting system as it is currently implemented is completely broken.  Bloom effects are amped-up through the roof while ambient/""natural"" light is nonexistent, making this a very dark game - such that it is borderline unplayable.  I cannot begin to describe how difficult it is to see anything while playing.  Reference the attached images and judge for yourself:  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/esvp0oxvj0acs7v/AACsUL_dAlfPxAZReeVmVO2ea?dl=0Depicted is a subsurface coal vane about 1-2 blocks below the surface that has been exposed.  One screenshot shows the coal in natural light, the other with a flashlight directed at it on maximum power.  Also included are screenshots of various tunnels being illuminated by a flashlight on maximum power.2.) User interface:There are very few user-configurable audio or video settings. - No brightness/gamma control - No UI scale control - No key binding (must exit and change within the Unity launcher)In addition, the control scheme is extremely awkward.  It is completely alien to that of any other game, including Factorio and Minecraft.3.) Save time on shutdown:For some reason, this game implements a savefile compression system that activates after you confirm that you want to exit to desktop.  This system will operate for well over a minute before allowing the game to shut down unless you cancel it by clicking ""exit now"".4.) Sound design:The sound design in this game is a bit of a let-down.  It tries way too hard to be a blend of retro-futuristic bleeps, bloops and machine sounds, but ends up sounding more like a bunch of stock files that were tweaked in Audacity.  This is not a deal breaker by any means, but it really helps to make this game feel like a cheap one-off.  (The main menu alone contains audio elements that pop and crackle as they move around, and at least one horribly obvious 60Hz ground loop.)I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone.  I was very hesitant to try it based on the other negative reviews below, but I purchased it for ~$12 w/ DLC nonetheless at the recommendation of a friend.  I will be refunding this title immediately.Caveat emptor.To the developer(s?):  The main problems with your game are not related to lack of features or content.  Your game is desperately in need of usability refinements and technical polish.  When it comes to your UI and lighting systems: Instead of trying to defy convention at every opportunity, take a few hints from other games that have been massively successful.  In addition to everything mentioned above, focus on the little things that make a huge difference - like placing ""tutorial"" elements into dialog boxes, instead of floating them above peoples' heads or behind machines where they will never be seen.System specs for reference:2560x1440 144Hz displayGTX 980tii7 5820k32GB DDR4(All overclocked)			"

												I never write reviews but since this game just became my most played game on steam and i'm still on my 1st map so i think I should share my experience.It's addictive, it's a lot of management, there's always something else to do. Last time I got this deep into a game was WOW 10 years ago. If you got something to do you need to do it right, always think bigger, large scale. I ended up redoing my whole base a few time and it's worth it, it's necessary, if it doesn't work you're doing it wrong, think bigger, automate, optimise transit for you and your ressources.It may not be 100% complete, lots of much wanted helpfiles aren't done yet but I prefer a good game with active work in progress than seeing the end of it. Best indie game ever, much better than most AAA titles, be ready to sink hundreds of hours on normal mode. "

												I have been submerged in the game for a number of days now. I have barely scratched the surface and yet I have about 50 hours on each of two worlds I have created. There is a lot to like here, if you like building games, you get to start from about nothing and work up from there. If you have played Factorio it is kinda like that, and not like it too. I think the research in Factoria can be a lot faster, but then I haven't really automated enough in FCE yet to know if that is true. The 3D aspect is a lot of fun, and the world shaping and stuff just eats up my time. I level hills, fill in valleys, build walls, make neat tunnels, etc. I have never played Minecraft, but my understanding is that the movement and shaping in FCE is much faster and easier. I guess it looks similar but does play very different from my understanding.All in all I have really been enjoying the challenge of finding the ore, building up enough to work to automating getting it to the surface so I can smelt it and then use it for research and more building stuff.I would recommend watching a play through or two on youtube, there are some great folks there. Even though the game has changed over time the mechanics are mainly unchanged so you get a good feel for how much there is to do and to play with!tl;dr I liked it a lot, you should get it.			"

												This is, by far, the best survival game I have ever played. the combination of Tower defense, automation, survival, and exploration is exquisite. Not only that, but the sheer amount of replayability is staggering. Each playthrough is unique not just because of procedural generation, but also because each playthrough is a new chance to try new automation methods, new turret setups, design new power grids, etc. if you aren't very patient or don't like intellectual games, however, this may not be for you. The first play through will take a while, as it takes a while to learn everything, and creating massive mining and manufacturing operations is very difficult, even for a veteran Talos Principle player like myself. The game has a few flaws, such as the fact it is very taxing and creative mode is rather lacking, but other than that it is great. Heck, if you have any questions, you can ask the developer directly by tuning into his daily developement live streams on the Projector Games youtube channel. I give Fortresscraft Evolved a 9/10.

I would like to see even more machinery, more simple ways of getting back to your home base,  something like an overheat once you get to a depth where the tempeture starts to rise, more different reasources, lots more enemys ( I have not seen any within the game), and a larger surface for worlds.

								FortessCraft is a very powerfull building game that does outshine others of the same type, the only downside in my opinion is that the game is hard to understand for anyone who is new to this type of game there is little info and is a bit confusing at first i think if they added some more info and change the menu screen it will be a hit game, my main points that i do not like = Menu is annoying, moving into different rooms with arrow keys does not do it for me i like my mouse.not enough info to get people on the right line, maybe a tutorial that makes people play it standad.on the flip side this is already a good game and it has potential, but personaly minecraft being basic is why i like it so much  i think games like this can end up being ( OTT ) as you can do everything really fast so theres no gain or sence of achivment as the game has done all the work, i do cross my fingers for this game and wish the guys well who are making it - Good luck			"

								I am an avid builder playing things like TA i have massive fortresses for a base.  This game greatly apeals to that building nature. You are given a MASSIVE world to play in and either have survival mode or just plain building [For Now its early access].    You remove or shuffle the blocks that make this world and make a place for you.  Survival leaves you on an unexplored world after your ship crashes fighting aginst the cold  and much more.  Use your Creativity to survive and get the resources you need.  Currently they are working on the base mechanics of the world but it is immensly enjoyable for me with just the basic building parts.  [Note:] This game can take all your pc has to throw at it. I have a celeron using built in video and that runs well enough.  those with massive pc's the game will use as much as it can to render further etc.			"

								When they say ""infinite worlds"" they really mean it!  I decided to test this and built a structure going from the surface (Y:0) and built all the way up to 3,254...  I could have kept going, but let's be honest, that would have been pointless.  So then I decided to find the floor of the world, and dug down to 9,153...  And I could have kept going.  Minecraft's 256 block height limit is put to absolute shame, as this game shows its beefy and well-constructed voxel engine.  I'll admit, I'm going to use Minecraft as my comparison here, because Minecraft is the definitive voxel game to compare to.The game's view distance is comparable to that of Minecraft's 15 chunk view distance, which means you can see a lot.  In Minecraft there's a survival situation which revolves around food.  Currently in FortressCraft Evolved the survival situation revolves around body heat.  You're in a constant struggle to keep yourself cool enough and warm enough at the same time.  Standing in fire makes your body overheat, draining your power cells, and will kill you of heat exhaustion.  Staying underground or out in the elements at night can cause you to begin to freeze, and you can die of hypothermia as well.The game is looking good already in its pre-alpha state, and I absolutely can't wait for the full release.  Normally I'd say ""don't buy this early access unless you're ready to deal with bugs,"" but in this case, the sooner you get it, the less you'll end up paying in the end.  So it's at your discretion, buy now and save, or buy later for peace of mind.Some of the features work, some of them don't, but you'll still find plenty to do in this game.  Better pack yourself a lunch, because you're going to be playing this for long hours.			"

												It starts so well, it is like Factorio or similar factory/base building games, but being in 3d makes it a lot more exciting. The problem is that after a while, you have the basic factory and there is nothing else to build. You do unlock some more objects but they are crafted in a moment and then placed and then you are done. So you are adding occasional new little machines or boxes, but you aren't actually building a base, and you certainly aren't building a 'fortress'. There is really no fortress or base building at all, you just build a basic factory, and then instead of tower defense, you just build 4 lasers and put one in each corner of your base and it kills everything. Later you need to upgrade that by adding a rocket to each corner but you will complete the game like that. There is really no tower defense gameplay in here, no shaping the paths and no multiple tower types with synergy etc. It is just a line of flying monsters that head straight to your core and get killed by lasers when you aren't even there. And even if they don't die, it doesn't matter because there is no penalty for them killing your core. It just regenerates and is back to normal 2 minutes later.The game seems great at first, but it all falls apart after a while and you see how under developed the whole game is. I suggest getting Factorio instead because although that game is 2d and doesn't have the exploring and digging for resources, the actual factory building is more fun, more balanced, and less of a micro management chore. Also the combat is more promising because at least you have to fight back in that game. Also there are a more and better mods, including one that lets you fight back with planes etc. FortressCraft has some mods but not many, and most of them don't do much. You might get a new storage box or something but there isn't anything that adds anything significant to spice up the gameplay. Almost an amazing game but falls short.			"

												What a boring Minecraft clone. You dig, you run up and down to collect stuff, set up automations and start all over again. Blocks seems have no value or meaning, too easy to place or destroy them. I rather go to work in the real world for money instead suffer for nothing this ""game"" I'm not against the concept at all, i just i feel the process is tedious and uninvolving. I do not get the taste to discover something or excited to be alone on the planet or even feel threatened by anything, or experience reward and appreciate the effort. The player just thrown to the middle of some labor situation and takes time to figure out the machines, and what is the benefit to doing this and that. You research but you have no log about the results just unlock the possibility of the thing to use according to its purpose.  A droid hanging around with messages what is often difficulty to read. I still have no idea what the big spider like machine is doing there all the time around. I can keep going on longer on my disappointments, but the main thing is the game just not feel right somehow. So i do not recommend unless you are specially after this type of ""fun"".			"

Basically with conveyors & matter movers just being better i don't understand the real point of them.It seriously needs a blueprint system or something like it to create a planned already built system and you can just make it with the required materials. Example would be to create a mining system for another location and be able to just build it all at once with the required materials(this is where the robots i'm talking about would of been amazing) dev needs to play factorio a bit haha.

												Updated Mar 10th: Green thumbs all around, developer is putting too much effort for me to be a whiner.Updated Dec 29th: Back to a red thumb, survival is just too empty to call this a game.  Still very much ""in development"" even though it's missing the EA tag...Updated Dec 2015While this game is no longer in Early Access, some of it still feels very much ""beta"".  This is not a bad thing, at least not in this instance.  For example, the graphics settings are very basic.  You'll be forced to live with Jar Jar Abrams due to any light source emitting massive amounts of bloom.  So your options are going to be darkness, one light, or blinding nova of brightness.""So what?"" That's pretty much what I mean by still feeling ""beta"".  Don't like music?  Better also not like other sounds, it's all one slider: Volume.  Some other GUI issues pop up, like no exit to menu.  You must always head to your desktop, and since the game has stringent survival mechanics and no pause...well it's either full exit or no bathing.""Just GUI issues?"" So far, that's about it.  I mean there is a lack of content (trees that grow, plants that grow, a sun/moon/sky/weather) But these, to me, are fluff.  The base game is there, the mechanics are sound.  It just needs the finishing polish to make it a full game.""Lack of Documentation"" There is still a big issue with information in game.  You need to craft item ""Thing"" which is made up of items ""A"" ""B"" ""C"" and ""D"".  Item ""A"" is made up of ""B"",""C"", and ""E"".  Item ""B"" is made up of ""E"".  Item ""C"" is made up of ""F"".  And item ""D"" is made up of ""E"",""F"" and ""G"".  Confused?  The help menu helps, but it's just a start.  (Back to feeling beta...)Lastly, I feel the AI is just not there.  I see some slugs, and other minor mobs.  But nothing that screams ""life"".  The planet (always snow, nothing else...) you land on is a dead husk, with aimless monsters.  Again, the mechanics are there they just seem under utilized.No modding that I can find, can't even change textures.  Might need to use a fancy program to edit files though.Anyway, do I recommend the game?  It's hard to say, I really enjoy playing it.  Would enjoy it more if modding was there, or at least information as to how to mod.  Until then, it has plenty of hours worth of content to keep you busy, if you're after a crafting/building game with really bright lights.  So I give it a green thumb, though with my track record with plants it might as well be red.			"

												It feels like playing Factorio, if Factorio were 3D, extraordinarily slow-paced, tedious and unsatisfying in every way.EDIT. I've changed my opinion about this game. Sort of. I still think it's slow and tedious where it should not be, ie, the early game straight up sucks. I still think it's extremely unintuitive, especially when figuring out what unlocks what, etc. That said, the game has improved immensely and there is a great deal of enjoyment to be had in building and automating systems. Don't be fooled by my play time though. If you have a Vive plugged in, the game will launch the VR app and run in the background, and after you exit the game it will continue running descreetly. I didn't realize this the first time and thus the game was running for several days without me playing it. I think my actual playtime is around 60-70 hours.			"

												Great game!  I have 50+ hours at the time of this review and l like that I still have a LOOONG way to go to experience all the content.  The tech tree is quite extensive and feels well balanced.  This is a logistics/base building game, so don't think it's just a minecraft clone because of the blocks.  Completely different gameplay and goals.  It takes actual strategy and planning, and the only way to ""properly"" play is to automate everything.  You should not be carrying ores around and crafting by hand otherwise you're in for a long, slow grind.Edit: update after almost 200 hours of gametime... Still fantastic.  I love the fact that the developer is still actively working on it, continuously adding new features and fixing gameplay issues for free.  Meaning that's not even including the expansion pack.  He listens to the community for good suggestions, but also has a clear direction and reasoning behind gameplay elements.For the price you are getting an absolute steal in longevity and entertainment value.

												While still in the development stage, FC Evolved still provides a plethora of things to keep you occupied while build and advancing your way through the technology tree.I would like to see some more in the way of building materials but with the games heavy focus on the tech and the logistics of collecting resources, I am not sure we will see much improvement on that front.  That is not to say that building is a wasted effort.  With a little bit of creativity and ingenuity you can create some pretty impressing structures and fortresses.   The method of researching new tech through discovery and a later stage Research Laboratory was a welcome change to other methods I have seen leveraged.  I cannot wait to see what awaits for Tier 4 and beyond.The survival mode GUI is still a bit rudimentary but it has been promised by the developers that it will see improvement by the time the game is finished.  A hopper GUI is a much anticipated addition.All said and done, FC Evolved is an immensely immersive game that will provide hours of frustration and enjoyment as you work to gain new tech and build the most epic of fortresses all while trying to fend of the attacks of the local population.I will continue to play and look forward to the further development of the game and happily purchase any and all DLC and Expansion packs to support the amazing work done by the developers.

												Now that it's had a bunch of updates and I don't think the base game is going to change much more without DLC I think I could write a proper review.Still worth a thumbs up, there's hundreds of hours here if you can stick with it. The only criticisms I have are: the inconsistent naming scheme for PCBs and research pods - why not just name them after what they're made from like everything else? the agonisingly slow start - early expansion appears to be restricted solely to add hours played, even though most of it is just waiting for ore to be smelted or items to be researched the boring reliance on tiers, or multiple versions of the same object as a way to increase complexity - having fewer items made from multiple ore types would be better IMOAll of those are easily fixed through modding or completely disappear within 5 or 6 hours (sooner if you know what you're doing).It's pretty smooth sailing from there :)			"

												Fortresscraft Evolved is a very orginal game indeed. Looking for a minecraft clone? Then you're not going to find one here. After many years of running modded minecraft servers, I was quite sick to the back teeth of the game. That being said, I did get this game thinking there would be some similarities and expected to get bored very quickly. This game, quite simply put, is amazing. The developer is nothing short of a genius!The game has you start with afew supplies, after crash landing on an Alien planet. You are given a small tutorial, and then thrown into the deep end. At this point, I went and watched a few episodes of Direwolf20's lets plays. After being educated a little.. I jumped back into the game. You begin by scanning for various ores, and setting up mining equipment. While this is happening you will be also scanning new blocks and plantlife. This accumulates research points which you can use to unlock new research projects and equipment. It's not long past this point, you realise that 5 hours of game time has passed, and you've simply got lost in this enormous game! By this point I had found my first 4 ore types, and had begun building a system of convayors that could fill my smelters on the surface. Research seemed very simple at first.. but another few hours in and I was now constructing a lab and researching new projects was taking several hours at a time. This was ok though because I had so much other stuff to do while this was happening. However.. the bigger your base becomes, the more power you use.. the higher your base threat becomes.. and it's not long before you threat analyser is telling you.. ""Attack immanent!"". Now for those like me who love the tech, and the factory side of the game.. the invading alien swarms will only attack your central hub.. and once it's health is 0, it just reboots. That is unless you're playing hardcore.. and then its game over. So as I went deeper into the ground, I realised just how big this game was. Some of the caves, from top to bottom, were bigger than minecraft, bedrock to sky... I would liturally hold my breathe incase I fell off a ledge, as death meant I would drop all my equipment. So far i've been 1,187 blocks deep.. and everytime I go exploring, I just can't explain the feeling of being so small, in caves so large.. This game is great for those wanting some survival, some tower defence, and some tech. I love all the machines that automate the ore collecting and the minecarts that collect the ores.. the way the power system works, and the defending of my base. It really is very well balanced... and it has just the right difficulty level to keep most playing, and not getting bored.10/10			"

												Automate or perish.This game balances resources just right such that progressively every new item in the game turns into something you'll need hundreds or thousands of and will thus set up automation for producing it. With the ""plentiful"" resource and power settings, nothing feels grindy at all, but even then you will eventually burn through even multi-million ore resource veins, and have to open a second mine for that ore (eg. gold was mine when producing vast numbers of missiles).If you like Minecraft tech mods, this game will exceed anything you've done before.My only complaint is multiplayer, which seems a bit laggy even on a 1Gbps LAN, though I haven't tried tuning it yet.

												This game is phenomenal. Sure it's not perfect but as an avid 'base builder' and 'factory builder' that religiously looks for new and exciting games in this genre FCE has completely taken me over. I have hundreds of hours into this game and keep coming back to it night after night.It does live in the same family with Factorio but it's not fair to either to say they are the same. I'm a huge factorio fan myself but have spent more time in FCE due to cosmetic and the more in depth base building aspects it provides.Give it a try and stick with it, the learning curve is a bit high but the reward is worth it. Once you grasp the basics the mod community is really quite good and there's great additions to the game you can find in the workshop.DJ also works tirelessly on this project and is constantly in touch with the community through discord and his streams, join the discord and ask any questions you may have! The community is always there and always willing to help.			"

Where your primary goal is digging down to reach new materials and research.Overall great game with alot of content for the price!Also I reinforce  one of the reviewers messagesquote ' The dev is also committed to releasing regular significant updates as long as he can afford to, both as free updates for all players and paid DLC aimed at players spending 100s of hours in-game.'Patreons help support him, but many are getting the free content updates. Not all but  a good portion. Please consider to support him in Patreon!			"

												Alrighty then...Fortresscraft Evolved. The one bllindly bought game like some many others has done with so many games.But this one particularly is the cherry on the cake :). With so many already included items and machines,the possiblities for this game is only limited to your time and imagination. Grappling hooks,automated quarries and excavators.Endless conveyors and much much much more... If you are truly into building automated machinery (Minecraft:Industrail craft/Mekanism etc.) or (Factorio) then this game truly is worth a try.Combining tower defence,both on the surface and underground(to protect your resource extracting monster machinery) and combining the creativity of all the Indie/sandbox games out there.First experience?-Spawned in...-Got a fright due to gaint spider robot-Built my first automated copper extractor-Felt like a boss-Found a cave...fell down deep below-Figured out that F was grappling hook-Used it...and died a horrible deathConclusion?10/10 would use the grappling hook again!

												If you like modded minecraft (with tech mods) or factorio then this game is definitely for you, It takes that concept of industrialization, automation, and tech progression and builds on it massively. Not only that, but It also adds some actual threats for you to deal with (we all know that minecraft mobs aren't a threat at all unless you specifically go looking for a challenge) and adds a bunch of cool QOL features like a grappling hook and better building mechanics that improve the experience a whole lot. Yes, as some other reviews have pointed out this game does have its issues, like inconsistent inventory management and sub-par UI, BUT, I think that all of the benefits greatly out-weigh these quirks and result in a very enjoyable experience. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Excellent game, realy. There are a lot of people complaining about bugs and the like , but I never experienced any of this. The game runs very stable, and is highly addictiv.The only problem right now, is that the content overtook the documentation (and the tutorial and the wiki), so the first few hours are pretty though. Once you get the drift it's realy hard to stop. There is just so much to explore and build.			"

												FortressCraft Evolved.. What can I say? Feels like Minecraft/Factorio but plays like no other game on the market right now. It's gameplay is challanging but addicting and satisfying. I usually don't like games where you have to grind so much in the beginning to get ""started"" but for some reason starting a new world feels strangly refreshing, no matter how many new worlds I start. I would recommend this game to everyone I know that likes Voxel building games. 10/10 imho			"

												So I have only played a few hours in enough to get near the end game content. There is plenty to be said for this game. I have heard people consistently compare it to factorio (which i have never played nor minecraft). its got a pretty steep learning curve but there is a pretty decently fleshed out ingame help manual albeit it still doesnt help you in first learning. Best thing to do is watch the streans of youtube videos on this before you play!One of the games more creative solutions is a game option to let the system adjust graphic options based on a framerate you set. This can be annoying at times but it works fairly well in keeping the game running smoothly which is especially useful for older machines.The research and semi tower defense is prob what set this game apart the most.

												Really amazing game, with a very active developer :D I can recommend getting this, and even the DLC to support this amazing game!Game has mod support, which is being improved as time goes on. Quite easy to mod the game to your own liking, if unsatisfied with the balancing of the game. After 500 hours, the game is still offering new challenges, with the newly redo of the Hard Mobs difficulty, whole new challenges appears. The new Casual mode offers a great alternative for those who might not have unlimited time to play the game, with a little boost to early game infrastructure as well! :D Community is very helpful, and the modding community as well.Having completed the game a few times, on different difficulties, I believe the game still have more to offer for me, as there are still machines that I havn't played around with. As well as a major rebalance that I havnt tried myself yet either. A lot of hours for a silly low amount of money. Insanity! Also one of the only games, that I have played, which have enough content and still isn't repetitive, that I have actually been able to stream it. Thumps up from me.			"

								This game is a copy of minecraft but is better in terms of building because there is more peices to use and theres more things you can create, in creative mode the object of the game is to create which is pointless but in survival it has a point to survive and build, its a great game to pass the time if you are waiting for something or someone.overall i like this game but i love building games and ones that have no objective.

												""Minecraft with machines"" is what I'd say if I had to describe Fortresscraft in three words. They look similar and play similarly for the most part.However, FCE is focused on machines, rather than farming. Even in an unfinished state it has significant depth, and the blessing of a dev who is happy to listen and to incorporate ideas from the community. The game has had constant updates since I first purchased it, and I keep coming back after the major ones to replay and see all the new content. It's already great, but once finished it will be fantastic. It's very worth the purchase.*UPDATE*The latest updates have had some issues IMHO. The game is still a lot of fun, but the Frozen Factory expansion is very grindy. The only reason I've kept playing is because I can fire it up at work for 6 hours and leave it alone.There's also a distinct feeling that the developer is no trying to force players into playing a very specific way and thus destroying the freedom that made the game so great in the first place. That's his prerogative as the designer, but that doesn't make it any less disappointing. If some of the more heavy-handed tweaks are able to be turned off in the future, I'll update the review, but that doesn't seem likely. I still recommend the game, but not as wholeheartedly as before.			"

												FortressCraft Evolved, Is a remarkable blend of mechanics coupled together in awesomeness. Its like Factorio and a VERY tech heavy MODDED Minecraft had a baby together but didnt want it, so along came DjArcas and he raised and nurtured this creation into something magnificent......... and he's still making it! He is accepting feedback and development ideas from his discord channel and his twitch streams, I dont know many folks that do this, even in this day and age!Well, the shear magnitude of the game world is breath taking, finding a cavern throwing a glowstick and watching this fall without hitting the bottom, makes your stomach backflip and try to climb out of your mouth, meanwhile trying to navigate and plan routes for conveyors is merely one of several things that you will end up happily wasting several hours and more than one occassion!The progression is fantastic, the way it gets your mind thinking of ways to automate or improve a system. All in all, this is a beautiful game that has more than enough in content for the price as it stands and there is only more to come!!			"

												I really love that this game is worked on constantly by the developer (often literally right in front of my eyes on twitch). I recommend to be involved on the forums and twitch to get the full experience because player input is affecting the game and there is definitely a community here. FortressCraft has a heavy emphasis on logistics, similar to Factorio. It doesn't hold your hand and it certainly doesn't play like Minecraft - so watch a couple tutorial videos and adjust your expectations. It holds a unique experience if you give it some time to grow on you.			"

												I was a sceptic of this game at first. (Thought it would be a minecraft clone. Btw. its not its got the voxles and yes they remind one of minecraft, yes you mine but thats about as close to minecraft as it gets ) then  I decided eh why not its deciently priced for a game ill give it a go. I honestly didnt think i would like this game now im hooked i Dont notice what time it is till its waaaay past the time i need to get off. it is a lil slow in the beginning but once you start getting conveyer belts going you cant stop.So I crash land first time nooo idea what I'm doing. scan some blocks research some stuff find some ore. make trips back and forth to charge power and get ores. thought this is tedious make some belts n laser power no more trips. look for more ores.... WTF im under attack by what ... ooooo i made the wasps mad. set up turrets go back lookin for more ores. died died died some more. ooooo im to cold down here make better gear go deeper. ... how'd i die that time ... oooo toxic fumes..... make more gear go deeper. build lots and lots of more goodies. go exploreing ..... wth almost craped my self when i ran into a giant worm spittin acid.  more turrets ( feels safer .... ) Honestly i could go on and on but theres so much to build / explore n do in this game it would take a long time to explain it all. but if you enjoy crafting / survival / builder games with logistics n factory line setups i would suggest this for you its waaaaaayyyyyyy better than minecraft it just has blocky voxels that look waaaay better than minecrafts anyway.

												Mostly impressed with this game.It seems polished and playable, with good performance.The linux support is seamless.It seems fun and well designed, abit a little grindy (although this aspect disappears as I automate, which I think is the intention).My only complaint is the spiders. They simply walk through your base, which is stupid and obnoxious. It makes me wish I'd played with no creatures, but I hate the idea of a world with no hostiles at all. Seems like the game Minecraft should have been - This game gives you tools to build with, like the developer says.			"

												FCE is a voxel-based game.  That is where any similarities to that oft-compared ""other highly popular voxel-based game"" ends.  The point of FortressCraft is to build your base/machinery/infrastructure, and let it do the work for you.You start out having crash-landed on a planet with with the most basic of machinery.  Your Central Power Hub to produce power, a research station to perform basic research, a smelter to smelt ore into bars, for use in the crafting station.  Selecting the easier resource difficulty levels will also give you a bonus coal deposit right near your CPH with the machinery needed to automate coal delivery right off the bat.You then start finding resource deposits, placing extractors to mine from them, and collecting ore to smelt to then craft the machinery needed to automate that whole process.  As you discover different types of blocks, you can perform research to be able to craft new machinery to work faster or perform other tasks.  Once your basic research at the research station is all complete, you'll need to build a laboratory to continue higher levels of research.Once you've got your infrastructure rolling along nicely, producing metal bars and power at a good rate, your base threat will increase to the point that the wasps start attacking.  Thus begins the tower defense aspect of the game.  You'll need to build a defense network to deal with the bugs.  And, of course, upgrade that network as your research and production levels increase, to deal with increasingly strong bugs.The best part of this game, though, is the developer.  DjArcas is constantly adding new content into the game, and live streams development quite often.  A lot of game developers claim to be highly involved with their community.  And some even live up to that claim.  But Dj is the only one I know of that interacts with his community live on Twitch while he's writing the code for things that he's talking with the community about.  Many of the machines currently in the game are the result of suggestions made while he was streaming development.If you like voxel-based games, city-building games, or strategy games, or any combination thereof, I highly recommend you check out FortressCraft Evolved.

												The game is quite nice if you like Minecraft with automation mods. There's a good number of challenges in the game, including having to defend your base against continuous attacks, making sure you maintain sufficient energy production and making sure your automation lines remain running efficiently.On the downside, the combination of digging, searching for resources, defending and maintaining power easily becomes overwhelming, even if you automate everything! It isn't a game to sit back and relax, and it continuously keeps you busy, which can be exhausting at times. There's not that much to explore and the entire game is quite misty, giving it a bit of a depressing feeling and making it lack scenery worth looking at.Recommended? It depends what you like. I spend quite some time in it and liked to play it, but I believe it isn't for everyone. If you like challenges and automation, go ahead. If you like exploration, you wish to relax or like nice scenery, there are better games out there.			"

												A must have for fans of modded Minecraft and Factorio.Automation from the ground up is aim of this game, so it's good to see a game like this, in it's current state, with the vast array of machines and upgrades it's possible to get. And it's blatantly clear how much there is for the developer to add, this is a game that you will spend well over two days (not two days in real life, but 48 hours in game) on now, come back and lose even more time later, with a bunch of new content.While the tutorial maybe boring and dull, leading you through utter basics, the game features a world gen that is awe insipiring, with canyons carving scars in the terrain and caves seemingly without a bottom. Not to mention a literally infinite world.A gem that I might have otherwise over-looked.EDIT:I will clarify about the games ""status"". It is a FULL release, with active support. It means there are bugs still in the game, but these are patched and fixed by the developer. It is by no means early access, the main game itself is complete, with DLC (coming, as of time of writing) to expand on the current content, not a cash grab. And to be frank waaaaaay too many games use early access as a shield to divert attention away from it's bugs. FCE is different, the dev fixes the bugs rather than throwing ""EA!"" in the face of bug reports. What more can you really expect from a (single) dev who also is adding content, polishing and bug fixing his game all at the same time?			"

When I got back in, 80% of my magnificent castle was GONE! Hours and hours of work destroyed! Now I cannot bring myself to play again....			"

Its like Factario but cheaper and 3d.Ever since mount and blade warband, I find it extremely difficult to play single player games but, this is one the very few games that I give a pass to. It's possible to play multiplayer on this, but doesn't seems like it'd enhance the game very much, unless you had a buddy to regularly play with.			"

												I love this game.It's a steep learning curve, rubbish tutorial, awkward controls and it has a really slow start.But then you stick with it for a while, and the learning curve is conquered. The tutorial is passed in 30 seconds. The controls become second nature, and you learn how to speed up the beginning of any playthrough.It superficially resembles minecraft, but feels more like factorio and big pharma. The dev can come off as mean and facetious, and the community can come across as elitist and sanctimonious. In short, they do not suffer fools. I don't care about that. As long as they keep doing exactly what they do, what resulted in such a great game, I am happy to support them all.			"

												TL;DWTR:It has a steep learning curve.It is a challenge.It is a factory game.You get attacked.You try to endgame.You try to endgame again.If you love slow paced 'crafting/automation' games (like Factorio, but not 1 hour and you're done), with a sense of acheivement when you build that massive (3 dimensional) factory that does exactly what you ask, while you are being attacked, and trying to grow your factory, so you can be attacked more while you try to endgame, then you will very much love this game.It starts slow, and has a steep learning curve, but players who can bear to not have their hands held, will love it.NTL;WTR:I love the Battlefield series of games.I love getting into a fresh round of fast paced action.I love killing those 4 blokes who all came up the elevator at Siege of Shanghai C.And most of all, I hate the fact that players who have all played the game a long time and acquired knowledge and experience in the game think it is their right to ""Always be on the winning team"". Where is the challenge in fighting a bunch of noobies that don't know what they are doing? Where is the fun without a challenge?FortressCraft Evolved is nothing like Battlefield, thank goodness.There is no teamstacking. There is no ""How the f did he get me"". But it is a challenge. And it is fun.I've only owned it for a little bit. And when I first started playing it, I wasn't sure what I was doing, and not much has changed for newbies. Spend a week on making a proper tutorial for new players, and the player base may just grow.The primary developer does listen to community feedback. Heck, he even ASKS for it. Sometimes he downright ignores it. But few times has the primary developer's actions been detrimental to the enjoyment of the game.My experience of my playthrough currently (And all my time 187 hours is devoted to one single game)Start off.WTF am I doing?Oh, I get it.I don't get it.Need more power.Need more ore.Need more bars.Need more power.Researching cool stuff.What is that thing in the corner of the map.I won't do that again.More cool stuff.More cool stuff.Make  un-cool stuff do cool stuff.Still playing around.

												I bought this in early access and (at least I think this is the game I remember) I hated the movement (getting pulled to the center of a block when stopping).  It bugged me enough to not give the game a chance, and seemed more like a creative mode minecraft at the time with some fast building tools but I wanted a survival mode.  Uninstalled and didn't touch it again.  I believe that was December 2013.Then recently the Frozen Factory Expansion came out and took another look at the game (and apparently all the updates to the game over that time period added a ton to the game).  Amazing.  Like minecraft and factorio mashup but better looking, fast digging and building tools, lots of machines to research, every block type has to be scanned, super fast travel with the grapple, using lasers to send energy to remote excavators.  Been playing and watching ""flexible games"" play this on youtube.  I'm hooked just like when Minecraft and Space Engineers first came out.With the current sale I bought another copy of the game and the DLC for a family member to play with.  Edit - And because I have fallen in love with this game, just bought a copy full price for another family member, but they are going to have to earn the expansion by playing the game.I read on the forum someone running out of RAM while playing.  He has 6000 machines.  I have maybe 20 machines and can barely keep up.  This game is about automating your assembly lines.Wonderful game.Edit - 25 hours in and now I am finally ""getting it.""

												tl;dr It's tough recommending this game, but the bottom line I think I've got my money's worth and I think you probably will too.Pros:+ Great game concept. Cons:- Progression is broken. This game is about automation, but buildings' prerequisites and research requirements are set up so that you WILL spend hours grinding through things manually, and you WILL spend hours waiting on unavoidable bottlenecks. The game fights you every step of the way- UI is broken. There's so much information that's not presented to the player (eg what research does), or presented in one of multiple places. There is a contextual help, but it really needs to be fleshed out to fill in huge gaps.- Mobs are completely uninspired. Wasps will fly without stopping directly to the heart of your base, only attacking a single structure (the one that gets less and less important as the game progresses). There's no strategy to defense aside from supplying power to however many turrets it takes to kill the enemy.- Low quality models and animations. Not super important considering the above points, but jerky conveyor belts sending items through each other, guns and enemies shooting globs of goo through walls, and everything else is just kind of distracting.Those are some pretty massive cons for a game with only one pro, but I've got 38 hours in this game and only spent $8. Buy it and play it while watching TV or something. Or don't buy it and just play Factorio.			"

												This is a game that requires investment of time and effort. It's not for everybody, it doesn't offer a steady dose of action packed mini achievements and it isn't something you just pick up and go, before you reach the end you'll have put in around 200 hours into it and it's said that the Frozen Factory expansion adds another 100. And that's not counting the time you spend outside the game planning your base if you're like me.Most of the time in this game is spent building stuff and setting up elaborate pipelines so you can ... build more stuff. You can avoid the automation but then the game gets grindy, plus it's becoming harder and harder (both because of extra limitations to push people towards automation and because barriers to automation are removed so it's always the easier option).The game isn't very hand-holdy. It purposely drops you in a situation with fairly little guidance outside of the first few hours and leaves you to your own devices. That said, recent changes like the mission system have made things easier by pointing out short and long term goals.The developer is active and about once a month there's a big patch. Usually that means extra functionality too, new machines and/or new abilities. Often there are some nerfing changes that force you to rethink some things, a bit annoying at times but ultimately for the better (or so one hopes).I've had this game since it was in early access and it has really gone a long way since then. Back then it was a nice demo which showed a lot of potential. Now it's a downright good game that's getting better every patch.			"

It takes a long time for slow adjusting, extremely casual gamers like me, to do anything, we dont start with guns that have infinite ammo that do a small ammount of damage, we have to research how to craft stuff when the stuff we start off with makes stuff for us.We are on a uncharted planet in this! We are in SPACE! We should have blueprints that help us survive from hostiles, and provide us with electricity! And the creative mode is awful, it is extremely hard to tell what item is what. The tutorial doesn't help very much, it just tells you how to power your base, mine, craft, and reserch better stuff.Overall, I don't reccomend this game.			"

Difficult to figure out but no problem in and of itself. The whole control set is not intuitiv in my opinion. The real problem is that multiplayer didn't work and this is what i bought it for. Tried to connect to friend and got kicked to packet loss. I had no packet loss (we checked through wireshark and different routing, vpn and stuff, which was really not our job :/ ). Once the error message occurs it stays on yout screen leaving you no choice but to alt+f4. Tried several times.

												Excellent game! I haven't played a game this much since... well, I can't even remember when. Vanilla WoW maybe? Anyway, if you like games that make you think, solve puzzles, build and automate a myriad of machines in any way you see fit, all while trying to defend your base from almost constant attack, this is the game for you. This is a challenging and rewarding game that keeps me coming back almost every day.The Dev is honest and keeps the content coming. Can't give him enough props. Great work!			"

								Excellent start for a promising game. Moving from the xbox chapter 1 version there are some things lacking in comparison. I cannot wait to see where this ends up. DjArcas puts alot of effort in his game and the core community is very focused on making this game one of the top voxel games out there.			"

												Its time for an actual reveiw!Projector games, you need to stop changing the game into something where progression becomes linear and boring. The game needs a faster start to get players hooked, as at the moment I find the game is very slow at the start.On the other hand, the tower defence aspect is very fun and the building and planning of your factory is fun. Exploring is also exciting because of the amount of new things you can find.Scores (Out of 10) :Diversity : 4Gameplay : 7Design : 5Exploration : 8Innovation : 6Value for money : 6Average score for all : 5.2Its sad to see one of my favourite games fall.Projector games please change this.

												So i bought this game and all its dlc for 75% off during the halloween sale and i had been looking forward to this game, ive seen positive reviews, videos and being promised this game would run fine on even a low-end system. Basicly i expected something of a 3d Factorio. I bought factorio and absolutely loved it and i thought this game will be great. So when i finally get in the game i'm met with 22 fps and i think ""maybe i have to enable high-performance graphics card on this one""Sure enough i was back in the game and there's still 22 fps but only handles alittle better settings. And after the tiny tuturial the game had i was stuck at the outpost not knowing what im supposed to do. I powered the drill and i got the coal, the field went down and the tutorial pop-ups stopped coming. Afraid of the two hours of limit incase i had to pull a refund on this i stopped trying further and came here to ask for help if theres any way to make this thing run better and if there is an actual more detailed tutorial that would get me used to all the new keys that i would have to take a look at from the settings every few minutes, i feel dissapointed But i really dont want to pull a refund on this so i would really like some help on this matter.

								For those of you who's initial thought is ""this is Minecraft in another form"", this is not true. The only thing it shares is the ""block building"". Vanilla MC does not have process automation such as mining ores, ore processing, power distribution grids and so forth. I've played both and they each have their strengths. Even though the game is in early access, the devs are very active in both updates and in the forums. I'm happy to be part of the group who are playing this game as it matures into a polished, completed product.I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.			"

								The game is very similar to minecraft, however gameplay is a little diffrent as is mining and crafting.  Make sure to read instructions on how to play, it can be a little confusing at first. Digging is a lot faster and you do not need to make tools.  The game focuses mostly on creating automated resource managment.   The game is really fun to play and I am looking forward to seeing what they are going to do next.Pros:  Digging and block placement is easy and fast, you get a Grapple gun, can create elaborate automated mines. Cons: Graphics is a little off, not many blocks in the game yet, no multiplayer yet. "

												This game is alpha at best. Doesn't say early access on the steam page though. Buyer beware...The graphics and sound effects and music are all very amateur and at times downright glaring and annoying. Some graphics are completely out of place  in the game compared to others.The survival game experience is completely unbalanced, certain resources such as power are massive bottle necks with almost no upgrades for a very long time. The difficulty settings to make survival have any point have a massive gap between too much and too little. If you want there to be ANY reason to defend your base against raiding bugs, you have to play in hardcore mode with permanent character death, which will happen in some cheap, unavoidable way at some point. Otherwise, your CPH being destroyed just means it respawns 10 seconds later. You can completely ignore the tower defense part of the game until end game when you are trying to complete the ""win"" condition.The game has potential, and maybe in a year or 2 it'll be where it needs to be to be a complete game. For now, just play Factorio or Terraria			"

								Fortresscraft is a fun game in the places it works, but there's a ton of emphasis on that, because there's a lot of places it simply doesn't. Because it was originally made for the Xbox, the controls on the PC feel terrible and stiff, and the frame rate is consistently below 6o fps. This could be just me due to not having a high processing power but while I had Skyrim on my PC, it was never as bad as how this game performs here. Building is slow and I feel like the UI is far too much of a struggle to put up with. Furthermore, this game is still in early access even though it's been in development for more than two years. What has hindered te development this long, I really can't imagine. I enjoyed what I could do when it worked, but I feel like compared  other titles of this genre *coughcough* Minecraft/Terraria *coughcough* Fortresscraft doesn't add up in end. Not every game can and should be like the rest, but it should at least live up to the standards set by it's competetitors, and unfortunately, FortressCraft Evolved really doesn't do that.			"

												Fast version:  This game is slow, the temperature mechanic is interesting but frustrating, the game is complicated in a non fun way, building things is okay and the monsters are annoying in a non fun way.  Everything is constantly in a state of waiting on everything else, playtime is the devs #1 selling point. Get factorio instead.FortressCraft Evolved is like factorio mixed with minecraft.  With all the cons of both.******************************************************************************************Complexity******************************************************************************************Factorio gets its complexity through simplicity.  FortressCraft gets its complexity through complexity.Factorio has these eight raw resources: wood, coal, iron, copper, stone, oil, water, alien artifacts.  Very different and used for different ends; of these most everything is done with: iron, copper, oil.  Simple, it becomes complex as your create new resources.FortressCraft has 14 (? by the wiki) ores alone, each one can be turned into plates, wires, coils, pipes, and PCBs.  It also has 13 (?) other resources which you find, they can be very hard to find based on your starting seed. (Organic Rock I am looking at you).  FortressCraft also has 11-13 (?) items dropped from mobs that you need to collect.I will start with my frustrations with organic rock.  You need organic rock to make smelters, why? I have no idea.  Organic rock is sometimes found in caves.  Caves are dark and cold.  You only have so much battery to keep yourself warm and the cave lit, so bring 1000 torches made from coal they provide light and warmth.  But don't stand too close or they will begin to overheat your suit, stand precisely something like 1.5 blocks away from it or it is worse than not having one.The first time you look for organic rock it will be easier as you can scan for unknown objects, not all of them will show up but hopefully a couple will.  As a new player instead of collecting all of them you will likely be like, ""wtf is this weird thing, i'll scan it for the research when I get back.""  After this there is no organic rock scan to use later.All this to make a couple smelters.  But smelters also require tin plates and Basic PCB (the copper ones) and all the dependent research.  See the problem.  Fortunately the game starts you off with one smelter you can use, that will deliver you the high throughput of 4 bars per minute at a 4:1 ore to bar ratio.  This leads to maybe being able to make a smelter within the first hour of playing.  Don't worry you will definitely be mining enough ore with the extractors provided. The game will constantly bug you to improve the extractors and also bug you that they are constantly offline as they are backed up. If only I could smelt all this ore.You will be manually running around fetching ore for several hours as conveyors require a copper bar and a tin bar per square. 2 bars each, 2 conveyors per minute, need hundreds of conveyors to connect mines to smelters.Then you need to build the machinery to make plates, wires, coils, PCBs.  Keep in mind storage is very hard to come by as hoppers are very expensive early on, so you can't just build a storage bin for each of these materials immediately.Now you can make the research lab (if you didn't accidently spend all your research points on everything else and screw yourself permanently.)  The lab itself takes a lot of copper, but smelting copper is trivial right?  That isn't the problem with the lab though, the lab can consume 15000 power per second (pps) and the assembler can consume something like 500-1000 pps.  Up until this point power has been trivial, an extractor takes roughly 2 pps, the smelter takes somewhere around 5-10 pps.Do not connect your lab directly to your central power hub, it will take all the power just to charge its own internal buffer.  To combat this you need to make more power generators and energy lazers and probably make a new coal mine at this point, so while you are waiting on the metal to set this up, you are waiting on the lab to finish its research, also did I mention that about now you are going to get attacked, better build turrets.  Also did I mention that your lithium mine will probably have a bunch of plants eating all the ore on the conveyor you built, better build some more turrets and batteries and lazers to power it all.  But you need those for the lab too, better get more smelters going, but guess what your suit also needs all that power so you can find more organic rock without dying of hypothermia.  Also you can't leave your base because a bunch of wasps are attacking and they don't seem to stop coming and you need that lithium to build those batteries and the purple plants keep spawning and you need to shoot them too.So you run around killing wasps, trying not to die from hypothermia, out of research points, making sure lithium isn't getting eaten, and collecting metal bars so you can hopefully do something is this silly game.You have now been playing for ten hours.******************************************************************************************How it fails******************************************************************************************It is so hard to explain how needlessy complex and slow this game is.To pull from minecraft and factorio, the furnace is made out of stone blocks.  It makes perfect sense, the limiting factor is how much ore I can find.  Which leads to needing more furnaces, which leads to more ore, etc.  It is an exponential that I want to ride up.To mine something in FortressCraft it needs an extractor, lets assume we have those.  They need power, each one needs at least a basic laser of power.  Lets assume we have those.  They each need to have line of sight to that laser or have batteries to connect them all and the laser needs to be powered likely by another laser.So what should happen is I run back and forth making this mine amazing and making my smelting amazing too.  But you are bottlenecked constantly.  Your new basic smelters will take 8 ore per bar, so we need about 4 extractors.  Which is 4 basic lasers, which is either going to be some crazy triangular setup to keep line of sight or you are going to need 16 ish batteries.  For each of the three basic ores, maybe more lasers for lithium as it is found deeper underground and more everything for copper as you will need a lot.That many lasers just isn't going to happen early on so we will need to upgrade.  Good news there is a better type of laser available early on, the MK1 laser is 10x stronger than the basic laser.  So we can just point one in that direction easy.  Next the conveyor belt can only carry one ore at a time, so perhaps we need to use normal conveyors instead of basic conveyors but replacing the conveyor is being bottlenecked by the very smelting we are trying to upgrade.  So lets just smelt the bars right at the mine its an 8:1 throughput increase.But each smelter takes a full MK1 beam of power, now you are running multiple MK1 lasers to your mine and you have the same problem you had before.  Plus smelters stop working at lower elevations (for some reason?).FortressCraft is like 4+ seperate linear functions instead of one happy exponential.  And once you finally decide to stop increasing one of those functions none of the others can increase either.  For myself it was power for the lab, I just stood there feeding plates, PCB, and research packs into the lab for hours.  It was already running 10 power generators out of energy, even at that my 1 million coal mine was already draining faster than I would like.It is always the same answer: There is a solution to that, that you can't make.  I can't even talk about how research works as I am out of space. Basically you scan unknown blocks, there are only so many unique blocks in this game.			"

								This game is in early alpha and might be a lot of fun, when it is completed.At the moment however, it lacks the simple design of its predecessors (i.e. Minecraft?) which left me cursing several times.It all starts with a rather buggy menu - there is a small camera driven animation which hovers in front of several signs....which - unlike any current games - do not light up when the mouse hovers over them.Getting into a single player mission is even worse because you have to click the empty space in the middle of the screen (no text or anything like that to actually tell you to do so).When creating a world, the dialogs appear unresponsive. (you click the button - wait for a second or two, click again, ... until you are thrown into the world)In game there are some nice mechanics, namely the survival against the wild system. (your suit keeps you warm on a frozen planet and if its power is fully depleted, you die after a short time).But in my opinion, this is one of the biggest flaws at the moment:There is a brutal world out there, trying to kill you and you have to fight it from the very beginning - without much help or direction from the game.While several games have recently tried this ""do what you like and see what comes of it!""-approach, this game has you fighting for your life from the very first moment and thereby hinders any attempt at  a shallow start (again, think Minecraft: hacking away at those mud-cubes, only to find out they're almost worthless - but you didn't die from that and could switch over to actually mining something useful)However, there are too many unexplained phenomenons to actually rush into this game without any knowledge.After reading a few guides it might start to make sense that you should simply search for coal to power your equipment - but if you've yet to read those guides you might spend the first attempt at survival cursing.Simply because you start with several fancy technologies in your inventory and can't place them or know what to do with them in the first place.Then there is the awkward mining process - it feels counterintuitive having to repeatedly press the mouse button to mine. (why can't I keep it pressed like in Minecraft and it simply keeps mining?)I'd say its got potential once several flaws are fixed.But at the moment there are simply too little hints to actually get started and enjoy the game without reading several guides.

								--Update 8/15/15--Dev warns Steam users not to purchase game.""DjArcas ‏@Fortress_Craft Aug 13Review : ""You should not have released this feature until it was 100% bug-free""YOU shouldn't have bought an Early Access game. ¬.¬""---FortressCraft could have been a really great game, but I cannot recommend it in good faith. I say ""could have been"" because development has all but stopped, even though it's still in Early Access. There are currently game-breaking bugs, such as segment loading/saving errors that result in lost items/constructions, invisible walls, unloaded blocks, etc. Sometimes half the world just doesn't load and everything you've built gets deleted. What is FortressCraft Evolved?There are two modes: Creative and Survival. Creative is the same as any other generic Minecraft clone. Survival is a bit more interesting, and it's where I spent most of my hours in-game. The premise of the Survival mode is a mix between Factorio and Minecraft, where your mission is to basically collect resources and build infrastructure with the end goal of...automating the collection of resources to let you build more stuff. There are ""plans"" to include enemies/combat to give a bit more of a challenge for players who don't just want to mine. Right now exploration isn't that fun. It's a fairly bleak surface world with repetitive caverns below.Why Should I NOT Buy This Game?Game-breaking bugsLack of updates from dev teamPoorly thought out game elements (e.g. The math behind power delivery is completely broken. When you connect batteries, they do not share power instantly, it ""leaks out"" over time. Even with fully upgraded lasers, which transfer power from object to object, it's impossible to fully power the most advanced types of objects currently in game, such as MatterMovers)*Fairly boring/lack of content after first few hours (Granted, that would be fine for any Early Access title, but this game has been in Early Access for YEARS now and has completely stalled)*Note: Some of these issues have been fixed by a third-party mod, called LazyMod. Yes, a player made fixes to the game that the developer wouldn't/couldn't. The game Developer then asked the mod author on a Steam forum how he was able to manage these things...that's a bit disheartening. Why Should I Buy This Game?You enjoy automation/upgrading/resource collectionYou don't mind weird glitches, placeholder graphics, or reverting game save filesYou want to support an independent developer who has, in all honesty, probably lost interest in the game "

								this game isn't bad for when you just want to build stuff. I bought it because it was on sale and I'm liking it, the only really annoying thing (other than the bugs but it's still being worked on) is the music. it likes to play at random times and then cut out for 5 to 10 min. I would prefer to have it stay on since hearing nothing but your build gun and machines running (if you have any) gets kind boring.....overall not a bad game			"

								With the sale of 66% in the summer, def worth $2.71. I couldn't resist giving it a try. if you've ever wanted to buy minecraft and not pirate it so you can go on servers but never have the money of 26 or so dollars, this game is a great time for you and your friends to play and be cheap. And there is the workshop, which allows you to make blocks the way you want them to be. pretty cool aye? Myself i do own minecraft legitly and i do own totalminer, castleminer, and fortresscraft on the 360. FC was my least fav because it was the last one i got and it just felt like castleminer. But it has obviously changed with so much to do in it. I'm not sure if this game is worth $7.99 yet, there are bugs and stuff, however that price is like 2 drinks, gum, and chips at a gas station so go right ahead and put hours into this game if you like. But for the sale of $2.71, def worth it imo.EDIT: Having played even more, it is WORTH $7.99!!!!			"

												Tried the game again, thought I might want to try the expansion. There is some new content but the performance has decreased. I used to run on a GTX 970 and I recently upgraded to a GTX 1070. Framerate drops down into the 40's with an average around 60. Framerate glitches and stutters consistently, on a 4790k @4.7k.This is a great example of a very poorly optimized game from a struggling developer trying to pay his bills. He is baiting you in with ridiculous grind time for minimal content. He hides additional content behind Patreon support. It's cute that he has gathered a small, mediocre following to manipulate into paying his bills.He is also Steam's most condescending, arrogant and patronizing developer. Which is remarkably self-defeating due to his narrow skillset.Enjoy ;)			"

												Yes this game is worth 13$. Yes it has what is say's it does, and yes its on a massive scale. I would say though that i feel its still in EA and early at best. They rushed it out to draw in people who wont buy EA games, now that they got some $ they are doing upsates faster and more often than before. Odd i know and kinda lame to be honest, but atm they are working hard and adding features that needed to be in before it was released and shipped as a finished game. Its defenitly a game for the more builder/factory type than a base defence and survival game. Really it should be billed as a mining game with a processing/manufacturing core gameplay. The AI is lame and there is some (4) hostile creatures and the survival is limited to a power resource you need for your space suite. Beyond that its a blast and is really shapping up to be great. I say but it for 13$ and if you get 40-60hrs out of it its a win. Small side note that did turn me off. One of the Devs of this game liked and reviwed the DLC. Why is that problem u ask? well the DLC is basicly a way to give them another 4-5$ for basicly 4 block skins and some ""dapper"" skins for your AI robot buddy in game. The DLC description was basicly ""help continue to fund us adding in features that should already be in the game"". So why would the Devs be likeing and reviewing the DLC? to give posotive reviews of course. Sad rly but the game is cool and cheap			"

												My primary reasons for enjoying this game are that unlike modded minecraft, this game was designed from the ground up to support these complexities. As such, you can create large numbers of machines (with animations) working in one area without the performance issues minecraft encouters. Also, the multi-tiered ore system is enjoyable, with different environmental hazards at different levels making digging deeper interesting.The downsides I find with this game are primarily in its aesthetic. There are no biomes excepting the default snow/hill template. This makes the surface world uninteresting to explore. Also, the lighting effects need some tweaking as they reflect off of machines/conveyors in odd ways and make playing the game at night, or attempting to make the factory indoors less enjoyable.			"

Not sure what good the little ARTHUR is but don't worry about him being on fire.  In the beginning there is nothing you can do for it until you start refining ore.  Overall good game, would like to see more research options, early ladder options would be very nice.  Until you make the jetpack it is a pain in the butt making stairs everywhere.			"

								This game seems to get a lot of crap from other players, and I see what they see. However, with a little time, reading, and work I actually started to have fun playing this game. The confusing interfaces, controls, and something else about the general feel of the game is outputting, and when I first launched it, within 10 minutes I slammed the book shut and stored it on a high shelf. But I gave it a second chance, this time more open hearted. The game is playable and fun, you get to mine, use the resources, build machines, and expand. You just need a guide to do so. The interfaces? Very counter-intuitive and inconsistant. Overall the game is rather well done, has room for improvement, uses a great concept I'd love to see more of in gaming (automation of resource refinement), but just has some painfully rough edges. If the developer(s?) would devote one long, productive day solely to interface enhancement and a bit of easier to understand starter stuff, then the game would feel a lot better. Also, remember, this is early access! It definitely feels it deserves this flag, and I hope it can fix these issues. If so, this game can definitely be something great in my library.			"

								I really want to recommend this game, but I can't.  Writing this review, I can't decide if I should recommend it or not.Pros:-Voxel is always fun.-Building tools allow building large structures without much work.-Developers seem to care about their players, replying to reviews and all.-A TON of blocks. Even dozens dedicated to building lunar and space stuff.---------------Cons:-More demanding than most voxel games, due to shaders.-Some things just don't fit in (e.g. the weather staff's mesh that controls weather is nice and smooth, but it's a voxel game.-Annoying robot flies around telling you what block you have in your hand.------------------------I know that this game is early access, so I know it'll all get better.

								     Do you like Voxel based games? Do you enjoy hardcore-esc environments? Do you enjoy standing by a lamp, hoping you won't die of hypothermia? Then this is the game for you! In it's mechanics, it is kind of like minecraft. You need to mine to collect ores. But it isn't just ""Punch tree, get wood"". You need to loacate your crashed spacecraft. You need to fend off againts enimies. You need to stay warm, to prevent hypothermia. You need to cool down, so that you don't get heat stroke. No matter what it is, the game can prove to have difficulty. You can't simply afk and let all of your ores melt, you have to sit in just a precise place, so that you don't overheat, or freeze.     But, it's not all hard. The game also serves with a small robotic friend(Who needs power, go figure) that helps you out. He doesn't do much, but he can keep your suit powered, so that you can maintain your heat levels. You can explore giant underground tunnels and caves, with boundless possibilities! You could simply enjoy walking around on the surface of the planet.     I reccomend this game. Not because I play Minecraft and other 3D voxels, but because it has good mechanics. Sure, at first the game is confusing, but aren't all games confusing before you learn how to play them?			"

												Epic game.  Quite feature-rich and playable, while still being in active (and community engaged) development, yet designed with the innate desire (I would say promise, if this wasn't the world of software with its ever-emergent unknowable bugs) that its development will never force a world reset.  The dev is on the forums almost daily, actively engaging with users re: feature tweak/addition suggestions, bug reports, balancing issues... rather than buying a buggy in-development game and getting cryptic or dismissive responses to your suggestions/issues from the obvious PR arm of things (as opposed to the techies who know what the bleep you're talking about), you're buying Minecraft-esque access to a living, /thriving/ beta version, with much less endemic issues than Minecraft, ALONG WITH front-row tickets to real-life large-scale game development unfolding in front of your eyes.And, it is incredibly well-optimized when it comes to visual/computing-resource playability.  My favorite feature of the game, far and away, is found not in the gameplay, but in the settings menu: click a checkbox, set your target framerate, and the game will take ahold of the quality and render distance settings in order to keep you achieving that.  In a frenetic base with umpteen-gazillion things going on, it'll automatically turn down shadows and maybe kill the render distance - just like our IRL brains would tend to focus on a small subset of the goings-on in a real hectic factory - while during landscape exploration, you can get the voxel equivalent of Skyrim's brilliant vistas.  (Hint to DJ: World-gen structures of awesomeness maybe?)Geeky stuff aside, the gameplay... wait, never mind about ""geeky stuff aside.""  If you just want another alien shoot-em-up with resource management and base-building mechanics in the tactical background, then this game isn't for you.  If you want a tower-defense game where mobsKilled is proportional to resourcesAvailable through some arcana, this isn't the game for you.  If you want another (Modded) Minecraft, where you have the option that the base can be there just for aesthetics, or for helping you The Player become the Great Lone Warrior and Loot-Collector of Your Infinite Domain (not that many take this option, but from some of the forum posts, quite a few do), this isn't the game for you.BUT, if you want a game that blends ALL these elements, plus ever-present environmental factors, automation systems that would appeal to Rube Goldberg and Henry Ford alike, and a strong requirement to Go Forth and Explore... then as long as you can handle the irreducible complexities of such a system, this IS the game for you.  This is the game for the MacGyvers of Minecraft, the Fords of Factorio, the Kings of Kerbal, who want to apply their problem-solving, epic-failing, and grand-constructing skills to an infinite-yet-efficient landscape and a stable-yet-expanding game mechanics platform (with official modding support much closer than with Minecraft).  If you're geeky, 10/10 would recommend.			"

												earlygame is VERY slow because you can only get 1 slow smelter for all your ores you can upgrade it but its still slow you can also craft a ""early smelter"" but it uses x2 the ore and is really slow and it takes 5 machines just to craft it so its not avalible very early you need to be able to craft the Real smelter sooner			"

												FortressCraft Evolved is definitely a game that can absorb a lot of your time because of how expansive and intricate it is.  And that's a good thing!  I find myself constantly experimenting, changing, and iterating my systems to take advantage of new tech or just to maximize efficiency.  As of this writing, I have 200+ hours in game and I plan to at least tripple that.At first glance, it might look like Minecraft or Factorio.  But this game is much more than that and really isn't comparable.  This game rewards efficient, scalable design, not one-off systems.  You can do many things by hand, but eventually, everything must become automated.  And that is a good way to understand the game.  You must automate everything.For the price, this game is definitely worth it.  I've spent more on games that I've played less.  Additionally, the planned expansions sound exciting and definitely something I will want to play.My recommendation: if you like designing or building systems, this game is a must-have.Quick update: I'm now well over 400 hrs in game and still loving it.  The developer continues to add to and improve the game with more great features.  This is a fantastic game.			"

												Great Game! Wish there was a survival mode with infinite stuff in inventory so you can just explore and play with stuff just for fun. It does not make sense that it stays cold throughout the whole game except in the magma layer. it is really weird. in real life after a certain depth, the deeper you go the hotter it gets. I can't wait till water and realistic liquid physics are added. Can't play this game easily because of difficulty of crafting and stuff. but I have been watching vids of the game and it looks awesome so far and it has a lot of potential. needs some changes regarding temp. and stuff to make it more realistic. Survival needs a mode where everything is already crafted and put in inventory so we can just have an exploration mode with all the biomes, survival elements, and enemies of survival, including the nova, and you can still die in this exploration survival mode. I noticed dripping water sounds underground, water can't flow if it is 10 below C.  I noticed sandbox mode does not have biomes and stuff, and it is so LAME! sandbox mode should just be in the survival world. Be ready for a LOOOG time crafting and seeking stuff out, and building a base, here is a tip. watch some youtube vids about this game so you can learn tips and tricks, and get base ideas. This game is a good buy, if you can get into this game and start enjoying it, you will have HOURS of playtime. in my opinion exploration is the best aspect of the game.			"

												An amazing game!!I have put a lot of time in the last few months into this game and keep coming back to it almost daily to try new strategies and to see what dev has added to the game (which is done almost daily).   I have never personally experienced a game that had such an open forum for the development of a game.  As a long time game player from games back to Everquest, WoW, Minecraft, etc (and even back to the days of Zork and before) I can't remember ever having the opportunity to give feedback on something and have it actually become a part of the game.   (Don't expect every idea you come up with to be implemented, but if you have a well reasoned and thought out idea you stand a shot).Fortresscraft takes some work.  If you are looking for a game you just start up and have it hold your hand all day while you mindlessly hit a few keys, then this might not be the game for you.   But if you like a challenge and are looking for a game that is constantly evolving and growing, a communitity of players who will help you if you have questions, and a game where you can go online and watch the developer streaming as he builds new game content then you may want to consider this.I am addicted to the game and although I have a lot of hours of play time I am nowhere near completing it.   Like the old saying goes, ""it isn't about the destination, it is about the journey"".   The journey of playing Fortresscraft Evolved for me has been a blast.   I only wish every game I had ever purchased had given me so many hours of fun and enjoyment.			"

												Absolutely love it!  I've been hooked for more than a day now, and I love everything, even how grindy/lengthy unlocking new tech is.  My only real complaint is that ARTHER often flies too far away from you to give you a charge, and if I want to lure him close enough to get a charge I have to spin in a circle just to get a little more energy.  Aside from that, great time killer and really challenges players to think logistically.			"

												Well... What do I have to add compaired to the other reviews? I have nothing else to add, really.This game is for those people that don't want a short game that they can play over a weekend. You'll find yourself putting in many hours to achieve some large feats of engineering. Planning out logistics systems that interlink with each other, going from the ore extractor to a fininshed product.The game is constantly getting monthly updates with a dedicated Dev.If your still on the fence on about this game. if you put in a small amount of time like 10 hours it ends up being a £1 an hour. but if you end up liking the game you'll put in the hours and get something like 50 hours in the game that £0.20 per hour which is crazy concept when you think about it.

												Fun Game, Still in the works, but basically put, its still very early game, but that being said, right now, there is still tons too do, so don't be fooled. Overall, very fun. It allows extreme customization of building your ""factory"" in a 3D world. Its a game for all those people who like indie, survival and real time expansion. If you like the premise of mc, space engineers, Factorio and other similar, youll love this. My only beef with it is it's getting way too little support, thus not too many streams and broadcasts on twitch and steam, and not too many playlists and let's plays on youtube, but that will come in time. But just not one thing, Don't place the threat scanner until your ready to deal with mobs.			"

Early Access Review
								I picked this game up yesterday, because it's only 4 bucks, and I liked Minecraft quite a bit. I was hoping Anthony's review was a bit of an exaggeration, but even after dozens of hours playing Minecraft, I was pretty lost after about a half hour playing this game. There were birds flying around that I couldn't kill, with text attached to them about crafting (Not sure if this is a bug or one of many confusing features), and even with tutorial screen at the beginning, I was still clueless. It kind of feel like it was written for someone who already has a lot of experience playing this game. I think I was supposed to find my crashed ship, but when I went to the area where it seemed to have gone down, there was just some ""power thing"" floating well above where I could reach it. I was able to mine a few rocks and trees, but couldn't seem to craft anything with them but torches. Even after chopping down trees, I saw no way to turn those into planks, or construct anything. Survival mode in Minecraft starts you with nothing, and no endless menu of things you could eventually build, which eases you into what eventually becomes a very complex game. I'm not sure how much more complex this game is supposed to be, but it's almost impossible to get into a game when I don't have the slightest clue what I'm doing. I'll try watching a Youtube tutorial on how to get through the first few days, but since this is still Early Access, I'd really recommend to the developers that they consider a very basic, starting from scratch, survival mode, and slowly introduce new features. I usually don't need my hand held figuring out games, but this one almost requires it. Assume the people playing your game have never even heard of a game like this before, and teach them how to play it. Right now, a 6 page tutorial on topics that make no sense to a beginner, isn't helping. I think I could really get into this game, but right now it's almost impossible, even if I wanted to. Please consider a more basic starting point for beginners, Devs, and teach as we go, rather than bombarding us with a bunch of information and features from the get go.But all in all, I'm going to recommend this game because it is Early Access, and the Devs do seem dedicated to making improvements.TL;DR: Survival mode is incredibly difficult to figure out, even if you've played Minecraft, but at this price point, this game is still worth picking up.

								I am right on the fence about recommending this or not so I will go forth and say at its current sale price of $3.99. The game is worth it. In the main game you start out in a seemingly random area with a supposed crashing ship that is locked on until it crashses. You find your crashed ship via light beacon piercing high through the sky. Your initial objectives is to stay warm which is done by burning trees or if you are lucky, coal if it is within eyesight. From here on out is just a slow climb to gather resources like coal , iron and so on to get upgrades and eventually some sort of automation of ore harvesting and smelting. There are some interesting features like the ore scanner which scans blocks and is further identified at your reasearch station . It also lets you scan for things that you have not identified, useful for finding new ores or for ones you have previously found. There are a few useful features that are thoughtful and useful and they blend in with game mechanics as to not seem overpowered.  This game is not without its flaws. There are a number of bugs I've encountered. -When your ship crashes you cannot relocate your starting area without some sort of tool later in the game but it glitched and I accidently had it placed far from my base and I couldnt basically continue reasonably. -Saving your world and continuing later seems to initiate that crash scene again and again, destroying everything I've built that was in its crash radius, though it left me with 2 starting areas. I lost everything in my inventory though. The menus are convoluted and half of the buttons seem to work correctly. For example when crafting there are arrows that let you change the quantity of the batch but the arrows dont change anything as if they are just apart of the graphics.All in all if you like these types of creative games. I would get it on sale as this game has great potential but dont want to risk much more as we all know early access has just become a legal excuse to sell an unfinished product.			"

								     Do you like Voxel based games? Do you enjoy hardcore-esc environments? Do you enjoy standing by a lamp, hoping you won't die of hypothermia? Then this is the game for you! In it's mechanics, it is kind of like minecraft. You need to mine to collect ores. But it isn't just ""Punch tree, get wood"". You need to loacate your crashed spacecraft. You need to fend off againts enimies. You need to stay warm, to prevent hypothermia. You need to cool down, so that you don't get heat stroke. No matter what it is, the game can prove to have difficulty. You can't simply afk and let all of your ores melt, you have to sit in just a precise place, so that you don't overheat, or freeze.     But, it's not all hard. The game also serves with a small robotic friend(Who needs power, go figure) that helps you out. He doesn't do much, but he can keep your suit powered, so that you can maintain your heat levels. You can explore giant underground tunnels and caves, with boundless possibilities! You could simply enjoy walking around on the surface of the planet.     I reccomend this game. Not because I play Minecraft and other 3D voxels, but because it has good mechanics. Sure, at first the game is confusing, but aren't all games confusing before you learn how to play them?			"

												Game should still be in early access. Unfinished release. Overtones of Starforge Alpha again. The basic game will likely never be finished and is abandoned now in favour of DLC's that will also likely end up the same way. What a pity.Dev running out of funds it seems. Strange when it advertises itself as ""The original FortressCraft was one of the best-selling Indie games of all time"" that this would be the case.Having failed here on Steam, dev seems to have moved off to Patreon to milk the flock further.For a really accurate assessment read the review by 24carat.

												Still playing Minecraft and mining resources by hand like a sucker?  Ever wanted to just plop down a nice automated resource extractor?Easy, peasy!  Just dig a shaft and set up some lasers to beam power down to your new mine.   Oh, and build conveyers to get the ore back to the surface. And an automated smelting system.  And storage. And an automated coal extraction system to power your generators.  And research for cargo lifts and other what not to replace those old conveyers and...  Ok.  Not as easy as digging by hand. But way more fun!			"

												Was great, but it turned into a boring grindfest.There was so much potential in this game, and I liked it for a while, but I can't really recommend it anymore.  It's changed into a money grab and you can tell that the passion has left this game in favor of ""what shiney can I put in the game next.""  This game heavily suffers from unpolished feature bloat simply for the sake of bringing in more cash.  For instance:1. You have 1! biome, so forget exploring.  From the moment you step foot on the planet, you've seen everything it has to offer until you dig down for miles.  2. Grind for the sake of grind.  The equipment tiers are mostly just numeric advantages with color change, and very little functionality differences.  This is just to waste more of your time.3. Huge vertical distances, just for the sake of it.  I'm not kidding, you can dig a very long way down before reaching the different levels, and this would be a feature if it weren't such a barren emptyness that you are digging through.  There's no point to the far distances other than to add to the transportation grind, and just to say ""it's a huge world!""4.  Dev prices things to fit his financial needs rather than to be competitive in the market.  The expansion has a price tag of 15 bucks, which is more than the original game!  A complete ""screw you"" to the loyal fans who bought the game originally.  Hell, I payed less for fallout 4 expansions than I would if I were to buy this one, and that's a AAA title!  Get real.5. Monsters are an afterthought, with no real pathing, pathetic AI (because the dev can't be bothered) and a silly minigame based on your production levels.  There's no real threat at all to yourself except from falling damage.All in all, these things make the game feel unpolished and the dev seems to have an obsession with gadgets and machines and cares little about gameplay.

								I really want to recommend this game, but I can't.  Writing this review, I can't decide if I should recommend it or not.Pros:-Voxel is always fun.-Building tools allow building large structures without much work.-Developers seem to care about their players, replying to reviews and all.-A TON of blocks. Even dozens dedicated to building lunar and space stuff.---------------Cons:-More demanding than most voxel games, due to shaders.-Some things just don't fit in (e.g. the weather staff's mesh that controls weather is nice and smooth, but it's a voxel game.-Annoying robot flies around telling you what block you have in your hand.------------------------I know that this game is early access, so I know it'll all get better.  This review is based on my personal opinion.			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this on sale for only $2.24 (I feel like I stole something!!!)....after almost 40 hours invested, even in the early access stage it's worth ten times that. As mentioned in other reviews, think tech modded MC and Factorio had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child. Hate using MC as the reference, as it seems almost every vox type game gets compared to it....but, unfortunately popularity & timing made it the ""benchmark"", and in my opinion, this game will well surpass that mark in unique playability. Love the fact that it's not overly easy to ""run away"" with production like some of the MC mods....you know, the ones that you play 3 hours and you no longer have to do anything except design a new house....the exploration & mining remains a requirement. I love laying out mines & methodizing my gathering/processing lines....Not much of a ""builder"" fanatic, I stick to industrial style buildings, so my typical asthetic is: square, gray, door, mine, the end....so can't really comment on the building aspect. Already polished for the stage it is in, going to enjoy watching it grow....at the time of this writing, dev released another primer for the next update, so no worries about the ""dev mysteriously disappeared after selling X amount of unfinished product"" as I've bought into many times prior, I'm pretty sure they're here to see it through. Love the game, love the genre.....if you're reading the reviews, then you should probably grab it before it hits the finish line & prices go up to what it's truely worth!!Finally found a gem!!			"

Early Access Review
								Monotonous version of Minecraft with machines. I don't know the first version on X360 but Evolved, in this Alpha stage, isn't so appealing. Wait until Early Access ends.Why i didn't like it so much:1- Graphics is the real problem. Low framerate on Good preset (but it's good on Simple, so kind of OK). Models are horrible, especially block ones (like ore deposit boxes, ore extractors, ore refineries etc.). Also still buggy, time by time i see through blocks; can't see distant lands.2- Survival mode? What is that? The only survival in-game is hypotermia which doesn't affect your gameplay. You only die and respawn. Ah, and your robot companion needs a power core. That's all.3- GUI isn't so useful.4- You have to identify every kind of block which i found it as a donkey work.5- This game needs small amount of interactive guides imho. Only a small amount of them.I'd like to make a more solid recommendation but it's unbearable in this state so wait, don't buy it now. This is my last Early Access title, i guess. I'm not a type of feedback guy, so, i shouldn't buy alpha and beta stage games. You shouldn't too, if you feel me.			"

								Terrible. Multiplayer is very glitchy, and messes up your inventory, among other things. You can only go a few minutes away from your base because you have to constantly recharge or you'll die. Even worse, the station you start out with can't be moved, so you're stuck in the same area. The ores required to advance in the game are so rare that you die before you can bring them back and recharge. View distance is limited, making it look awful. And if you want to see in the dark, you have to use a headlight, which consumes power extremely quickly.			"

												I have been playing FCE for a few weeks now and can say that it's scratching itches I didn't even know I had, along with others I knew. The game is early release so understand that it is not completly finished and evolves. Sometimes things get nerfed to ensure balanced play, reduction of exploits that deminish the fun quality. But also things are constantly added, and new features arrive on an almost daily basis (when using bleeding edge version). Additionally a fair number of mods have been created, with more on the way that make your life even easier. Think of factorio and minecraft put together, but in a super cool symbiotic way. Follow the tutorial. Sometimes things are spelled out to you but you just have to look (example blue text hints that flash occasionally), or the mission system that shows outstanding items. Do them in order and make your life easier. the key to everything is automation, but it can take a little bit of time to undersand that and get setup. There are also modes for those who need an abundance of resources to blast through the game as quickly as possible. Think real mines in the real world...ore comes out of the ground, transported to crushers, and smelters and then transported further. The game thrives on being very spread out, and you have a huge world to do this in, so spread out! Think giant fortresses built that consume your resources. I'll be enjoying this game for a long time to come. You ask, is this worth it? Yes, for sure, at least in my opinion, and I've been a gamer for many years, of different flavors.			"

There are also modes for those who need an abundance of resources to blast through the game as quickly as possible. Think real mines in the real world...ore comes out of the ground, transported to crushers, and smelters and then transported further. The game thrives on being very spread out, and you have a huge world to do this in, so spread out! Think giant fortresses built that consume your resources. I'll be enjoying this game for a long time to come. You ask, is this worth it? Yes, for sure, at least in my opinion, and I've been a gamer for many years, of different flavors.			"

												Totally hooked. 15 hours in and I've barely even scratched the surface. Never thought setting up power relays. mining conveyors, and weapon platforms could be so fun. The graphics are fantastic and every machine I've used so far has very clean animations. Has a decently high but fun learning curve and screwing around with components, reading the very in depth help menu, or asking people on the discord can clear any confusion up quickly - even the devs are on the discord. I've played minecraft with over 200 mods on a single server and it doesn't even come close  to the things you can do in this game, the pictures I see posted constantly of other peoples creations just make me want to work towards that point even more. Not to mention once you get to a certain point in the game you have to set up defenses to start killing waves of enemies that show up to visit you every now and then.For those of you thinking this is just a minecraft clone are dead wrong. Highly recommended.			"

												This game has a lot of elements: Exploration, Crafting, Automation, Logistics, and some tower defense.The game begins with a survival feel. You craft, with a strong push to automate. As your base grows, some basic tower defense elements emerge.The cave systems are vast, and exploration is necessary to progress. A few hours in, you will realize this game dwarfs minecraft by thousands of meters. This game is not minecraft, despite the voxels.Factorio is commonly compared, and it does take a lot of elements from this game.Extensive in-game help and mission system helps to shorten the learning curve. If that isn't enough, there are hundreds of youtube videos covering most every aspect of the game.Networking & server support.Modding supportThis game gives you more for your money than most. It is actively being updated, and is constantly evolving towards the dev's vision.the Frozen Factory expansion is well worth the price adding easily another hundred hours of content after the base game.

												If you like creating, efficiency, logistics and exploration then this is the game for you.  You will spend hours figuring out the best way to run your base.  Get it right then have to redo it cause you need to move to a higher tier of building.  You'll have to manage power output, which metals need to be transformed into wires, coils, plates and PCB's, probably more I don't know about yet cause with my time played I don't think I've reached tier 2 yet.  Which all can be automated on factory like assembly line.  This game can be addictive.  It's the next generation of Civilization addiction imo in regards to the 1 more turn.  But with smelting enough bars to craft that item or research that upgrade to progress your operation.I noticed some reviewers don't like some of the changes, which I don't get, from what I understand the changes made added more logistical problems to solve.  Which in my book is a great thing.  This game has so much depth to it you just won't believe it.  Oh and I forgot to mention you will have to defend your base against attacks.  So yeah theres that to.The game is a bargain at twice the price imo with the amount of content and play time I've already gotten out of it.  I was lucky enough to get it on sale and bought it on a whim after reading the description of the game and watching the videos.Highly reccomended for logistical types.			"

												TL;DR - Great game centered on logistics systems with free-form voxel construction and wave defense.8/10Factorio meets Minecraft. For those of you that aren't familiar, this game is about planning and constructing logistics systems to gather and process material (Factorio) set in a voxel based world with essentially no limits on the ways you can build with those voxels. (Minecraft) If you like Factorio, go ahead and get FortressCraft Evolved. I think you'll like it. If you like Minecraft however, you may want to watch some game-play videos, as there are many aspects of Minecraft that don't exist in FortressCraft Evolved. This one really gets your brain going. Resources are abundant on default settings, but difficult and time consuming to extract. As such, intelligent and cleverly constructed logistics systems will provide an immediate advantage to players with the smarts to create them. Maximizing the available resources is a constant goal, and to that end the player can continually upgrade or change their systems in attempt to better utilize what's available. On top of that, building is a key mechanic to the game and players can spend as much, or as little time constructing decorative building as they desire. Oh, and there's a wave defense mechanic slapped over the whole game. Not really sure how I feel about that, but it doesn't get in the way.			"

												I'll start by saying that I am having an amazing time with this game.That said, it's definitely a niche offering. I used to play a heavily modded Minecraft (let's start by not pretending the game isn't influenced by Minecraft), but there was always the issue of mods not working well together. Different machines needing different sources of power, for example. Then everything would break when there was an upgrade. It was a hassle. FCE provides the experience I was looking for w/o that hassle. It's more akin to a 3d Factorio than Minecraft. There are negatives, of course. FCE has the nickname toilcraft for a reason. There's a lot of manual labor involved in ramping up automation. Resources are generated slowly, and you'll spend the first several hours waiting for ore to smelt into bars, even AFTER you know what you're doing. You start with one ore smelter, and there is a lot to do before you can even build a second. I find the slower pace relaxing, but I'm old. YMMV. I like the fact that I can carry on a conversation with my wife & watch TV w/ her while playing.There IS a rapid resources mode now that makes this somewhat less of an issue, but you'll still be doing a lot of running around manually smelting stuff for hours to get things going.The world is also really bleak and depressing. That's by design, but after a while it gets to you. A bit of biome diversity would have been nice. I haven't tested it, but it also doesn't seem to have Minecraft's nigh-endless size. It's big enough, though. Summary: If you're a Factorio player who would rather work in a 3d environment, you should check this game out. If I prefered 2d overhead to 3d, I'd be playing Factorio instead of this.			"

												It's hard to give this game a bad rating. Pretty much everything about this game is really good. It's fun and me and a friend played it multiplayer and absolutely loved it for about 4 days. So why thumbs down? Well there is one huge flaw that I just can not get over.In order to progress beyond a certain point in the game you need an item called a Perfect Faceted Eye. It's a drop you get from killing creatures in the game world, or supposedly get from creatures in the game world, me and my friend found none after more than four days of game play. No matter how many slimes, wasps and or other creatures we killed we never got this drop. We tried multiple worlds, increased our threat level, built slime magnets, killed everything in site for hours and hours and hours and still no drop. The problem is you need at least a few of these items to mine crystal and without getting any in drops you can't even get to the point where you can manufacture your own. Crazy huge flaw, feel like I wasted my time and money, should have multiple ways to get this item and or mine crystal and without it you pretty much hit a giant wall that you'll never be able to get around. Tutorial is a little weak too, like for the longest time I was possitive that you could not add items to the hopper. I was amazed when I found out it was the T key. LOL, no drag and drop option like everything else you literally have to select it in your hot bad, face the hopper and press T. A little funky but not enough for it to be a problem. Fix your drops and I'll come back and give you a better rating. Until this I honestly can not find myself recommending this game to anybody.EDIT: I just wanted to add that if you look online this is clearly a problem that a lot of people are having and is something that isn't taken seriously by the developers or the community for some reason. I can only guess that most people are not having this problem but after 70+ hours, my friend having played 190+ hours, and after receiving every other type of drop except this specific drop shows that there is a problem with this game. It is broken for some reason and nobody cares. It being required to progress the game pretty early makes this a really bad problem. Buy at your own risk.			"

												Take Minecraft with manufacturing/industry mods, remove 99% of what you think you know about Minecraft with said mods and press start.Fair warning to those who think it will be pick and go, it isnt.

After 2 days you will begin figuring out how basics work, and then after you start trying to automate Iron and Lithium will the game really start.If you think you have the time, patience, and logic then buy this for the LONGGGG haul.

												This game is absolutely fantastic.One major plus to the game is that the main developer (DJArcas) streams a lot of his creation process, between bug fixes and new features, and is relatively easy to get in contact with in a variety of ways- causing a unique sense of being part of the game's creation.The game itself is amazing. Starting with the graphics, all of them are fabulous. They might as well be considered the best- loading very quickly, with little to no lag, unlike most games that try to have good graphics (even with a not-so-good laptop or PC!).On to the gameplay, there is a ton of content, tons of machines to build and resources to gather, while still not flooding the player with too many options. There is a story, somewhat, as well. You crash on a planet and try to get off (this is definitely not the best description of the story), which adds a point to the game, rather than pointless building.This may not be the most coherent review ever, but these are the main reasons (among many other) why I have nominated this game for one of the Steam Awards.

												I really wish I could recommend this game, I really really do but I can not agree with the direction the developer is going.   I have had this game since the early days of early access, I've had fun playing it but it's never been ""finished"" and time after  time I have to set it aside before picking it back up due to ground breaking bugs. Scroll to the bottom for the TLDR;I've had worlds corrupted on me, ones that have had hours worth of work put into themI've had major work lost due to sudden crashesSeveral updates have causes existing worlds to no longer be loadableGranted all of these are while it was in Early Access, frustrating but can be expected from a game in development (hence putting it aside and trying it again later)Well it's been out of Early Access for a while now so I thought I would give it another go around, unfortunately there are still issues that while not ""game breaking"" are 'game breaking'.I have a HTC vive and the game starts up in VR mode every time, unfortunately VR mode isn't useable as the game won't load pass the world creation ""into"", even while loading the resolution is lowered to the point that it's not even playable.  That's fine, I can play it 2D except:There is no way to force it not to start Steam VRWhen it starts Steam VR it doesn't start it properly causing Steam VR to error out until restartedI have to catch the right time in the loading screen to hit space to switch over to 2D modeThen there the other issues with the game:Still crashes occasionallyWhen you exit the game it doesn't quit, steam thinks it's still running and won't let you restart until you quit steam and reopen steam (not just the game)There are still issues with block placement and Orientation and getting everything to align correctlyI understand that the developer needs income to continue development, and I'm good with the fact that additional content is coming in the form of DLC but am rather on the fence with the patreon content.... There is something to be said for the privilege of getting early access to something, but some of those items are in my opinion ""Core"" items, that should be part of the base game (Mutators, since mods break achievements) as well as the fact that the ""base"" game isn't finished and is still buggy.  It comes across that new content is being developed to bring in income, bugs are being fixed while new content is being made but of course new content takes times and effort (which in turn slows down bug fixing), it leaves a bad impression on me that new content is being made to bring in income before the base game is even  finished.   The fact that the content is good and useful is conflicting, I want to support the game and the developer but at the same time I won't be buying DLC for a game that still doesn't function properly.TLDR version;I really want to like and recommend this game but I can't, it's still isn't complete and New content is being released before bugs are fixed in the base game.Game is buggy, crashes to desktop.Even if you quit properly it won't relaunch unless you completely shut down steam and restart itIf you have VR capabilities (HTC Vive) it forces the game to launch in VR mode, except VR mode doesn't work "

												For me this is one of the games that I can play for a very long time.But be warned that this game is not for everyone as it is complex and takes time.Time for gathering resources depends on world difficulty and can range from fast to taking forever.Base building time is not so much affected by difficulty (once you have the resources) but takes some thought to have a good layout. You can even screw up without knowing until it is too late. For example when you do not protect your conveyor belts and have uncontrolled hive mind growth.So before starting I recommend to read some guides and/or the wiki. If you are not willing to read then you may have a hard time. The tutorial is very basic and the ingame help is not enough to understand everything in the game. There are no scenarios or extended tutorials that show you how to master the game.Once you know how things work out it is really enjoyable to build up your base and to automate the tedious processes.The frozen factory expansion is not required immediately for this because it extends the late game. Have played over 100 hours and just about to begin with the additional content. For that amount of playtime it is well worth it in my opinion.The user interface is the part of the game that needs the most improvements. It makes some tasks more complicated than they should be. If you are deterred by this fact then better wait for improvements. It already improved over time but still needs more time.My recommendation:If you are looking for a complex game that requires time or already played minecraft with technical mods like industrialcraft (especially if you like Gregtech) then this is likely a game for you.If you are looking for a game with less complexity and quicker progress you should look into Factorio first and come back once you need more ;)			"

Love the game.  Have played it hundreds of hours and I am still interested in playing more.Bottom line: one of the most worth it games I have taken a chance on in years. Pro:If you like building things and seeing stuff work then you owe it to yourself to buy this game.  The game also has an interesting tower defense side to its gameplay where part of the stuff you build needs to be geared toward taking down waves of angry bugs which increase in strength as your power usage increases.  The workshop mods also offer interesting options to tailor the game to your liking.  I.e. if you hate worrying about inventory space there is a mod for that.. or if you like building stuff but dont want to go for full automation you can get a mod to have much bigger hoppers.Cons:For me, the UI was not built the way I default assumed the controls should work.. however, it turns out the developer put alot of thought into how to setup the UI to allow you to build some really complicated stuff and I found that the more I played the more I was totally happy with the UI choices.There are some points when I first started the game where I didnt know how I was supposed to proceed.  With the help of google and the very friendly game forums these were often quickly resolved.Why all the drama...There are alot of reviews focusing on the personality of the primary developer and things he said in this place or that place.  Frankly, I couldnt care less if he insults everybody or offers a massage with a happy ending.  Its irrelevant.  The game is fun, and I found it rediculously worth the price.  I did not buy it because I needed a new friend and hoped the dev was that guy.[edited to fix formatting]			"

												Loving this game so far. It is one of those rare games that you think about when you aren't playing it. It is a puzzle game, but not those maddeningly difficult puzzle games, it is one where you look forward to solving problems. I honestly believe that this game will make you more intelligent by making you think really hard, like, to the max. And you will love every minute of it.It is addicting, but its a good addiction, ya know? Like, if you were addicted to crack cocaine or something, you should start playing this game and you will forget about your drug habit!			"

												Totally hooked. 15 hours in and I've barely even scratched the surface. Never thought setting up power relays. mining conveyors, and weapon platforms could be so fun. The graphics are fantastic and every machine I've used so far has very clean animations. Has a decently high but fun learning curve and screwing around with components, reading the very in depth help menu, or asking people on the discord can clear any confusion up quickly - even the devs are on the discord. I've played minecraft with over 200 mods on a single server and it doesn't even come close  to the things you can do in this game, the pictures I see posted constantly of other peoples creations just make me want to work towards that point even more. Not to mention once you get to a certain point in the game you have to set up defenses to start killing waves of enemies that show up to visit you every now and then.For those of you thinking this is just a minecraft clone are dead wrong. Highly recommended.			"

												This game has a lot of elements: Exploration, Crafting, Automation, Logistics, and some tower defense.The game begins with a survival feel. You craft, with a strong push to automate. As your base grows, some basic tower defense elements emerge.The cave systems are vast, and exploration is necessary to progress. A few hours in, you will realize this game dwarfs minecraft by thousands of meters. This game is not minecraft, despite the voxels.Factorio is commonly compared, and it does take a lot of elements from this game.Extensive in-game help and mission system helps to shorten the learning curve. If that isn't enough, there are hundreds of youtube videos covering most every aspect of the game.Networking & server support.Modding supportThis game gives you more for your money than most. It is actively being updated, and is constantly evolving towards the dev's vision.the Frozen Factory expansion is well worth the price adding easily another hundred hours of content after the base game.

												An interesting concept, being a blend between minecraft and factorioIt's decent enough, however I personally found that the early game suffers from ""many paths, only one that is any good""The tutorial teaches you about power automation, which is good.The tutorial does not teach you that you can put multiple ores into the same hopper, and the game obscures that fact by only showing you the most recent item.  It seems you 100% need to do this to get your smelter operating with any sort of efficiency.  It should be part of the tutorial.It feels like giving players access to the research path before they have _built_ the smelter upgrades and the suit & robot power upgrades is a mistake.  It consumes a ton of resources and takes focus away from the income engine.There's lots of other odds and ends you can waste resources on early game, research is just the one that got me.So the early game is not as broken as I thought, however I suspect it's been optimised for someone who already knows how to play.  New comers without existing knowledge are likely to get harshly punished for sub-optimal play.This is something that both minecraft and factorio seem to handle quite well but this game drops the ball on			"

								Aside from looking like a potato crudly taped to a monkey with down syndrome, Fortresscraft has some good Ideas... but can the company use them in a way to complement the game?Im gonna answer that right off the bat, no it can't. This game realeased in early access more than 4 YEARS AGO and I still have a better time playing the orignal one on the XBLA. This game completly fails to motavate you to do anything at all. It starts you out with a drill gun that can dig through ANYTHING IN THE GAME so I had no reason to craft a better one even if you can. It also starts you out with a ♥♥♥♥ING LASER CANNON so there is also no reason to get a better weapon either, y'know im not even sure if theres enemys in the game to shoot at. I did find little flying robot things that I could'nt collect like a perk (like in the first one) and I tried to shoot them with the Mega Death Death Ray Gun that it just gives you and it just wizzed right passed them. Speaking of robots you have a little robot thing that follows you around and shows you the block you're carrying incase your completly brain dead. Lastly, it spawns you with a 3 tourches  that emit enough heat to burn through the earths crust. See, there is this system much like thwe hunger in minecraft in here but with tempeture. And scince it spawns you in the middle of a blizzard I decided to make a house to get warm in. And after I made a house of wood and stone and waited for 5 minutes I did not get any warmer. So I dug in the middle of a moutain hoping to get warm and littarly nothing happened with 5 blocks of stone on either side protecting me from the cold. So the only way to get warm is by getting items that emit heat. But scince the crafting system is as easy to work as rubber stilts You're. Basicly. ♥♥♥♥ed. But when I was on the brink of freezing to death I decided to die in good lighting, so I set down a tourch and withing 12 seconds I overheated and died ... so ... ya. "

								Monotonous version of Minecraft with machines. I don't know the first version on X360 but Evolved, in this Alpha stage, isn't so appealing. Wait until Early Access ends.Why i didn't like it so much:1- Graphics is the real problem. Low framerate on Good preset (but it's good on Simple, so kind of OK). Models are horrible, especially block ones (like ore deposit boxes, ore extractors, ore refineries etc.). Also still buggy, time by time i see through blocks; can't see distant lands.2- Survival mode? What is that? The only survival in-game is hypotermia which doesn't affect your gameplay. You only die and respawn. Ah, and your robot companion needs a power core. That's all.3- GUI isn't so useful.4- You have to identify every kind of block which i found it as a donkey work.5- This game needs small amount of interactive guides imho. Only a small amount of them.I'd like to make a more solid recommendation but it's unbearable in this state so wait, don't buy it now. This is my last Early Access title, i guess. I'm not a type of feedback guy, so, i shouldn't buy alpha and beta stage games. You shouldn't too, if you feel me.			"

								Terrible. Multiplayer is very glitchy, and messes up your inventory, among other things. You can only go a few minutes away from your base because you have to constantly recharge or you'll die. Even worse, the station you start out with can't be moved, so you're stuck in the same area. The ores required to advance in the game are so rare that you die before you can bring them back and recharge. View distance is limited, making it look awful. And if you want to see in the dark, you have to use a headlight, which consumes power extremely quickly.			"

The controller support doesn't work, you can't configure your block set, can't switch tools and many other things too. The keyboard set up works so far, but often the keyboard get's disabled for some weird reasons. If I dig down, to get on lower levels, it get's stuck at 500 blocks lower level. The graphic doesn't build up anymore and the keyboard get's disabled. Please don't tell me, it's because my PC is too weak. The game runs allways at 60 FPS, so really no lag at all. Only the graphic doesn't build up. One of my biggest issue is, that there is no playable tutorial at all. It has so many new functions in comparisson with Minecraft, that a player can't know all that. To figure it out, would be probably a very long try and error. If the heavy bugs get solved and a short tutorial get's implemented, I give it another chance. Else I declare the game as dead. -.-'I can live with not achieveable achievements, they're a nice add to games, but not necessary. ;)But bad controls and tons of crashes are an absolute no go. :'( (\s/)			"

(Think automatic robots in minecraft)Then this is the game for you! You start with nothing but a laser miner,and from there you craft machines that can do everything for you,from mining to moving to storage! The automatic rich mans lifestyle.Most of the fun currently (as of 11/7/2014) Comes from building the factories/automated lifestyle,and picking out nice spots to store your ores. After that,well..there is not much to do,it's hard to get pretty materials in survival mode to build nice looking houses with. I give the game a 4/5, or a 7/10. Once finished,I can see it being an amazing place to spend most of your time.			"

								This is a great game with a good potential. However now, in it`s current state, it has two problems. First of all, it is vey, very buggy. Look at any part of the game and you will find bugs. Player falls through the floor, items cannot be moved to inventory, capacity of smelter changes randomly, sometimes items just disappear while dragging.Second problem is balance. Prepare to wait a lot and to make many monotonous movements. Dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge, dig and recharge. Then go to smelter and smelt for an hour. Capacity of smelter is low (and changes randomly) so you cannot just leave game and go for a walk.Of course, there is automation in this game, everything can be automated. But you`ll spend hours and hours to craft automatic resource processing. And these hours will be very boring.I dont recommend this game untill all bugs are fixed and long hours replaced with brief breaks.			"

								I hate to say this, but i've hinted at many ways to fix this game with no consideration whatsoever.This game is bloody awful, a huge step down from the predecessor FortressCraft.This abomonation feels like a bad minecraft mod, with cheesy, overdone 3d models that look lazily done, and not to mention the gameplay is elastic and horrible.  The old FortressCraft was beautiful, your only limit was your imagination, but on this? the limit is you might not have a super powerful computer, WITH THESE GRAPHICS, THAT SHOULD NOT BE NEEDED. OPTIMIZED MY♥♥♥♥♥ NOT TO MENTION THE GRAPHICS, EVEN THOUGH REQUIRING SO MUCH, MANAGE TO LOOK UGLY AS ♥♥♥♥. This game blew up my last Power supply, so maybe look into that.This game has an awful interface, confusing and downright stupid controls, and no point of purchase. I can NOT express my hatred of this game through words, they have taken an amazing game and DESTROYED it. If you like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that feel like chinese knockoffs of already mainstream games, hell, give this a go.But if you're like me and want your MONEY'S WORTH, DO NOT BUY THIS. Though there is SOME gameplay that doesnt make me want to gouge my eyes out with the rusty♥♥♥♥♥♥of a thousand demons, it is not worth the money. i feel pain for anyone else that has payed♥♥♥♥♥♥for this abomination.(PS. the reason it's so different is because of death threats from minecraft fanboys, that projectorgames took seriously. yeah.)(PSS. Nope, they will NOT fix this game, as it's already ""GOOD"")Summary 4/10			"

												Well the last straw was that the machine to see what you have stored in your ""mass storage"" requires the DLC. However, the game will let you craft it (at large resource cost). DLC for a basic quality-of-life interface? Nope.The good: Great ideas, and many original ones.The bad: The base game is not ready. Early-access level at best. Power-creeping DLC. Some performance issues, especially with a few people on a small-ish dedicated server. Also, unlike Factorio, for example, this game punishes you for trying to automate - all factories have small costs, but all automation machines have huge costs associated with them. It should be the reverse for obvious reasons. And lastly, I have some security concerns about the mod system, as it is DLL-based.Will probably revisit in a few months if it seems like it has improved.			"

								I've been playing Minecraft for two years now, and I love it. I hate to compare this game to Minecraft because their so different, yet so similar. Yes, they both have blockes, and everything. But Minecraft is simple at the start, then gradually gets more complicated. This game however, is impossible from the start! The torches don't evem light up dark areas. If you are looking at this game from Xbox 360 expirience, don't be fooled. They are COMPLETLY different. I liked Fortress Craft on the Xbox. But on this, it sucks. Yes it does look pretty, but who cares. Its so dang difficult to get used to. I hate it. I want my money back!			"

								this game may not be entirely feature complete yet, and doesnt have a clear goal, but seeing it is in active development with competent, friendly and skilled developers, i see no reason not to love this game.it is currently a sandbox creative with a sandboxy survival modes game, soon to be a game with creative and a true survival game mode with creepy crawlies...it has similarities to minecraft, sure, and no doubt people will compare the two games to each other, but it is different on a multitude of levels and scale, and in a lot of areas.i leave it up to you, the new player to find out what exactly, as i found that some players find different areas overlapping then others...as for what is actually in the game, it works for the majority and is good fun, though not to much is there yet, but if it doesnt work (properly) it is highly likely that there is work being done on the subject which fixes or improves it the next or coming update(s), and if you report a bug which hasnt been covered properly yet, the devolopers will be very happy to fix or at least as soon as they can, and they let people know what they actually do.you'll likely get a response anyway unless its considered trolling.there are currently big feature updates on the roadmap to diversify the game and improve it as far as i know, which will make this game from a good alpha/beta, to great up till amazing released game. (*cough* *transportation* *cough* *fluids* *cough* *to name a few* *cough* *cough*)i'd say if you like voxel based games, give this a try, its different from the norm with its machines and ideas, definatly worth the few bucks/euros it will cost you, though i have to warn you, there are bug, but this is normal for a young game (currently alpha/beta).i paid, and i dont regret it a single bit.

								Written as of Alpha 1.11 (or 1.13c multiplayer, whichever you prefer). I have not played a lot, but from the meager 2 hours there are a lot of things that, unfortunately, made this a waste of money for now. The price tag would be justified if the game weren't the mess it is now. There are ofc a lot of pros to it but the amount of cons, and the form they take, is just a little too much. Also, as much as people would love to say it is a Minecraft clone, the similarities end at ""block based building"" and ""mining"". You could just as well place Space Engineers in the same category then.Pros:- Infinite worlds, a la Minecraft (better than the 256 block height it has anyways)- Good potential for a crafting system, unlike any other Minecraft-ish game- Research, blueprints, power system, different mining modes- Much more realistic processing and production, with ore smelting, refining, and producing items and gear- ""Health"" system with temperature, power levels and hypothermiaCons:- Buggy UI and menus, to the point it becomes very annoying- Lack of a proper tutorial (there is one but it's messy and sometimes unclear)- Buggy creative multiplayer with no proper netcode or player sync- Extremely buggy survival multiplayer (lots of ore duping without even trying and more)- Very odd color scheme and graphical design choices for blocks and machinery (more of a personal opinion, but ir sure seems off)It's a good game, with a lot of potential, but it's a shame that the bugs and clunkiness of it made it very hard to play. I will definitely check back in a couple updates and hope it still was a good investment. For people who can cope with bugs and still enjoy a game, go ahead, but there are too many things either unfinished or (partially) broken right now. I still recommend it tho because of this future potential.			"

												I was excited about this combination of minecraft and factorio, or at least up to the point, when i started to play. Tutorial is useless. It ends before i even noticed, it started and i learnt almost nothing useful. I had no idea, what to do. After I scanned immediate surroundings and mined some stuff, i had no idea, what to do next, just wandering around.Gameplay seems to be and tedious and not intuitive. Most of the time you just run somewhere, do 2 scans and then go back, because energy in your suit runs out almost immediately. Its annoying and terrain is boring.Graphics is similar to minecraft and yet after awhile, you feel dead inside, just from looking around.I did not get to the part with automatization, which seems to be main point of this game, so i could fit in two hours for refund. Just basics, seemed to be logical enough to understand. Just conveyor belts had some issues for me, trying to connect, because up and down conveyor belts are different blocks and look too similar, when i was trying to place them.It might be playable, if some improvements to graphics, gameplay and especially big improvements to tutorial are made. Since I started to judge games only on their current state and not on what if and maybe. I do not recommend it.			"

												I purchased this game primarily to play with my son as he's a big Minecraft fan and it was appealing to him.  Multiplayer, at least ""out of the box"" did not work for us.  Computers would not connect and always generated a ""connection timed out"" and UPNP needs to be enabled or port 27012 forwarded statement within the game.  Sadly, there is no option of just clicking on your steam friends name and sending an invite.     I ended up spending over 3 hours troubleshooting this error to finally give up in frustration and decided to refund this.   UPNP was enabled on both PC's.  Port 27012 was forwarded in the router and added to the firewall exemptions. I even went as far as to drop all the firewalls and see if that would allow the games to communicate. It did not. In this day and age UPNP enabled on both PC's should just work. It doesn't with this game, or at least, doesn't with me.  Throw me in the ""computers for dummies crowd"" or whatever, but I can say with complete confidence that many titles on Steam and elsewhere have a very smooth multiplayer connection system that works with a few clicks of the mouse. This does not.  When I spend more time troubleshooting a games systems than playing the game, it's time for me to move on. In summary, right now the multiplayer connection system for this title  is archaic at best. It feels and looks like something I'd play in a Early Access game.   I suppose it could be a good game, and I'd love to revisit this title once they clean up their attempt at multiplayer connectivity.     "

								This is still too Early Access (even for me - someone who lives on the Early Access store page). Survival is basically nonexistant. No enemies, broken game mechanics (many many basic menu options are unclickable), and quite glitchy even for my taste. This game will probably be ok in the end - it sets itself apart from Minecraft by having VERY different goals and game mechanics.The good:1. Sets itself apart from Minecraft in countless ways2. Multiplayer servers are free to set up3. Game is cheap-ishThe Bad:1. Game is too glitchy and surivival is basically unplayable in current state2. Graphics are worse than Minecraft (but not by much)3. You can click blocks no matter how far away you are (hard to believe in reality, but ok)4. You don't take fall damage?

												Extremely dissapointed. I tried playing multiplayer with my friend. When he hosted, whenever I tried to connect to his server, I got kicked cause of packet loss being higher than 25%. Why the game doesn't allow host to decide whether to kick a person because of that is a mystery to me. When I hosted, my friend couldn't collect any resources - whenever he broke some blocks, game said he collected them, but he didn't receive them in his inventory. Great.Multiplayer settings in the options menu are unresponsive - can't change the default ""friends only"" setting, can't change build permissions. When I tried entering a name in whitelist, the game became unresponsive so I had to alt+f4.Later, game also randomly stopped reacting to input from keyboard - I couldn't move, but I could look around. Alt+f4.Stuff like that kept happening all the time.I'm extremely surprised that this isn't in early access anymore. Cause it certainly feels like an early alpha build of the game. I enjoyed Dwarf Fortress's user interface more than that.			"

I know I haven't played much of the game, but I just cannot figure out how to play. Even the in-game guides are no help! I'm sorry to say it, but this game is terrible, even with the concept being my idea of a perfect game. Maybe in the future I'll re-visit it, because I really, really want to love this game, but for now, don't buy it unless you have a friend who knows how to play the game.			"

												The bad reviews for this game are unfortunate, because I've enjoyed many hours of play.  Fortresscraft Evolved has a lot of features I like in a game and has kept me attached to my computer screen for way longer than my girlfriend would like.  “Yeah, cutie, I’ll be to bed soon.”  But that never happens.  One recent (and ridiculously long) negative poster had 801+ hours of play!  He must have enjoyed the game much more than he admits and definitely got his money’s worth!On a side note first: I did not get this game for free, am not being paid to post a positive comment, and aren't using some fake account to skew the reviews. So for the TL:DR portion of my rant....I'd like to rebuttal some arguments about the game as to prevent misconceptions.The game is a complete, but open ended, fully playable game, and is constantly being updated with more features added and patch fixes for minor glitches.  If there are resources with descriptions like ""not implemented yet"" or ""has no use yet, but will soon"", it’s because that is a new feature only recently added to the already expansive game!  Anyone complaining (IMHO) about the game not being complete, is really only complaining that the developer refuses to stop adding more and more features to the game!  And how is that a valid complaint?!  If you think you’re going to jump into a new game, play for a bit, with the sole intent on “beating” it, you’re looking at the wrong game.  I’m sure one day there may be an end-game, like Mojang added to Minecraft much later after release.  But for now, feel at ease about spending your hard earned cash on this title. (which is cheap in comparison to much lesser games) Watch some videos.  Learn some strategies.  And enjoy the open ended-ness of the gameplay in its current high-content state.I’m looking forward to the upcoming Frozen Factory and Magma Core expansions and am fully willing to buy those as a DLC if that’s the way the dev chooses to go, because I’ve already gotten way beyond my money’s worth with the way the game is now.  Cheersies- ""Don't push the button anymore, Brother!"" ""I love you Penny!"" "

Mods make Minecraft what it is, and this game already has amazing content without mods.If you are into machines, automation, logistics and a 'never ending' world (there's no bottom like bedrock in MC... it just keeps going!), superb graphics, regular new content and a development team that has your constructive input and interests at heart (within reason of course)... then this game is for you.There's even a development live stream where bugs are fixed, content added, input considered, questions answered and... a cat?!!!

												This is a good game that scratched a similar itch to Factorio. I don't know about you, but I love conveyor belts. While you could call this game Factorio in 3D, it's unfortunately not as polished as Factorio. It has a very annoying visual glitch (on my system) that causes power lines to be visible as flickering lines through walls, and there are some very frustrating game mechanics that are never properly explained in-game. I don't regret spending money on this game, but I'm hoping that continued development on it sands off the rough edges.			"

												I see a lot of negative review about this game. And honestly? WHY??? this game is fun! :DThe game cost me 2 dollars on steam during the sales... and i played it 28 hours already (and wasted my ♥♥♥♥ing week end, ♥♥♥♥ off to the dev lol). That game is entertaining me for 0.07 dollars an hours at the moment... (and more to come haha)Ok there are a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of quality of life improvment, the game is kinda grindy etc, but it's part of the ""fun"" of games like that and factorio etc...If i could make just one suggestion about the game, since it's quite close to minecraft in term of look. You should add a few blocks (quite sur it's not complicated to do so), just for the aesthetic part. Add a few ""door"", colored block, wood and stone type in some kind of ""DECORATION FABRICATOR"". Why ? it would appeal to more people. My gf looked at it, kinda like it, but was like ""can i do a house etc?"" and sadly not... I mean, i spent 28 hours building my little industry, and i m quite sure a lot of people would love to take a small break and be like ""ok let's build myself a pretty house now while everything is harvesting.A few qol i would love is being able to fill harvester and things like that using a SHIFT or CTRL CLICK, at the moment it doesn't seem to work very well, or i may do something wrong. The interface could use some improvment, but honestly, it's a ton of fun if you like that kind of gameI'll give it a positive review because it's totally worth the money!Thanks to the guy who transformed factorio in a cool 3D minecraft game :D			"

												i changed this game to recommended, because the devs are involved. But i have underlined a few aspects of the game below. This game is really fun, but i have experienced many multiplayer bugs.. something i only intend to do with this product. as i would not like to play alone. The developers are responsive and are actively looking at their forums to fix bugs. i have adjusted my review to accomodate that. My summary for the game is good. lots of play time. but there are certain things that i think will be refined over time.. and i really hope that they do happen.. i have seen many games that the devs are not actively involved in. so i hope this isnt the case for FCE. because its complex. and diverse. The tutorial is a bit lacking. but apparently the missions are intended to slowly teach the player how to do things. is this game worth the money. yes.. you get bang for your buck. is this games multiplayer experience going to improve: we have to wait and see . my bug list for multiplayer can be found here. http://steamcommunity.com/app/254200/discussions/0/359543951706440293/ "

												When I first bought this game a couple years ago it was on sale and very cheap. I got it and 2 other games also on sale. I was not impressed initially. I thought the game was raw and not very much too it but I waited to see where it went. And its development has really gone well. If you like building, mining, and tower defense games you may love this game.  I watched DireWolf20's series on this game as I played this month for the first time. I also read  and watched reviews. The story of how this game came to be is very interesting. I look forward to its future. Great Job this last year this game has grown into something quite unique and fun. I think that this game is very enjoyable.			"

												I like the game, and it intrigues me a ton, but I really can't enjoy it because of it's optimisation. I'm pretty sure I'm the one whose on the wrong side of the fence here, because my computer isn't really up to par with most of the games steam has to offer.Don't get me wrong, I REALLY appreciate the work the devs put into this game, but because I can't enjoy it due to my pc's limitations, I'd really appreciate a refund. I've only played about 8 hours of the game but most of the time, I spent trying to fix the graphical options and later having to google ""how to run fortress craft with decent frame rates full screen"" and watching tutorials that'd hopefully fix the framerates so that the game would be a lot more enjoyable.I just can't enjoy the game even with a tiny window; I have a knack for tolerating unbearable framerates, but I guess I couldn't bear how the game worked on my computer, as games like Minecraft ran almost smoothly here; it's been frustrating me for a while now. I hold no grudge against the developers, as I've seen lots of YouTubers genuinely enjoy the game, and I know how enjoyable the game is. But I would really appreciate it if I can have a refund.			"

												I like the game, but it has a few flaws. First of all, a lot of the menus are a bit mest up. The boxes are out of place, and some buttons dont even do anything. Second of all, how do you stop flying in creative? I start flying upwards when i clicked spacebar. Im used to game having this, but i dint even click anything in the first place, so it made me start out flying. I did whatever I could to go back down. I even held down shift like it stated, but it still didnt work. It may have been a computer problem, along with it saying that I failed to host a server, but still. It can maybe be part of the game causing these. Though I think these flaws are overtaken by the entertainment, I recommend changing it to using steam connection so you can just invite your friends and internet problems wont happen if you can connect well to steam.

												I very much enjoy this game, you earn everything. No shortcuts, no cheating, no mega loot drops. You grind and grind and when your tired of grinding, grind more. Its a very nice game, but there is a fair amount of waiting. Which isnt really anything to complain about honestly, I hate waiting, so I put on my big boy pants and watch a movie, Tv, youtube, twitch, litterally anything on the web at your disposal. Complaints about ""It takes too long"" are people simply too impatiacent or unable to figure out that things can in gact be minimised and or put on a 2nd screen.I do have some comaplaints, but they are simply the lack of multiplayer community. Which isnt the fault of the Dev. I strongly reccomend this game if you can handle times of waiting.			"

												its a tiny bit grindy until you get used to how everything meshes togeather but for a  tower defence / crafting / survival / semi-sandboxy game it does a really good job. the dev is very active and pushes content out quite consistantly.the progression is pretty good ( for me anyway) there are several different game modes so depending on how difficult or easy you wish the game to be it is easy to tweak it. there is kind of an ""end"" in a matter of speaking but even after that there is much you can do to entertain yourself. especailly if you pickup the dlc which is nearly the same amount of play time as the base game.there are several let's plays out on youtube so go check one out and if its your kinda cup of tea than its well worth the price. or atleast thats how i feel about it and my play time kinda speaks for itself.

												Being slightly more casual than the average gamer, I do enjoy games you can wander away from.  While FortressCraft does not have a pause function, it does have the ability to go at your own pace, despite the developer mentioning once or twice in the community that style of play is discouraged.  I may be doing it wrong, but it is still fun (for me).Just having finished the second world in basic (no DLC) it is definatelly one of those games that eats time.  Sometimes it is just redesigning the logistics chains, sometimes it is waiting for research/smelting/manufacturing, and sometimes you are lost in deep caverns and swear the path home is just around here somewhere...As many other reviews have stated, it is a voxel game so it looks like many others in the genre, but definately has it's own place as a hybrid explorer/builder/tower defense.The game does not try for a hand-holding open world story experience.  This is about setting goals, and working with the randomly generated environment to achieve them.			"

												One of My favorite games. It has a very own graphics set but it is fluid and very nice to play.I watched the development for a long time even before I bought it. The main developer (and the team as well of course) are very nice. I watched many live streams on Twitch and within Steam. What I want to say, the developers and the community are very nice and polite.After the first twenty hours of gameplay I still not finished the game. Just scratched the surface of what it can be and do. It is hell of fun (just like to see how everything works once set up and what is beneath the surface).The price is quite fair (more than that), DLC prices are fair as well and these are really adding content (Frozen Factory i. e.). Other DLCs are just for supporting the devs wich is also very good done.Absolutley recommanding this title!PS: I like the cat of DJArcas. :D			"

												One of My favorite games. It has a very own graphics set but it is fluid and very nice to play.I watched the development for a long time even before I bought it. The main developer (and the team as well of course) are very nice. I watched many live streams on Twitch and within Steam. What I want to say, the developers and the community are very nice and polite.After the first twenty hours of gameplay I still not finished the game. Just scratched the surface of what it can be and do. It is hell of fun (just like to see how everything works once set up and what is beneath the surface).The price is quite fair (more than that), DLC prices are fair as well and these are really adding content (Frozen Factory i. e.). Other DLCs are just for supporting the devs wich is also very good done.Absolutley recommanding this title!PS: I like the cat of DJArcas. :D			"

												I just wanted to take moment from playing and say what a great game this is, if you like games like tekkit then this is a good game. The dev pushes out a new update every month and does a GREAT job! As soon as the DLC's are no longer on sale i plan to buy them all to help support, if you love this game as much as i have do the same and help keep the updates going!			"

												Bought this during the winter steam sale and i've been playing almost nonstop. I've only played single player so far and its pretty damn fun from an engineering standpoint. It does have a pretty steep learning curve with regard to figuring out how it works initially, but after that it's amazing.			"

												Once Upon a time, there was a man named Ballerquest, he liked games like factorio and minecraft. One day he was bored, so we went to the Steam store to look for a game that would be similar to one of the games he liked.He came across a fancy game called FortressCraft Evolved. He saw that it was almost a combination of minecraft and factorio. Ballerquest decided to download the game and tried to convince other people to get the game after that. He played the tutorial and he played and he played. He convinced one person to get the game so He can have a friend to play it with, Because he was feeling lonely due to the lack of mobs that spawned. After that person got the game Ballerquest decided to try multiplayer, soon they both found out that multiplayer required a Universal plug and play. Ballerquest’s friend went off to refund the game. Ballerquest was now depressed, so he went to play some single player on FortressCraft. About a few days after that he went to make a new game due to his confusion over power supplement. He did the tutorial quickly and went to scan for known ore veins after he scanned a bunch of fauna. (Then it happened:) After scanning, Ballerquest’s screen froze. He went to restart his computer but it would keep freezing, then he tried lowering the graphics. Still no good, He then tried to scan a bit farther away from his base. His screen would still freeze. On 1/17/2017 Ballerquest had enough with this nonsense and went to put a bad review for Fortresscraft. But he wouldn't give up so easy. He now plans to install More coolants into his computer and try again. After that he learned that there is no need to get salty over a game and that there is many other games out there that are just as good as Fortresscraft. The End.	Let your hope make you glad. Be patient in time of trouble & never stop praying.								- Romans 12:12			"

												Original: This is only half of the game. The other half is in the DLC, which should've been in the original. The game doesn't feel nearly finished, yet DLC is coming out? Developer seems to like to push content, but never polishes. Needs a lot of graphics optimization, menus are difficult to deal with, and progression is very linear for a seemingly open world game.Edit: After playing on easy difficulty, the game was MUCH less grindy and actually found the other half of the game. Menus could still use some polish, though, and graphics still need optimization.			"

												I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys creating logistical system while fighting off the native bugs.This game is quite grindy playing single player and is still developing so it might not feel quite complete at times.However the game is still in development, fast development. Developer is very interactive with the community and the community is helpful and active.The game has some awesome mechanics, some cool looking tech and allows for some brilliant designs in automation and logistics. This game will be worth your purchase if automation and logistics are the things you live for playing games like minecraft or space engineers.(also games worth buying!)			"

												Fortresscraft is a very good game. The game is about building an orbital power transmitter, load it with energy and use it to kill your enemies. You have to mine ores, automate production and build defence for your base. The mapping of the world into the Voxel landscape is good and believable. The progression is very long, very good and very fun. Whenever you are starting to get bored doing something you get a machine that does it for you. Also, i like that the frozen factory expansion ores are already in the main game, so you can continue with the expansion without having to start over. There are bugs and crashes, but i still give it a thumbs up because i never lost any progress, so i guess i can accept one crash or another.			"

												i got bunch of hours on this game probably more than 40 right now and ill keep playing it for sure  here quick  pros and cons of this game from my point of viewpros -liberty you are free to start the way you want and explore the direction you want build you base the way you like it and  automate in the order you prefer -awesome automate system really look awesome to just go and watch all machine and robots take ore smelt them take the bars make them into plate then into pod and all that really awesome-potential almost infinite  this game got huge potential it could be develop in massive amount of way lots of mode could be create and got to say map are huge Cons:  -ill just die  something you will discover ore deep way deeper than where you usually hang like -500-600  and you gonna say like i should use the elevator every 38 to make my way up after i came here collect or to refill my coal or what ever but you gonna end up count up the ressource cost to do so(since elevator is crap only +38 height is the max i made it works(and i did try multiple times)  so you end up using solutions i wont pick up my toxic filter just go down collect everything out of the storage hopper i got there and wait to die ..Dont get me wrong it work(on default setting) but it dosent feel right-conveyor going vertical i know the devs did it because people complains too much about pipes cost and i got to agree you got to do it in order to progress at decent speed(in solo play anyway)  cause building pipes requires days of farming 4 nickel if i remember right per pipe mean if you wanna extract titanium at -400  you need 1600 bars wich mean 6400 ore in the best smelter got to agree the veins you were extracting will be empty by the time you collect all those ressources for me anyway -feel lost after a while  im somewhere in the game where i need only ressource -300-400  and everything else is automate at the surface   and i got to say i wich i had more generator type or transporting type or better storage hopper ...

Posted: September 29, 2016
												First time I am writing a review here for any game! This is actually the first game where I really felt a compulsion to do so xDI'll start with a simply pro and con list for a quick reference of what to expect, before I write a bit more about it:+ lots of puzzle solving and planning ahead+ game occupies your head even when not playing it (a rarity)+ great sense of accomplishment when you see a personal project finished or succeed (I cheered when I saw my first Cargo Elevator come up fully loaded with Iron Ore, unloading it all on conveyors towards smelters)+ graphics (may sound odd for a voxel-based game, but on the higher settings it has great lighting effects+ a good intuitive 'rule-system' (the first 5 minutes is a tutorial which shows the very basic controls, but after that you will have to figure out all the rules on your own mostly, unless you want to be handheld the entire process by reading wiki's every 5 minutes. The ingame help encyclopedia (H) gives you just enough information at times, but doesn't give everything away thankfully).- Occasional bugs (I only remember falling through a lift at times, or a lift only going up to 32m instead of 64m, though that was because I was playing the game on low-end pc at the time instead of my regular pc, if I read some comments correctly)- Occasional freeze (mostly when doing multiple Coloured Ore pings too rapidly, probably my processor not being able to handle that though?)- Annoyance of the constant wasp attacks, where at one point I simply stopped building Threat Reducers since they required too much power compared to what they delivered. Besides, the penalty for not killing the wasps was absent, you only lose your command module for a minute which didn't bother me that much, since most of my power came from other devices which were not affected by the Wasp attacks.In short: Fortresscraft Evolved is an amazing game, really. I never played it's predecessor or any other 'Minecraft-clone' as people sometimes refer to these kind of voxel based games. But really, from all the MC vids I have seen, FCE really adds quite a few layers to that formula.It's been a long time since I played a game that has me thinking about it almost the entire day long. 'How am I going to deal with this or that', 'What am I going to do next?', 'What's my next project going to be' are questions that occupy my mind the entire time, even during work or on the train home :D Now, that's the sign of a great game, if you ask me.Apparently I actually bought this game during Early Access phase, but wasn't really impressed at the time (mid 2014). I only tried it out recently and it truly feels finished right now (and yet still it gets regular patches, the developer actively approaches the community for new ideas, etc.)I think the best way to express why this game is so great is through a few examples, instead of writing too generically about it. Basically the entire FCE adventure is a constant chain of small puzzles that need to be solved in order to continue:Last night I had just dug a second shaft towards a Lithium deposit, right next to an older shaft which had a Iron deposit I was already mining and sending upwards using a cargo elevator. These two shafts were only separated by a wall of 1 voxel wide. Within this wall I had also dug a 1x1 voxel wide column downwards to place the Laser Power Transmitters to send power deep into the earth (like the name says: these devices spread your power/electricity to remote places easily). However, this second shaft was right in between the bottom of the first shaft and the horizontal tunnel where I was mining the Iron. In order to keep supplying power to this horizontal tunnel whilst also delivering power downwards into the second shaft I had to fiddle around with batteries and Laser Transmitters in such a way that these devices were not in the path of either elevator shaft, yet still were in sight of the ore excavator at the end of the narrow Iron Ore tunnel. The solutions are often numerous, but each has it's up- and downsides. 'Do I dig an entire new shaft upwards just for these Laser Transmitters?', 'Do I widen the Iron Ore tunnel so I have more space for the batteries/Laser Transmitters to place inside the wall between the two elevator shafts?' or do I simply abandon the project altogether and find a new place to mine Iron. The answer to that last question is almost always: 'NEVER!'. You always want to find a solution, constantly analyzing the situation, figuring out the most efficient and best way to solve the numerous puzzles that you will be facing. And the beauty is: these puzzles are not bound by any hard limits (like most puzzles games, where you have 'levels' that you need to solve to proceed to the next) but they overflow in each other; the solution to one problem brings an entirely new problem with it! Or it might solve multiple problems at once! Also very important to acknowledge: You create your OWN puzzles! Everything you face is your own doing. You were the one that dug this shaft here. You were the one that decided to mine this Iron vein instead of that Iron vein. You were the one that decided to place certain machines too close together so that when you had to expand your base you ran out of room for lack of planning.I could name more and more examples, but I think the above illustrated perfectly the feeling you get when playing this game. You either crave that sensation or you don't (basically if you have a logical, analytical mind you enjoy this game, if not...  stay away :P ).			"

												An amazing game for the puzzle/efficiency addicts out there. I've come across from Factorio/Infinifactory, and I'm loving the increased complexity, exploration aspect and the sheer challenge of just getting to the deeper ore deposits and surviving. Taking the automation genre into 3D makes for an amazing game. The UI needs work, but once you get to grips with it, it's surprisingly easy to use. I'm personally not a fan of Minecraft, as I tend to get bored with pure survival/aesthetic building games pretty quickly. This game hits all the areas that I enjoy in one package: Exploration, problem solving, combat, automation, logistics and the challenge of tweaking your factories to improve their efficiency.The game has been rock solid stable for me and hasn't crashed once in the 50+ hours I've racked up playing, sometimes well into the small hours of the morning. I'm eagerly awaiting a more stable and comprehensive multiplayer experience. I've only just reached T2 ores, but I'll be buying the expansion anyway as a developer this good deserves support, plus I have no doubt it will add greatly to the experience.			"

												FortressCraft Evolved is a game that takes place in the distant future. You start out in  a cinematic event, in which you haplessly attempt to dock your personal spaceship into a space station, only to be ejected by a meteor impact, and to crash on  a terrible, freezing planet. At first progression is slow. You will likely need to cling to your Central Power Hub (CPH) to power your suit, or suffer a hypothermic death. Before long, you will likely set up automated means of collecting ores and smelting them into bars. There is a ladder to progression in the sense that you must set up automated mines for new tiers of ores, set up logistics to get the ore back to the base, create machines to assemble devices, and eventually upgrade you suit to go deeper and discover newer ores. However, spread out across the planet, are creatures called hiveminds. They are encased in a thick, resinous shell that can only be destroyed with high-tier explosives/machinary. After a while, the hiveminds will become a problem, as they will spawn 'mynoks' (cis) on top of your conveyer belts, which will eat passing materials. This causes the hivemind's shell to grow, until it reaches/destroys your CPH. As well as that, there are swarms of wasps that will attack your base on the surface, and will attempt to shoot acid at your CPH to destroy it. The penalties of the CPH's destruction vary from losing the CPH's power to losing the game, depending on the world's difficulty setting. There are, however, a few ways to stop this:Using your space-aged ray-gun, powered by your suitSetting up automated turrets, powered by power cellsSetting up an ARTHER turret, a simple turret powered by power cells and controlled by your companion drone, ARTHERCharging/Arming the giant spider robot that patrols your base (this only works for surface attacks)Anyway, that's about the gist of this game. If you decide to give it a try, then have fun, good luck, and happy digging!			"

												FortressCraft Evolved is a great game that gets nowhere near as much recognition as it should. Though often compared to other things like Minecraft, FC:E is far removed from the style Minecraft presents and should never be considered in the same vein.You're on an alien planet, for a start, crashlanded after a great big asteroid smashed into the station you were about to dock in. So, where to begin? Well, you start with a Central Power Hub, some simple machines, a fantastically powerful Build Gun (which is upgradeable) with which you can mow down mountains or build massive plateaus with little effort, and you have to find yourself some resources.With the handy Scanner, you must scan the world around you to be able to research new machines, ping for ores, and plunge the dark depths of the grandest caverns you have ever seen to discover new resources further down, beneath the surface.Then comes the automation part of the game, which is arguably the largest part and a great logistical challenge. You'll have to start with simple automation: getting Copper and Tin to your smelter. A few conveyors, a storage hopper or four, and before long you have bars with which to build new items, blocks and machines. Next comes Iron, which is deeper down in the ground. Then Lithium, though this ore is deep enough to attract the voracious Mynocks to your conveyors, which fuel a dark threat hidden in the caverns if they eat stuff off your conveyors. So, after having placed some turrets and provided enough power, you have Lithium safely automated.So, now with plenty of bars to spend on base expansion, what does an accomplished crash survivor like yourself have left to conquer? Worry not, for there are still several hurdles to overcome. Enemies will come to find your base, attracted by the increased energy your base produces as you expand. Vast deadly caverns lying below those precious Lithium veins provide new challenges and environmental dangers. Hiveminds stalk your base, lying in wait for that one block of conveyor not covered in turret fire to plant a Mynock on it.As your base grows, so do the dangers, so there is never a dull moment.That's all I will say, since you really should experience the game for yourself. I have more than 900 hours in this game, and I have enjoyed every one of them. There's nothing quite like putting all your hard work to use in calling a bombardment from orbit to exterminate your enemies. For the price, this game is absolutely worth it!			"

												I would describe this game as huge, complex, challenging, yet fun and outright addictive. Don't bother about the negative reviews, I think it comes mainly from players who start Fortresscraft expecting to embark on a sweet Minecraft-vanilla clone, which it is not. There is a steep learning curve, but if you can allow yourself a few hours to familiarize and learn your way around the game, you will be rewarded with a great experience.One could more or less compare this to a Minecraft with many technical mods on steroids. It also roughly resembles a 3D Factorio, in the sense that the game involves setting up huge automated assembly lines and logistics networks to provide for energy generation/distribution, ore mining/refining, transportation, research, manufacturing and base defense (nervous local fauna will harass you on a permanent basis).If you love mods like Buildcraft, Industrialcraft, etc., or games like Factorio, I definitely reccomend that you give Fortresscraft Evolved a try.

												this is one of the best games i will come across, for those people that say that its a complete rip off of minecraft they are wrong! this game adds the usual minecraft game while also allowing for making some of the best mining operations in the world ( in which I must add is that you can do that in the regular minecraft ) and what I think I is that Djarcas ( if I got that wrong sorry) is making this game completly on his own ( if he isnt well i also credit the people that work with him too ). and the thing that I love is that Djarcas keeps track and talks to the players of the game and keeps them up to date, you would not believe the amount of games i have seen that have died because the developers didnt interact with there community. all in all i would give this game a 9.98/10 (the .2 is counting for the bugs) if your looking for games like this I suggest you get this one first.

												This is, perhaps, the most under-rated game I have ever played.To be sure, it is currently (default) configured*** to be a grind-fest, with a learning-curve steeper than what could be tolerated by a casual gamer... But here it is. An unpolished gem.*** Settings can be extensively defined on start... I am considering default for comment.I'd describe it as like the planet part of Space Engineers, crossed with Factorio.It's not for everyone, for sure... But for those that like Explorers/Builders and Tower Defense games, it would be rude not to include this in your library. It does not deserve poor ratings. It's a great game, just not for everyone.

												To anyone who isn't sure about this game it's like a 3D Factorio, However this is only a comparison to understand the gameplay and not a comparison of quality or content. If this next sentence is a pun please pardon it. The fact Fortress Craft is 3d adds so much more depth to the game. I will warn you, this game is difficult to begin with but new ""missions"" guide you through the basics without actually feeling like someone is holding your hand. In my personal experience I tried to play this game and honestly I got stuck and frustrated I was trying to be reserved instead I should think big. Your save file can be created with a special mode that enables gameplay to go by a bit quicker, but even still the complexity of this game allows for so much time to be spent. Sometimes you might think, ""Is the end"",  ""have a I finished it"" and I can promise you that you'll probably stumble upon something that unlocks a whole new chapter of gameplay. I personally think it is well worth the money and as a side note the Dev are brilliant a few times I've posted on their forums about ingame queries and about 90% of those posts get a response from a Dev. The dev are always releasing bug fixes that have been brought to their attention from the players. This game is fantastic as it is but I can't wait to see what wonderous things happen in the future. Move over Minecraft FTB.			"

												I really like the idea of this game.  It is basically heavily modded minecraft meets factorio.  You are in an open world / sandbox with lots of resources.  You can explore and exploit those resourcs similar in a manner to minecraft.  However, there are enemies which wish to destroy your base, so your resources go to teching up and building defenses.  Id love to see a lot more games like this.  I had a lot of fun, but I didn't finish it.  It does have its problems.The good:It is a wonderful minecraft like game and the designer does a lot of nice things that other games can certainly take a hint from.  For example, you can access any object at any distance as long as you can see it.  IE:  To craft things you do not need to walk to your crafting table, you just have to look at it to use it.  To pull stuff out of a storage system, just look at it, even if you are 60 blocks away, and you can access it.   Then you also get a grappling hook that lets you move around very quickly.  This is an invaluable too.   There are lots of technologies and systems to build.  The Bad:The documenation is terrible.  You have to spend research points and you only have a vague idea of what it is you are getting.  You also can research things early on that you can not build for a long time, due to tech requirments.  Also sometimes there are ""packages"" of research items where buying just one item is useless because you will need to buy 2 or 3 others to complete the set.  If you spend too many RP points, you may end up stuck (although ultimatly you can get out of this hole, but it can block you for a while).   The tech tree is also just a mess and the organization on the build tab makes little sense.  Often I have to search for the item I want to craft because I have no idea what tab it belongs.    The mechanics of how to progress and how to use things are often mysterious.  There is a wiki, but it is often out of date.  You shouldn't have to use an in-game wiki.The ugly:This game is grindy.  The designer just makes things take a rediculous amount of resources in terms of materials, power requirements and crafting time.  A good example of this is some machine that will take animal parts and turn them into some generic part that you can craft items with.  This machine takes a huge amount of power, and takes 5 MINUTES to craft 1 component.  You may need 20 to 80 components to craft some of the items you want.  So for 20, you are looking at 1 hour and 40 minutes.  It gets even worse, it takes 10 raw material to get 1 component.  And gets even worse, that these components will rot unless they are put in yet another setup that is also power hungry that extends their life time.  Its nuts.That is just one example, there are others, like the 100 MILLION units of power needed to charge a certain object, that you need to do 4x.  With several stacks of turbine generators, it can still take like 4 hours per charge.  This isn't fun, its boring.  Many of the crafting recipies just require rediculous amounts of material for no good reason.Summary:For the price, the game is a great deal.  I had a lot of fun with it until the grind killed me.  Maybe Ill check it out again in 6 months to a year.			"

												While this game isn't really interesting (repetitive), it's really fun to finally see your creations begin working. Finding the ores and mining them and crafting new things and making power sources is awesome, and I'd say if you liked Factorio or automating stuff in general, this game's for you.			"

												FortressCraft Evolved is a very fun game to play. I really like the automation focus of the game and even though the main premise is somewhat cheesy it's actually executed pretty well.  Basically, the game starts off where you crash land on a cold planet and you need to survive by finding new resources to upgrade your base so that you can continue to have your marvel-of-technology exosuit powered and therefore keep you warm and happy. I won't go into any more detail, but if you like base-building ad automation games you should give this a try.Don't mind my hours, I play this game offline mostly. "

												An amazing game for the puzzle/efficiency addicts out there. I've come across from Factorio/Infinifactory, and I'm loving the increased complexity, exploration aspect and the sheer challenge of just getting to the deeper ore deposits and surviving. Taking the automation genre into 3D makes for an amazing game. The UI needs work, but once you get to grips with it, it's surprisingly easy to use. I'm personally not a fan of Minecraft, as I tend to get bored with pure survival/aesthetic building games pretty quickly. This game hits all the areas that I enjoy in one package: Exploration, problem solving, combat, automation, logistics and the challenge of tweaking your factories to improve their efficiency.The game has been rock solid stable for me and hasn't crashed once in the 50+ hours I've racked up playing, sometimes well into the small hours of the morning. I'm eagerly awaiting a more stable and comprehensive multiplayer experience. I've only just reached T2 ores, but I'll be buying the expansion anyway as a developer this good deserves support, plus I have no doubt it will add greatly to the experience.			"

												FortressCraft Evolved is a game that takes place in the distant future. You start out in  a cinematic event, in which you haplessly attempt to dock your personal spaceship into a space station, only to be ejected by a meteor impact, and to crash on  a terrible, freezing planet. At first progression is slow. You will likely need to cling to your Central Power Hub (CPH) to power your suit, or suffer a hypothermic death. Before long, you will likely set up automated means of collecting ores and smelting them into bars. There is a ladder to progression in the sense that you must set up automated mines for new tiers of ores, set up logistics to get the ore back to the base, create machines to assemble devices, and eventually upgrade you suit to go deeper and discover newer ores. However, spread out across the planet, are creatures called hiveminds. They are encased in a thick, resinous shell that can only be destroyed with high-tier explosives/machinary. After a while, the hiveminds will become a problem, as they will spawn 'mynoks' (cis) on top of your conveyer belts, which will eat passing materials. This causes the hivemind's shell to grow, until it reaches/destroys your CPH. As well as that, there are swarms of wasps that will attack your base on the surface, and will attempt to shoot acid at your CPH to destroy it. The penalties of the CPH's destruction vary from losing the CPH's power to losing the game, depending on the world's difficulty setting. There are, however, a few ways to stop this:Using your space-aged ray-gun, powered by your suitSetting up automated turrets, powered by power cellsSetting up an ARTHER turret, a simple turret powered by power cells and controlled by your companion drone, ARTHERCharging/Arming the giant spider robot that patrols your base (this only works for surface attacks)Anyway, that's about the gist of this game. If you decide to give it a try, then have fun, good luck, and happy digging!			"

								Over all, I liked it. At its core it is a game where you attempt to maximize your automation for crafting. Overall, I think it works well. ATM monsters don't seem to attack, so your only real danger is freezing to death.Your best option starting out, once you have learned to feed coal to the hub is to build a combustion engine. That pluss a storage bin is the best posible source of portable power, with it you can mine using the hyperbeam for a very fast early source of materials.			"

												so after a hiatus from FCE i've managed to rack up another 25 hours in the last 3 days, suffice it to say this game has improved signifigantly since i last played (around the time my first review was written) my previous review was full of candor, i was only trying to point some the holes in the progression.i would like to add, for anyone who had read my previous review ... i went into the game expecting a different game experience and it relfected that disappointment in my review. in any case i was happily surprised when i started up a new world again. before the game was simply too easy, 1 million+ piece ore veins and no hostile mobs were my biggest issues. the tech tree progression is a lot smoother now and makes more sense. Pros:-extensive tech tree progression ( lots of new higher tier machines)-survival is more apparent now-unique mobs-early game progression is much more balanced -more building blocks added (windows and a few others)-very few bugs/glitches ... reletively polished-new base defense system .. awesome :)Cons:-still some unfinished UI elements, nothing gamebreaking-no penalty for death-still no compass or map feature of any kind  .. lost your base? easy, dieing is the fastest way to find your base :)-the giant Spider bot like to step all over you a lot :P (doesn't affect gameplay but is annoying when trying to see something its standing on lol)now knowing what to expect from FCE has been a better experience for myself, so if you resource/power management and logistics and really strange mobs trying to hinder your progess constantly then grab this game. side note: the Developer seems to be a lone wolf on this game so dont' expect a lot of new content to be added on a schedule like other games. updates a little slower for this game but the dev is working his tail off to produce this game :)			"

There is a lot more you can mess with in Creative mode, but I prefer being able to actually do things, otherwise its just like art... pretty to look at but meh.Its lookin good!Old review: ...meh.  The Steam version is not really worth playing, at the moment.  It was made for another system, and the port to PC over Steam is unfinished.  You can get started, on survial mode, but there is no way to progress too far before hitting a wall.  Maybe in a year or two...			"

												Normally I can't be bothered to write a review for a product but this developer has pushed my buttons.Only buy this if you are going to play exactly the way the dev wants you to otherwise he will take what you want to do awayThe game is good, no arguement there or it was good. Now the developer continues to push his agenda of forcing people to play the game the way it was ""designed"". The 150 ore limit is my breaking point. Sometimes I like to wait to do the automation because I'm working on another project that required that I use x material that I just found. I am much more interested in getting that project working. That is wrong. I should be automating extraction first according to the dev. Bad news man Creative Intent ends as soon as you let someone else touch the thing. Let me know where the inventory controls are in the source files and I will be happy to change my mind but I dont like being told how to play. I will get around to automating but on my schedule not on the size of my inventory. It is a dumb change to make this long after the game has been release. This is only the change that set me off. There have been uncountable numbers of changes that accomplish exactly the same goal. Edit:As promised Someone provided me with the answers that I wanted which is a work around. Still annoyed that I have to work around the developer but as long as that is an option I won't knock the game. Still fun.			"

Early Access Review
								When I first read the game description I got quite excited as I thought of it as a Minecraft in a more futuristic environment. I've been playing for a few hours now and I find it rather frustrating. Mainly because some of the features just don't make sense and are not well explained and the worst of all: survival you're basically locked to just one world, it's NONSTOP snowy and windy and all you actually hear is the generator's humming and the wind blowing. So not only does the frustration add up, it's basically also very frustrating.I made the mistake and got my brother a license as well as multiplayer was announced and again... was very disappointed as many features were not included and to date I have not managed to actually get a server running and even if I managed, it basically would only be a creative server. No thanks.It doesn't help that the EarlyAccess information box targets a release towards the end of 2014. It's 2015 now and still far away from release. Worse: if you follow the dev's twitter (or twitch) account, you can actually follow him streaming other games. I think I stopped following him after he started playing the borderlands pre-sequel and even gloated about how much he played and streamed recently... at the time mostly borderlands. I wonder at what stage he actually tries to finish the game, rather than playing and streaming other games but his own. Obviously not much, otherwise the game probably would have been finished before the end of 2014 as promised. And I will not go into all the whining he does on Twitch and Twitter how bad money making is via steam and that he could do with a bit more games being sold etc... So far, I cannot recommend this game at all if you're interested in the survival part. I cannot talk about the creative part, but then again - it says it's survival... and as that part is certainly by far not close to be finished or any good for that matter.- world setup basically non-existant (other than free name choice)- world setup features that are in with placeholders restrict to things like difficulty, and I think the amount of resources- world setup cannot change the world you're landing on, or the weather, so you'll forever be stuck with annoying nonstop wind sounds... snow... cold... and wind... and snow... and wind... if you don't die of hypothermia, you'll either die real-life of boredom or the after-math of a depression- it's nice that conveyor-belts etc. are being big announced in the screenschots but what's the point if it doesn't explain how the system works (and that's a big downer in general... many features have no explanation, i.e. research, what gives points, why would you scan things, what's the point... etc.) and for some of the resources I ran back and forth (very repetitive) for an hour and only had enough resources for one item, far away from any automatism... I wonder how some other players managed that.Anyway, the game has been released December 10th in 2013. It's January 2015 and game is still in EarlyAccess. That should answer if you really want to buy this game or not. If you don't believe me, feel free to follow his twitch and twitter accounts. I unfollowed the dev on all platforms shortly after his borderlands streaming, if I could, I would have requested my money back at that point.			"

												Absolutely fantastic game!Sci-fi voxel game with cool machines, lasers, weapons and monsters!FCE is a great construction/destruction type game that offers a lot of depth and creativity and I fully recommend it.You will enjoy this if you enjoyed these other games:From The DepthsFCE isnt as complex but still has a technical aspect and is very stisfying when everything works well like you imagined.TerrariaFCE is more tilted to the scifi and is 3d of course.  It feels very progressive, like terraria, and you are only limited by your imagination.Anarchy OnlineThe grind in FCE is there of course, and is very adjustable...so much so that it feels like your not grinding at times. Anarchy online of course is not a construction type game, but it has great character progression and a satisfying curve, like FCE.If you mash the 3 games mentioned above together, you get a simulacrum somewhat like Fortresscraft Evolved...I love it.  My brother and I play together on our own server and we both highly recommed it!Anyway, just my 2cents.			"

								This game has potential but it has to be the less polished game I ever bouth on early released. I bought it expecting some quality, beeing that its a port of a 3 years old game on a past-gen console, and one of the best xbox arcade game. But as of now this game is not recomendable and you should wait if what you want is a game that is enjoyable to play. If you go in you should know that there is a lot of cliping bugs and the UI is barely usable as of now. I gotta say i havent tried creative mode yet, but this is not what im interested in.This said 6.99$ is not a lot if the games ends up to be what it has the potential to be, and helping the developers could end up in a better game or it being released earlier.UPDATE: I was wrong saying its a port because the developers are rewrinting the game entirely, but I still think the game is not recomandable at the moment and if your looking for a new game to play look further cause this is barely a demo as of now			"

								This review is about version 1.8.  I would normally change it as the game improved, but I'm not going to because the developers swarm anyone who posts a negative review. You should avoid buying this game just because it's made by a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who try to shut down any criticism with ad hominem attacks. You're not missing anything anyway. Game's pretty crappy.Original review:Survival game is essentially unplayable in it's current state. Multiple menus don't work, large ""under construction"" images appear in critical places, like say THE INVENTORY. You have to stand exactly 2.5 blocks away from torches or you die. To place a dirt block you have to first find it in a list of 150 items. Critical functions are hidden in multi key commands . Want to progress at all? Better hit alt-M to locate minerals, had to dig that one out of an online guide, along with everything else because the game options menu doesn't even work enough to look at the controls.It's an early access game. I get that. What I'm saying may not apply in a few months, but for now, version 1.8, that survivial trailer on the steam page is misleading at best, an outright fabrication at worst. Steer clear.

								I have mixed feelings about FortressCraft. Granted it is still in development so I'm going to forgive a lot of things, but anyhow.This is by all accounts a MineCraft copycat with a few extra features. The graphics aren't nearly as pixelated as minecraft but most of the blocks 'glisten'. though one good feature is the fact that I can copy and paste structures to quickly create buildings and landscapes and the number of block types is also really nice. controls are a bit unresponsive and result in a lot of misplaced blocks. there is also a seemingly infinite range for placing/removing blocks which, while at sometimes is really nice, is actually quite frustrating when you accidentally delete a block on the otherside of your building and have to trudge all the way over there to place it again. FortressCraft Evolved has a lot of potential to be better than MineCraft but at the moment I recomend sticking with MineCraft.			"

Early Access Review
								AT THE POINT OF WRITING THIS THE GAME IS IN EARLY ACCESS ~6/16/2015~This game looks and seems like it could have a lot of potential but in the current state that it is in I cannot and will not recommend this game. There is pretty much little to no content that really keeps it worth while in the current state. I played 1.2 hours of this in survival mode and pretty much just gave up on it because, for one the content that is in survival mode is little to none other then just ore automation and two once you get it all up and running there is nothing to use your precious ores that you have collected and you just feel like you have wasted time. The upgrades in the game are all still in development so you cant really upgrade anything either so you don't really win at all.One huge mistake is they went upon development backwards in my opinion! They started the game out as multiplayer and did single player as a add on when they should have focused upon single player which would provide more things to do. Without a good single player core how do you expect to have a good multiplayer? It doesn't really make sense at all to me at least... Which makes me kind of sad cause this game looks like it has a lot of potential but in the current form I really just cant say too much good about it.Please Dev's don't give up on this game because of all the hate! Just keep working at it :) If the game gets to a more playable and enjoyable state I will change this review! What we need is more things to craft,upgrade, and just simply do more then building a red and blue house with our buddies. If we really wanted to do that we would get together and get out the old legos from our shelf!So overall I wouldn't recommend buying this at the current state simply not enough content and things to do!

												I really wanted to like this game. The grapple mechanic is really cool, so are the glowsticks, the hiveminds are huge and imposing, and it runs pretty well. But there are multiple design decisions that are very annoying, and I found myself asking ""why?!"" much more often than any game since the n64 days.Here are some of the thoughts I had in the first couple hours:Is it day out? All the fog and excessive shadows are making it really hard to see stuff. Maybe I can change the gamma in the settings. I can't? That's annoying, I'll just turn off the shadows. Okay... nothing changed, that's annoying.Wow, that's a deep hole. Maybe I can find some or down there. Wait, why did it suddenly get so dark? I could see everything when I was looking down, and I can still see the lit sky above me. That's annoying.Good god! What the hell is that damned noise? Oh, it means there's a crystal nearby. I don't need those yet, so I'll just turn down that sound. Oh I can't... that's annoying.Okay, I have some ore extractors set up with automated power delivery. I should automate smelting next. Oh, I can't make  a smelter without some research. It's annoying that I need to do research for something so basic. Fine, i'll move my starting smelter so I don't need to wste time carting resources. I can't? That's annoying.Well, if I can't bring my smelter to the ore, I'll bring ore to the smelter. Wow, the conveyor belts are pretty expensive in terms of resources AND time because of the lack of smelters. I'm going to need a lot of these too. This is pretty annoying. Oh cool, lifts are much better for getting in/out of my iron and lithium mine than the grapple. Oh shoot, I can't actually get the lift shaft all the way down because there's an errant coal vein in the way that I can't remove. That's really annoying.Geez, I finally found enough of this obscure resource that I can't scan for to make smelters for all the starting materials. I finally can begin sutomating something interesting. How long has it been? 4 hours... huh... I don't feel like I've completed very much. That's annoying...Do you see the pattern here? "

								I have a hard time recommmending this game yet. A lot of the ideas are there, but it is super unpolished, and there are things that just don't make sense.  I need some more time with it for sure, but initial impressions aren't the best. It looks like if you can get past the lack of a good tutorial/help guide and can figure things out on your own you can build and do some neat stuff.I do applaud the developer for trying to make a mine craft style game with more objectives and focus.

Last two patches I haven't seen any of the bugs I encountered disappear, Seems as though none of the changes actually took place mentioned in the changelog. Had this game for about a year and only seen the 1 update. Disappointed cause I bought multiple copies for friends when it came out.  Would not recommend it.			"

												This is a game that definitely pertains to creating a factory out of the world, and it's a great idea. The environment is nice and it gives a basic tutorial on how things work. However, for all of the advanced information on how everything comes together to become a complex automatic system, you're mostly on your own. I usually like to do everything personally, and this just doesn't work for me; it ALL depends on your machines to do the dirty work for you. I won't simply smack it down for others. As a matter of fact, it's a great game for industrialistic people who want to create an advanced system that works effectively. But if you are patient, and you aren't a fan of these types of mechanics, then I would say it's best to look elsewhere.			"

Early Access Review
								Short version:FortressCraft is basically a Minecraft + tech mod clone, minus Minecraft's charm. With a side of difficuilt and awkward to use interface. Plus an extra helping of bugs (even for early access). Not recommended. Longer version:On startup Fortresscraft greets you with possibly the most detailed and intricate menu ever. This turned out to be a bad omen though as it's also possibly the most difficuilt to use menu ever. Difficuilt to the point of needing a tutorial to navigate. However after much random mouse button mashing I managed to overcome this hurdle and start a new survival world. Alas, I was one of the lucky few. We should spare a moment of thought for all those poor souls who failed to navigate the main menu, and instead flocked to Steam's forum for a solution... on how to use the main menu.Once the world had loaded and the ringing in my ears caused by the really LOUD crashing ship passed I came to another hurdle, the help screen. I quickly browsed over the help text and tried taking in as many hotkeys as I could. There are a number of them as the only way to select a tool is with a hotkey. Which you can't rebind. After skimming the help screen I tried to close it by pressing escape, nothing. Tried clicking on stuff, nothing. Only after rolling my face across the keyboard, not once, but twice! Was I finally rid of the cursed help screen. (edit: The escape key sort of works in the latest version)With arch-villan help screen defeated I was finally able to take in the world, the very bland world. This is where the clone shows through. Even the block's textures have that familiar MInecraft look, albeit high resolution. All other voxel games have moved away from cubes into their own form of voxels, and all of those new voxel games feel nice and fresh.  So coming back to a cube game can feel a bit underwhelming. Made worse by a world that has nothing going on. It's just snow and the occassional tree. Totally lacking in features that convince you this is an alien world.The actual game, in it's current state, is centered around building an automated mining network similar to many Minecraft tech mods where you have mining machines that feed a conveyor of some sort. You then need a power network to run those machines etc.  So far the stuff in game is similar to stuff I've seen in mods. Which isn't a bad thing. Expanding on these ideas could lead to somewhere interesting. But.And it's a big but. This game has a lot strange design features that either take away player agency or are there to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Like the decision to go against the convention of every other game in this genre, and reverse the block breaking and block placing mouse buttons. Those buttons are so ingrained now that I'm constantly wrecking my machines or digging holes when I meant to place a machine, infuriating. Then there is the bizarre inventory mechanic where you can't choose what you put into a machine. The game decides for you and it's pretty much always the wrong choice. So you have to wait around for the machine to finish then hope it chooses the correct material next go around.  Finally the inventory or lack of. The inventory is just for show it lets you know how much of each block you are carrying and that's it. Since it's non-interactive you can't organise it or anything you can usually do with an inventory. The only thing it lets you do is spew blocks everywhere via another hotkey. A number of those blocks will often get lost because of physics bugs. Spewing is the only way to get stuff from your inventory into a storage container. The problem being another container in the vicinity will suck up your block spew. Meaning you need to empty that container then try again. As you imagine can this becomes a real chore, real quick. "

								What a joke. Bought this game for $3 and deeply regret my purchase. The movement and mouse acceleration make this game unplayable. Ordinary things like mining, block placement, construction seem very hard to execute. Building a house is such a frustrating thing that makes you rage quit. Also the distance view algorithm is a weird one. As the world spawns around you, its made in this weird animation thingy that looks like blocks falling from the sky. At first I didn't know what it is, it seemed like a glitch or something. Anyway the problem is that this paralax effect induces nausea for people with motion sickness. After 30 minutes or playtime I felt so sick that I had to stop playing and have no incentive to play this ever again.The Ideea seems good but the execution is terrible. I do not recomend this game.My rating: 2/10			"

								I remember when I first encountered Minecraft on a fluke. I figured hmm, this looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥visually but the concept sounds good. Several hours later.... what just happened? Did the game combine a metric ton of fun and interesting core elements making it ""stupid"" addictive... yep. It'd been a long time. I figured I'd snatch this $9 game called FortressCraft Evolved while I was browsing other titles. That's well spent. Even in its current form there's a good amount to experiment with.If you're impatient but also want to play survival you can modify some core xml files related to resources and a few other things. Mess around and enjoy.If you like these types of games there's quite a few that suck ballz and aren't worth playing for free. FortressCraft Evolved is one worth the current price. Time will tell as it ""evolves"" how much more it may be worth. Odds seem in its favor based on what I see in the content and its direction.			"

The Main Menu screen serves as a warning for the terrible menu & GUI systems to come.  A basic UI is not only easier to design, but also more useable.

								where do i eve start? first the good points, it's basically miecraft with a built in tekkit mod, which i find to be amazing and if not better than both minecraft and the tekkit mod itself, why you ask? let me explain, FCE literally has infinite worlds, with no block height either, leaving the possibility to build things on a scale previously never seen in a voxel type game, there is a complete method to automate everything, which if like me you hate spending continuous hours digging and mining, is perfect, ad using tekkit as my example here, unlike tekkit where nothing is really self explanetary and you spend longer looking at a wiki page finding exactly what you need to build what in terms of resource and machine's, this gives you the basics, collect ore, smelt and craft and thats it, sure it's a pain locating said ore, but heh you get that in minecraft, the difference is i find an ore vien in MC and i get 10 ore from it, here you can get hundreds of thousands of ore before it is depleted thats a win. another plus is the fact it runs on unity... unity is great, it really is and it plays wonderfully on my low end laptop without any lag spikes, bugs or glitches, which is brilliant.now, the bad points, (yes i understand it is early access and things take time) while there is a survival mode, there is nothing survival about it other than you can freeze to death which sure, is a cool mechanic, but easily avoidable, the ingame 'guide' feel's to be lacking in information, like whats the little icon next to the lamp icon? and what is the secondary battery? things like that could use some further explination, some of the textures are a little low quality and seem 'cheap' like basic model designs, the tool for example, the animation makes the whole think look like all the parts are just hovering there and aren't really connected to each other, but thats not exactly game breaking.summery: basically this is a great game, while it lacks the features other games provide with mods, this has everything as stock, it runs brilliantly on even low end machines and i can only imagine what it loks like on a top end rig, as it is early access there are still plenty of things that can be improved on and added, which given how much i feel i get for this game paid £1.49 during a sale, is great, would i pay full price for this? as it stands sadly no i wouldnt, when more is added? certainly, at the time of review i have spent 8.2 hours game time having purchased it only two days ago, 10/10 will recommend			"

								I write this Review because of the especially bad reactions of the developers, the game itself has possibilities (after many improvements).I suspect that the developers really do not know who their customers are and this is actually very important thing in gaming, you depends on them. I see this because of some of your responses towards negative reactions and to normal questions, many of these reactions are quite bluntly and in most cases when you get a reaction like that in a store you walk to the next store.And who are your clients ?? ..... I a gamer and beside me hundreds of other gamers. We have not always right but we do have when it comes to our game experiences. Besides, we are not your enemy but an ally (as gamers we want to help you), but we take care of our own brothers (fellow gamers) protects for mistakes we have experiance our selfs.Last week began Fortress Craft Evolved again, because i got new information and I went deeper into the game. Because when I bought the game a year ago, the game was a disappointed for me and I marked it as not playable - Creative mode was boring for me and i didenn't have a goal and i didden't know there was a survival mode back then.Now I'm starting over again (I discovered the survival mode) and I try to find some reading matirial on the game, but there where nearly none (there are a number YourTubers). Unfortunately, that is because there is no community behind the game.How come there is no community? Then I come back to my beginning, by the failt of communication from you as developers, what result is that gamers have no connection with the game and walk away. Why should I as a gamer take part of a community when the developer think they are better than me?I also know quite annoing to read bad things of your game, it's your baby, I also know that a bad reaction can hit hard and that the first reaction is to hit hard back in respond to it, but usually that is wrong. I would recommend writing a response, wait a day, after reading your responce like you  get the as customer get the response, throw your reaction away and write a respones you as your customer would like to get. It is all about your customers not about you as a developer/person. Every reaction you get is not an attack on you (exept this one), every reaction is there to make your baby better.Give customers love you and they give love back but give them hate you get hate back.I also promise to them when I notice that you as developers improve your behavior, my opinion (like many others) wil chance to the better. Because we as gamers want the best game as posable game and a few even better developers, but like the game you are not at your full potential and i feel i have to call you on your bad habbits.			"

Early Access Review
								Lacks polish on every corner unfortunately. Yes this is an early access title and yes EA can have bugs. That's not what i'm talking about.The overall concept of the game is great.The balancing and core ideas of the game are great too. It's very clever above all how the progression in survival works and forces you to preserve materials on every corner even after a couple of hours.But just about every core feature that's in the game feels irky / buggy to work with:The bad- Right click accidentally with your building gun on any machine and it will deconstruct Losing ressources that were in it and generally being a nuisance.- The whole interface is very problematic, disappearing cursor, unintuitive controls, buttons that dont work as they should. Nothing gamebreaking, you eventually learn how to work around them. Inconsistent use overall. (Some things require ""e"" to charge them, some need to be opened first for instance...) Annoying nevertheless.- The Energy and Transport system are cool but very annoying to work with. Moving a line one block lower because you misjudged something and built it a bit off, good luck with that, will cost you a ♥♥♥♥♥on of ressources and a blob of interconnecting logisticshoppers.- Energytransfer. We have lasers that transfer power over 64 blocks but no cables that distribute power to something 2 blocks away. Instead you have to kinda misuse batteries to connect things. I suspect it's because of the 1 block 1thing development philosophy that this game went for. In the early days of Industrialcraft over at Minecraft they used cables that measured 1 x 1meter... not a perfect solution but at least you had something to work with. If there is anything in the techtree then it's way to far down. (Solar panels before basic cables ? Really ?)- The energy grid is very simplistic and lacks complexity once you see through it. It's just batteries / machines that have energy, or they dont now distribute evenly with limited tools.- Combat... should have left it out, it just looks really bad and unfinished and doesnt add anything to the game.- Once you have a bigger base you need some sort of navigating tools so you can dig straight tunnels to where you need them because the game is seriously annoying if you have to build 2-3 blocks to connect things. The game has a holomap for that and a map that is very confusing to use and needs alot of time to get used to. Simple coordinates on the scanner would have solved this problem entirely, but no, we have a bloated graphics effect.- Death doesnt mean anything. It just ports you back with ALL ressources. Take the survival aspect out of it if death is meaningless.- Unnecessary robots flying around in your face, and the spiderbot. Have fun with the spiderbot, it doesnt do anything except block your view in your base day in and day out.- The Scanner doesnt work proper. While the scanner is cool if you scroll the mousewheel once up or down you see that the thing is buggy. Pretty much sums up how such an easy spottable bug got past the Dev or that he didn't care about it.- Graphics are somewhat dated. Not a huge thing.- The name... has nothing to do with fortresses, should have named it Factorycraft or something.- Multiplayer is very buggy. The dev is not capable of reproducing alot of the reported issues. We could reproduce them on every single client in the first try. Well... yeah.Whats cool:- Ore distribution is really cool and works better than in minecraft as it forces you to branch out the base naturally and think of ways to make things easier.- The Scanner is cool.- Energysystem of your suit forces you to be carefull about your ressources.- Progression is really smart and fun. You can't just step away 10 hours and then have a ♥♥♥♥♥on of ressources, the limited automated storages make sure of that.All in allI get the feeling that whoever programmed this is potentially a great game designer but shouldn't be the person who pushes out any releases. Have someone that does quality control and treat this as a conceptual prototype. The game lacks an overall control / ui concept and now wants to leave Early Access.			"

								If any game needs a wiki it's FortressCraft Evolved! This game seems to have so much potential and it's still in the early development stages. It's highly playable, even with the occasional bug or world glitch here and there.  I've played a good three hours and still have yet to explore this games full potential in it's current state. There's just so much to do! If I had to pick one thing that bugs me a bit it's the asthetic to the game. It doesn't look the best. There are some odd colours and a number of the machines look a bit too quirky. Hopefully they will do some remodels and re-textures to make the machines and lands look more consistent with themselves. I'm sure the devs will! All in all, if you like sandbox/survival games and you're looking to make sweet fortresses with working lifts that take you down into the depths of your world and much MUCH more, buy it. BUY IT NOW!Love it.			"

												This is a well thought developer's dream of a building/exploration game in a voxel world that wants you to build a self sustaining mining-ish operation. I say mining-ish because your resources are 99% dug out of the ground, but this isn't just a dig and build kind of game. You need power to live, you get power through different means. One of these means that takes it away from just mining are things like solar energy and the ability to store the electricity in batteries. If you like a sandboc voxel game and the idea of building a self-sustaining operation this game is for you. There is also a creative mode, but I can't speak much on this because that is simply not my general area of interest. The early game has a very good push to make you want to expand and evolve. The energy requirement to keep you alive feels very real when the game starts and after about 30 minutes of keeping yourself alive I most certainly experienced the wanting to keep myself alive with less direct input and the only solution to this was building things to sustain themselves. I would say I have done about 50% of what can/could be accopmlished in an average scope of the game (not a 100% copmletionist have to get every achievement kind of view). One way I like to way games is how many good hours a got per dollar. Currently I have 65 hours and I believe I bought it at $10 (USD). That's 6.5 hours per dollar which is far above my threshold of a game that should be considered bad if you play it less than 1 hour per dollar. I definitely got hooked on this game and stayed up late hours wanting to keep playing.  One of the best things I can say for this game is the small development team. The developer is ALL OVER THE FORUM. The developer always wants more feedback and seems to spend all day speaking to players and improving the game. It gets updated constantly and has a well thought out road map of what is next.  I would say invest now. Get your money's worth and enjoy I great new take on a voxel game. Also, I forgot it is moddable and the community will help with that. TL;DRIt's a good game. (I don't give 0-10/10 because it is meaningless in a 1 paragraph review). This game is worth your money and has a great theme and support to become even greater.			"

												I am addicted to this game at the time i wrote this review, while the game is still in development i reccomend getting it. Basically this game is what you get when you mix Minecraft, a few of it's more technecal mods like Industrialcraft and Buildcraft and turn it into a full blown game. If you're a fan of Minecraft with those two mods then you should definitely play this, if you're a fan of voxel games in general i also think this is worth a try.When you start off you're about to dock at a space station in the middle of a meteor shower when it's hit by an asteroid and you come crashing down to the planet below because of that. At the moment your goal is to build up a base, research the local enviroment for things you can use and send some power in orbit so your buddies in orbit can get the damaged station running. While you're doing this you have to defend yourself from the local wildlife and trying to prevent the illusive hive mind from spreading and destroying any clump of resin you find on your travels as these will give you useful rewards.Let's start off with the bad:- The game is still quite buggy and unstable (when i wrote the review) and multiplayer is even more unstable. Running the game at a graphic quality setting higher than good will almost guarantee your game will crash if not your computer at the moment.- Enemies are quite buggy, going through blocks and if they die while inside of a block they could end up breaking the block they're inside.- The game punishes you if you mine ores yourself as you barely get any ore out of veins which forces you to rely on your trusty ore extractors.- This game is fairly hands off especially late game.- The game is also quite CPU heavy, if your computer has a weak processor i'd say either upgrade or avoid this game until you do get an upgrade.Now the good:+ The worlds are randomly generated which can be good especially if you get a good seed with loads of bigger ore veins. You can even change a few settings in relation to the map such as how common ore is, how fast conveyors move items about and how strong the enemies are and so on.+ While the progression has a few places that can be improved i think the devs have more or less nailed it.+ There are a set of upgrades for your suit, your floating bot called Arthur and later on the massive spiderbot that helps you defend your base.+ Automation is fun, especially when you get all four of the starter ores and you can build a basic power grid with coal generators, batteries to store energy and lasers to transfer energy from your generators to your extractors, turrets, even your forward outposts which you will need later on as you go deeper into the planet.+ This game is so much better with friends, although you can only play cooperatively at the moment as everyone shares the same base but you do all have your own inventories.+ The devs are very active, they try to push a patch out every month and sooner if the game has a massive problem. Every now and then they'll even throw in a feature that someone has suggested, complete with an achievement if you do use something a community member has suggested.+ The game has a creative mode which has been massively improved upon from the original Xbox 360 game, even the detail blocks have come over from there.+ If you have a massive problem with your game or computer there's a neat little system which aims to lower the chance your world will break as a result.+ Research is interesting especially when you get the lab, you scan the local enviroment and analize those scans to find out what they are and get a few research points for your efforts which you spend on new recipes and early on new technologies. When you research a new technology you'll either get something useful or a new technology which can give you something useful.+ On the technical side (at least i've heard) FortressCraft is one of those few games that makes good use of all your CPU cores no matter what so if you have a CPU with loads of weaker cores so if your machine doesn't have a CPU with a set of fewer, stronger cores then you might be in luck. This can be good news especially for AMD people as AMD CPUs (as far as i know) tend to boast a higher CPU core count compared to Intel CPUs of a comparable model.			"

												Starting out can be rough, depending on your world. I tried a couple before I found one I was happy with. It will take time.The game is heavily based around automation, so you can continue to dig deeper and find new things, then automate those new things to get it all back to your base. At first, you will have to babysit things. You simply don't have the resources to get things rolling on their own for the first hour, maybe two. Watch a couple of videos on it. You'll see how others do things, you'll get a good understanding of the basics, and you'll have some ideas as to how to set your own system up. It takes a lot of time to really get a lot going on, but if building up to that isn't your cup of tea, then I might advise a different game type. There are several more mechanics at play here than in MineCraft, and pretty much any other game in this vein. It takes a lot of the concepts explored in Space Engineers, removes space, and instead focuses on mining materials and setting them up to work for you.			"

I'm glad you have. However, you were in the habit of simply posting a single paragraph followed by a link. If I (We) wanted to know more we had to follow the link and/or search for the patch info on our own. Yes, I know. It's not very difficult to do so. Especially if your game is the only one I care about. It'd likely take me 2-5 minutes to locate a change log. It gets rather annoying when you have a dozen, or even hundreds of titles in your library. And frankly, I'm getting more and more tired of hunting such info down. I've uninstalled many that either do not patch very often, or patch but don't inform their fans what they're installing on their systems.Maybe some things have changed. Or rather, obviously some things have changed. Or one thing? Never mind, I'll change my review. The reason for the review was because i was uninstalling several games. I considered uninstalling Fortresscraft, then noticed I still hadn't written a review of it even though I've had it for well over a year. Maybe over 2 yrs. And what I wrote is what I remembered about the game.			"

								I'm going to preface this review with this short statement: I ""recommend"" this game because I think not recommending it is too harsh. Read on if that confuses you.I've played a lot more Minecraft in my time than I'm prepared to discuss. There's a lot wrong with that game, and FortressCraft Evolved seems to be on the right path to fixing it. I've always found creative mode in Minecraft to be dull - for me, there needs to be the chance of failure/death, no matter how slight.  I've always hated the amount of time that goes to waste just trying to mine blocks in Survival, though, and FortressCraft has taken a great direction mixing the two. I don't really appreciate that the only way you can die is freezing to death... I know you can take some form of fall damage (with a really annoying screen effect), but I don't actually know if it can kill you. But! It's Early Access, and I can appreciate that these things take time.A few suggestions I would make, assuming that the developer(s) read(s) this:-Portable block identification. Some way to make it not a pain to go back to ""home base"" and have to identify things before you can use them. I get that it's unrealistic for Steve? the wandering hobo to magically know what iron ore looks like and how to use it, but it's willing suspension of disbelief. Honestly, I would more readily believe that a space-man on what was probably a mining ship has basic earth metals committed to memory. -Make the particle effect for ""home base"" visible on low graphics (that is, if we really have to have home base to begin with). There was an interesting glitch when I first started up the game that made the ship just fly off into infinity instead of crashing to ground. Since I started the game on fastest graphics, the purple light particle never showed up... unless the ship legitimately never crashed and flew across the endless map. I reset that world anyway, so we may never know.-The way chunks load is entertaining, but I feel like that has to be taking up CPU that could be used a bit more responsibly. I don't personally know enough about this to go in depth about it, just kind of suggesting that the animation be dropped in favor of chunks ""popping"" into existence.In the end, the game is solid, and I really believe it has potential. It's not going to be the Minecraft killer, but that's alright, since Minecraft is enough of a danger to itself. There's plenty of bugs to iron out, but like I already said, these things take time. All I can really hope for is that these guys aren't the Terraria team in disguise, making a quick buck and running off, leaving an orphaned game that could be much more.			"

Early Access Review
								So far this game is pretty great considering it is still early access.I haven't personally had any bugs or game crashes.  Game loads very quickly as well as the world generation or world loading as you move around.At the time of writing this I'm 14 hours in and still haven't reached mid game.  I would guess even at the early access level of development there is at least 60 hours of entertainment to be found.If you're a fan of minecraft you might like this game, if you're a fan of factorio or crafting / automating style of games you'll really enjoy it.The only negatives at the moment I have is that there is no real threat in surivial mode death just spawns you back to your base, and mobs have not been added yet, but again, still in development and the games current status works well.  Also the progression to being able to do anything efficiently besides manual filling/unloading miners, hoppers, etc. is a little much.  I ended my last game session to finally being able to build my 2nd smelter, which is a bottle neck that limits progression more so then having a consistant progression of acomplishments.  But as i've said several times it is in beta so I'm sure as more mid game and end game things are added smelters will be more available early on. Overall the game is great and quite entertaining.  $9 bucks for what I expect to be 30+ hours minimium of enjoyment is better then any cost to entertainment ratio I expect from most AAA games.  And once they start doing more patches I'm sure I'll get even more enjoyment out of it.			"

Early Access Review
								Well this game seems to be better in the future, so I give it thumb-up. The game, however, is not really worth a thumb-up at the moment, because the game is not really playable now.The developer says that the creative mode is easy to use, but I didn't see how 'easy' it is. Well if you have played Minecraft, and you like building, you should probably know the plugin WorldEdit, and that really make building easier. But although this game have a 'powerful' building tool, it can't really make any different. If I want to place a chunk, that's OK, but it's really a challenge to make the chunk in proper size and position. The 'powerful' building tool seems to be more like a terrain brush rather than an assistant tool. In my opinion, something that can be called building tool should at lease have all the function that WroldEdit have. And the build to me function didn't work at all.By the way, there are no slopes, even no slabs and stairs in the game. Although I can make it an model manually, is that really easy that I need 8 models of one meterial in order to create the roof? And I REALLY want some furnitures but I can't find anything that really seems to be furniture, and I even can't find doors.Also the survival mode is really hard to play. The ping tool in the scanner really fustrate me a lot, because it can make the screen bright violin and it's hard to see through with these on. Energy things is almost OK, but why can't power centre charge the research centre? Every time I have to move the energy cell right next to the research centre in order to charge it, and transfer energy manually.And the UI is hard to use. Something that I really want to complain is that, could I have an inventory? And also, drag-drop control is not featured, and I should first select the item in my hot bar, and then open the UI to feed it, and the energy centre have no buffer, so I have to throw in a coal every minute, before I can have any automatic machanic.So with all these problems, why I still give it thumb-up? The main reason is that I only get the game for 2.24USD (and I purchased 13.44CNY), that's far cheaper than Minecraft. And also you can't expect a lot on a game in technic preview stage. 4 years ago, I used to play the classic version of Minecraft, and that has even less function than this game in this stage, but everyone enjoy that. There's still a lot of time for this game to be improved, and I hope that my 2 USD will worth 40 USD in the future.So, it's still worth to buy it, but don't expect too much too soon. Buy it and put it aside for several years is OK.			"

												If you like the Factorio, you must try this game!You will start with only few small lasers and 5 conveyers in your inventory and will reach to the core of the planet to build and automate your machines. The beauty of this game is that you will dig and explore the vast caves of underground for coal, copper, tin, iron, lithium, gold, titanium, nickel, biomass vein, crystals, chromium and molybdenum, magmacite and uranium and more. And this is not all!! All of these are row materials for complex machines and structures that will help you to defend your core.Give it a try and you will not regret it! "

												This is NOT youre AAA Entertainment Game. If youre looking for some hours of brainless fun you wont enjoy this game. If you are into min-maxing and complex logic for base building look no further.You will have to put some hours in to get a hold of what this game has to offer. Literally HUNDREDS of hours of gameplay which you will want to revisit even after those because you keep figuring out better ways to do stuff.This is an ever-evolving gem which continues to get better. You have to keep in mind it is a single person continiously evolving this game so sometimes not every change will hit youre taste, there is a pretty active community though the DEV is very willing to listen to.

												The sheer scale of this game can be overwhelming, But once you start to learn how to automate it can be incredibly satisfying to see your resources being fed through you base. I would go into your first world just as a learning experience and take the time to learn controls and how best to configure automation. I have only put 130 hours into this game and am still constantly rebuilding my base as i think of new more efficient ways to run resources. Also the tutorial is short and can leave alot unsaid, that being said PRESS THE ""H"" Key it is an excellent resource that new players tend to miss or overlook. The Dev has done an excellent job with this game and continues to do so.The price is entirely too low in my opinion and i would have been happy paying far more, with that said consider buying the DLC if you really enjoy this, but it is also not required as the base game is huge and continues to get new content.

												This Review in one word: RecommendedThis game is mind-blowing. I didn't play for that long (only around 300+ hours and i want a lot more), but what i can tell for sure: FortressCraft Evolved is addicting, amazingly fun (mostly because of your own actions), diversified and sometimes (logistically) challenging.For me it has a good mix of gameplay pace, as it offers situations where you have to react fast (or let's say you want to be fast) and on the other hand you have relaxing base management, where you can think about your next ""project"" or just waiting for resources.Furthermore the game gives you more than one moment of satisfaction. In fact you have a lot of small and big moments. For example you established a new mining site, you obliterated your first overmind or you just reached a personal goal in producing energy / ores / bars. Or maybe you're going to build your Climate Control Center? It depends on your own personal preferences.			"

The dev is also very active, streams his work and does good, substantial updates often enough to keep you interested.p.s. If you like Factorio... this is the same, but 3d... and on steroids "

												This game is freakin awesome.  The dev is a quirky dude but quirky or not you're a real hero to the indepent developers setting out on their own.  Well done good sir.  Still blows my mind that you did most of this yourself, by yourself.  I know you've had some help along the way but this game is a true triumph story showing it's possible to make something awesome on your own if you work hard enough for long enough.  The fact that you are about the only survival crafting game to ever get out of early access still blows my mind.About The Game:I wont re-bother saying all the things already pointed out about how it's like this or that game.  I'll just let you know what I like about it.  To start, It's great for the OCD in me as it gives one the tools to learn what you need without holding your hand so tight that you can't do what you want.  Less about building awesome castles, more about building awesome factories that automate every little task you can think of (Though you can still build castles that like,♥♥♥♥♥♥or even a castle factory).   Best part of this game is when after you've been doing things by hand for hours and finally figure out how to automate the process with logic systems and cool conveyor routes, the reward is a bit like a king sitting on his throne looking out over his land as the farmers and soldiers toil for his gain.  But much less 'slavey' than that sounds because they are all machines.Anyhow, this game is great for the creative in me and I bet if your easily addicted to fine tuning systems until they are perfect then you'll get sucked into this game right away. I'm 85hours in and still unlocking new tech.  From the looks of what the interwebs has to say, I'll be unlocking things for quite some time to come too.  Not all of it is just the next tier up kind of stuff either.  Research is done in a very creative way as there are two different ways it's tackled.  Early game most of it is just scans, a few hours in you'll build machinse the process cores and spit out research you can use as well. When you finally get a good automated process for it, it's very satisfying.  Anyhow, I've said enough.  I just thought this game specificly desereved some good praise as it stands alone unto all the clones you see around.   I hear a lot of people thinking this is just a minecraft clone but that couldn't be farther from the truth.  About the only thing these two games have in common is voxel landscapes.  Everything else is unique and from what I've seen, completely origonal.  And you can go a LOT deeper in this game then you ever will in minecraft.  Infact, if you go too deep you'll need special heating unit in your suit to keep your♥♥♥♥♥from freezing to death.			"

												FortressCraft Evolved is like a much more polished version of Minecraft + buildcraft mod. The TL;DR is it's more or less Logistics Simulator: Minecraft edition with tower defense aspects included. Sometimes getting a specific item is frustrating because you use so little of it, you don't create a dedicated system of machines to produce said item.  That said, I am quite sure you can automate pretty much the entire game if a player was dedicated and skillful enough, though that is MUCH easier said than done. I cannot currently comment on the multiplayer aspects as I have not messed around with that (yet!). The cons are that the tutorial is fairly useless. There is a LOT to figure out, but once you get the gist of it, the game is pretty consistent. Another con that kind of irks me is that most of the mobs that attack your base do not effect the player in any way, so you literally clip through them with no repercussions.			"

												Fantastic building and automation game!I really don't understand the negative reviews. The single developer has delivered a large amount of content and updates over the years. The game is priced low enough to make the DLC an easy choice to buy (plus you are supporting his efforts). The mod support is great. The game runs quite well considering the incredible size of your bases and world, and the massive number of enemies being hurled at your defenses.As far as as gameplay goes, if you enjoy resource gather, mining, and automation then this is about the best there is. Even after hundreds of hours I am still sometimes in awe at the massive underground complexes I have stumbled across and built myself. I do agree that sometimes the game can be a bit obtuse in the beginning, but once you understand that things are meant to be built on a grand scale everything gets so much more enjoyable and easy. Also, I will agree that some mods are must haves for quality of life improvements, such as, infinite ore stacks  and Tricky's hoppers. I know I know, Fortresscraft Evolved has fortress in the name, but where it succeeds most is as an excellent automation and mining game, and you won't be disappointed picking it up as long as understand what it is.

Everything they show you in the trailer video is true, the caves are GIGANTIC!!!It´s very hard for some people to understand how to get everything automated at the start, and maybe they need to put manufactoring plant into the game a bit sooner, or maybe i just need to learn the reserch tree to know abit better... :)I played factorio alot (400 hours before steam launch), and im sure i will play this at least as much!!Last and most importantly - DjArcass, GOOD JOB MAN!

												So much time lost. So much fun had.Likes: Complex tech trees. Every game is a different physical arrangement and gets you thinking about new solutions. Automation. Cooperative multiplayer. Designing a base is a lot like designing software, only it has nothing to do with my workplace so it gives me dopamine. Balancing tech progress with defense is a good time.Dislikes: I'm a multiplayer junkie, and the dedicated server (experimental as of this writing) still a bit on the clunky side: Chunk loading issues, getting stuck inside of nothing, other odd issues like that. I expect they'll be fixed with time. Definitely not enough exploration, there's pretty much no reason to ever leave the immediate vicinity of the base other than to nuke Overminds. Also, not enough threats in regions unknown. Game is generally pretty easy, even with Hard Mobs enabled, once you've mastered the art of efficiently climbing the tech tree. More challenge, please!

								I have gotten this game to run ONCE!I got it to work that time by using 32 bit instead of 64, but now it won't give such an option.  It simply begins loading and then gives a message saying ""Steam required to play ..."" then quits.There is a long list of things to try posted in the forums.  I've tried them with no success.It's hard to evaluate and give feedback on an early access game when you can't even access it.I can tolerate bugs in alpha/beta stages but to place the entire burden of getting a game to run on the consumer is not reasonable, especially when none of the workarounds apparently work.

								You know those really grindy ""free to play"" MMOs where you have to do the exact same thing over and over again to get the cool stuff? This game is exactly that, but without any payoff whatsoever.-Want to explore the wastly huge terrain, that is randomly generated to look exactly the same every single time?-Sorry you can't do that cause you'll freeze to death in 2 minutes.-Do you want to build the ever expanding factory of your dreams that produces all the cool stuff you could think of?-Well you can't quite do that, but what you CAN do is run back and forth between your mining drills, and your ONE smelter for 10 hours straight to gather enough resources for 20 conveyor belts. YAAY!This game is marketed as a HARDCORE base builder, which is all about automation, but in reality everything is way too resource expensive, and all the vital resources are too far apart. You'll literally have to spend at least 20 hours with hidiously boring grinding to make any form of automation possible.If you want to play a basebuilder that isn't a minecraft clone but is ACTUALLY FUN TO PLAY, dont waste your time with this and go buy ""Factorio"" instead.PS: I know this is just in early access, but that is not an excuse for not having actual gameplay.

								Ok, I know this seems like a cool game, but it is VERY CONFUSING!When I first played Minecraft, everything seems just simple and easy, but this game when you starts out it is very hard to understand what you are doing.  Ok, first you need to find some ores, and let me tell you guys this: the ores are impossible to find, you would think ""oh I can just dig down and try my luck.""  So I did, i used super dig, used up all my power, made a HUGE cave from my super dig, and found nothing but rocks....The guies are very unclear about what you need to do, and the machines are very hard to understand, I wish they made like a video about how to get started or something.Did I forget to metion that there are few bugs?  (Of course, its Early Access)Went to Creative:  Don't know what 95% of the machines does, seeing some robots following me around, not sure why or what they do.  I just wish they had BETTER/CLEAR guides on what to do and make it simple and easy, not 20 pages long.I'm here for the cool machines and the ""FortressCraft"", not getting lost in what to do due to unclear guides!Overall:If you want to build: Just go to minecraftIf you want to play with machines: yes, then you should get this game, but note this: you HAVE TO spend at least 1 hour to figure how to get started in this game while reading a 20 page guide that are not very clear.

												This little gem caught my eye about a year ago, when it was in early access. I decided back then to let it mature before buying it. As such I was excited to see it was out of early access and the full release was out.As another voxel based survival game this one seperates itself from the pack by focusing more or automation and refinement, matched really only by Factorio (but in 3D!!!). It looks great, at first glance, until I bought the game and played it...It played smooth. REAL smooth, in that it was between 150 and 200 FPS. There is an option in the Settings menu to change that, but it didn't do anything. No change whatsoever. So you try restarting the game, and there is still no difference. Now that is a pretty basic thing to set up, so why it doesn't function is beyond me (again, in a full title out of early access). It hogged all my computers resources to keep up with that rediculous update speed. But ow well, let's play on!So you start in a tutorial setting, protected from outside influences by a forcefield, which lifts when the tutorial is done. Awesome! The tutorial is short but informative, so even after restarting hundreds of games I can't see much of a speedbump there, and it's practical...Until the shield lifts and a giant spider robot walks over your base, its feet several blocks away from its legs (assuming said legs aren't jerking over it's head).At this point I noticed the text at the bottom right of the screen saying Development Build...Okay, probably started a Beta through Steam???...uhm...no...the game is still in beta...and the spider is supposed to be some kind of boss enemy to be encountered later in the game, which was left at the players spawn probably to debug / test.Why do I have a Development Build for a game that has been out for 5 / 6 months and without running a Beta?This game is not done, and it is out of early access. I concider that seriously disrespectfull towards the customer and a violation of my consumer rights. I don't mind buying a product that isn't finished, as long as you're honest about that and don't play morally and legally questionable games.In 10 years of Steam patronage I have never ask for a refund, and to be honest I thought Age Of Survival warranted it, but at least they are honest about the game not being done yet...EDIT: People don't seem to understand, so to make a bit more clear: I liked this game, I really did, but there is no excuse for selling a game that isn't finished, that is still a 'Developer Build'. The moment we as consumers accept that as 'okay' we collectively accept blatant disregard for our consumer rights and those rights will disappear.Steam has agreed with my complaint by refunding my payment, so at least I know I'm not entirely wrong by fighting this...

								Most games start off easy and get progressively harder in order to balance out the players advancement and remain interesting. This game does the exact opposite. Maybe not in terms of skill, but in patience. The first few hours (if not more) of gameplay are incredibly slow. There is a general sense of just not getting anywhere. And when you do manage to get a decent industry up and running and you actually have the resources to get things done, you realize there was no point. At this point in the game's developement, the only thing you can do with the resources you gather (Id guess there are fewer than 10 useful ones) is making machines that automate...gathering more resources...With such limiting gameplay and more bugs than a rainforest floor, its difficult to imagine it leaving early access in the near future			"

								Cons:This game randomly hard-locks my computer. This happens with no other program and I have throughly tested my memory.The menu does not pause the game, so you can die from adjusting settings (especially in the first 5 hours in a world).You're in constant peril of death for the first several hours of the game and after patiently strategeicly attempting for almost 12 gameplay hours in a world, I just got to the point of crafting the first 2nd tier item. Survival is frustratingly slow.You start with a single device to smelt ores, and to build another is a 3rd teir build and reportedly among the community takes roughly 30 hours of gameplay to get to. I have more than 20 hours and can still not yet survive going deep enough to *find* T3 resources.Can very easily jump into a block and see through the level. There is even a four-click method to see through the world reliably at any time you want. Major game breaker.Pros:The mining is automated for the most part as you grow. Then the smelting becomes automated. Then the building.Cool system, allows for huge top-end growth.Really nice voxel graphics.Summary:The ore mining/energy/processing is a really cool idea, but this game has screwball glitches, partial graphics failures regularly, inventory failures often, and total system lockups on a healthy computer. Lets be honest, this is a minecraft clone, and not worth the money.			"

												At first I really enjoyed this game. It was unique to me and I enjoyed creating large systematic productions. However the game took a turn sharply downhill when a DLC that added extra into the game costs an additional 15$. The game is good but doubling its price when I supported the alpha is not something I wanted to do. I don't see the game going much farther then it is currently which is sad to say. If there are still issues with the base game then I can't recommend it to anyone because it seems the dev would sacrifice the main game to create DLCs for money.			"

												Edit: After a developer reply on how to fix the crashes this runs smootly now (it never crashed since 2 hours at least). So i edited this to reflect more about my experience.However i still leave this review as negative, mostly since there is no ""neutral"" button, and since positive would not reflect what I exerienced / felt, while playing it.I must admit, that I havent progressed further than starting some basic automation.The UI get's in my way too often, and the tutorial is minimal, not explaining you lot's of things.Geting into automation is way too tedious at start.There is some weird sound problems for me too, like if i scan down there in a hallway the shrieking echoes forewer, having me to turn down the sound to an allmost absolute minimum.While the idea might be nice, the 3 dimensions just make it horrible for me personally, since the grappling hook probably needs hours of training to make you go up and down a mining shaft without dying every second time (after another two hours i found that shooting it repeatedly towards the wall while ""falling"" down a shaft you can actually land...). Digging deep and then bringing those materials back (automated, not running down there every 5 minutes) is a pain at the start too.The idea of needing unidentified blocks to scan for research is in my eyes not really good game design. An increased amount of ore or other resources per research would be much more apropriate (or did i not progress far enough still?).One of the things that hinder me most is the limited energy at start. Just because of this, and for no other reason i run forth and back 10 or more times to just set up a mine and build the conveyors and energy supply for it. While it could be fun to dig it, find a way for the belts and the energy transmition it gets dull, because 50% of the time is ""running forth and back for energy"".Some things are really nice in there too. Like distance not mattering for interacting with things, or the ""build to me"" feature. Unfortunatly nothing of this is explained in the tutorial, and i had to check some youtube videos and guides to even get the basic understanding of the game (and i'm one of those that dont like to have to watch let's plays to understand a game, i want immersion and learning in game).There is potential in it for sure. And i'll check on it again some time later.TL;DR:If you want a stable good factory builder then I recomend Factorio instead.If you want pure tower defence then there is 100 such games around.If you want a blend of both and you love 3d then this one is it.

Early Access Review
								I played FortressCraft on the 360 quite a bit, enjoying the hunt for all those hidden little tools you could use to make playing the game more interesting. I especially enjoyed the idea of creating zed spawners. I must have created thousands of those things...But anyway, on with THIS game.I had to say this: it's not easy starting out. I had little time to read the help and starting tips before I realized that my suit energy was dropping fairly quickly. To top it off, I had to also wrestle with the controls before I was able to make my way to my crash site.But once I managed to get the controls down, I was able to start mining for resources. I got lucky and found a tin and coal vein inside the mountain I set up camp on, and eventually found iron and copper (though they were a long climb down into the earth.I think the suit energy idea is a good idea. It's going to keep you alive, and it allows you to stay out in the cold a while longer before you need to recharge. And the scanner idea was nice as well, though I think I know a tree when I see one. Unless it suddenly grows tentacles and tries to eat me. Then I'm just being eaten.And the new entities in the the game have given me more questions than answers. There are these flying robots that, when I kill them, drop ruined stingers. Not sure what to do with those, or what they are suppose to do for the bots, but it's interesting. And let's not forget the wacky-looking spider thing I found stuck on the mountain. That thing wouldn't die, nor would it move. I'm curious as to how all of those things got there.While this game is pretty fun to play, and the creative mode is a blast to mess with, I did have some general issues, ones that I'm sure some or most players will have run into.1. Resource Management. While I can understand that resources are going to be important for your survival, it just seems kind of ridiculous to have to travel hundreds of blocks away in order to find even basic resources (it took me over an hour to just find copper). And the majority of the time, my energy is being used to keep my few ore extractors going, or scanning for more areas to mine new resources. I've yet to find anything new.2. Control Layout.This is one of my biggest beefs, and for a good reason. As I said before, I had to fight with the controls for a minute before I could get moving, though it took me even longer to learn how to switch back to my scanner from my gathering tool. It also feel a little clunky, having to reach across the keyboard to hit a certain hotkey. I know the keys can be rebound, but I tend not to mess with that. Maybe a few minor rethinkings of the layout would be nice. Or controller support! I'm honestly one for full controller support, so maybe that could be a future addition.3. Crafting.The crafting system is relatively straight forward, which is nice, but requires resources that could take a lot of time to find, and even more time to gather. And even with the resources that are almost immediately found, the process requires more time and more resources. To illustrate my issue:8 iron=1 iron bar, 15 iron bars=1 ore extractor.It just seems a little tedious.4. Environmetal Hazards.Now, honestly, this is a cool feature, but one that needs some working. Heat keeps you from freezing to death, obviously. But what makes me a little irritated is the fact that you can't make heated rooms. It just seems like one of those things that you'd think would have been implemented a while back to help players better manage themselves. I'm really hoping it's added in a future update, though. Cold nights would be so much more pleasant.5. Terrain.This one is just something small, nothing major. But I feel like it's something that could be implemented at some point in even a minor update. Having to jump to go up another block gets a little tedious, not to mention it's a little hard on the spacebar (at least mine, anyway). Maybe the option of automatically climbing up one block could make an appearance in a future update.But other than that, this game is looking pretty good! I'm looking forward to seeing what the Devs have in store for futue updates, as well as what other players will suggest adding to it. This is a game that certainly has evolved from it's console predecessor, and it's done so pretty well.			"

Early Access Review
								Disclaimer: I have not played the Creative Mode.Even in Early Access this is an incredible game.  You start off in the middle of no where freezing to death with only the energy in your suit and a couple of torches and ore extractors.  You immediately have to set off to find your crashed ship to try to salvage whatever you can to just survive the first night on this planet.  Once you're accustomed to surviving the night, you can start exploring all that FortressCraft has to offer.  Building automated bases, suit upgrades, crafting, etc.The UI still needs to be cleaned up and more intuitive, but the devs are working on core functionality of the game first so expect a bit of a learning curve (if you have any questions the devs and other community members are always available on the forums),New updates and features are being released all the time, multiplayer was just recently released (there's still a lot more work to do with multiplayer, but at least it's under way).  I highly recommend this game.			"

												Its not bad. Kind of like factorio, but more of a tower defense type. There is a significant amount of content gated by the DLC, but it doesn't really block the end game, so I'm okay with that. The game is very grindy. Sometimes you will find yourself just waiting around without being able to move forward until your incredibly slow ore smelting slogs through enough ore to allow you to research ore smelters.It is actively updated with new items and bug fixes.

												I really, really, really want to like this game, and for a while as I was starting out, I did. The elevator pitch is more or less ""Factorio as recreated in Minecraft"", and the first person element really does add that much more to the exploration aspect.Unfortunately, once you've got an assembly line set up for your most basic resources, the entire game's progression of tech trees turns out to be deliberately balanced a step or two behind parity with your current progress, such that you are always sticking your neck out, collecting stuff manually, and being forced to stretch your current equipment to its absolute limits to gather the new resource for the next tier of equipment, at which point the process repeats itself. It's less a game about automation as it is a never-ending masocore scavenger hunt. Which is a damn shame, because if just a bit more common sense were applied to the tech trees it'd be another masterpiece of the ""explore, collect, build"" genre. You still might be able to get something out of it, but I would advise caution. It's more nefarious than it looks.			"

												I really should recommend this game. It's 3D Factorio, and I love Factorio and 3D. Alas, while I kind of like it it's just too grindy and slow. The game gives you all sorts of cool tools for you to play with, but they're so expensive to build (smelters) or power hungry (automatic tools like excavators/belt layers and the like). The early game in particular is awful because of how hard it is to locate basic ores. If you find a new ore and analyize it before you've memorized or marked the location the ore won't show up while pinging unknown anymore, so good luck finding it again. This is but one example of many about how FortressCraft Evolved wastes your time with boring crap.The developer could learn a lot from Factorio and slash the power and material requirements for everything by quite a lot (like, a factor of 10), then it would be a fun game. Also other stuff like ping colored ore should be the default mode for pinging known ores, and that shouldn't be locked behind research or cost a ton of suit power. I'm not holding my breath for these changes though, the developer has released at least 7 major updates for the game since it left early access and hasn't reduced the grind significantly at all.Update: I tried this game again with update 10 and casual settings and got to the point where I was minining lithium. It's still just as tedious as it was.			"

												It's rare that I give up on a game so soon into playing it but this would be one of the few times that it happens. I couldn't tell you much about how the game itself plays except that it really does lack anything which could be considered entertainment. The notion of a tower defence Minecraft-esque game sounds appealing but the way it has been done is just needlessly tedious. There are many mods for Minecraft which offer what FortressCraft is doing here but does it far better.Whats more is that the game is just plain unpleasent to look at. The UI itself is messy and vague. The environment itself is dark and neon in a way which isn't interesting or visually appealing at all and can be done much better as shown by games such as Subnautica. The draw distance, even when maxed, is actually far less than what Minecraft it capable of with shaders applied so you have this distinct horizon not very far away and the surface clutter can be seen hovering over an invisible landscape that has not yet loaded. The items held in the players hand block a good 1/4 of the screen which is distracting when you're looking around. Due to how dark the game is and how crucial machines are all blocks I found myself having to carefully peer at the screen to tell if I was looking at a hopper or a smelter for example. This unwieldly design also extends to the controls which cannot be rebound to new keys from within the game it would seem.The game is just an unwieldy mess of ideas that have been mashed together and don't really work when taken as a whole. I've refunded this already and I would suggest that nobody touch this game.			"

								WAIT AT LEAST A YEAR BEFORE YOU INVEST INTO THIS EVEN AS AN EARLY ACCESS CONCEPT.It looks like minecraft, but it's really nothing you should ask money yet for a long time. I think this is EVEN MORE broken than the infamous ""Maia"" and is completely unplayable. It's ridden with both small and large incredibly annoying things such as: - Think you can press that help button in menu? Nope. That's just graphics. - Think you can start the game without problems? Nope. Expect the survival mode never starting since your ship actually doesn't crash. The irony should not be lost on anyone.- Think you can have the most important feature - multiplayer - to at least play with your friends? Nope, it's broken and limited to ""creative mode"" (which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t). - Think you can start server from the multiplayer menu? Nope. You need to shuffle through vast amount of data to even find where you can start the server (which is ingame esc menu, because main menu's MULTIPLAYER would have naturally be too logical).I have zero belief something would comes out from EA messes such as this which is bluntly just due experience. No, this isn't ""alpha"". I don't think this is even a prototype. It's barely a runnable concept of a game made in Unity.I bought this for 3€ in sale for 2 copies and I still feel more ripped off than even before.			"

												I'm not too happy about this one... The graphics are indeed quite good, and there are some improvements over minecraft (Yes, I am comparing this game to MC + Tech mods) including the jetpack, the flashlight and large ore veins.But there's also a bunch of problems which might be because this game left EA too early.Let's talk about progress. I normally play survival in MC, but in this game I got bored by it. Actually bored, not the casual play-something-else bored. If I want to progress, I need to produce a lot of bars, which means a lot of ore miners and even more power to power my equipment. If I do that I'll attract the attention of mobs. I could run my mining operations at a slower speed, but where's the fun in that? To make matters worse, the base income in ore, metals and power is so low that you REALLY need a lot of everything, for which you need a lot of resources. And you don't have those.ARTHER, that tiny flying thing by your side. I guess having it give you energy is neat, but I don't get how a tiny flying robot has better power cells and solar panels than you do in your space suit. In addition it's supposed to display vital information to you. But you can't really read that if it points away from you, or is sitting inside a wall.Threat level, while a good idea, is simply not working out. In the very beginning of the game you are not getting attacked because you're not mining/smelting enough to attract any mobs. But once your base evolves, you'll suddenly get multiple waves of wasps every 10 or so minutes. And your turrets don't target mobs immediately, so you need a lot of them.Wasps are the main enemy (before the heavies and bosses appear). But they are only a way to make your base receive damage, they aren't fun to defend against at all. If you build a wall around your base they fly through it, if you shield your CPH they shoot through the wall, they can turn invisible and invincible, etc.Fortunately there's that big spider robot which is supposed to defend you. Unfortunately it doesn't. When a wave begins it starts walking away and doesn't defend the base. I guess that it is actually heading towards the wasp's spawn location, but I'm not convinced that it does anything once it's there.Finally, the CPH. It is just an excuse to slow you down. In the beginning you may depend on it, but later on it is just useless. It is called Central Power Hub for no reason, it's like a PTG at 30% efficiency and you can't feed power into it from your power plant. It is the one and only target for wasps, yet it doesn't have any means of defending itself. It fires a beam upward in which you can't build at all, despite having no effect whatsoever (no it's a bad beacon). The worst part is that you can't even move it. Spawned on a hill? Too bad.This game would have been very good if you didn't had to constantly defend against wasps.Oh wait... I can change that :)[imgur.com]I had to stop playing or I would have wasted countless hours modifying the game and still not have the fun I was hoping to get through it... progress is still too slow.

Early Access Review
								It's good so far, and it uses the Unity Engine, which means it's not a big corporate game, etc. A few things to note: This game is not complete, not by a long shot. I've already run into a LOT of bugs within my playtime already, below is a list of them.-- The 64-Bit Version may crash upon Quitting the game to desktop.-- Having more than one ore type in your inventory will confuse the smelter's ""Feed Ores"" button. (You cannot make a storage system without multiple ores.)-- The A.R.T.H.U.R or whatever it is called, requires a Power Core to be crafted for it to work proper again. However, you do not know this recipe, even after researching the black box and power suit upgrades.-- Right-Clicking items in your hot bar (using the mouse-enabled HUD) removes them from your inventory, forever. You cannot collect more of the item, you cannot see the item when using scroll wheel, etc. It's gone, forever.-- Using your mining laser on coal ore (or any ore) constantly will seem to continue mining the ore incredibly faster than an ore extractor, this is not the case, the blocks that appear dropped are ghost ore item drops.-- Game on ""Fabulous"" has issues with block animations, etc. The loading screen also freezes on that setting, even though the computer can handle said setting over 60 FPS (IE: Getting screen-tear since my computer can process faster even on Fabulous.) The setting can also lag computers that are far, far above the recommended requirements.-- The spider mech enemy does nothing.-- Your gun cannot hurt the spider mech enemy. (IE: The spider mech has no hitbox.)-- Sometimes, during the day, the solar cell on the suit does not work.-- Sometimes, even if you have enough power and research points, some research items will say they can't be researched.-- The world select button on the Escape menu does nothing.-- When creating a world with a custom name, the world's name reverts to ""World"" on game reload.

								So I got this game after reading that it was one of the best-selling games on XBL. However, I don't see how that can be. There's no goal, other than build giant crap. No purpose to the game. If your life is so utterly empty that you feel showing off intricate structures you've built will fill some void, then this game is for you. No NPC's, no action, just building♥♥♥♥♥♥ VERY boring.

Fortresscraft: Evolved is... awkward. Alright... where to start? Well, I suppose I should start off by saying I can tell this game takes inspiration from ""industrial""-themed Minecraft mods, in that you're setting up production chains and transporting items and mining and all that stuff. The problem is it's only taken inspiration, and pretty much fails in every other regard.The good: Fortresscraft is initially simple and you might have fun for the first hour, but the fun soon stops as the game becomes a parade of annoyances, either due to bad game design, intentional grinding, and a slew of other bullcrap that keeps you from that carrot on a stick; progression.The bad: Now, you may be wondering, ""Higgs, what's so annoying and bad about the game? Look at all the positive reviews!"" To that I say; everyone is stupid except me, and you... if you listen to my gripes about this game. Starting off, the graphics. Now, I might be playing this on an ancient GTX630 graphics card, but that's still no excuse for a game with these sorts of graphics to not be hitting 60FPS, at the very least on low settings. The models are simple and bland, they look like they're out of a PS2 game (a bargain-bin one at that), and the blocky terrain clashes with this. The textures are muddy, dull and needlessly high-res, and have parallax for the most mundane things. The developer seems to have slapped on as many special rendering effects on top of the game to cover up the mediocrity of the art style, to the point that it can be difficult to see when some of the bloom effects or screen overlays do their best to blind you. As a result, the game tends to chug despite the low poly-count.The gameplay itself is, to a point, what you'd expect from a Minecraft ripoff. Break and place blocks. Simple enough, if the UIs weren't a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare to navigate. Every single screen seems to run on a different set of rules, and despite what might seem like a solid framerate your clicking and dragging will be laggy as hell. The focus of the game, the machines, are obnoxiously unexplained; even with the in-game help it either seemed to gloss over the function or rules of things lioke hoppers, which never EVER behaved in the way you wanted them to. I'd be fine with that if I could mine by hand, but you CAN'T. Ore blocks aren't supposed to be broken apparently, and yield junk when you turn your laser onto them. You have to place a grinder thing beside an ore vein, then wait for it to chew through it sluggishly. It's obnoxious and it just doesn't make sense. Even breaking normal blocks manages to be awkward and clunky, they break far too fast and the range for the laser is too far, making digging stairwells a chore when you accidentally dig at more or less than a 45* angle, meaning you have to dig out the ceiling or place blocks to make the stairs smooth again. With the way blocks break in Minecraft, you have far better control over what you're digging, to the point that I find mining to actually be one of the more enjoyable activities even after at least 5 years of playing the game, Fortresscraft's awkwardness just vomits all over that sense of zen that I get.  It's worth mentioning again that almost nothing is actually given context in the game. Despite dismantling a tree with my laser I can't make planks to make a crate to store all this garbage in my inventory. What do all these over-detailed glowing plants do? Slimes everywehere? Are they bad guys? Sometimes when I'm underground a block decides it hates me and kills me (dying has no consequences outside of respawning, yet another annoyance). Are THOSE bad guys? How do I fight them? I had to go down to -150 meters to find lithium ore, yet the device that beams power underground requires that I already have piles of lithium? Why do I have to nrun back and forth between my power station because there's little option for providing power to underground drills? How many times am I going to get HYPOTHERMIA? Also, no pickaxes in the game apart from the logo. That really miffs me for some reason, maybe because I can't mine myself and the machines are frustrating to deal with. Placing conveyor belts is an exasperating chore; they never go the way you want them to the first time, and you'll often need to dig a hole to stand in to get at the right angle to place them up a wall (that doesn't even make SENSE).The ugly, ugly, UGLY: Did I mention this game is ugly? Holy hell is it ugly. Again, I have to reitterate that the flat, blocky terrain clashes with the semi-detailed models; Minecraft might be ugly too but at least it's a consistent sort of ugly. Every texture is far more detailed than it needs to be, to the point that it looks less like a texture and more like a grey blob at every distance apart from directly in front of your eyes, in which case it's got so much detail it looks almost uncanny valley in a way. The lighting SUCKS, it hurts my eyes. I hate looking at this game. In conclusion, if you really, absolutely must play a voxel-based mining game with machines, buy Minecraft and install Technic launcher, there's dozens of well-made and POLISHED mods for you to play, with far more content and without the graphics drain and constant frustrations.

												Don't let the high recommendation fool you. This game is awful. It's completely unfinished, it may as well not even have a tutorial for all the good the tutorial does you, and is barely functional in all other respects. Even if it were functional it is completely devoid of personality or spirit. What started as a clone of Minecraft hasn't evolved into anything worthwhile. Skip this one.Edit: The developer commented, so i figured I'd give a bit more detailed reasoning as to why I returned this game.a) the game runs like♥♥♥♥♥on a current gen ASUS,b) the first game I played I spent 20 minutes debugging why the power hub and conveyer setup wasn't working (the hub spawned a block too high), and had to restartc) you've published the game with the developer console actived) the robot tries to fly into the optimal place to display its message(which was clipped by the edge of the screen for me), and it took me several minutes of chasing him down before I realized that's what was going on,e) there's a general lack of visual communication when you look at objects to try to figure out what they do,f) things that, I assume, were working normally, looked buggy and unpolished, like the intro screen and the level generation screeng) the visuals and audio, while hardly placeholder, desperately need a polish pass (the lighting and shaders especially)h) you can die in the starting zone simply by not learning the game fast enough.All in all, a horrific first impression. All the in-game help menus in the world can't make up for a bad impression.			"

												I did not find a lot to love in this game.  To start, it is ugly.  I was not expecting much from the screenshots, and I am hardly a graphics snob, but this is an unpleasant to look at game.  The textures and models are not cohesive, and the game is inexplicably dark.  And I mean dark.  There are highlights of variously colored lights, but it is more reminiscent of early games like Quake rather than anything attractive.  The tutorial is exceptionally short and completely useless.  I guess new players are expected to watch YouTube videos to figure things out.  The UI is also pretty terrible, starting with the main menu and getting worse from there.  There may be a good game buried in here, but I couldn't find it before I decided that there were better uses of my time and asked for a refund.			"

												I loved fortress craft at first up until the last changes.  Try and argue with the developer is like arguing with a brick wall.  Problem 1: Play style and lvl a simple difcuality level is needed.Peaceful - Those who just want to do the manufacturing part of the game and make stuff.Easy - Some monster shows up on rarity.  Start setting up defences etc form here.Medium - Diffcualtiy as normal Hard - Go for it and make it a little tougher enemy etc.Hard Core - If you die, you game is erase but your highest stats will be listed.Problem 2 - Generators does not work below 300.  I really don't care but like to generators to work at all levels.  Problem 3 - You spend more time mining and collecting resources then building an actual base.  Its already complicated as it is.  You don't need to add more problems on top of problems. Problem 4 - changes are soo annoying that when they do changes it makes the game worst then what it is.  - Examples  - Generators don't work below 300.  I have an entire system setup for that and now I have to go back and fix it.  I barely have enough materials to make a power laser to get that far down let alone finding a way back down.    - Monsters spawns soo much that all your ore is gone before you get it up.  Plus going back to make all those changes is a pain.  Even Minecraft changes is better then this.  - Force to use high speed tubes vs oonveyors,  It means hours of replacement again mining speed of the ore is slow going even after upgrades.    - 8-1 ore - yea millions of ore and on turns into 20 k or so.  With so much needed to build, who needs ore monsters.In addition, read the forms and you can see all the crappy changes they keep making.  Yea, its there game; but, who is paying for it???  Us of course.			"

												The graphics are horrible. I never saw a game with worse graphics ever. It is like playing a game from 20 years ago. The lighting is ridiculous weird. In the most case, it is so dark that you cannot see anything. Once you initialized a scan or stand before a light/torch, it get so bright that you cannot see anything still. >.>The optimization for rendering is bad too. I have to set all the detail to lowest with 1/2 resolution (Yes, I have to play the game in a window which sucks) to make it run at around 30 fps. At the same time, I can play Minecraft very smoothly so I assume it is this game's problem.However, I really love factories-designing games. Although similar to factorio, this game is really creative in its own ways.   I really love how energy is transferred through lasers. I also love the concept of hoppers (which are similar to inserters in factorio though).Also, I really love that you can go (almost) infinitely deep in this game. It really gives me a sense of being in a 3D world. factorio is 2D obviously. Although Minecraft is 3D, the height limit thing is just annoying. When you are playing Minecraft you can get to the bottom very quickly. It feels like being in a paper world.Last but not least, I also love the ""op-ness"" of the main character. You basically get the ability to fly (even though really hard to control), infinite long reach, and very fast health regen from beginning. You also almost lose nothing when died. All these settings really let players get into the actual designing instead of worrying about getting to some where.Anyways, although the graphics is extremely bad, I will really recommend this game.

								I have yet to really jump into the game, as I'm one of the few people who bought it to play it in the Rift. It seems the dev is working on making DK2 work with the game, but that it'll require an update from the current Oculus Rift SDK, as it is currently incompatible with the way Fortresscraft renders things.All that technical jazz aside, I would say that I've personally observed a lot of very diehard fans of this game, so I'd say they would recommend it.

												I tried, I really did. I've seen the accusations that this is ""another minecraft clone"", but I went in with an open mind. I was disapointed and not really surprised that I was.Let's skip past the name, since we all know about that issue, and look at the gameplay.If you took a poor resolution minecraft texture pack, added rejected alien and weapon models from Garry's Mod, and threw the Tekkit mod in for some more ""originality"", you are left with Fortresscraft. - Gameplay is slow- Block textures are disappointing- Objects that are not a copy/paste from Minecraft texture packs do not fit the ""feel"" at all. Seriously, you are standing on blocky voxels but then pull out a Doom64-like building gun.- Did I mention the game is slow?The only part that caught my eye was the conveyour and automation system.Also, if you look up any interview involving the dev, you will see the kind of person he is and you probably won't want to support this type of dev.No you won't this game in my library because I hit the ""REFUND"" buton an hour in.

												The clunky and eye-gouging UI really puts me off this game. It feels 20 years old, if not worse.The fact that it so enourmus that it covers a very large portion of the screen does not make things better either.The default controls are not the ones listed in tooltips, which makes it very frustrating to constantly jump into the keybindings to see what is what.Another very annoying fact was placing the conveyorbelts, which did not seem to keep the rotation they were placed in earlier, and the orientation based on your own position was very finicky.

												While it had potential, the developer is just awful - Horrible attitude, selling what should be base game content as DLC and Patreon rewards, writing links sending users to virus-ridden sites and not putting out a hotfix, getting his goonies to upvote the game with private, level 0 accounts when it gets low, etc.  I can not and will not recommend this.

												way way way too unstable und buggy.Demanding money for this is insulting - Im not even talking about the HUD that looks like from pre 2000 games to not delve deeper into more expletive metaphors.The level of refining of basic things this piece of software offers in the first 10 minutes is a joke.To list a few issues:-Integer Roll Overs of simple energy capacity listings-the game crashes on exiting a world, may be hardware specific (reproducable)-saving the game uses such a weird compression algorithm that crashes the game 100% of times, may be aswell hardware specific (reproducable)-a random amount of the most important blocks of your starter base tends to be invisible because animation fails/texture being not loaded or whatever.. but not being able to see your base immidiatedly breaks the gameI could list more bugs I had in the 30 minutes I tested the game, but that should suffice to paint a picture.Just waste your time and money on something else			"

								0/10 like minecraft with minecraft, every time I play this game I feel sick.Really though this game feels really cheesy to play, don't buy it...feels like a bad port.Oh waitThis game doesn't really control well and everything just feels so cheesy in that awful ""Get this crap away from me"" feel.I regret buying this, this game was an absolute moneygrab when it came out on the xbox, because there was no minecraft and a lot of little kids wanted to play minecraft so they begged their parents for fortresscraft, but that strategy just doesn't work on steam because steam is a 13+ only platform.

												First off, this is an early access game without the title, what a slimy way to get people to buy an incomplete game. There is already dlc for it, one of which is an expansion that costs more than the original game.I went into this game expecting to like it. For the first 30 seconds, the tutorial seemed very hand-holding which I liked for this game because after that, I didn't have a clue what to do next. After 22 minutes, I gave up and decided to try again later. Saving the game took about 2 full minutes; That's excessive. Came back the next day having no objectives. I didn't have any idea what I was supposed to do. Only after 20 minutes did it finally tell me what I was supposed to do. So I put ore in smelter thing and it just sat there. There was no on/off button to it so I thought, I know, I'll add power to it. There was no way to do that directly so I tried to add power to the central hub. My suit drained power but the machine didn't gain any. This had worked for me the first day though and continued to work for other machines. I decided to quit once more, saving seemed like it was going to take a while again(why is this even a thing? I'm not the only one with this problem), so I alt-tabbed, when I clicked on the icon to see the progress, it disappeared. I assume it crashed without errors.The whole suit having power thing is completely stupid, it drains so fast. Literally running back and forth to the energy block thing(that fills up very slowly) after trying to mine twice which collects like 10 ore total. I don't know if this energy dilemma is a problem late-game but it's realllllly annoying at the start. Unless you can upgrade your character, which I didn't see a way to, I imagine that will always be a problem throughout.Something I personally didn't like was the UI. The rainbow colors weren't pleasing to the eyes and the white font on top of it only made it worse. Very difficult to read.Spending the first two hours trying to figure out this unintuitive game will be too much trouble for me. Maybe the game is good for all I know but it certainly doesn't start out that way and I'm sure it's part of the reason people will be asking for refunds.			"

												If this was an Early Access game, I would be gobsmacked. However as a full release, there are some glaring flaws I noticed in just the first hour. Foremost, the tutorial for a game this complicated should continue through the first five hours, lightly stepping in whenever the player encounters a new mechanic to explain it. I spent over an hour in this game trying to do one thing, and one thing only. I wanted to automate power transmission from the main generator to the coal mining drill, and subsequently automate coal transmission from the drill to the generator that burns it. In over an hour, I came no closer to figuring this out than I did watching the video at the top of the page.Secondly, the crafting system interface needs to be scrapped and redone. Impossible to find crafting requirements without more than a minute of searching through menus and lists, meanwhile 60 percent of the screen is taken up by ridiculous ""sci-fi"" window borders that do LITERALLY NOTHING AT ALL. If you are going to copy minecraft, at least copy the parts that were user friendly.Thirdly, do you know why blocks take a few seconds to break in minecraft, but appear instantaneously when building? ITS BECAUSE IT WARNS YOU WHEN YOU HAVE ACCIDENTALLY DONE THE WRONG ACTION. I spent more time than I can measure switching from the thing I actually WANTED to build back to BLOCKS OF DIRT just to fill in A HOLE I DIDNT MEAN TO DIG. This is utterly ridiculous.HOWEVERThe concept has incredible potential. Adding automation and base defense to a minecraft style operation creates both drama and empowerment, and it would be something I REALLY want to enjoy, but these initial issues with the OBSCENE learning curve, clunky interface, and other oversights overshadow a very good idea. Fix these issues and the game will improve.2/5			"

								This game is amazing. Well, that's what I would be saying if the creators of this game even bothered trying to optimize it.This game is so poorly optimized that I literally can't do anything. Also, all the controls, the menu, and the way the game works is just unbelieveably confusing.Please, do not buy this game. It may look good, but believe me, it's horrible.(P.S: My computer is not trash. If the game was optimized, my computer would certainly be able to run this at a good FPS. I can run other games almost exactly like this with very little to no lag.)			"

												I don't know whether I liked this game or not.  This is the first game like this that I ever played.  I never played Minecraft or Factorio, and my one attempt at Terraria left me lost and confused.  So I simply found this game too difficult, as it appears to assume knowledge on my part that I simply don't have.  I had no issues with the game as far as bugs or whatever: for what it is the game seems to be working as intended and doing what it's doing.  I don't know whether to recommend this or not, as it was simply beyond me.    I suppose if you like 'simulations' instead of games you might like this; it appears to accurately simulate (without Fitz/Simmons) how to not survive on an alien world.  Maybe it's fun; I just don't know.			"

												Cons.UI is atrocious. As far as I can tell there isn't even an in game list or option to look at control keys.Tutorial is bad. Seems like this one bit has ""scan uknown item"" but if you bump into it before scanning it flys away and becomes impossible to continue.Keeps crashing. Just constantly. And this is just the tutorial. Tried lowering graphics even though I have a decent rig but doesn't seem like that's an issue. Doesn't chug and it would have the be insanely unoptimised for that to be the case. I'll keep toying with it probably for a bit. I'll be surprised if it forces me to change the review.Edit: Nope! The crash fix they said would work doesn't.Edit: Holy crap so many controls. No in game control list. kmn.Edit: It was fun throwing all my glowsticks to see how many I had in one spot to make it frame rate lag. Could not figure out how to pick them back up.			"

												Start game, first thing to look for: Settings menu...  Ok; there is none.Guess I'll go create a world (no other available options).  Start typing in the world seed, go to click ""ok"", mouse cursor has vanished... Ok, so it's gonna be like that, eh?  Hit ""enter"", mouse is back... Strange way to start things off.  All menu's to this point are waaayy too big (playing on a 43"" 4k monitor), but yeah, whatever, I'll probably find the settings in-game.Start the game, watch the initial cutscene which I guess trying to explain what's going on?  Get into the tutorial, but have absolutely no clue what to do, anywhere.  There's zero consistency in the presentation of information, no idea what the keys are (as I didn't find a settings menu before starting to check!), and the tutorial is pretty vague.  Information is arbitrarily displayed when your cursor is over random items, but there's nothing to really direct you.  I patch together some basic directions (pretty sure I missed half of course), one screen tells me to craft something, which I do from a menu (without the slightest clue as to its material requirements, purpose, or process), and bam, the tutorial ends... wait... what?Absolutely nothing learned in the first 15 minutes of the game.  I figure out how to ""dig"", make a hole (figure why not?), can't get out, tutorial didn't cover that (or anything else really).Whatever.  Enough for now, Exit game. Screen whines something about trying to compress something or other... Let it run for 30 seconds... Says you can exit, but nothing is clickable (even if it was, none of the buttons display when being pressed, etc.).  No progress, alt+tab / force-close.This game needs a serious tutorial/UI overhaul before it's worth wasting any time.  FWIW, I can manage to build asparagus staged rockets in KSP, I've finished Factorio (*with* bobs mods), etc.   The basics of a tutorial/etc. should be well within my capability to grasp, yet somehow, the first 20 minutes of this game were about as clear as mud.[update - 01-Mar-2017]:Well, I took the plunge and gave it another go.  I reset the world, played the tutorial up to the point it dropped the shield.  Honestly  -- it looks exactly the same as it did before.  The UI is absolutely terrible in every regard.  Maybe it's my 43"" monitor/4k resolution -- but the text is enormous, the dialogue boxes are all at minimum opacity with crap going on directly behind them, the fact that all of the icons are fuzzy and look like excessively-inflated 16 bit art that doesn't match the rest of the landscape rendered in ""fantastic"" mode.  The tutorial gives you a set of directives that you follow because you're told to, not because they provide any compelling narrative, or stitch together actual game mechanics, etc.  And then at the end of this little mini tutorial, there's a robot floating off to your left, with the text ""press h [blah blah blah]"", but when you turn to look at him, he perpetually shifts away to sit in your peripheral (and the text rotates away, so if you missed it, you can't read it now).Bottom line, DjArcas: have an actual UI dev take a poke at your game, if you can't draw somebody in during the first 15 minutes of gameplay, then they're never going to discover what's beneath the hood, and that's your lost/flipped sales at the end of the day.

												It was fun for a small while, but after so long it became difficult to obtain research points which are needed to upgrade, research, purchase weaponry, and so on. I personally did not enjoy this game, but whomever that may be reading this might. My only suggestion would be that the character levels up or something to that effect which then grants you research points, but gathering the research points the way the game is currently set up is still a good way to get extra research points. I just don't think that it should be the only way to get them. :-) Either way the idea of the game was fun. Just some of the mechanics behind it.			"

												Started playing the game, went through the tutrial moved around a bit and didn't liek the controls.  Went to main menu, no controls there, had to close the game and start it up and before clicking play change the controls on there.  Fixed what I didn't like, played a bit more, noticed I had a key mapped to multiple actions (Shouldn't it stop me from doing that?).  closed the game reopened to change the controls back to default.  Find there is no reset button to do that.Redownloaded game, and left the controls normal.  Started a new game, went through tutrial.  still no idea how anything works, or how to collect things (walking over them didn't work all the time).  No idea what the power is for, or how to get more.Went into creative, no idea how to make conveyor belts or anything in there, none of the blocks I can place are anything but blocks, and all of them float. Glass isn't see through, but there is a rocket window that is.  There are also multipule blocks that are either ""Testing"" or have no graphic on them, and I couldn't even place TNT.Maybe I'm missing something, but I couldn't do anything, and there arn't any helpful guides that I found either.Edit:Uninstalled and reinstalled, started up a new game on the standard settings.  Couldn't finish the tutorial because I died of hypotherma, but did notice a new exctractor thing.  Also when I looked at the big thing in front of me (CPH) and pressed ""e"" like it said nothing would happen.			"

												////// EDIT - Update for Patch 16 - see bottom //////It's a wildly popular game, and I'm sure this will be a wildly unpopular review, particularly with the short amount of time I've spent with it...but that is simply because the game is NOT friendly to new players, whatsoever.  There is a tutorial, but it is perhaps the single most confusing and least helpful tutorial of any video game in existence.  The player is thrown into the tutorial which does not explain anything whatsoever and instead, just tells you what buttons to press (without explaining what you are doing and why you must do it).There are in game pages you can read (like a reference), but that assumes the player as the patience to actually read through it all. It's 2017. Relatively complex games come with in-game tutorials,  This one doesn't and thus, only those who are extremely patient are likely to take an interest in it.For me, there is too much competition out there (other games) to be forced to learn the mechanics of this one. IMHO, lack of proper tutorial in a game like this is a sign of development laziness. There is no excuse for it.////// EDIT ////////Played the updated tutorial after Patch 16. It is better. However I didn't get far with it. It tells you to place the Holo-Laser Power Transmitter. Yet no such thing exists. I did find some sort of Power Transmitter in my inventory so I placed that, nothing happened...the quest didn't go away. So I placed another one, perhaps I just placed it wrong? When I did, the game crashed.It's a mess.			"

												Game has multiplayer issues, requires ""upnp"", the interface of this game disturbs visuals and the quit button takes forever to shut down the game even with an SSD drive -_-'.After all manually port forwarding did not work with Speedport w724v Typ C, nor did it work on Typ B.Whats quite annoying is the interface it really ruins your fun because it either hangs up or no longer reacts properly.I ran the game on i5 4690K, MX100 SSD, GTX 1080, 16GBs of Ram.One thing i didnt like in its gameplay aspect was that its extremly complicated, hence why i had to request a refund because if theres no multiplayer you wont be able to try things out with more than just one brain >_<.I dont wanna say complicated games suck, hell no, but when i started Factorio it simply made more  fun with a friend so you could try things out together.watching tutorials or lets plays suck because they take away any learning factors.But you should try it out yourself, people say its as good as factorio - maybe they are correct and in singleplayer this game is excellent? For ~4€ Sale nothing to do wrong and with steam refund theres nothing to do wrong twice.Just try it, maybe you dont get frustrated so fast as i did.			"

												Who, even among scholars in the field, could keep up with the flood of attacks on Pius XII that began in the late 1990s? John Cornwell gave us Hitler’s Pope , and Michael Phayer followed with The Catholic Church and the Holocaust . David Kertzer brought charges against Pius XII in The Popes Against the Jews , and Susan Zuccotti reversed her previous scholarship to pen Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy . Garry Wills used Pius as the centerpiece for his reformist Papal Sin , as did James Carroll in Constantine’s Sword . So, for that matter, did Daniel Goldhagen when he wrote what proved to be the most extended and straightforward assault on Catholicism in decades: A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair . Meanwhile, the essays and occasional pieces were collected in such volumes as Holocaust Scholars Write to the Vatican , and The Holocaust and the Christian World , and The Vatican and the Holocaust , and Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust , and Christian Responses to the Holocaust ”and on, and on, until we seemed to be facing what the exasperated reviewer John Pawlikowski called “a virtual book-of-the-month club on institutional Catholicism, anti-Semitism, and the Holocaust.” The champions of Pius had their share of book-length innings as well”although, one might note, never from the same level of popular publisher as the attackers managed to find. In 1999 Pierre Blet produced Pius XII and the Second World War According to the Archives of the Vatican and got Paulist Press, a respectable but small Catholic house, to publish it in America. Ronald Rychlak finished his first-rate Hitler, the War, and the Pope , and the hardback was brought out by a press in Columbia, Missouri, known mostly for printing romance novels. For the paperback edition, Rychlak’s work was picked up by the book-publishing arm of the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday Visitor . Those are both fine presses in their way, and Rychlak has done well for them. But one can reasonably point out that Our Sunday Visitor is not quite at the level of distribution, advertising, and influence enjoyed by Doubleday, Houghton Mifflin, Knopf, and Viking”the large houses that issued the books against Pius. The commentator Philip Jenkins recently suggested that this disparity in publishers sends a message that the mainstream view is the guilt of Pius XII, while praise for the Pope belongs only to the cranks, nuts, and sectarians. Jenkins’ suggestion is worth considering. Still, no one can say Pius’ supporters were squashed or censored. In just six years, Margherita Marchione managed five books in praise of the Pope. The Thomistic philosopher and novelist Ralph McInerny, aggravated by the deluge of attacks, issued a splenetic volume called The Defamation of Pope Pius XII , while Justus George Lawler (a writer best known in Catholic circles for his liberalism) penned a witty evisceration of Pius’ critics called Popes and Politics: Reform, Resentment, and the Holocaust . José Sánchez added Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust , and a slew of German and Italian books might be mentioned as well, prompted, for the most part, by the popular visibility of the English-language criticisms even in Europe. But it was primarily in book reviews and responses that the defenders of Pius XII fought out the war”which is something of a problem. Every pope precipitates biographies, hagiographies, and maledictions, like the dropping of the rain; it is part of the job to be much written about, and the works on Eugenio Pacelli that began to appear when he became pope in 1939 seem innumerable. But no supporter has yet produced a book-length biography in the wake of the recent years of extended blame. Even Rychlak’s Hitler, the War, and the Pope was essentially reactive, devoting a thirty-page epilogue to a catalogue of the errors in Cornwell’s book. We have seen this pattern before. Rolf Hochhuth’s play The Deputy premiered in Berlin in 1963, and its picture of a greedy pope, concerned only about Vatican finances and silent about the Holocaust, immediately caused a firestorm of comment from the intellectual world. Everyone who was anyone felt compelled to weigh in. Hochhuth himself faded away when he tried to extend his censure to Winston Churchill, penning a play in 1967 that claimed Churchill had ordered the murder of the Polish General Wladyslaw Sikorski and, later, the murder of the pilot who had crashed Sikorski’s plane. Unbeknownst to Hochhuth, the pilot was, in fact, still alive, and he won a libel judgment that badly damaged the London theater which had staged the play. Thereafter, Hochhuth found it harder to get a hearing”although, interestingly, the current notoriety of Pius XII seems to have resurrected the playwright to some degree, and in 2002 the Greek filmmaker Constantin Costa-Gravas released a movie version of The Deputy with the English title Amen (or Eyewitness , in other copies). Even without Hochhuth, the wide discussion about Pius XII he initiated in 1963 went on for several years. It produced some overheated journalistic attempts to cash in on the public interest, such as Robert Katz’ Black Sabbath and Death in Rome (the latter being the target of a successful libel suit, this time brought by Pius XII’s niece, Countess Elena Pacelli Rossignani). But the era brought forth as well three more serious and scholarly”indeed, by today’s standards, quite moderate and thoughtful”attacks: Guenter Lewy’s The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany (1964), Carlo Falconi’s The Silence of Pius XII (1965), and Saul Friedlander’s Pius XII and the Third Reich: A Documentation (1966). The brouhaha also prompted the Vatican to begin releasing material from Pius’ pontificate, which appeared from 1965 to 1981 as the eleven-volume series Actes et Documents . In part by relying on these new documents, but even more by simply gathering their forces and investigating each of the incidents taken as the core of the indictment, the defenders gradually tamped down The Deputy ’s claims about Pius XII and the Holocaust. Pope John Paul II was a consistent advocate for his predecessor, and even once-popular notions about Pius”that he was, for instance, the great reactionary opponent against whom Vatican II turned”gradually seemed to lose steam by the late 1970s and early ’80s. It took more than a decade, but the reactive reviewers appeared to carry the day, and the popular magazine press and major book publishers lost interest. A few commentators noted that the whole thing hadn’t entirely died. The historian Michael Tagliacozzo said he kept an open file labeled “Calumnies Against Pius XII.” But most were unprepared when the criticism began again in the late 1990s. To journalists and cultural commentators, Hitler’s Pope seemed almost to come out of nowhere in 1999, and it received almost entirely ecstatic reviews when it first appeared. A few skeptical journalists who remembered the Hochhuth battles” Newsweek ’s Kenneth Woodward and the New York Times ’ Peter Steinfels, notably”doubted Cornwell’s conclusions, but it had been years since they had investigated the topic, and they were unprepared to provide details about the book’s errors. Time was needed for scholars to gin up the machine again, double-check the claims in Hitler’s Pope , and publish the reviews. Some of the results proved deeply embarrassing for Cornwell, particularly the falsity of his boast that he had spent “months on end” in the archives, when he visited the Vatican for only three weeks and didn’t go to the archives every day of that. The Italian letter from Pacelli that Cornwell placed at the center of his book as evidence of deep anti-Semitism had been, he claimed, waiting secretly “like a time bomb” until he did his research.

												Perhaps there's a good game under the surface? I tried this on the recommendation of a colleague who described it as something of a mash-up of Factorio and Tower Defense games (which sounded awesome). However, it's inexcusible to have such terrible control options:Bad: The controls are only bindable from the launcher and can't  be displayed in game, let alone rebound. Worse: The prompts in the tutorial don't reflect any keybind changes and there's a good number of keys.Awful: because it's a Steam game, you can't launch multiple instances so the only way I could check my controls was to fully exit the game and then restart it - utterly ridiculous. Even if there is a good game under the covers the barrier to entry is such a pain I just can't be bothered. However, if you're happy with WASD and whatever default controls the game throws at you, you might have better luck.			"

												I tried Fortress Craft for the first time ... i use a non-standard keyboard layout.- All tutorials just show the standard keybindings- Changing keybindings is ONLY allowed before starting the game!!!- You can have multiple actions bound to a single key, only one will work, no warning ... nothing. - I use ""u"" to walk forward usually. The only binding for this key is ""Walk forward"", yet there seems to be still another action bound to ""u"" and i can´t change it at all. And the best comes now ... the keybindings are stored in the Registry as BINARY values.Reset your keybindings? Oh yes ... deinstall the game and delete the registry. Then re-install. Possible a nice game ... really. But i can´t recommend it, because i can´t play it. So if you are not using a standard keyboard layout and the default keys - you will run into trouble with this game.			"

												Terrible gameplay, constantly crashes fulscreen (only playable at 1080p windowed). Crashes on exiting the game also. Tries to compress the saved gamefile into archives which takes about 10-15 minutes everytime it saves.Ingame mechanics are not explained in the game so you need to watch videos and search web how to actually play the game.It tries to be minecraft, but fails because you cannot venture too far because of energy. Objects have incredibly annoying texture if you play on anything higher than 1080 monitor, unlike minecraft where they were simple but worked. These use highly saturated colors so if you have high contrast monitor it actually hurts your eyes to watch the game (you need to reduce the saturation to about 40%).Overall very badly designed game, a wannabe minecraft-like game with advanced tech but at the end is more annoying, with highly confusing gameplay and dont forget many hotkeys, you basicaly need to use whole keyboard to do one thing.

I loved the original on the xbox 360, but this version, though being more impressive, just feels too hard and is quite boring to play. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you really like complex games. I wouldn't really recommend it on sale either unless you have money to waste on a game you probably wont be able to play. There's nothing wrong with the graphics though as they are really nice. Weirdly though my computer , which has a gtx1080 and i7 quad 6700k would really lag if I opened the developer console./			"

												I bought this game since a year ago, released and indentified as ""New"". Today, I find FortressCraft Evolved labeled as New today. Screw you!This game is crap.

Sorry, it is a bad copy cat of Minecraft when it just one of the troll developer wanting to ride off someone's money in the name of sandbox.Comment posted about his bad game""Is it finished?No. Part of the reason for leaving Early Access is the massive change in the Steam landscape since we entered Early Access. Touted as a place to put unfinished games and get feedback from the community, many games haven't lived up to this expectation, with broken games, abandoned games and 'oh we aren't making enough money to finish it, it's done now!' games. You know who you are ;)"" On the contrary, you are doing it because noone buying your crappy game which placed your game as ""New"" courtesy of Steam's milk maid method of earning money.

												Played this for 10 hours and my eyes hurt. The default lights in the game are yellow and you cannot change that color unless you buy some DLC. Requested a refund and turned down, because I've played over 2 hours. So my advice watch some youtube videos of people playing the game for 5 hours, full screen and see if the yellow EVERYWHERE bothers you, if not, buy the game and enjoy. Better still, save your money and buy Factorio (not on steam yet) it's basically the same game, but without the awful lighting. I've played 400+ hours on that game, no eye strain.Remember kids: Pirate a game before you buy it to save wasting money.			"

								This game is pretty bad. I gave it a shot before and after major updates, and it's just depressingly bad. As soon as I made it through the clunky tutorial, the first thing I see is some random giant robot near spawn with it's limbs freaking out. When I went to investigate, I noticed the ""feet"" wear moving along the ground with the limbs flying in every direction. There was also no collision box with the entity... Anyways, I just felt like in both cases this game repelled me from any desire to really advance in the tech and get immersed.It's also worth noting the lacking visual impact of the intro cinematic. You'd think an exploding space station would be interesting, but nope.			"

												I got the game, as a lover of factory building games, and tower defense games, and the likeI pick up these types of games with relatively low expectations, if I can get a few days of enjoyment out of them hey, I'm relatively fine with that, but I have to say the developer of this game has made a completely unenjoyable game that many have picked up with hope for what it could be.the (lone) developer's attitude ammounting to this: I'm not doing it wrong, and my game is just as good as or better than x other game, people are just too stupid to realize itrather than accepting the fact that he has made an unenjoyable game that's idea of content is long ginds and waits, where you are forced to play longer than steam's main refund policy in before you can even begin to realize how little (and unenjoyable) content the game really has.whats more, rather than properly fixing their game, when an issue showed up relating to directX and unity, rather than fixing than putting out a patch to fix the problem, instead he left people to dig for the fix, even if he did post the fix, it is extremely poor customer servicerelating to the developers live streams, which I've frequently watched both him and streamers he was talking to while they played. the developer of this game uses being a 'lone developer' as an excuse constantly, despite constantly going on about how great his game is doing, if the game is doing as well as he says it is, he can afford to hire proper helpthe developer has reached to point of unsulting those people who have been unsatisfied with the game giving negative reveiws calling them 'abusive' and with ill intentthe maker of this game has no intention of delivering on this game, he slapped together a game, perhaps with good intentions at the start, but he slapped a 'finished' label on it as though that 'finished' label would magicly make people happy with the gamehis attitude towards the people who play his game, is that he shouldn't need to update it, and we should be happy he gives us anything since he decided the game was 'finished' 16 major patches ago, and describes those patches were 'free content' despite the fact that the game was marked as being 'completed' when it was no where near it, and his attitude suggests he could just abandon the game and run with the money if he chose to. now for the POSITIVE (yes there is a positive): the most recent patch, PATCH 16, seems to be a shift in the right direction, polishing the game in a way that fortresscraft has long needed that developer still has a bad attitude, but watching his interactions with steamers suggest that slap from reallity is coming, and he is at the beginning of seeing it coming he talks about how his game would be so much greater if people would just stream and post videos of it more, meanwhile he goes on to their streams and insults them when they do to the point that the big youtubers that took interest in the game in the early stages, now completely ignore his requests. ( in the recent stream by cpw, a well known developer of numerous very well known mods for other games, the djarcas (the developer of forgresscraft) spent a great deal of time saying it wasn't his fault that the person playing was stupid, when the game did a poor job of explaining what needed to be done )now to wrap things up, I've seen enough upstart developers in my own personal work who later got a nice slap in the face from reallity, I'll wait things out a bit and give them time, but the developer of this game needs a serious reallity check if this game is ever to be recomended by me, even as insiginficant as that will likely sound, telling your customers that they are wrong for disliking what you've done with the game is and extremely poor buisness practice.

												While I'm not sure if this is abandonded, it is certainly unfinished garbage. The initial tutorial does very little hand holding, then just dumps you in the game. The client frequently crashes (to be fair, this may or may not be related to hardware issues when my graphics card gets hot), but half the time launching the game will cause it to freeze. I can't join multi-player as the network thread immediately crashes when I try to join. I feel like there's a lot of depth to the tech tree, but I'm still yet to get past tin and copper. *IF* I manage to find tin and copper near my starting location, I'm then stuck unable to find any higher level metals to progress with.EDIT: So after several restarts, and by switching from Mac to Windows, the game is getting better. I'm actually making progress now and starting to unlock the tech tree. I'm seeing more of the game now, but the initial learning curve is very steep, and the game doesn't hold your hand at all. Unless you're willing to be reading forums and searching wikis, you're going to find the start of the game hard.			"

												Once upon a time there were 2 games, one was called Factorio and the other was called Minecraft. One night they both got really drunk and slept together, then out popped a baby game. This is that baby game. I only pratted about for alittle while to see what it's like so nowhere near enough to give it a definitive thumbs up or down, will update the review if i do bother to play again. First impressions are its not very user friendly, frustrating controls and lack of guidance. I like playing games to chill and have a bit of fun and could feel myself getting a bit annoyed with the lack of simple things. Another thing this game claims is that the map is huge and, yes it is but most of that size is of nothingness, just big empty caverns everywhere so goes to show size is not everything. I will keep an eye on development to see if things improve and i hope they do as it could have some potential but as it is, its just a big frustrating borefest.			"

												Horrible. Although it may seem very interesting at first glance the game is littered with problems.The help guide is bugged, the blocks sometimes don't load in your hot-bar, there is no inventory, very limited amount of blocks.. The list goes on.But there's some interesting things to it as well. There is a creative mode, a weather staff that allows you to summon storms and meteorites, and a little drone that follows you around. Along with the option to color blocks, and a seemingly never ending ground limit ( you can tunnel for quite a while)The game is still drowned out by the fact that it needs more care and development to grow into its full potential.

												Pretty sure the dev is 10, might finish before they are 30 at this rate... and it will still probably suck.			"

												Game not playable at the moment, this is very very very early acces ??? Tons of bugs and stupid ideas. Resets chunks bugs, very stupid work storage hoppers and mass storage, (why dont make chests ???) . Weak optimization frame per second. This game is only clone ""Minecraft"" with technic mods and ""Factorio"" Very simple and useless Creative mod. In Minecraft is much better Creative mod.			"

												Game starts: A cool intro, your mothership blows up and you crashland... not just waking up naked somewhere like most survival games.But then, you are trapped in a tutorial bubble, with the instructions to press E by some f#@$#$ing hub.Ok there is a center hub thing, that has allsorts of other things around it, you can build and process things, and make power...Neat! Well... WTF now?!?! Press E near the hub does not advance the tutorial..... Pressing E near the devices just activates them..... I have owned this game for over 2 years now, and have installed it 4 times. Each time I end up in the middle of WTF land.I have no idea why they can not have a normal tutorial.... you know, go here, click this, do that,......F#@#$#@$k no... You get to just walk around and be confused, constantly being nagged to press E to interact with a bunch of Sh!t that does nothing for you.I can understand why this game is totaly unpopular, unpopulated, and unknown... It is because NOBODY has a f-king clue on how to play the god dammed thing.It has nothing to do with fortress crafting or anything... it is all about being in a f-king bubble pressing E walking in circles , and playing like you are interacting with a bunch of cryptic crap.

												I am frustrated. This is a review of the direction of the game and the developer. Make your decision on a purchase accordingly. I have a factory which I have just spent 100 hours building. With one fell swoop the dev has decided that I will practically need to rebuild my whole power production (by releasing a patch that drastically changes production of fuel). For a factory this size, it is no small chore.After having complained about the lack of warning for this change, I was given in-game suggestions to fix this - again, no small chore redesigning/rebuilding.And basically told to suck it up.To the dev: being ""the only developer"" for the game is NOT an excuse for shoddy, poorly-thought-out decisions and not looking after your gamers. This decision is clearly poorly-thought-out, as you didn't even realise the effect it would have on other systems downstream. And while you maintain your skepticism that I use 300fuel/min, I (and others) have already pointed out you need only 100/min to hit this bottleneck in my game. This furthur shows you have not thought out the effects on games running settings other than default (which are available within the base game).(I might add that 300items/min isn't even the default setting)All I have asked for is a way to roll back the changes via beta-opt-in, which you have previously provided for players for AESTHETIC changes.And as a developer, telling your players to ""stick to facts and you might get a better response"" is a very almighty way of saying ""I don't give a damn"" after all of the above.Like I said, I am frustrated.

												What a grindfest. I cant recommend this to anyone, unless you love grinding for a few hours just to get a simple system running. Its not even rewarding when you build a system, cause you gotta grind out that system in ordewr to get the materials to make the next system. Try it, you will get a massive headache trying to run back and fourth trying to craft things that require 9999 different components to make. This game should have a very simple crafting system, and more complicated systems and gadgets.Instead the crafting system is drawn out to make the game longer and to make the game seem like it has more content.

												Long mining/factory/tower defense game but best game I've played.  Needs guides. Auto-farm the hive minds and know what you are doing before building the C5 or start over after 400 hours. (cryoplasm sucks as it should) Take advantage of H.I.E.S.T to start and turn your destop off for the night to collect ore.			"

												Awesome game. If you like sandbox games like Minecraft, Space Engineers and Terraria this game is absolute must. Recommend 10/10. Probably games need more stuff like ores, materials, enemies, etc, but is already awesome and evolving.			"

												Edit : This game has come a LONG damn way. Lots of updates in the past 6-12 months and has Progressed forward since they have hit release!. Glad to see the game added some newb friendly features to help the newer players get deeper into this game. Nice work guys. Changed a Neg review to a positive one! Well done.Old Review >Would really like to say more about this game, but It needs work. All i can really say.<			"

												Update 27FEB2017I switched from No to Yes after playing a bit more. I must admit its not a bad game and the pricepoint (12,99€) is fair. Too slow for me thought - building and automating is fun, manual labour and running errands is not. If you are more of a patient soul than me you will probably enjoy this  ""Space engineer""/Minecraft/Factorio hybrid. (p.s. the huge monsters are awesome). OLD -------------------------------------------------Because of all the hating im going to post my reply to the dev (+ some clarification) here:I expect to be able to play without a major time investment. The game is not that complicated - but the user interface makes it feel that way. Its not that hard - except on your patience. I was impressed with a lot of things like: The early game on the surface with a great view, the awesome spiderbot and gigantic monsters. The scanner, the automation, the lift etc. all awesome. BUT: its feels like its going nowhere - like the game never starts. 20 hours is a LONG time to spend on something. And the 10 last was spent hoping the game would start to pick up. Its more like a template for a great game. Recap of 20 hours spent (as replied to dev):- Used default settings. No idear what they where. - Read the ingame guides. - Didn't get all 7 ressources. Started dying fast when digging deeper.- Research got slow and there where some unknown components missing.- Got really tired of collecting ressources manually - and since research got stalled i couldn't get tubes and thus the ressources up from below.Original review (unaltered):Has potential buy way too slow and grindy. It feels like the developer is trying to prevent me from having fun by dragging out everything into oblivion. Would be ok at 3-5€ or/and tagged as early access.			"

												Edit: After fixing the crashes and the build gun always firing problem - the game is back to fighting trim for me and now am giving it a positive review.  If you want to compare this to Factorio you can and should - they are lots of similarities.  Still the art style and first person perspective are very different.Edit: I had to uninstall and reinstall the game to fix the ""build gun always fire problem"" - now it's back and black.			"
