												Australia: The GameIn a world where there is no law or order and madness reigns, Warner Brothers presents a triple A title that doesn't run like it's in Early Access.Pros:Runs great even on systems that barely meet minimum specs. Extremely well optimized.Looks great even on normal settings.Surprisingly satisfying combat for a system that only uses LMB and RMB.Driving and car combat are great.You can literally spend days of your life doing every single side quest.The only thing that could make this game more macho is objectifying women.Cons:Keep getting in the car on the wrong side.Losing days of your life to this game.No naked women to objectify.11/10 would witness again.

												Some desert weirdo on a lower deck than me was telling me to ""come here and fight like a man"". I ignited a gas can and dropped it on him.Each time I try to continue the game's story, I bump into something else to do and start to fool around for hours.This game is awesome.I'm also lucky enough to play this on a GTX 980 with everything maxed. Shadows, tire treads, heat waves, camera focus, everything's very well done.Years ago, I watched and loved the movie. Today, I AM Max and this whole gigantic desert will soon be my kingdom.Hail the road warrior!Have I mentioned that this game is awesome ?			"

												Pro's:- runs very good, seems to be very well optimized- looks amazing- the combat feels great- story so far looks very promising- sounds - all around are absolutely excellent- great production valueCon's- maybe the driving ... for a game that's so dependant on driving the steering seems a little sluggish. i say maybe because it could be just a matter of getting used to it ( edit: it definitely is. after 3-4 hours of play i got used to it )By far one of the better optimized games of the past couple of years ... it loads and runs extremely well on high quality settings on an average computer. Oh ... and it's gorgeous.Beyond that ... I've only played just an hour so can't say much else other than so far it promises to be an excellent game.Story wise ... it definitely seems like it's gonna be a fun ride. But even with that unknown ahead of me ... I'd definitely recommend it.			"

IntroductionMad Max is a post-apocalyptic, open-world action game featuring Max, a man haunted by his past. Your goal is travel across the Sands of Silence but to do so you’re going to have to build a new car capable of the long journey, after your trusty Black on Black is stolen by the Immortal Scrotus. Much to Max’s dismay, he can’t build this car alone and must enlist the help of several characters from across the Great White, including the trusty blackfinger, Chumbucket.PresentationMad Max is an incredibly good looking game. The graphics are excellent even when not running the game on maxed out settings (I was playing on normal-high) but adding all the bells and whistles makes this game absolutely gorgeous. The character and vehicle models are all very detailed, particularly Max and The Magnum Opus (the car you’re building). MM’s User Interface is minimalistic and clean, only showing you information that you need when you need it and most of it stays out of the way during regular gameplay. The main menu, in my opinion, is where the presentation is let down slightly. For the most part the menu is easy to navigate but when choosing settings you have to select each setting before editing it and then save each setting individually, not only did this make changing settings significantly slower than usual, it also meant that I kept accidentally returning to the previous menu by trying to change values before selection the option.GameplayMM’s gameplay predominantly consists of combat, both on-foot and while in vehicles, both are fun but not without issues. Melee combat is effectively the same as in the Batman games apart from the fact that you don’t have to jump all over the room to keep your combo going, Max isn’t quite as agile as Batman. As well as your fists, sometimes you can find melee weapons, such as maces, though these break after a few hits. However, it’s not all good; you’ll never be attacked by two enemies at once (apart from charging enemies) which makes controlling a fight a little too easy, once you start building up a heavy attack you can’t interrupt it to counter an enemy and enemies always use the same tactics so they very quickly become predictable. Vehicular combat is easily one of the best parts of MM, there’s nothing quite as satisfying as taking on a convoy though taking on two or three cars can sometime feel tedious. To aid you in vehicular combat you can unlock and upgrade several weapons throughout the game such as a harpoon, rim grinders and anti-boarder spikes. MM also features several abilities to use during vehicular combat (most of which are unlocked alongside Opus upgrades) such as the ‘ricochet bash’ which smashes you from a car on one side to one on your other side, dealing increased damage. These two types of combat are used across the game’s activities. What are these activities? There’s the obvious story missions and side missions, both of which I’ll return to later, but you also can liberate enemy bases, disarm minefields, take down enemy scarecrows and sniper towers, go up in hot air balloons to survey the area you’re in and of course, take down enemy convoys. Apart from the hot air balloons, all of these activities contribute to lowering the danger in a region which in turn unlocks upgrades for the Magnum Opus.StoryIf you’re familiar with the films, you’ll know that they aren’t as popular as they are because they have stellar plots, it’s all about the action. This game very much follows the same rule. While the game does have a story-arc it doesn’t really get more complex than what I mentioned in my introduction, it mainly consists of going to certain places to get certain things in order to upgrade the Opus. Of course there are some missions which aren’t like this but those are pretty much just to get them to help you get more Opus parts. I won’t say too much about it, so that I don’t spoil the story for those who care, but I personally found the ending a little disappointing. The final boss fight was nowhere near as difficult as it should have been, I breezed through it in around five minutes, and the story sort of just ends after that fight with no implication as to what Max is going to do, they’re probably setting it up for a sequel or DLC. The main missions and side missions take around 20 hours to complete, the rest of my playtime comes from doing the other activities that I mentioned, not bad for the price.CustomisationMad Max features a great deal of customisation options for three different ‘things’. First and foremost, we have the upgrades for the Magnum Opus, with eighteen different categories and between three and twelve upgrades for each category there are a huge number of options for your car. It’s also not just a case of the more expensive thing is better, some upgrades have a negative impact on your car as well as positive ones so it’s important to find a good balance which suits your play-style. Up next, we have the upgrades for Max himself. With eight different categories there’s a lot you can do with Max; you can choose his jacket, his hair and beard style, what shotgun he uses as well as unlock skills which help you in melee combat. Unlike with the Opus, all of these upgrades (excluding the skills and tools categories where each upgrade is separate) provide and improvement over the one from the previous level. On top of all of these, you also get upgrades from a character called Griffa using Griffa tokens which you earn by levelling up. Griffa upgrades include improved maximum health, longer lasting melee weapons, and the ability to find more water. Lastly, you can upgrade the Strongholds which you find across the Great White, these upgrades directly benefit Max, for example building an Armoury at a Stronghold will refill all of your ammunition when you travel to said Stronghold and building a Water Tower will refill your canteen.AudioThe audio in this game is, apart from the occasional bug, absolutely spot on. The voice acting is excellent, particularly from the actors playing Max, Chumbucket and Stank Gum. The game’s soundtrack is fitting, there’s even a nice little Fury Road easter egg thrown in. The sound effects are also very good, particularly the bone crunching combat sounds and the engine and nitro sounds for the Opus. However, I did encounter an audio bug several times where certain sound effects would not play for minutes at a time such as no engine sound or no sounds during combat.MiscellaneousAs you will have heard, the game’s optimisation is incredibly good, I had a solid 30FPS running the game on normal-high on my pretty mediocre PC The map is pretty damn big, taking a fair few minutes to drive from one end to the other. Of course most of it is empty but what do you expect from a post-apocalyptic wasteland?The non-story/side mission activities get incredibly repetitive, not so much capturing War Boy bases or taking on convoys but driving around to pull down scarecrows or search for scrap gets pretty boringThere’s a first person camera for when you’re in a vehicle, not a major thing but it’s pretty cool to see the wasteland through Max’s eyesMad Max features the same incredibly good Capture mode as Shadow of Mordor which if you’re a fan of screenshots, is just great. MM’s Capture mode even allows you to record videos, though I didn’t try that out myselfAs well as the Magnum Opus you can drive any vehicles which you take from enemies and the store in StrongholdsVerdictEssential Purchase.Mad Max is a fantastically good post-apocalyptic, open-world game with great graphics, tons of customisation and a lot of activities to keep you busy.

												A bit of Far Cry mapping, big world, Batman fist fighting mechanism with a raw street fighting feel that makes you want to fight more and more, oddly the same kind of feel of Assasin's Creed Black Flag when you're driving your car in this endless waste , instead of a boat and lots of water in Black Flag, and take care of enemy vehicles (including storms but we have sandstorms here), collecting this and that along the way (reminded me of Just Cause), the way they made driving and racing a whole lot of fun in this kind of game (hello Rage!) , upgrading your character and car by doing things...and there are a lot of things to do in this world.....you would almost forget the story. And that's also very good so far. Voice acting is top and the whole scenery and atmosphere is great. It's Mad Max. And you can be Mad Max. So let me make this clear. It's not a shooter. There are guns and you can shoot them but the focus is not at shooting. The driving and fist fighting takes the most of it. And what a pleasure that is!They took a long look at some very good games out there and mold it together to make Mad Max look great. They succeeded. Great game, lots of fun. Yep, after 5 hours of gameplay I can see where this is going. Another lots of sleepless nights.After 45 hours of gameplay: Yep, it's a very good and addictive game. I saw some reviews with a bit of complaining 'bout that it gets the same after a while. Taking a break now and then will help. After an 8 hours work shift everyone wants to go home and do something else. But after a view hours of 'doing something else' it's great to step in Mad Max's shoes again. They get comfortable the more you wear it.After 80 hours of gameplay: Woh, time is getting abstract playing this game. That's always a good sign when you're having fun. There are some very good missions here. Got the heart pounding and the adreneline rushing. Almost have completed the map but still not sure how much more I get and I realy don't wanna know. As far as I'm concerned this game can go on and on and on. I got 73% of the achievements so the end must be near. My advise is to don't rush the missions and first clear out the regions one by one and do the missions when they are in the regions you cleared out. And take your time and enjoy searching for all the goodies! It'll be over too soon. Very good game this is.			"

												ProsGreatly optimized giant open world game (with some limits when reaching map borders), game barely goes under 50 fpsGreat graphic, and awesome locations (Be on top of a mountain and look down)Vast amount of locations (over 200 places to visit)Melee focused with Batman Arkham series styleLevel up and build your character / vehicle statsRelic collectibles telling the story of how it all startedSandstorms events, you're wandering around, and all of sudden your partner starts to screamInterceptor and personal dog Can feed from the remaining ""fauna""Awesome and helpful partner ConsCollectibles (There's just too many, it's overwhelming at start)Few ragdoll glitchesShort storyVehicles driving system isn't the bestYou get V8 close to the end, when there's almost nothing to do anymore.At start, i didn't think i would enjoy this game, but seems like i had to change my mind after a few hours, and if you like giant open world games, this surely will do for you, make sure to mix a bit of story, and a bit of side activities, so you can have a good going through the content.

												At first glance, Mad Max is a fantastic open-world adventure teeming with things to do. The excitement can give way to boredom because the short story can’t hide the required grind to advance. Still, there is a plethora of different dusty environments and strongholds / outposts, while the detailed landscape is full of things to do and discover.Total size on my hard drive: 32.8 GB++ Optimization is stunning. One of the best optimized games of the past year or two.+ Graphics are great. Light, dust, haze is a great icing on a highly detailed cake.  Clouds look a little low-res at times, but the skybox looks fantastic in general (if you like sunsets / sunrises, there are some great screenshot opportunities).+ Punchy sound design. Explosions have great impact.+ Great story - gritty and grim - but it’s short. Do yourself a favor and complete the Wasteland side-missions in addition to the main campaign. You’ll get to know the factions a bit better and the game feels more complete.+ The wasteland is wonderfully detailed. Rocks, caves, forts, pumping stations, strongholds, outposts – even though it is a dusty wasteland, there is plenty of visual variety.+ Customizing the car. From the body style, to the suspension, engine, armor, and more, you can really make the car you want to play the way you want.+ All the unfinished missions and quests return after finishing the main story campaign so you can take your time, explore the wasteland, and 100% the game if you want.+/- The hand-to-hand combat is a riff on the Batman Arkham combat system with fancy finishers but without gadgets. It works well enough, but nothing outstanding about it.  (If keyboard & mouse is your preference, be sure to have a 3-button mouse.)+/- The game is a grind for scrap, which is used for much-needed upgrades. If you hate grinding, walk away. If you enjoy exploration and looting, then Mad Max is an amazing experience.+/- Child slavery content warning. There isn’t much, but it is there.- Checkpoint saving is the primary method of storing progress. Awkward in a sandbox game. You can save the game from the menu, but it does not hard-save the last checkpoint; it saves Max to the nearest fast-travel location. Not very useful.- Driving mechanics are sub-par; floaty and imprecise, the smallest bump can send the car flying, leaving Max facing the wrong way in seconds as the enemy speeds off into the distance. Not good in a game that focuses so much on driving. The Gastown race almost made me rage-quit the game.- Enemies are endlessly re-used.- Grinding is required. Upgrades are sometimes hidden behind completely clearing a region of threats. - Glitchy menus. Hitting Escape to view a new log entry would frequently result in seeing the menu headings, but no images or text. Switching to another menu then switching back would usually fix the issue.- Messed up mission progression. Need to build the “Jack”, a special class of car referred to as an Archangel. Well, the next part of the mission wouldn’t trigger, no matter what I did. Checked online. As it happens, I had parts on the car that were a level HIGHER than what was required to progress. I had to un-equip all upgrades on the car, and re-equip only the upgrades the game told me to, and the rest of the mission triggered properly.- Some quests that were supposedly optional disappeared without warning because I chose to continue with the main story first. All the missions return for completion after finishing the main campaign, though, so there’s that.It was a challenge to bring Mad Max to an open world game, and Avalanche delivered an incredibly gritty, detailed world and a mature story. While the story itself is not open-ended, there is clearly a chance for sequels - with possible franchise potential. Fans of Mad Max and open-world explore-and-loot games should give it a try – especially since it now discounts during Steam sales to $10 or less. There’s a lot of value here. Recommended.			"

												Something is happening here.  A lot of review sites, you know, the ultra progressive authoritarian ones who think that gamers are dead, gamers are over, and gamers don't have to be your audience; are telling people that this game isn't worth playing.Are they all upset that gamers have finally woken up to their lies, attempts to control a narrative, and utter contempt for us?  Are they now telling us that games that are fun and worth playing aren't fun or worth playing?I am having fun with this game.  There's a lot of mechanics at work here, I enjoy how the car is something central to you that becomes more powerful as you progress.  The combat is a bit simplistic, the shooting controls will throw you off (until you realize that shooting is more of a 'power attack' than a standard attack),  but the world is gorgeous, the gameplay is compelling, there are lots of things to collect without it feeling like overload (I'm looking at you Assassin's Creed 4 and Dragon Age Inquisition).  The questions to answer are:Do you like games in the vein of Just Cause 2? (same production team)Do you enjoy a post apocalyptic setting?Do you enjoy an action game with RPG elements?Do you remember that playing games is supposed to be fun?Count up your ""yes"" answers and if they're 50% or more yes, then that's your answer on whether or not to get this game.Trust the gamers, the Steam reviewers who paid for the game to play it.  Do not trust the media sites, the ones who only give positive coverage when it suits their political agenda.  Or when a certain company *konami* flies them out to a private hotel for a week so they can play their game.			"

												Mad Max is an intriguing game to review, and a tough one to succinctly assess. It captures the atmosphere of its source material very well, presenting an open world of majestic dunes and industrial wreckage, replete with anarchy, chaos and quasi-spiritual linguistic quirks. Avalanche toss players right into this turbulent land, and the game thrives in the moments where Max is jostling with War Boy raiders on the open road or tossing ignited cans of gasoline into their scrappy fortresses. But it’s also a title which seems, at some point, to have gone through significant changes (perhaps related to its delay in 2014), and some of the hastier joins around the story pacing, resource systems and progression mechanics still remain.Befitting of a Mad Max game, the vast majority of the plot concerns Max’s tireless quest for a V8 engine. He’s forced to build a new car (with the help of the irrepressible sidekick/acolyte Chumbucket), after his famous Interceptor is stolen by a roid-abusing chap with the very Mad Max name of Scabrous Scrotus. Though this encounter leaves him bruised and bereft of car, clothes and equipment, Max does at least leave a chainsaw blade in Scrotus’ forehead for good measure. In order to piece together a vehicle worthy of Chumbucket’s ‘Magnum Opus’ moniker, Max needs to roam the dusty wastelands, scavenging scrap, trading favours with local warlords, and ramming or punching every War Boy, Buzzard or general road filth who tries to get in his way.Pretty much everything in Mad Max is upgraded through the scrap resource (including, somewhat bizarrely, Max’s combat skills), so any of the open world activities that reward scrap are potentially worth doing. Luckily, that’s basically all of them; so unless you have a worrying compulsion to clear the entire map of icons it’s possible to almost exclusively stick to the things you enjoy. A few of the story missions will force you into owning certain upgrades or tackling specific side-areas, but this is kept in moderation.Avalanche’s art team have done just as tremendous a job as their technical division (the game runs incredibly well even on minimum-spec PCs), creating a dozen or so desert zones that actually look distinct from one another. Red, Mojave-like scrublands border rolling dunes, which in turn become rockier, mesa-filled landscapes, or areas pocketed by vents of near-luminous sulfur. For an area of land that’s ostensibly barren, it offers a palette of bold colours and striking, post-civilisation landmarks.Roaring through these realms in pursuit of a convoy, harpoon primed to pull wheels off escorts, War Boy boarders tumbling in your wake, and a well-aimed shotgun blast turning another wheeled foe into a spinning, combusting ball of debris, is one of Mad Max’s most exhilarating diversions. The versatile Shadow of Mordor-esque photo mode isn’t just in the game for moody shots of the desert, it’s also for snapping some of the magnificent explosions in full bloom.The various camps, hide-aways, and ramshackle dwellings scattered across the wastes do eventually end up seeming over-familiar. For a decent while though, it’s a delight to roll up on a new location, comb it for scrap, engage in some un-gentlemanly BatMax fisticuffs with the locals, and explore whether there are any unique, handcrafted little dioramas contained with. Such encounters are only enhanced by the random events of Max’s world. You may end up having to deal with a honking patrol showing up while you’re on foot and vulnerable, or a powerful dust storm bellowing its way across the dry earth.Of such things are the finest of Mad Max’s moments made. There are some shonkier aspects though, which aren’t gigantic problems in themselves but are amplified by being repeated across hours upon hours of playing. Max has a bit of a case of ‘Geralt movement’, where the weight of his animation will often carry him beyond the ladder, box of scrap, or weapon you’re trying to line him up with. A great many things in this game demand that you stand somewhat perfectly in front of them and hold down E (or equivalent) for a bit, so that gets rather old.It’s also extremely aggravating to have to watch an almost-cut-scene every single time Max tips gasoline into something or refills his water canteen (effectively your back-up health potion, and probably preferable to the other options of consuming maggots and dog food). This is borderline crazy, because I’m pretty sure it all still happens in-engine. Having the game cut to black after those actions makes very little sense. If modding is ever possible, the removal of these repeat irritations must be a priority.Though it doesn’t directly detract from a lot of the fun, Mad Max shows various signs of features being hastily changed or wrapped up before they were quite ready. The game’s opening tries to impress the importance of fuel and water for survival, when in fact those resources are now found in abundance across the wasteland (I never ran out of fuel, and having an empty canteen has no additional penalty).Every ‘Top Dog’ mini-boss looks basically the same, attacks in the same manner (a couple do have assistance from underlings), and may even use the same voice actor. Encounters in the wasteland offer ‘intel’ on these fights, vaguely hinting at a sort of Mordor Nemesis system of particular weaknesses, but it’s obvious stuff like ‘he doesn’t like being shivved in the neck!’ The same tactics which work on all of them. Clearing minefields seems like a hold-over from a time where Max was intended to regularly use a wider selection of vehicles than the Magnum Opus. You can still collect a full set of cars, but outside of races or a sneaky plan to drop mines in front of a convoy, only the mine-clearing buggy (and attendant dog) has such a specific purpose.Unfortunately, some of the Magnum Opus upgrades are tied to the reduction of ‘threat’ in different regions, and that can mean having to take time off from your campaign of chaos to settle into some familiar busywork. Getting the top level harpoon (the only one which can reliably yank down the most hardy ‘scarecrow’ structures dotted around the land, and one of the most hilarious weapons overall), means sniffing out a whole lot of minefields.Some of the unlocking methodology may irritate, but the way upgrades for the Opus are handled is quite novel. Later armor and ramming options are not automatically the best way to go; they’re heavy, and become a trade-off with speed and handling. In this sense, you do actually have to design a workable car to some extent. It’s refreshing that the ‘last’ upgrade in a chain isn’t automatically superior by default, but is instead a new variable to consider. Mad Max has its fair share of quirks and odd design decisions, but creates a sandbox of anarchic chaos that’s both wonderfully rendered and, on PC, a technical marvel. A word on the sound design too, which is just as responsible as the art design and animation for capturing the whump of explosions and jaw-breaking punches alike. There’s much to revel in. But although it’s appropriate that a game from this universe should feel like some aspects are misshapen or hastily bodged into shape to fit a grander vision, the annoyances really peel away at you over the course of a title as long as this one. Like the original 1979 film, Mad Max seems destined to be a cult classic; beloved by many, in spite of the components that appear to have been ripped out and reassembled, or otherwise abandoned to the desert basin.

												This game is great because it perfectly captures the life of an australianEdit: attached review because I was tired of getting panned for not actually reviewing itALRIGHT! You just moved to Australia during a drought. All of a sudden, the police take your car. So you pick up a shotgun and ride around killing warlords in some random hunchback's car. IS IT GOOD?:IN MY OPINION yes, thats why I thumbed it up you dummy!. Reviews say it's repetitive but i have more than 2 days play time and i havent gotten bored but once, where you had to do a lot of tasks to level up your car. UNLIKE FREAKING ARKHAM KNIGHT SO BAD IT GAVE ME PTSD, this game is INCREDIBLY optimized. I run most games 1080p @ 30, I run this ultra at 60. you could probably get away with using a potato (no not a bad computer, a literal potato) and get 30fps at high/medium. It does this without sacrificing looks too, as this is easily another beautiful game from avalanche. IF YOU ENJOY CAR COMBAT/ JUST CAUSE 2/ HAVING FUN/ SPENDING 60 DOLLARS/ AAA GAMES THAT ARE ACTUALLY WORTHWHILE/ VIDEO GAMES/ PC MASTER RACE/ BEING ALIVE/ IF YOU HAVENT BOUGHT THE GAME YET YOU'RE AN IDIOT, then this is the game for you.Final rating: 9.9/10 and personal contender for game of the year			"

												Mad Max is a third person, action game set in an open world environment, based on the Mad Max film series. It was released on September 1st 2015 on PC, PS4 and Xbox One. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic setting, much like Fallout New Vegas, we have plenty of deserts, canyons, wreckage and tunnels to explore.  You play the character, Max Rocktanksky on the story to regain your lost car, and along the way you will build your own car, The Magnum Opus. Game play within Mad Max is very heavily focused around vehicular style. Half the game is based inside of your car and you are having to deal with other enemies in their cars as well as on foot. You can use a series of different techniques, whether it be simply ramming the opponents, using your shotgun to blow tires out, or your harpoon weapon to take down the threats.  The other half of the game is done in a commonly seen third person action style - this is extremely similar to the style of combat on show in the Batman Arkham series of games. The hand to hand combat is simply brilliantly put together and you can pull of some amazing combos, blocks and parries, and it all looks so fluently done.  I played this game on 4k resolution, so of course the game looks good, but seriously, this is the best looking game on PC I have seen. It just looks gorgeous, every single one of the textures is high resolution, the animations are perfect, some amazing screenshots can be taken. One would probably expect that when on 4k, but it still looks amazing when playing on the lower resolutions, I'm not even going to say 1080 is low, it looks gorgeous even on that.  It's easy to see why they pulled production on this game being released on the PS3 and Xbox360, I would think even the current gen consoles would struggle with this. The story in Mad Max is a stand alone and is in no way related to any of the films. As someone who has only seen the recent Mad Max film, I didn't have much nostalgia going into this game, but I can honestly say that I was drawn into the plot from the get go. I got attached to the characters straight away, Chumbucket (your cars mechanic) becomes your friend as you progress through the game and quickly turns into a friendly companion. There are some scenes which really take your breathe away as they are very unpredictable and some of which had shouting out in sheer horror as to what was happening, that is just how invested I got into this game's plot. This game is not exactly a difficult game to play. The Arkham style combat mechanism is very easy to pick up and pretty much master and the art of vehicle combat can very easily be learnt after a few trial runs. The boss fights in the game can be pretty challenging, as they should be, and you will probably have to redo a few of them until you nail down the perfect fight. You will more than likely die more from accidentally blowing your self up, driving down a cavern which has no bottom, or something silly which you weren't really meaning to happen. As with most open world games like this, you can really make your character way too overpowered for the stage in the story you are on with upgrades and stat increases, so if you too much, you can soon make the game have no challenging aspect at all. The open world side of this game is truly awesome. I have never seen a map so full of things to do, areas to explore, items to find, hidden objects to locate, side quests, everything. There is literally never a minute in this game where I was bored. If you don't feel like doing a story mission, go for a drive into the dessert and kill some bad guys for more scrap to upgrade your car. Want to go do some exploration? Go digging in an under ground cave for that hidden object to tick off the list. There is literally something every 30 seconds of traveling in game to see or do. Some open world games feel like they are as vast as an ocean, but as deep as a puddle. Mad Max completely blows that theory out of the water. Not to mention the world is absolutely huge, there is so much depth to whats in it, you will never struggle to find something to do. On the topic of side quests, another nice little mechanic which I really loved in this game, was the ability to upgrade towns and strongholds which you venture into, by completing ""Projects"", these are simply a style of fetch quest which in turns gives you a little buff in that area of the map you are in, such as whenever you come back to town, you'r ammo gets replenished or something. A key one to try work your way towards in every town, is to collect scrap even when offline, it's nice to login after a few hours to see you've collated a few hundred scrap and can now upgrade your car! The full story, and I would say 80% of the side missions completed, took me just over twenty five hours to complete. That to me is a huge amount of content, purely from the story mode and the side missions alone, I still have plenty of hidden objects I want to seek out, strongholds to take over, cars to unlock and races to take part in, this is easily another ten hours worth of content to see. Not to mention the amount of achievements on offer too. I only reached 18 out of 49 on my run through, so there is plenty to do on that side of things too. Even though I was playing on 4k resolution, with all of the options at max graphical settings, I was still getting a constant 60 FPS. This game is perfectly optimized for any rig, and will run like a dream on almost anything if you set the options correctly. The only technical problems I ran into, was that sometimes the dialog on a few of the NPCs in the open world sometimes cut out half way through, but as long as you have subtitles on, that won't really make a difference - it only happened three or four times for me in the 25 hours I have played. In my opinion, I think Mad Max is going to be a surprise contender for ""Game of the Year 2015"", it is simply amazing and I will go as far to say it is in my top 10 best games of all time. Hats off to Avalanche Studios, and Warner Brothers, who have redeemed them selves ever so slightly with this amazing PC release. Do not waste any more time and get this game now!

												Mad (for looting) MaxI have mixed opinions on this game, mainly cause I've spent 60 hours playing every single story and side mission, as well as looting every possible thing I could in the Big White. I'll start by saying good things about the game; it is gorgeous. It has a lot of Mad Max lore easter eggs and the main story of the game is pretty good. I enjoyed the characters and the trippy Max moments he had throughout gameplay, as well as car combat and several ways of taking down enemy vehicles. Probably my favorite side stuff was taking down convoys which are the closest thing to the Fury Road movie. And now to the bad side; it can be VERY repetitive and frustrating to do some challenges. Doing some looting is interesting cause of the locations the devs put their effort into (like camps), but most of the looting locations are just copy/pasted and always the same: 2-3 loot crates and maybe 1 history relic. You'll rarely stumble on new car models unless you've previously maxed out the strongholds so you know where to go.And don't even get me started on the annoying clearing minefields and challenges (""Stick It To Ya"" being absolutely THE WORST challenge to accomplish).Overall, this game reminds me of Assassin's Creed/Far Cry games. They're not bad, but they aren't anything special really. I know that once I've completed every possible thing I could and unlocked all achievements that I will never play this game again. Not because it's bad, but because it felt so good finishing it.tl;dr - the game's like pancakes. You'll love it at first, but play it too much (like myself with 60+ hours) and you'll get sick of it.			"

												Highly recommended.While some people will compare Mad Max in a negative light against the Batman series or Shadows of Mordor, Mad Max is by far my favorite of the three.Pros:+It's friggin Mad Max.+It's canon Mad Max.+You have a badass car.+Explosions.+HUGE world, tons to do (despite feeling like you're doing the same things on occasion).+Combat is more fluid and less tedious than the Arkham or Mordor games.+Explosions.Cons:-Slightly repetitive at moments.-Sometimes feels a bit TOO big.At the new $20 price tag I can't recommended it enough.

 Drought, gasoline, fist fights and fast cars! Max, a lone wolf who just wants to leave this damn filthy piece of land where survival of the fittest applies vigorously. All Max knows is this post-apocaliptic society stucked around Gastown. It's the last bastion of humanity surrounded by hostile land called Big Nothing. Max desires crossing part of Big Nothing called Plains of Silence in order to find what lays behind and start a new life. Forget what was lost. Rumour has it water and green vegetations are plenty there, but no one ever returned to confirm these legends. Still there would be no reason to return to this brutal and violent land led by masochists and maniacs. Max focuses everything just on one purpuse - build a car able to cross Plains of Silence - but what happens on his way its up to you to discover.Mad Max offers surprisingly large open world full of brutality, violence and day to day surviving. Wait, let me stop here, survival in this world for Max is as difficult as swimming for Michael Phelps. I would expect more elements and threats, but in this desert it's easier to meet a stranger than in my town on Sunday. Even though the Mad Max's world is welldesigned and every location is unique after a while you won't know whats lack of gasoline, water or even ammunition. On the other hand action parts of the game are spectacular and make the game very enjoyable. Beating to death almost every person you meet, destructing cars of other survivors and dismantling Scrotus's (President of Gastown and surrounding lands) camps makes game very entertaining.When we move to RPG elements, don't expect much. Story is short and plain. I was so curious about Max, or even about the past, how the world turned into this hellish place, but no, sorry, no explanation for you. Eventhough many relics (usually postcards) and monuments (lighthouse etc.) persisted the decline of civilization, you are here only to look around and examine them. It's not bad, but there could be so much more! Max's memories or just tale from anyone who you meet through the game. After all this game feels amazing despite all negatives. Pros✪ Amazing graphics and cutscenes✪ Welldesigned and unique world✪ Large open World✪ Action combat✪ Nice system of improving Max's abilities✪ Car customisation✪ Interesting collectibles✪ Races!Cons✪ Lack of survival elements - plenty of water, gasoline, ammo...✪ Short and plain story✪ Very easy to complete, the only ""hard"" parts demand your time not skill✪ Missing depth -  at any cost I wouldn't call this RPG✪ Repetitive side missions✪ Lack of options7/10 Good quality action game			"

												Finished Mad Max late last night. Being an open-world game, I neglected the main story for the most part and did all sorts of side activities. Usually not much of a completionist but this time around I did a lot of that. Cleared the Threat Level in each area to Zero, leveled up Max to the Max and so on. Didn't do any races though, not a fan of races. Anyway, I think there is plenty good with the game but it definitely won't be a good time for everyone. The campaign itself is fairly standard in length but the world itself took centerpiece during my time. Probably one of my favorite post-apocalyptic wasteland worlds in all of gaming. The atmosphere is on point. Desolate, destroyed, almost alien. Inhabitants having lost all sense of mercy or ethics. So does Max, the protagonist. One of the few games where the players actions feel perfectly in line with the character and world. Characters and story are sadly passable at best. There's only very little to get you invested in them. An alright excuse to keep things moving. Besides the main story there are several major side stories which happen at the four friendly strongholds. Each has their own ideology and it was compelling to see how humans could make sense of living in an utterly destroyed world. These strongholds can also be upgraded by scavenging for special loot-crates in the world which open up permanent benefits for Max, health-refill, tank-refill, etc. These are very useful and make the tedious scavenging hunt worthwhile.Most of your time will be spent doing other things though. The world is huge and it is daunting at how much there is to explore at the beginning. You slowly discover new areas but in the end it all goes the same way. You search for the hot air balloon at each area and by using it, the fog of war clears, enemy camps and other points of interest get marked on your map. These places are identical across the whole world, so it's easy to get in a repetitive motion very quick. Taking over enemy camps, clearing minefields, looting the many small loot locations, taking out convoys. The thing that makes this still fun and worthwhile is the constant change of activities. At one point you are brawling your way through enemy camps where you can spice things up by melee weapons, makeshift bombs and special finishing moves. On the surface the combat is not deep but the combination of ways you can fight makes it always fun and satisfying. It's a similar story with the second big pillar of combat, by car. This one starts of seriously under-powered and you will have a hard time tackling even smaller convoys. Upgrading your car - especially weaponry - will drastically turn the tides and soon you'll feel like an absolute bad♥♥♥♥♥of a one-man army ripping off tires during high-speed car battles, sending enemies flying through their windshields with your high-powered hook or straight up turn vehicles into fiery explosions of metal with your thunderpoon. It's as bad♥♥♥♥♥as it sounds really and does not get old.This all, the actual gameplay and the beautiful and diverse areas help make the otherwise repetitive tasks a joy to fulfill for the tenth, twentieth time but in the end, they are repetitive tasks and if it is not fun the first time, I doubt things will change. For me it just clicked. I enjoyed clearing the world of enemy patrols and camps, upgrade my car, destroy huge enemy convoys and see how strongholds strived and prospered by my hand. After clearing the whole map of threats and doing all side missions, tackling the final third of the story became sort of a final pay-off to me. A nice and fitting end to a long road.			"

It is a bit repetitive, and the story isn't very good... but the game...is fun, the characters are charming, it's addicting, action packed, rewarding, and filled with so much relentless content that I've played for more than 20 hours, and still feel like I have so much more to do!It is madness in all the right ways, a must have when the price goes down a bit. Update: I finished the main storyline today, and the last 2 acts actually make the story pretty good with some very unexpected events.			"

												I am very much enjoying this game so far! I've never seen a Mad Max movie. But I don't think that would matter. The game exists as a standalone entity.The game world is huge. As one would expect from Avalanche after Just Cause 2. You have basically full freedom to explore the world, and complete challenges at your own pace, while the story will still guide you along.Much of the game consists of driving to various scavange points, and hunting for all the Scraps, and defeating all the enemies at each location. Combat is fairly similar to the Batman Arkham games.Yes, it can sound pretty repetitive, and it may be. But the characters are interesting, and the world is vast and full of things to explore and discover. Upgrading your car, unlocking new abilities.It's a very satisfying experience.If you're looking for something to play while waiting for Fallout 4 and/or Just Cause 3, this is the perfect game for you.

												Avalanche are to be praised for distilling everything a Mad Max game should be into an incredible whole. It's got fantastic atmosphere, controls, graphics and sound design. Very loving and true to the source material, it demonstrates why Mad Max has really just been a videogame waiting to happen.Also, for the PC version specifically - this is how you do games on release day folks. Silky smooth and gorgeous graphics, not even a stutter. The opposite of Batman: Arkham Knight.I utterly recommend this game.			"

Well, it's simple -- Mad Max is an excellent amalgamation of tried and true, well-polished sandbox mechanics that serves as the ideal interactive tribute to the extensive Mad Max film canon. Hardly revolutionary, but by all means fun, engaging and superbly optimized.			"

												Story is you are Max, left stranded for dead, vehicle taken and dismantled to scraps, and left with nothing but your clothes.Now full of vengeance and teamed up with your hunchback sidekick Chumbucket, it is now your destiny to rebuild a better machine called the Magnum Opus, something that the wasteland will tremble in fear from decades to come.That is basically it as you will have to travel the wastelands going into uncharted territory to build and upgrade your new vehicle from scrap all the way to making the Scrotus clan eat your deadly wheels as you will have to fight to survive by gathering food and water, taking over enemy clans camps, and racing your way to collect scrap as you upgrade.The vehicle has much to offer as you upgrade everything from wheels with better traction, harpoons to destroy enemy vehicles, paint job, armor, and all the works.You can also upgrade Max as well from his looks to his uniform to upgrade in combat as well, combat system kind of reminds me of Batman, only with shotguns and plenty of satisfying German Suplex's to even make Brock Lesnar jealous.Other form of combat comes from your vehicle as you the other half of the time you will come across gang of other vehicles looking to demolish, this all comes in handy as you can use your shotgun to shoot the enemy fuel tank in on kill or be strategic and use your harpoon to take off portions of the vehicle or lasso the driver out and flip him to oblivion.Now this may not be a popular opinion and I do apologize but to me, the racing and the driving controls in general were just way too stiff and clunky for me, I know you can upgrade for better traction but even half way through the upgrades my vehicle still felt like it was swimming through Crisco. Also, good luck with racing in the game, if you even as much get hit and swerve into the rocks while driving, you might as well restart the race because it takes forever to catch up to your enemy drivers while avoiding hazards to make sure your vehicle does not spontaneously combust while skating through the crisco wasteland. That may not happen to others, I don't know but that is my opinion.The other little minor issue I have is the weak ending. Throughout the game you will also have your share of boss battles which they all fight in the same pattern pretty much, either dodge out of the way to avoid their powerful attack or click the mouse to counter their attacks and lay into them with a series of punches and kicks as you will also go into fury mode which turns you into a ninja and you become a buffed up one man wrecking crew..but yeah the bosses were kind of weak, especially the ending boss, oh god the ending boss, which made the ending feel anti climatic..I mean here is the build up for the Lord of the wasteland called Scrotus, built up to make him look like a complete bad a**, and what do they do? Oh let's just put him into a car playing scaredy cat as we toss like 3-4 harpoons at him..and thats it..thats the last boss. Also the ending story just came out of nowhere as I felt like it was rushed, once again, maybe it was just me but they could have done something more to it.Other than that, graphics are great, I love traveling through the desolate wasteland to the creepy tunnels.Music and everything else is pretty good.So on this game it is kind of in the middle for me, but I do recommend it, just let the price go down a bit and then see what you guys will think. It is a good game with a decent length of 15-25 hours of gameplay depending on how many missions you go on. So yeah, a little repetitive but still something worth checking out.			"

												I really liked it at first, but now 23 hours in ive come to the conclusion that this is a very repetitive game and have gotten boring for me. All you do is dismantle camps, destroy scarecrows, sniper towers and cars. Im so tired of it, its just the same over and over.. Others may like it, but i dont. And then theres the eternal search for scrapsThe story is decent at most, and the missions arent really that fun.  And the combat system, its 3 buttons, but the variation in enemy's kind of makes up for it imo.The things i do like about this game are: The game world and atmosphere, its just amazing, they really nailed the postapocalyptic wasteland, the weather and setting changes all the time, looks great.Its very well optimized, didnt expect to run it on very high/max with gtx 760 card.Upgrade system is goodLots of actionAll in all, gets a 6.5/10 from meIf it is heavily discounted and you are okay with 15+ hours of fun before it gets repetitive, then sure go ahead, but NOT worth 46$ imo.Wish i could give a neutral thumb			"

The most exciting part about Mad Max in my opinion is the bond between you and your car!Combining action and racing mechanics to offer you an unforgetable experience!The game is revolutionary!That is something we haven't seen in a long time and really takes the gerne to the next level!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=516959315So moving on about the combat!Pretty cool basic stuff inspired by Batman games.You can upgrade fist,parrying equipment for bigger chances oof survival or use sivs to escape from difficult times!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513635883 Another part that might really concern you is the story!Well the game starts quite slow but it's really interesting moving on and i like that in order to progress through story you have sometimes do side quests and scavanging in order to upgrade Max and Magnum Opus.The story itself is pretty descent BUT the only disadvantage of it for me is the ending!Yes it's kind overdramatic and not quite rewarding as you'd expect!it's just a sad mind♥♥♥♥!Overal pretty descent though!Last but not least the sounds are amazing so detailed as well as the atmosphere!Find youself lost into the deadly sandstorms hunted by Scrotu's boy!And the game engine is phenomenal!So well optimised since Day 1!!!It's simial to the one Shadow of Mordor uses and offers some amaaazing views while it's really gpu-cpu friendly!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=523966132 Overal my experience on Mad Max was way better then expected it really was!It really caught us off guard and that's what i love seeing in games these day!GG Warner Bros!You gave me the time of life! <3Gameplay:9/10Story:8/10Graphics:9.5/10Sounds:9/10So what are you waiting for? ;)			"

Why couldn't Arkham Knight have been this good?Grand Max Auto: The Arkham WastelanderThe Good~+ The rich and engaging story of Mad Max~+ 18 hours in, at the time of this writing, and I've only just barely upgraded the first of five strongholds and explored about a fifth of the map. (This is a plus because it means at least 100+ hours of  game play.)+The driving feels solid, and the collisions are very satisfying.+ The combat is very similar to the Batman Arkham series, with powerful combos and counters, taking on 5 - 10 people at once. + The game map is massive. I couldn't tell you how many miles it is, but at full speed in a car with nitro it takes about six minutes to go from Jeets (East) to Pinky's (West.) And it's a relatively short distance on the map.+ DOZENS of upgrades for Max himself, and the Magnum Opus (your car.)+ Your actions feel like they influence the world, and have weight on it's people and economy.+ The lack of guns has no impact on the game. Even with a single home-made shot gun the game is always fast past and action packed.+ Awesome graphics+ Awesome voice acting+ You get a bomb sniffing dog!The Bad~- Exploration is limited to scalable area's marked with yellow paint. You can't climb just any ledge or rock. Due to there being so many of these areas, however, the game does not feel linear at all.- The Sniper Rifle Mod for the car is more of a tool than an actual weapon. Yes, it kills people, but you can only use it from the Magnum Opus. You'll end up just using it for reconnoiter and safely taking out key defenses.- With any massive open world game there is a bit of repetitiveness. Collecting scrap can become tedious in the beginning, but eventually people will help you when you build up the strongholds. - Chumbucket can get a little annoying. But that's not really a bad thing on the game's part. Just my preference for his character. - I've found a few bugs. But not many. Sometimes the map won't open and you have to exit the game to reset it. Stomping out rats and lizards for food can sometimes launch you into the air, which will result in you dying upon hitting the ground. The pause menu can get stuck on a bio entry, even if you've read it. But it's easy to just click out to where you need to go.  The game doesn't like it when the car rolls........ .... ..... ..All in all, the game is awesome. Pick it up if you can. You won't be disappointed. ~Love and Peace			"

												A good game of Mad Max, showing flashes of excellence, but fails to keep up those levels in its entirety. The setting works, the design of many missions is valid, the overall gameplay is rich and well structured and the stages of guidance are very entertaining. In contrast, the fighting is dignified but nothing more, the activities on the distance can tire out and if you don't structure your game there is the risk of encountering too many ""walls"" along the flow of the main quests.

												Mad Max is a game where the divine meets the driveshaft. Where fates and furies touch a flywheel.It's awesome.First of all, it's gorgeous. The monotony of the sand dunes is mitigated by a surprising amount of variety in the environment. Pools of oil, rock formations, and flocks of birds split things up naturally. But there are also traces of the past civilization: broken bridges, artificial roads, and vehicle wreckage abound.The lighting and particle systems are also excellent. The sun's rays make for a lot of dramatic imagery against what might have been an otherwise dreary landscape. I think I took more screenshots of Mad Max than any game I've ever played. My random travels generated breathtaking vistas at an astonishing rate.And the first time you're caught in a storm outside away from any shelter - it's an unforgettable experience. Progress on challenges gets lost if you die, so the storms can present a real threat to you. They disable fast travel too, so there's no easy escape. This is all as it should be. It makes for some tense segments where you will absolutely have to improvise to stay alive.Dying is otherwise not that big of a deal because most other types of progress generate an auto save. This is also as it should be. The system encourages you to be bold and more reckless than you might be otherwise, and that seems really in tune with the spirit of Mad Max.And that's another positive in general: Mad Max was ripe for an open world driving game, but I had no idea. A lot of the concepts and themes translate perfectly. The explosions, the fighting, ramming cars together - it's all a ton of fun.That said, the melee combat is one of my chief complaints about the game. It gets very repetitive very fast. I was hoping there would be a way to acquire more guns like a silenced pistol for stealth or an assault rifle for mowing down large groups. Sadly there's only the shotgun, and its upgrades don't feel that significant. There was a chance for a lot more depth in both the leveling system and the combat progression for the game as a whole, and the developers didn't take advantage of it.The car combat, on the other hand, is fantastic. I haven't had this much fun blowing up cars since Twisted Metal, and that came out 20 years ago. The amount of customization and improvements you can make is great, with the possible exception of the weapons. Having to choose between rockets and a minigun might've made things more interesting. But it's hard to knock it at all because the Thunderpoon is the best weapon I've used in a game in years. Plus it has the best name ever.THUNDERPOON!The open world aspects and the collectibles were pretty standard, though I was impressed by the variety. Most of it didn't feel old, even at the end. There are three notable exceptions.First, clearing the minefields was tedious, and this is largely because you have to get a different car from a base and it disappears if you fast travel - I wasted a lot of time forgetting that fact.Second, the day/night system. There are some missions that can only be performed at night. There are also only certain enemy and car types that appear depending on the time of day, and those distinctions are necessary to complete some of the challenges. BUT, there's no way to fast forward time. What's worse, time can get ""stuck"" and not move at all. You can spend literally forever waiting for the time to change so you can do that one mission and it will never happen. Nothing you do will affect it. It's incredibly frustrating, and I don't understand how it survived the testing phase.Third, the challenges. There's a single achievement related to getting all of them, and if you didn't know that before you finished mopping up everything, then you really screwed yourself over. There's no new game plus where the challenges carry over. And enemy spawns at the end of the game when it's all been cleared out are basically nonexistent. Just Cause 3 solved this problem with its ""Re-Oppress"" feature. Having now played a similar game where that doesn't exist makes me appreciate it a lot more. Plus, that one achievement will add 15-20 hours to your time even if you're prepared for it. They should've found another way, or at least eliminated the more troublesome, time-consuming challenges. It's ridiculous.Finally, let's talk about the story. It's generally presented well. I have a minor gripe that some of the cinematic action sequences would've been even better if they were playable. It felt like I was forced to watch instead of do things too often. What's worse is the story they were telling itself - clearly, secondary to the gameplay. Max is very much removed from all the characters in this part of the world: he doesn't know a single soul when he gets there. And whatever connections he does make throughout the game seem forced and one-sided. He's just not that sympathetic of a character the way they portrayed him here. On top of that, it doesn't feel like Max had a lot of agency to make choices or change anything. The world is more or less the same for his passing, despite everything you do as the player.The writing is amazing though. It makes Mad Max one of the best examples I can think of to showcase how dialogue and diction can be top notch while the overall story and plot is bland. Every time Chumbucket (there's a main character named Chumbucket!!!) opened his mouth I wanted to write everything down to save for later. Each of the characters has their own distinct personality and vocab. The voice acting on top of the writing is solid. These things came together in micro-moments where the cinematic sequences were shining bright examples of what can be done in the medium.Mad Max is a great game. Probably the best open world game I've played in recent memory. It's easily better than Watch Dogs and Shadow of Mordor. The comparison starts to get more interesting when looking at Sleeping Dogs, as one game's strengths might be the other's weaknesses. If Mad Max had a combat/upgrade system more similar to Sleeping Dogs and an improved story, then I think it would've been unstoppable, and competing with the likes of Fallout 4 for GOTY 2015 awards. Hopefully they make a sequel and improve those few areas while adding things like a true stealth mode and more time with Dinki Di. I'd buy that game faster than you can say ""Thunderpoon.""			"

												It's on sale for the price of an expensive ale at a festival. It's got amazing graphics, is extremely well optimized, and the mechanics are solid.There may not be a wide variety of enemies to murder, but the vehicle combat more than makes up for it. There's something exhilarating about slamming into the side of a convoy at 90mph and unleashing hell, especially as it feels impactful.Seriously. Buy it. It's on friggin' sale and I don't regret buying it on release for full price.			"

												What a surprise! The best action post-apo game since ""Rage"".The game is great on so many levels. First of all it works great (nice optimalization) ! 60 FPS as a starting point gives smoothness especially needed in car chases (btw car mechanics are cool). Incredible vistas! They are rather minimalistic in details but this is a good thing. The feeling of isolation is palpable here. Also the different color moods are fantastic! Another good thing is hand to hand combat. It's got batman's formula and It's enjoyable. The story is ok with many cool looking characters but don't expect to much. The downside is too busy map. The core of the game is grinding for scrap but with two good mechanics like driving/combat you don't mind doing so. Overall I give it 9/10 score-(if you don't like post-apo then 8/10)  great fluid car-combat gameplay with beautiful scenery!			"

												Mad Max is good enough to recommend heavily discounted, but ultimately is made for those who enjoy grinding, collecting, and achieving. +Driving and car combat done right. +Huge open-world map. +Very deep level up/upgrade system for both Max and car.+Level design makes most of repetitive areas to add challenge. +Fury....beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of warboys without button mashing!+Gameplay hooked me a few times for hours. +Chumbucket. Starts out as annoying hunchback-clone from 300, but grows on you. -Repetitive. Repetitive. Repetitive. Re...you get the point. -Minefields. These really suck. Drive around semi-randomly, wait for dog to cry, exit car, press and hold E. -No story. I mean none. -Large green or purple dot stays on screen to denote a destination removes immersiion. We already have a map, mini-map, and green line on mini-map leading us to destination. This is an over-the-top, unnecessary dumb-down.-Superflous button-mashing; I understand the batman style melee mash, but ""Press and hold E to mash"" certain chests and doors? Why, developer, why??-Ladders: first you have to line up with them just right,  press E to get on, and slowly trudge rung by rung until you make it to the top. -""Press and hold E to collect scrap"" Why the hell do we have to hold a button for no damn good reason? 7/10 Will return to Jeet's Stronghold again.

												I deleted my previous recommendation to write this new one. I just wanted to warn Steam users (my friends, to be more precise) about some things about Mad Max.I still believe this is a great game, an awesome game, a supreme blast and loads of fun...BUT:Game went from owerwhelmingly positive to very positive, and for me too.The best is for me the wasteland, the scenario is utterly inspiring and really really cool.There IS one thing that lowered my opinion quite a lot: the survival aspect. How cool it would have been if the initial pressure of surviving remained a bit longer.Instead, you level up without even noticing nor wanting it, and your character is MAXed a lot earlier than the middle of the game. I thought several hours ago in the game that a realistic difficulty, a ""Fallout: New Vegas Hardcore Difficulty"" was missing in this game. Now I am absolutely convinced this lack is a flaw.What if all that scrap scrap everywhere scrap would have been components instead, or the lack of water and oil was a bit more preminent, more crucial?What was good, remains good:The relics (THIS is the best for me: to see pictures and words of the vanished world we still live in, for now). I look behind every stone in the desert for those.The storms! THAT is what I'd like the game to be: a struggle for survival more than a normal action movie that it is.A bit more of madness: that's what this (almost a) masterpiece lacks.More Mad and less Max.On the other hand, once you own the game USE the screenshot editor, because it adds a solid +50% of fun to the game.

												  Mad Max is a very repetitive game. You go to an area, clear it out, and drive to the next area while upgrading your vehicle and grabbing debris from the sand. Blah blah blah...Look kids every game is repetitive, but is it fun? Heck yea! What makes it fun isnt the story or how REVELUTIONARY it is. Its not either one of those, but i thought i should address that since some people wont want to touch it if it isnt changing how we see its genre. Its fun because you have cars and blow stuff up like the movies. Its just a fun and simple game to sit back, relax and enjoy yourself.			"

												I've been a Mad Max fan since long before the days of Fury Road, and no one was more afraid of this game than I was. The pre-release gameplay videos didn't impress me. They didn't look like the movies. I wanted to play the movies!  I'm proud to say that this game is a genuine Mad Max experience. I played Mad Max as if it was one of the movies, and it was ♥♥♥♥ing great.The obvious highlight is the car combat. It's the greatest. There's a mini road war around every corner, and they make for the best screenshots. This game has a photo mode. It kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Look at my screenshot library. Come on, do it.  The on-foot combat uses the Arkham system, but you can't win by closing your eyes and mashing left-click. I've tried it in Arkham and Mad Max. It didn't work this time. This pleases me. Somehow, large volumes of enemies actually can become overwhelming, at least until you've upgraded your melee skill.  You can make your own Magnum Opus! Your own car! You can deck it out with spikes, rams, hood ornaments, and pretty colors. There's also several sets of pre-made vehicles, called ""Archangels."" They suck. You'll hate them too. They ought to leave them out of the sequel (a sequel? Yea, I'd dig it).Now, this next bit split the critics from the average gamer-- the wasteland is loaded with an endless amount of activities to enjoy. I love this. Too often will I play a sandbox game and grow bored when I discover there's absolutely nothing to do but shoot at cops (Grand Theft something or other). Mad Max gave me enough distractions to have fun for at least 50 hours.Oh, and there's parallax occlusion. If there's one thing I enjoy in life, it's parallax occlusion. Mmm....Yea, it's gr--fine, I'll say it.What a lovely game.I said it. You can go now. The review's over.			"

												What we've got here is an open world game made by Avalanche Studios, the people who developed Just Cause 2. They've focused their attentions to the escapades of the iconic Max Rockatansky, but they haven't done the best job at it because this is a frustrating, inconsistent game that never reaches its full potential and relies on a familiar bag of tricks to get the job done.How do I sum the whole thing up? Well  Imagine someone taking elements from Far Cry 3, Assassin's Creed Blackflag, Batman Arkham Knight, Watch Dogs or just any open world game, throwing a bunch of those elements into a blender and slopping the result into a neat little package.Overall there IS a good game here, you just need to invest in a lot of grinding to find it.Full video review:

												From nearly start to finish I enjoyed my time in the Wastelands with Max.  Yes, the missions and tasks were repetitive and, yes, the combat was more of the same from Batman or Shadow of Mordor but the world was immersive enough, attractive enough (in its own wasteland way) and just plain fun enough to keep me returning.Nearly every ""repetitive"" aspect managed to find a way to stay interesting.  Melee combat felt heavy and brutal and slamming a guy's head into a wall or suplexing him never got old for me.  There's a hundred or so locations where you can seek scrap metal or water but they varied from tents to old subway cars to cliffside villages to abandoned restaurants to deep caves.  You're tasked with tearing down giant metal ""scarecrows"" but, to the last, I enjoyed flying past (or through) them, launching a harpoon and collapsing them behind my racing vehicle.  You'll do a LOT of driving but the landscape is wonderfully created as you progress from dried ocean bottom to ravaged desert towns and upland desert to the mountains of waste and scrap surrounding Gastown.Vehicular combat is a special joy and from early on you are armed with a harpoon that can tear off armor, tires or doors or pull a War Boy out of his car or a sniper out of his tower.  Further car enhancements allow you to attach grinders to your wheels Ben-Hur style or launch explosive spears to quickly end a fight.The game certainly isn't perfect.  Boss fights are almost all copies of each other, clearing mine fields is tedious busy work and there is a major plot-required race that deviates from all the other driving you'll do in game.  The plot is nothing special and this game is definitely more about the journey than the destination.  But Mad Max and the Wastelands kept me coming back for more days on end managed to never feel ""old"".			"

												There once was a guy named Max, Who didn't know how to relax, Some guys stole his car, but they didn't get far before he cut off and flossed with their sacks.Max is not a happy guy. His car gets stolen, and a lot of people want to kill him, his only friend being a crazy mechanic who is basically Smeagol high on Petrol fumes. Walking around a desert with sand in your boots all day would make anyone mad.This sets Max on a quest to build the perfect car, the Magnum Opus, which draws a lot of comparisons with how the game plays. Like the Opus, the game itself is incredibly well optimised; it runs smoothly, at a very high frame rate, and has clearly been crafted with a lot of care and attention. The downside to this is that I feel like they could have used those spare resources to do more with the game engine, to make the game look better than it currently does - it's not ugly, but there is definitely room for an upgraded ""Definitive Edition"" later down the road. AA does a mediocre job of eliminating jaggies and it would be nice to have an MSAA option, with higher quality textures.Using a third-party injector, I managed to improve the colour palette - a desert will never be bright and shiny and colourful, but there's definitely room to enhance and sharpen the existing palette. All in all, it's beautiful to behold, and the night sky is a sight to behold.I've never been a fan of the films, but I love this game's story. It's clearly explained, I know exactly what's going on at all times, and it's interesting. I also like the upgrade system, which is fairly comprehensive and gives you some great options to customise both Max and the Magnum Opus.A lot of folks complained that I hadn't spent much time with the game and therefore had no right to judge it, so I'm changing my review to reflect having spent more time with the game - I now give it an 8.5 out of 10. While it may not technically be the best game ever made, for me, it ticks all the right boxes and does a LOT of things right. You won't regret buying this, I can promise you.			"

												Well, that was an amazing experience. Really a great game which came as quite the surprise. Taking bits and pieces from Just Cause, Far Cry, Arkham, and Fallout and blending them together in an honest view of the Mad Max post apocalyptic world, Avalanche created a true gem. So much content, such great optimization, such a compelling story (after you get past a certain point), such memorable characters....this game exceeded all expectations. I very highly recommend this to pretty much everybody. Play it.p.s. There is plenty of post game content, and plenty of room to do some expansions if they are so inclined.			"

												Well, I am a huge fan of the original Mad Max trilogy, and an even bigger fan of Thunder Road; however, I have had zero desire to play this game.  Call it poor marketing and grumbling from negative reviews.  I grabbed this game for $9.00 off of the September WB Steam sale, and even after DL'ing it, I had pretty much zero desire to actually play ....Then I turned it on and HOLY SH!T!!!  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE!?#1 The intro -- The game makes it very clear ... YOU ARE MAD MAX!! Go do crazy!#2 The Graphics on PC -- I'm running a GeForce 780 GTX and have all settings on Max, funning 60 FPS no problem and it is by far, the most beautiful game I have ever played to date.#3 Story, Voice Acting, Production Etc. -- Top Notch and in perfect harmony with what a Mad MaX game should be.One Con -- and it's a minor one -- Playing with keyboard and mouse is a little annoying.  Not game breaking, but it's a little wonky, in terms of sensitivity.  A controller is optimal, but again, not a deal breaker by any means.If you like Mad Max, and have been on a fence about this one ... do yourself the favor and buy this one.  You'll thank me later.

												The ONLY bad thing with this game was that it was released the same day as Metal Gear Solid V which ruined their sales. It's a fantastic, action pumped bloodbath, set in the open world of Max Rockatansky aka. Mad Max and it's just amazing! Gameplay is similar to other 3rd person games like Tomb Raider. It has RPG elements where you upgrade your armor and weapons and also unlock parts of the game world to gain bonuses. Get that V8 Interceptor!Graphics are stunning!!! Music is good, sound is also fantastic. This game is worth your money, especially if you like to hunt for achievements because it will give you good 80+ hours. I didn't finish all the achievements yet because I don't care, but I still got almost 90 hours for my money which is well worth. Highly recommended! :thumbs: Graphics:  ★★★★★ Sound:  ★★★★★ Gameplay:  ★★★★★ Music:  ★★★★☆   Overall:  ★★★★★ "

												Genre - Post-Apocalyptic 3rd Person Action/RPGI have watched the Mad Max films and really enjoyed the latest installment. When I first heard of this game I thought ""oh a movie tie in that will follow the film plot and be pretty pointless"". However, I was able to get this game on a good deal and was surprised to find this a great example of how to do a movie tie in.You take the role of Mad Max and meet a character called Chum Bucket early on. You then spend the time together helping out allies by destroying enemy landmarks and capturing camps. As you progress you earn scrap that can be used to upgrade your car and Max himself.You spend a lot of the game in your car, which you would expect, and the battles you have with other road users seem to work well with Harpoons and your Shotgun being essential gear.The story itself is short and sweet, and It is in addition to the film and allows you to delve into Max's world even deeper. As you are in a fairly open world you can also compete in races, collect relics or farm scrap to your hearts desire. I plugged many hours into the game doing just that and although I have had my fill, did not manage to get all the achievements by the games end. I might be tempted to go back though at a later date.The game isn't too difficult but adds a fair challenge at certain stages and is great fun to play. Definately in my top 5 games of 2015. Unfortunately I think it was over shadowed by Metal Gear being released at a similar time. Now I am just hoping for a Bullet Farm DLC. "

												Prepare thine buttox, ye who enter this realm of criticism.I'm not trying to be a prick here, I just want to be honest about what I actually think and experienced.While this game has cool GRAYFIX and all that, gameplay is lacking pretty hard.Here's the generally good stuff;*Very nice visuals, as I mentioned.*Even though the world is mostly sand and rock, each territory has nice variety and cool locations to check out.*Melee combat has a lot of fun moves and contextual things like slamming heads into walls or pushing people over rails to their doom.*Vehicle combat is satisfying and visceral.*Story is fairly good, not much to complain about here, except the ending is a bit anticlimactic in my opinion.*Characters are interesting and memorable.*Voice acting is superb.*Low usage of invisible walls, instead uses level design and deadly storms to create boundries, that's a plus in my book.And here's the rest;*Poorly balanced, very easy to get very overpowered.You can reach close to Max (ohoho) level before you leave even the first territory of the game, obviously designed towards being rushed through, which is a bit sad.*Supplies are extremely abundant, fuel, water, food, ammo, whatever.Never once did I run out of anything other than water, which I promptly refilled moments later.Skill upgrades are detrimental to the game, making supplies 'even' more abundant, giving you a ton of health turning you into a tank (combine with good armor and you'll be unstoppable), making combat even easier, etc.*The only thing that ever got me killed was me being silly where I fell off cliffs or such, oops.*Melee combat is pizz-easy(yay censorship), even if you use no combat upgrades.Melee combat also had potential to be a bit more interesting, but for no actual reason everyone fights with their fists, nobody except you has a gun (not counting snipers), and melee weapons are fairly useless and magically break after a handful of hits.You also can't store melee weapons, not even in your car.*Vehicle combat is pretty fun and provides some challenge, only real complaint here would be that you'll never ever leave the main vehicle to drive any of the other tons of vehicles available, because you can't bring cumbucket with you on anything else.*Vehicles handle poorly with keyboard controls, so get a controller if you wanna have more fun driving.Additonally, vehicle physics are a bit strange, with vehicles uprighting themselves constantly and being near impossible to flip.*Some vehicle upgrades are a bit silly, for example Armour upgrades where you stick a few guard rails on the side of your car and suddenly it weighs enough to warrant a military tank licence.You also can't even unlock and purchase the V8 stuff until there's like, 5-10% left of the game to play.*Gameplay is very (VERY) repetative, all bosses (yes literally all) are copy-pasted with different colours and voice lines.That is a huge point deduction in my little book.*Side missions are fun for the first few times, until you realize they're all copy-pasted as well, sadly.*Sub-par freedom of movement, unbefitting a modern game with a modern engine,you can only climb specially marked areas, nothing else, not even a belly-high fence.It feels very primitive and unorganic, especially for a modern 3rd person game.*Racing is, as you probably would guess by now, pizz-easy.You either outrace every other driver within 20 seconds or shoot out all their tires within 10 seconds ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)I can't write much else about it since it nullifies its own existance so quickly.*Exploring can be fun for eyecandy alone, but don't expect to be rewarded with anything substansial, only generic supplies, and Project Parts here and there, but..Projects makes the game, once again, even easier, giving you infinite fuel, ammo, water, health refills, etc.""But hey, it's fun to upgrade strongholds you big meanie!""So thought I, as I assumed it actually had purpose, but it turns out it has no function whatsoever. None.Unless you count looking less arze with each stage, but yeah..*So this is supposed to be related to Fury Road right?Supposedly, but there are no real ties between the movie and the game, in either direction.Max himself also acts wildly differently between the movie and the game, it doesn't even seem like they're the same person.Compared to the movie, in the game barely anybody has guns and Max can't fight anywhere near as good in the movie as he does in the game.But now I'm stepping towards reviewing the movie instead of the game so let's drop it here shall we.All in all, if you like Mad Max, you'll get a thrill or two out of this generally casual game, but it's certainly not worth full price, it's more along the lines of 15-20 euros.

												This game is basically Grand Theft Shadow of Arkham, which isn't a bad thing, it's just that there isn't anything new or groundbreaking here. If post-apocalyptic open world is your thing, you'll probably enjoy this. Everyone else would probably do well to wait for a price drop. I was able to catch this on sale for $20 with the DLC included, had I payed full price for everything I probably would have been a bit disappointed.			"

												When I start playing a new game, I always take notes of my first impressions (I was a reviewer of pc games about a decade ago), it's like a habit now for me. And I've rarely been so impressed with the early game as I was with Mad Max.The menu, the presentation and early game - very well done. The game world is unbelievably beautiful. It's freakin' gorgeous! Probably my most visually impressive 3rd person action game that I've ever played. Characters have good animations and are detailed. Controls are intuitive. Special effects and lighting is jaw-breaking. Weather effects <3, scenery <3 - everything is eye-gasmic. Day and night cycle makes the desert look so real and beautiful and ... sometimes lonely (in a good way).This game is based all around the battle cars and combat between them. It's very satisfying to combat a full convoy of them. The cars look deadly and diverse. Cars sounds are very satisfying. Even the controls are pretty good! Nitro animations looks awesome + you can speed up your car with it and whack other cars of the cliffs and stuff.I really like the hand-to-hand combat (It has some Shadow of Mordor vibe to it) and how the upgrade system works in Mad Max (too bad that you can get all the upgrades before or slightly after the midpoint. Of course, only if you do lots of side objectives, like I always do in these kind of games. And there are a lot of those little objectives or mini quests that you can participate in. (Just like in Batman or Far Cry, or Assassin's Creed games).The random storms are awesome. You really feel like you are in the middle of a f*cking disaster! Lots of mini tornadoes, lightning and flying debris that can damage you greatly. I really like how quickly you can descend the ladder. You just slide down and you're good to go. I hate when other games puts you in that unskippable animation and you sometimes have to waste 10 seconds of your precious life on the ladder.I really like how quickly Max can get out of a burning car before it explodes. You are never stuck in silly scripted animations.One thing that made me wonder - why Max can't jump high? He really despises jumping. I bet he couldn't even jump over his own shoes if they were lying somewhere on the ground. But then I realized. He looks like a ~35-40 year old man. He probably had to do a lot of jumping and running in his life so somehow he damaged his knees and he is just not able to do this sh|t anymore, so he said - f*uck it, I will not jump in my life anymore! Just like big NBA players in their late 30s. They can only run at a slow speed and can't even think about lifting off of the ground. Oh and explosions. Explosions. Seriously, explosions. No other game has better looking explosions. Period.This game has a little thingy called - capture mode. It literally makes you a photographer. if you want to be one - you can learn some basic things here: composition, depth of field, perspective and so on. Last 15 hours I was just hunting screenshots. Sometimes to make/take a perfect shot you need to invest dozens of minutes, but it's well worth it at the end. I've done like ~300 screenshots. I believe I could have done thousands of them If I would have used that mode from the very start. It's a great tool and I urge you to try it. (It's a bit buggy sometimes, but you will enjoy it anyway).Since I mentioned bugs - this game is pretty bug-free. BUT. I was trying to 100% this game and hunt for all the achievements and then a bug happened. I completed a mission and as a reward I had to receive the ability to build a maggot farm in one of my strongholds, but the game doesn't allow that. I've searched the internet and this thing is STILL not fixed (sad, sad face). I was/am disappointed. A great game with such a -+ game-breaking bug. But this should only matter to those who like to hunt for achievements.As a 3rd person action game - it has it all. And if you are one of those people that like to LIVE in the world, not just run through the main quest and be done with it - this game will provide you with lots and lots of fun hours.On a side note - this is how Fallout 4 should have looked like (from a graphical standpoint).

Mad MaxNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 8 A strangely beautiful wasteland to explore, with some extremely satisfying explosions. The storms you encounter in the wasteland are something to behold, especially as they come rolling towards you in the distance. The textures could stand to be a higher resolution, and occasionally glare out at you. But for the more part, Mad Max has done a great job crafting a desert that you're actually interested in exploring. Also of worthy note is the audio. Voice acting is well done, though Max himself can sound kind of strange at times. Sound Effects are fantastic and satisfying. Guns sound like they're actually powerful, explosions are wonderful to behold, and sandstorms are ridiculously intense. The combat animations in the game are also quite well done.   Gameplay 8 If you have played Shadow of Mordor, that's a great game to compare Mad Max to, gameplay wise. You spend the majority of your time exploring locations for scrap, destroying enemy camps, and competing in the occasional race. Combat is a simple combination of buttons to punch, execute, block, dodge, and shoot. Even after several hours of combat, I've found it still very enjoyable to smash some War Boy's faces in. There is no stealth in this game, and the variety of weapons is mediocre (shotgun, thunderpoon, harpoon, occasional melee weapons on the ground which all function the same way, and your fists). Driving your car is at the heart of this game, and Mad Max knows this. It can take a little bit to get used to driving your car, and sometimes you'll find yourself wondering why it spun out the way it did, but for the more part it is an entertaining ride through the wasteland. Car Combat is also very well done, with satisfying impacts as you smash into other vehicles, and a few options on how to take them down (shoot out the tires, pull the driver out with a harpoon, dismantle the car with a harpoon, etc). Of note is the upgrade system for your car. Max's upgrade system feels almost pointless, as it simply serves to make him stronger. However, your car is where the upgrades shine, with each upgrade offering different advantages/disadvantages. There is plenty of customization on the car to fit your style.    Story 6 I am not yet done with the storyline, but thus far it has been relatively engrossing. I won't say to much as to spoil anything, but Mad Max does do a decent job of keeping you curious what will happen next. The story does take many hours to complete, so there is plenty of content there.   Multiplayer N/A This game is single-player only.   Replayability 6 This is a toss up. While a very enjoyable game to hop into and beat folks up/destroy some cars, I don't see Mad Max as a game that one would come back to over and over. This is simply because of the fact that anything other than the main quest in the game can become somewhat repetitive. Mad Max's redeeming factor in this field is how satisfying the combat is, both on foot and in the car.   Overall 7.2/10 While a solid, mostly bug-free, wonderfully optimized game, Mad Max suffers from being a little to repetitive at times. That being said, I would recommend Mad Max to most any gamer, as the gameplay is very well done, and as a whole the game is fun experience. Take the chance to explore a well-crafted wasteland, and some of the best car combat I've seen in a game.

												Madmax is a great atmospheric, immerisve and intense open world action game that has some fun driving gameplays and moments but suffers from some progressive issues in difficulty of gameplaywhere some mechanics downright break later on in the game. Pros + Colorful Dialogue and decent voice acting+ Really well optimized and blew people away into thinking it was going to be a Mad Disaster like Arkham+ Immersive world with a day and night cycle, Windstorm, Dust storms, and lightning storms pure chaos and fun+ Great graphics and backdrop. The post apocalyptic world of when the ocean receedes+ Plenty of activities placed throughout the map, Blowing up towers, Strongholds takeovers, Random events request from wastelanders.+ Combat melee system similar to Arkham, easy to play and understandable controls+ Driving Combat system is fun and intense. Has good assortment of customization and weapons to handle destroying your enemies and objectives.+ Nice selection of car bodies and max customization+ Satisfying to see Cars blow up and the physics behind them as doors fly off and parts, Able to aim at thier section to gun them down or+ The capture option and movie option included lets you make awsome shots and movie moments. + Cool guys don't look at explosions moments. Full of explosions everywhere Cons - The plot and story is weak and non existent and characters are not as memorable except for ChumBucket and Max- As max level up the game becomes easier and stays easy, Lack of difficulty slider and challenge.- When fury is leveled up completely it only takes a few combo to activate it, your character will constantly be in fury mode even when you don't want to be in it to execute some of the other finishing moves.- Enemies never get any different in stronghold nor strongers, Always same group of mobs of warcrier and mobs- Boss fights uninspiring, All the sequences pays out the same to destroy them, dodge, hit you're done.-Fast travel to upgraded stronghold can be used anytime and less use of gas makes the scavanging completely useless and not needed. Max level makes collecting gas and this entire aspect of the game completely obselete as you will never have to collect gas anymore.-  Activities are fun but becomes a bit tedious as it is required to do to unlock car parts and accessories, to even get any unlock you have to do many many of it to advance your vehicle or progress it.

												I ate Dinki-Di dog food from an open can lying on the ground.  I ate maggots from a corpse.  I stomped on an iguana and ate it.  AND IT WAS GOOD.Based more off of the recent reboot than the original films, this world will still be familiar enough to older fans even if you haven't seen the new movie.  Max is still Max - the reluctant, passive-agressive antihero who can't even remember why he keeps going day after day.  He simply goes as he always has, because no matter how much he wants to stop he just doesn't know how even if the world would let him.It will be more fun for fans of open-world scavenging and OCD completionists than those who want an amazing plot.  And that's why you should buy it on sale, because $60 is too much.  it's a good game that oozes atmosphere and has some interesting characters.  But the story is barely there.  Not something to complain about in, say, a $30 game.			"

												Most important questions you probably asked yourself before buying:Does it run well? - Absolutely! My PC only reaches the minimum recommended specs and I'm playing on high settings with stable 60 FPS. The guys at Avalanche sure know how to do it right! (Just Cause 2 was the same, perfectly optimized). And not to mention the Wasteland looks stunning!Is it fun to play? - Absolutely!Driving is great! Cars are awesome! Car battles are fantastic! Moving down other cars and patrols are the bomb! Harpooning off parts (and people) is sheer joy! The fistfighting part is good, not outstanding, but good (the word ""proper"" comes to mind). Baseraiding and exploration is fun as well! Cusomization all the way, wether it's your car or Max himself. AND OH MY GOD THE EXPLOSIONS! And did I mention how ♥♥♥♥ing amazing the car battles are? I did? Well, THEY ARE!Does it give back the feel of the movies? - Absolutely!The music, the dialogue, the characters, the scenery, the cars - I could go on. It has the perfect Mad Max feel to it!Is it worth your money? - Absolutely!You didn't buy it yet? ARE YOU MAD!?			"

												It's repetitive. I know this isn't a unique thing to say about it, but if you are the person checking the negative reviews for more depth and not just constant praise then you are in the same boat I was in a few days ago.It isn't just combat, while it's literally click. click. click. right click. click. click. over and over again, this wouldn't bother me. And I told myself it wouldn't bother me when I decided to take a chance with the game anyway.You have no tactical approach to ANYTHING, I know ammo is scarce, but your only gun is a shotgun that you will likely only have a shell or two for most of the time. You don't get any of the other guns you saw in the movies. The problem with this is that if we had more guns in the game with specific uses then combat would actually have a bit of variety with it. The world is not good, I know it's a big♥♥♥♥♥desert, but look what Fallout 3 and Borderlands 1 have. This game copy pastes a lot of locations, and once you've played the first 2 hours you have seen everything unique about the game. It's after you start exploring where you realize this game has about as much depth to /anything/ as a puddle. You won't find unique NPCs or locations and you don't have random encounters. It just feels stale, like the world was generated by a computer and untouched by humans. You aren't ever going to find anything, it's always going to be scrap. Not unlike other games where you could find all sorts of loot, lore or interesting sights and characters. Nope just scrap.This adds to the repetitive nature, I can handle barebones combat, but if the environment and enemies are all the same, it's basically replaying a level over and over again for hours at that point, and that would drag on for anyone. Except those that have hundreds of hours somehow.You might think the car stuff is the bees knees and the rest pales in comparison, but car combat is pretty meh at best, I like traveling in a car I slowly upgrade overtime, I like hookshotting parts of other cars or people in the car and ripping them off. But you won't find the combat anything like it is in fury road, it usually dwells into driving in a circle around the other trying to nitro boost ram them over and over until they blow up. It just isn't enough.You can assault locations like oil rigs, and the game implies some form of tactics here in its tutorial, destroying perimeter defenses and eventually the gate. But it's always the same damn defenses so what is the point?! And you take out all 3 of them (Sniper tower, fire tower, and gate) by just driving past it and using the hookshot to knock them over. It takes all of several seconds to accomplish this!The last thing that initially hooked me, was when I first started I fell in love with how the game was looking like I was in an actual desperation for ammo, food and water. No regenerating health, you need to recover by eating or drinking water, which doesn't come in a large abundance. Ammo is scarce so making careful use of your shotgun for vital targets (No such thing) is important. I kept trying to conserve bullets thinking I should focus on vital targets, but no such targets exist. And of course they ♥♥♥♥ the survival up too with strongholds. With strongholds you can enter them and get your car refueled, health restored, water cantine refilled and ammo fully restocked for no charge. It nullifies the survival feel entirely. Storywise it's incredibly basic, Max just wants to assault GasTown for a V8 engine and some spritual journey crap blah blah. It's nothing special, it ain't bad. But it's not going to be something you remember.Technical wise the game runs fantastic and looks above average for it's time. More forms of anti aliasing would be great since FXAA looks dreadful in this game. I think TXAA would have been fantastic with the subtle blurring. Lip syncing is BEYOND BAD like this is bad english dub anime bad, the lips don't even move and if they do it's not synced at all. AT ALL! How does this still happen in a 2015 game?! It's distracting as hell.The voice acting for the most part was acceptable, but then you find these NPCs, they are like random NPCs that don't do much other then sometimes giving you worthless intel or a little scrap. And I have never wanted to stop hearing so much before, the dialogue is terribly written, the accent is bad, and the voice quality is terrible. The lines feel so forced and feel like a medicore mod was installed in my game instead of it being a triple A game. Hell even the audio for these NPCs are slightly louder then the rest and it stands out.I really can't suggest this game, I haven't played it in like 2 days and I don't feel the impulse to ever play it again. It's sad because I waited a long time to try it, and wanted to enjoy it but I can't. If I had any word to describe this game it'd be ""padding"" I think it would have worked better with a tighter focus on the story and less on putting out another sandbox game.			"

												""Mad Max"" flirts with great, and dances with brilliant, but doesn't end up marrying either of them.The main mission path is really well done as a piece of storytelling, especially as it twists the knife in both Max and the player. (You'll know what I mean.)But...there are all these other, potentially fascinating characters that barely get any exploration at all.The world is both large AND quite detailed as an environment. The effort put in by Avalanche on that front is obvious and impressive.But...when it comes down to it, what there is to actually do in the world is very ""samey."" Sure there are variations on the themes, but those variations are pretty minor. On top of that, all progression pretty much amounts to the same thing (getting scrap to pay for upgrades), and you can get essentially Maxed out (see what I did there?) relatively early. At that point, your actions seem pretty academic and rote, even though there's still lots of territory potentially unexplored.I personally felt that the vehicular combat was extremely solid, and maybe even stellar at points. If you were going to make a road-warrior sort of game, ""Max"" would be an excellent template to follow. The controls make plenty of sense after a bit of explanation and practice, and the overall balance is just about right to get challenge without frustration.But...vehicle combat ends up being rather less central than you might expect. Instead, a lot of what you have to do to advance the game is focused on dismounted, hand-to-hand fighting. The mechanics there actually aren't bad, but the way the encounters are structured makes man-to-man fights boring and repetitive.The Magnum Opus is a very cool piece of customizable hardware, and it's great fun to experience its upgrades as bits and pieces are added.But...for some reason, the Opus never seems as durable as Chumbucket's dune buggy. Sure, the buggy isn't good at vehicle offense, but it can roll over almost any terrain and take a HUGE pounding. Your super-rad, armored assault car goes off a small ledge, and a very sizable chunk of structural integrity gets chewed up. The buggy, on the other hand, seems like it could fall from 30,000 feet and not register any damage. It's a little bizarre.Speaking more generally, I think that one main measure of an open-world game is how well it hides the fact that it's all built on repetition. It's not that something like ""Far Cry"" doesn't have a similar amount of cut-and-paste as ""Mad Max."" It's just that the ""Far Cries"" and the ""Fallouts"" manage to get enough of both uniquely crafted material and fun, snappy gameplay ""loops"" into the mix that the repeated elements become washed out. With ""Mad Max,"" the feeling that you're continually leaving and arriving at the same party just isn't countered very well.Was I unhappy that I spend my money on this game? Not at all. It was worth it. I put a bunch of time into the experience. Avalanche did quite well, but it seems like all the effort got put into the environment when they might have spread out the resources a bit more evenly. It's a touch unfortunate - the game could have been an instant classic if it were smaller but more interesting - but I'm not really ""Mad"" about it. (See what I did there?)			"

												*Note: I'm almost five hours into an open world game that could potentially take 30+ hours to completely clear based on the huge map. I've sampled every different type of open world activity and have unlocked all the core ""equipment"" under Max's glossary.Let's start with what Mad Max *isn't* for those who may be looking for something specific: Mad Max is not a survival game. It has gameplay elements that sound like they would belong in a survival game like water and food scrounging, but this is an open world sandbox action game. Because it's an open world game, it's not as focused on delivering a narrative and tightly scripted action scenes as the recent ""Fury Road"".Now let's get down to what Mad Max is. Mad Max is an excellent open world sandbox in the vein of Just Cause. I say ""sandbox"" specifically because this game gives you a vast number of things to do and unleashes you upon the world to do them. Besides a few main quest goals (the story is frontloaded in the first few hours, as far as I can tell), you are given leave to plunder the wasteland while reducing the threat level presented by the big bad warlord Max is seeking to topple.The graphics in Max's wasteland are solid and I never felt like the world was merely one big desert. This really becomes apparent when you ascend in a scouting balloon and see just how many interesting land features there are to explore. In a way it reminds me of the Fallout series, barren but interesting. The sound design, though, is the real star. Engines revving, powerful explosions, and the crack of Max's shotgun and punches really sell the brutal experience.I can see the core gameplay loop of Max getting old if you don't particularly enjoy the activities of car combat, fighting, and exploring camps. However, I quite enjoyed the ""Arkham"" style combat and the great combat racing that allows you to slow down time to execute amazing attacks against foes that scream along the roads at breakneck speeds.I think it's safe to say that if you played tons of Just Cause (the other game these devs are famous for) then you'll love this game, but if you're looking for an open world game with an involved narrative like GTA or The Witcher, you may be less excited to take your twentieth bandit camp.I'd say Mad Max is a definitely worth a buy if you love the post apocalypse and want to spend hours tweaking a cool car, exploring camps and caves, and turning Max from a scrawny survivor into a Top Dog of the wastes (with an epic beard to match).

Simple and funGames based on movies usually suck. I didn‘t expect much when i first saw the trailer. But the game came out and it‘s pretty good. I love the postapocalyptic setting, i love Mad Max movies, especially the old ones. This is not a Fallout and it‘s nowhere near it. It‘s a simple, quickly made game. No one expected a good game so maybe that‘s why almost nobody got disappointed by it. The game begins when you lose your car and you need to get your car back. That‘s the story. Yeah it‘s crap, same as the latest movie. But this game is not about story. It‘s about doing repetitive tasks and it‘s kinda fun no matter how ridiculous it sounds. You drive around gathering scrap which then can be used to upgrade your skills and car. The combat mechanics are simple but fun. It‘s very similar to Batman games, you mash one button and press another one to counter attack. There are guns in the game but you rarely use them. Shotgun can be used to shoot the gas tanks to blow up the cars and also shoot bad people in the face then eat some maggots from a dead person‘s rotten stomach to replenish your lost health.There‘s also some racing which is quite fun but sometimes can be really frustrating.Resource gathering is simplified to the maximum. The gas will never end, you rarely will be out of bullets or with no health. You can replenish everything just by going to the base. Or you just find every resource on every step.Graphics are beautiful in this game. The scenery is amazing. I have never thought that desert could look so beautiful. There‘s a screenshot feature similar to Shadow of Mordor, where you can stop the game and take the screenshot. This should be available in all the games. Some people love to take screenshots and it really helps and makes screenshots look so much better.If you want a simple, maybe a bit relaxing game and you‘re not afraid of repetitiveness buy this game you will not be disappointed.ProsDriving, smashing and blowing up things is funCombat feels niceGraphicsSoundConsPoor storyVery repetitive			"

			Trent returns for his review of Mad Max! Watch to find out what he thinks! Review by: Trent Audio: Trent Editing: Valente		

The video game world is by no means short on post-apocalyptic wastelands to explore but unless a game comes out based on A Boy and His Dog comes out, none of them can claim to be based on one of the most influential pieces of Post-Apocalyptic media of the past 35 years. In this sense, Avalanche Studios’ Mad Max is an exciting licensed property in the game world and the prospect of playing another post-apocalyptic title, even amidst a market full of them, has only been sweetened by the most recent film in the Mad Max franchise: Fury Road. Given Avalanche’s mastery of creating exciting sandbox gameplay with ample opportunity for organic, play it your way hijinks, Mad Max seems poised to be this year’s Shadows of Mordor style sleeper hit.  Much like the films, Mad Max’s narrative is sparse but unlike the films, the supporting cast lacks the charisma to carry the events forward in a satisfying manner. Beginning with an overlong cutscene depicting Max’s clash with the game’s antagonist Scrotus. Their encounter ends with Scrotus suffering a major wound and Max stripped of his gear and left to wander in the desert. In typical video game fashion it’s up to Max to rebuild his car, re-acquire his gear and end Scrotus’ violent reign over the wasteland. While its narrative is certainly in the spirit of the films upon which it is based, the weak supporting cast and unfocused objective make for an underwhelming narrative experienced, especially when paired with 40 hours of gameplay. Early on, Max encounters a mechanic named Chumbucket who helps him rebuild his car and suggests the next wasteland leader to ask for assistance. Upon encountering each leader not much interaction occurs between them and Max. Their trust and tolerance is easily gained and there is very little narrative surrounding them. Each leader has a handful of side missions, referred to as wasteland missions in the game, but these amount to petty errands rather than building a plot around each character. The NPCs stand around like props exuding zero personality and failing to reflect the kind of society that each wasteland leader has built. In this sense, Mad Max takes the scenic route to its conclusion, introducing you to various people of interest but doing little to make your encounters with them seem essential to your fight against Scrotus. Amidst the endless diversions in each of the game’s regions, you soon forget why you are there and what your objective is. Aside from Chum’s crazed banter, there is little reason to pay attention.  Upon receiving your bare bones vehicle and enlisting Chum’s assistance, Max’s journey begins proper and a routine is quickly established where players enter a territory, meet its leader, destroy Scrotus’ infrastructure in the area, obtain a vehicle upgrade that permits passage to a new territory and repeat. Mad Max relies on a series of mechanics familiar to those who have played open world games over the past five years. There are enemy strongholds to topple, weather balloons to utilize for reconnaissance and fast travel, loot caches to pillage for upgrade currency, races to partake in and convoys to smash. In addition to these activities there are special parts to be on the lookout for that allow max to upgrade the stronghold of each wasteland leader he encounters. Constructing these upgrades allow Max to replenish his supplies which would otherwise have to be scavenged. The problem is each stronghold requires the same upgrades and by the midway point, hunting down components for each stronghold feels like a chore. Likewise, once the allure of taking out the strongholds that dot each of the game’s regions grows tiresome after the novelty of their sometimes intricate designs ware off. These strongholds are in particular a point of frustration since in many ways they are some of the game’s most interesting set pieces but by being populated with the same handful of gimmicks and gameplay choices they grow dull long before the credits roll. Some of these strongholds are also home to bosses, none of which come close to living up to the eccentric antagonists of the films such as Toecutter, Humongus or Imortan Joe. Instead, expect to fight muscular men in gimp masks wielding polearms ad nauseam. Further hampering the game’s mechanics is the mind numbingly dull combat lifted from the Arkham series which relies on counters and timed button presses. If you have better dexterity than a three toed sloth with rheumatoid arthritis, expect to yawn your way through the game’s uninspired enemies with barely a scratch. The combat system tries to spice things up with new abilities that Max can learn, melee weapons that break after a short period of time and finishing moves executed with shivs but due to the ubiquity of its design, combat simply doesn’t stand out. While it may seem that Mad Max is another throw away game based on a licensed property it does manage to redeem itself with engaging vehicular gameplay. Your car, The Magnum Opus, starts as nothing more than an engine on a chassis, but as you explore the wasteland you can locate new car bodies, and lower Scrotus’ influence over each region to unlock more upgrades. At first, taking control of your car is an irritation; it’s slow, handles poorly and tends to spin out easily but after a few upgrades the Magnum Opus becomes a speedy death machine allowing you to terrorize your foes. What’s more interesting is that the upgrades in each category can have a negative impact on other performance categories so having the heaviest bumper may allow you to deal major damage but it’s weight also makes the car slower. You can shove a massive engine in your ride but it’s going to negatively impact the vehicle’s handling. This makes it worthwhile to have all of the upgrades and swap between them when the situation calls for it. The visual and performance enhancing upgrades prove to be the perfect carrot on the stick to motivate players to complete some of the game’s more tedious activities. You can also unlock additional vehicles by driving captured enemy cars back to friendly strongholds or by winning races.  Ultimately, Mad Max’s gameplay falls short by not featuring any gameplay mechanics that give the game a unique identity. Most of the gameplay elements featured in Mad Max can be traced back to half a dozen other games that share the same mechanics—two of which are also published by Warner Brothers. It’s easy to run headlong into a convoy of eight cars, turn them into a scrap heap in less than a minute and reflect back on both Just Cause 2 and Fury Road… Where are the massive war rigs? Why can’t you hop aboard other cars? Shouldn’t taking out a convoy be something more than blowing up a few cars? Your interest in playing mad max will likely only last as long as your enthusiasm for driving around the wasteland in a four wheel drive rat rod leaving a trail of destruction. Mad Max is a case of competency over excellence and it doesn’t help that the open world action adventure game has usurped the third person cover based shooter as the go to game design template. This isn’t the sleeper hit it could have been but it isn’t exactly a game to ignore if you are a fan of Mad Max or open world action games.			"

												My thoughts: Beautiful landscapes/environments Very optimized, runs great Less than stellar batman-esque combat Janky controls Most upgrades to the car and Max feel useless. (Small % increases in most cases) Follows the standard open world game template/blueprint Story is short and boring Lots of repetitive side stuff to doIn the end it just feels very mediocre.			"

												I really think this game is underrated, people have no idea what they are missing.Mad Max is an open world game set in the wasteland, with only 3 companions; Chumbucket, the dog, and your beloved car, which is the main reason you're on a mission to get back what is yours, in a tale of vengeance and change.Now, people might think that a game that bases itself on driving a car in the desert is not fun, but they're so, so wrong. There are quite a few events, missions, and NPCs that you will never get bored. Let's start, shall we?The graphics, probably the best part of the game. You remember Shadow of Mordor, and how astounding the camera mode and the graphics were? Well, this is basically the same, incredibly good graphics, blood that flies, details in every face that will make your jaw be dropped, a desert that looks real, in which every step and wheel changes the terrain, and the best part of the game, the sandstorms. Holy.♥♥♥♥♥♥ they feel so real, so good, and so crazy that you will not want it to end for a while! Graphics are excellent, specially the lightning.Sounds are great, gunshots, hits with a weapon or your bare fists, people falling from a few feet, your car rumbling, it's all remarkably good.Story is... Wow. You'll keep thinking about certain parts of the game after finishing it, the least thing I want to do is spoil, let's just say that there's quite a few unexpected events that will change how you view things, and probably change your morality, too, try to think maturely.And gameplay. Mechanics are excellent, the cars feels real, don't expect a Need for Speed in which the car turns the instant you move the joystick or click a key, it needs time to rotate the wheel, it's realistic, and you'll need more than one stupid hit to destroy another car. Customization of your car is quite good, and unlocking items by completing certain stuff is not a bad system to keep you interested.The main missions are excellent, you will have fun in every single mission they throw at you, but... Secondary missions (Basically icons in the world map which you have to reach and then complete an objective, clear a camp, destroy a Pole with your car, etc)... There are way too many secondary missions, way, way too many, if you're a completionist you'll probably get sick of them, they're repetitive and don't add much to the game, they're good for the first few hours, but then the reality drops like a sack of potatoes, it has no end, it's too much time wasted. I decided to complete 15 side missions before each main mission, and I got sick of them by the end-game, decided to simply ignore them. The shotgun is great to use, though the chances of getting bullets are so low that you'll probably just shoot it around 25 times at best by the end, greatly unused.And well, that's about it, the game is really fun, and it will keep you entertained for more than a dozen hours, everything is great if you're not a completionist, and I'd give it an 8 out of 10. Excellent. "

												Everyone knows those two same formulas:A good movie will usually translate into a bad or mediocre game OR a good game will translate into a bad or mediocre movie.Luckly, this is an exception to both rules.While the game is repetitive, since basically you drive from A to B and smash people in the face and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up while on the road, the game is rather fun. The game isn't plagued by performance issues at least on my PC, even though I don't fully meet the recommended requirements but still am running it on high settings WITH a godly performance. The devs sure did their homework with optimizing.The gameplay is repetitive. If you played Far Cry 2 then you'll know what I mean when I say you'll need to drive EVERYWHERE. Luckly there are plenty of fast travel locations that can be quite easily unlocked. The combat in this game is repetitive, be it on foot or the vehicular combat. On foot it's very reminiscent of the batman games, you dodge, parry and beat the crap out of every single soul that crosses your path. But it is pretty fluid.On the road, the combat is pretty interesting. The cars handle about as well as you'd expect them to handle on sand and rock, that is to say, not so very well, but upgrading your tires helps! Basically, you get as much speed a possible to crash into the other guy and blow him up, before he does the same to you. Your car also has some interesting gimmicks such as side burners so you can get up close to the other cars and melt them, a post-apocalyptic harpoon launcher, that can also launch harpoons with the added ""oomph"" of exploding tips, a sniper rifle for taking out snipers or vehicles at long range, as well as lots of other sharp and pointy things to grind other cars to scrap, or keep people from boarding your car and beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. You can also, of course, trust your shotgun to shoot the other drivers in their face, shoot their tires out, or even blow up their gas tanks, and if needed, defend against people boarding your car.Basically you'll travel the wasteland looking for scrap so you can upgrade your car and your gear, water so you can keep yourself healthy and eventually give it to thirsty wanderers, and fuel to keep your car running. While scrounging up these things you will come across some interesting objects that say something about the old world as it began to descend into madness, usually upon inspecting these, the protagonist will deliver a one liner with his views about things. Altough the gameplay is repetitive, the map is HUGE. I'm 10 hours in and I haven't advanced much into the history, as I'm focused on clearing all the tidbits on Jeet's territories. That is to say, clearing out camps, sniper towers, minefields and their ""scarecrows"". If you are one of those hardcore 100% completiniosts, this game will probably drain you quite a few hours of your life. All in all, this is a very good game and an interesting singleplayer experience. The graphics are good, the game runs great and the post-apocalyptic vehicular carnage is about as blood as you'd expect it to be, with people getting impaled on your car as they try to board it, cars losing a tire because of a very hard crash, and running down other wastelanders as you drive somewhere to scavenge, all followed by the classic meal of maggots or can of dog food, because that's what's for dinner in the apocalypse.

												I have played around 36 hours yet and will play more as they are many things left to do.The game have awesome villians and we have to dominate all with Mad Max.Map is so big. have fun time while playing Mad Max, many things to do i.e. Escavenging, Car Shooting, Adding cars to collection, discount new locations & new routes, lower the threats, complete side missions, Complete death races etc etc..............The Combat / Fighting systems in this game are cool. While on Foot, have to defeat enemies using different skills, specially when futy mode ON thennnnnnnnnn Max Just like a killing machine, love it.While on car combat, its awesome. You can ram the cars, Convoy truck, shooting, fire Thunder Harpoon. ohhhh man, I lke it.Character customization is awesome, Max is now fully upgraded and now a killing machine.Car Customization is also cool though still to unlock best V6 & V8 Engines  and some armory updates but still ramming other cars is good.The graphics, sceneries, story are all good. Let me say that first time, I got a game which I truly liked and wanna play it until finish all activities and challenges.Must want Mad Max 2 with more fun and thrill.			"

												I am someone who really dislikes racing in videogames, so I wasn't sure if I should get Mad Max.I'm happy to say that I did get it, and it blew my expectations out of the water.The controls are really smooth, the game is beautiful and it runs flawlesly.Car combat is extremely fun and exciting, and the explosions look really nice making you want to blow up everything.The ground combat in my opinion was fun aswell, it has a batman arkham sort of combat system.This game has allot of things to collect and discover, if you dont enjoy collecting lots of things and upgrading your car/character allot, then watch out this game has allot of that.

												Pros:- Excellent Combat System, smooth.- Brutal, and Bada** finishing moves.- One of the best Optimized games to come out in awhile (1080p on High @ 60FPS with a GTX 760)- Beautiful Graphics, Beautiful World, Well designed characters.- A Large, and Vast open world to explore, along with a ton of side missions to do- The overall enviornment is amazing (Sounds, Voice acting, Atmosphere, it's all good. It really gives you that ""Post-Apocalyptic"" feel that not many games can give you)- 3 hours into the game, and the story looks promising.Cons:- So far the only problem I have with this game is the Driving. For a game to be mainly focused on driving, the controls feel a little but sluggish and slow, or delayed. It's not terrible but it will definitely take some getting used to. Oh, and there's no handbrake? wut. - Not a big deal but the mini hop you do in this game is completely useless.			"

												It is quite ironic that the critics find the game mediocre while the game gets an overwhelming positive feedback from the gaming community. If there is one thing that I could say about the game is that it is really pretty. From the setting sun, to the raging sandstorm, to the colorful explosions, the visuals of the game is really well done. You might be expecting that everything is a bland hue of brown and you are mostly correct but they did splash some color in the game and I mean bright colors too. Blues, oranges, violets, are all there. Nothing is quite a giggling inducing as beating the crap out of a bright blue wasteland baddie. The voice acting in the game is good. They actually got an authentic Australian to voice Max and not the movie type Australian like you're listening to Steve Erwin, you got a proper Australian accent going on. The game has a huge map and there are tons to do. Destroying camps, scavening scraps, pulling down scarecrows, and more. There is the feeling of being a janitor as you sweep all the icons off the map. It can be tedious if you have been at it for a couple of hours. Vehicular combat is were the game shines. It is violent, primal, and full of excitement. Your car is a veritable moving arsenal. The Magnum Opus (your car) is highly customizable. If you want a rolling fortress or a speeding bullet, you can configure it to your heart's content. The game uses the same system as Batman and Shadow of Mordor. You can counter attacks with button prompts and mash the attack button to wade in a fight. If you are used to Avalanche's fighting system, you'll be right at home here. If you are looking for something else, you'll be disappointed. It's good but nothing innovative. There were some (a lot) of people that were concerned about how well the game is optimized for PC users. Well, I'm glad to say that the game works wonderfully. Being that the game was developed in house rather than outsourcing the porting to another company ensured that the game is properly optimized though I feel that I should not have to talk about that because since when does proper optimization have to be a positive of a game? This should be the norm not an exemption. With Metal Gear being released on the same day, is Mad Max worth it? I would say yes. I bought it for $30 USD so I think I'm getting my value's worth. If you are a fan of the Mad Max universe then I say play the game. If you are new to the Australian wasteland, give it a try.  "

												I usually avoid AAA games like the plague. They often feel sterile, clunky, and have too much emphasis and effort (read: money which translates into final asking price) put into the high-end graphics.While Mad Max has its fair-share of some of these traits, its darn good and quite addicting. It is a pleasant surprise, honestly. I find myself returning to it again and again.Essentially, this is a sandbox game where you collect-and-conquer to have bigger and better stats. The upgraded stats are mainly focused on your car and your avatar. The game plays and feels like a movie - and is fairly well done in that regard. You have a companion through most of the game which reduces how lonely the world could feel. It works quite well. There is a lot to do and a lot to look at - and oh boy is it beautiful. It runs so butter, too.Pros:+Amazing atmosphere and graphics - and it runs so great. Not a hickup in performance to be found.+Very addicting, especially in shorter play sessions. Collecting scrap and gaining upgrades that really make you more powerful is so awesome. I even recently built something that collects scrap when I'm not playing. Its going AdVenture Capitalist on me, and I'm loving it.+The storyline and characters are all well done. The voice acting is top-notch, and they all fit in the atmosphere. +The companion makes the game feel much more real and alive.+Lots of random events and gangs are roaming the world, which make it further believable.+The sandbox is huge. Over 10 hours in and I haven't even visited 60% of the map.+Tons of vehicles and they all feel different.+Metric tons of unlockables.+The difficulty level is fairly easy - which, at least for me, is a breath of fresh air from tough-as-nails indie games that I usually deal with.Meh:=Some people report camera problems when fighting - I didn't find this to be the case. I did find the camera is as equally annoying as it is in any 3D AAA game.Cons:-Like many AAA games, the core mechanic is very simple. For the most part you only need like two buttons lol. Press 'A' to do most things. This is partly why most find this game best played in short play sessions.-Missions can get repetitive, which again, is why this game is best played in short play sessions. Its fine, and definately adds near infinite replayability (new missions spawn constantly), but they can start to feel meaningless over larger time.Overall, this is a great game, that is likely worth the high price tag. You can often get it on discount, which is great. There are a lot of hours to get out of this, particularly if you like large open-world sandbox games where you grind and upgrade.			"

												As of this review, I've got 51 hours into this game. I've done the story, side missions and most of the other things, but there are still some collectibled to collect, and map to explore. But this was not done in a single sitting, I got it nearly a year ago for 10$ from a key seller website. That should tell you that this game may not come off as very appealing at first.Well, first of all, the map is huge, which may be a bit scary at first, but in the end, it's a good thing.And, at first when you start, without an upgraded car, it's just not that much fun. But, if you power throguh the first few hours, and upgrade your car a bit, it'll become really fun. Almost everything you do in this game is fun, and there are a lot of things to do. Racing, capturing camps, vehicle combat, all really fun... well except clearing mines-which is just tedious and annoying-but there isn't much of that anyway. All in all, the comabt, gameplay and missions are mostly really fun, specially after you upgrade the car a bit. On the story side... it's not that good... but not too bad either. Max's motives are not really clear, and his actions aren't that well explained. The ending is also a tragedy, which might put you off a bit.The graphics and performance are great. The graphics, well, isn't as good as Witcher 3 or Rise of The Tomb Raider, but it's good. Face models for example need a bit of work. The landscape and cars look really good, however. The performance is also amazing. I can more that max out the game with a single R9 280X and a FX-8320 @ 4.5 GHz, and barely utilize 60% of the hardware, and I'm pegged at 75 FPS 99% of the time.Concluding, I will recommend this game. But the initial price of 60$ was a bit high for what it is, but as of this review, it has dropped to 20$ and has gone on sale for as low as 6.67$, which is a steal. So yes, I do recommend this game, specially if on sale.			"

												Although there was a bit of hassle with the midnight release. The game is finally out! I haven't spent to much time with the game, but enough to say that this is by far one of my favorite games this year!Pros:- Excellent Optimization (I'm getting 100-120fps with everything MAX'd out(pun intended) on a GTX 980Ti) - Great Graphics- Fluid & Meaty Combat, the punches Max throws feel so heavy and hard hitting- Story seems solid from what I've so far experienced- The open world is PACKED with things to do, you're never 20 seconds without finding some sort of camp or loot stash- Cars control perfectly- Extensive Graphics options- Outstanding Voice-Actingthere is so much more, but I won't spoil anything else!Cons:- Anti Aliasing only has an On/Off function, you can't set it to FXAA/SMAA/MSAA, not a huge problem, but would be nice to have that option.- For some reason the refresh rate option doesn't seem to save sometimes. But it's working for me now.That's all!Overall I would give this game a solid 10/10.It's probably the most optimized AAA PC title to come out so far this year, it has a well written story and enough content to keep you busy for 10's of hours!

												One of the best games out there that I've played. Even though I haven't watched the movies.The game is so good, you can do alot, from driving in a long distance (The game is amazingly big) to commiting a  suicide. ^^ The graphics are great, the animations are also great. But what I really love about this game is that there is something called ''Capture mode'', which gives you authority to stop the time and then move around the camera, change filters to your benefits. And this is a huge advantage for screenshot-lovers like me. I don't wanna spoil anything else, so if you love openworld/action/survival, you should definately get it.			"

												The best mediocre game I have ever played. Beautiful (but slightly low on interaction) world, car handling is really nice, and punching painted seminaked dudes in the face is beautifully staged. Oh, and don't even start with the fire. This game has the nicest, oiliest, smokiest, burniest explosions and fire effects in a car game yet and makes setting things on fire so much fun.So why mediocre? There is absolutely nothing you haven't seen or played before - the car combat, the brawls, the upgrading of strongholds, the slow grind to rid an area of weird negative influence by performing repetitive tasks... all of it executed perfectly well, but there is no area where the game actually tries to do something innovative.Still, 9/10 burning tires, would set on fire again.

												In many ways 2015 was the year of Mad Max. We got the excellent film Mad Max Fury Road earlier in the year closer to May, and in September we recieved Mad Max 2015 by Avalanche studios. The devs behind the Just Cause series. When I first heard about this game I hated the idea of it. I didn't really think in the era of Fallout that we really needed another derivative post apocalyptic open world game. When I heard Mel Gibson wasn't involved at all that really made me less interested in it. Then after Fury Road I relaxed to the idea of more Mad Max. And I was surprised by how much I liked this game and what it set out to accomplish. In many ways the Mad Max Film series is almost the perfect concept for an open world driving game. You have a post apocalyptic sandbox filled with hostile enemy raiders. You have a core driving experience with car combat and upgrade trees to customize your hot rod. What I was surprised by the most with this game in particular was how much detail was paid attention to. There are numerous little callbacks to the previous films, and the stylistic decisions they made with the game were spot on.The wasteland of Mad Max was perfectly nailed. Unlike the Fallout games, the world feels very handcrafted. Nothing feels copy-pasted and throwaway locations like enemy outposts all look scenic enough to take a dozen screenshots of. The game also boasts an impressive draw distance and it runs extremely well on PC. The gameplay is solid enough. With car combat being a highlight in the game. There's a very noticeable focus on scavanging. Your car requires gasoline to keep going, you require water inorder to heal yourself. You only ever find individual shells for your gun and can only carry a handful at one time. I really do feel more like a vulture picking at a corpse of a dead world than a super soldier like in most modern sandbox games. But with all that said, the game isn't for everyone. I feel alone when I say this but the things people dislike about this game, like the heavy focus on sidequests, the general minimalistic storyline and lack of gunplay are things that appealed to me about it. I actually think the laundry list Assassin's Creed formula benefits this game greatly. Your grand objective in this game isn't a pointless revenge story or a pointless revolutionary story. You spend the vast majority of this game looking for ways to upgrade your car. I like how the game focuses on that rather than a more generic storyline and mission structure.As I said the game isn't for everyone. If you're not a fan of the Mad Max films and you get turned off by a heavy focus on sidequests with a game I'd suggest looking elsewhere. I'd wager less than 10% of Mad Max is actual story content and if that sounds like a bad thing, you will probably find a lot of this game very tedious.			"

YouTube™ Video: Mad Max [Game Review] 

			Views: 345		

			My review of ""Mad Max"", the new movie-licensed open-world action game developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.		

Game: Mad MaxGenre: Third-person Open WorldDeveloper: Avalanche StudiosPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentCopy supplied by SteamMad Max is the new movie-licensed open-world action game developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.STORYIf you are a fan of the movies, the story will be right up your alley. Mad Max is driving around the wasteland, and one day he his hunted down by the evil Scrotum and his minions and his car his taken. After that he finds Chumbucket, an hunchback that sees him as the saviour who is destined to drive the Magnum Opus against the evil Scrotum. From that point, Max's begins a journey in which he helps different settlements to fight back and get revenge against Scrotum.The story isn't all that complex, and the characters are mostly one dimensional, however they are all peculiar and wacky, with Chumbucket being one of the best video game sidekicks out there, always giving you advice on what to do.Similarly to the movies, most of the Wasteland's backstory is told visually: you will see collapsed bridges, dry docks, buried cities. If you are looking for something more complex, you won't find it here.GRAPHICSFor almost every PC users, this game performs extremly well: Avalanche optimised the engine to make it work at rock solid 60fps, also thanks to the presence of the wasteland. If you are playing the game at the highest or lowest settings, the environment is beautiful. Every enemy camp you explore feels unique, every faction has different vehicles and enemies and there are enough landmarks to make you understand where you are going without always checking the mini-map.The particle effects are also amazing: the explosions are pure poetry, and the sandstorms manage to make your jaw drop the first time you encounter them. Hardly have I ever played a game about a post-apocalyptic future that looks so good.GAMEPLAYThere are two types of combat: hand-to-hand and vehicular.Hand-to-hand combat is pretty similar to the Arkham games, however it feels different: while Batman is more agile and can parry almost every attack, Max is heavier and stronger. While doing an heavy attack, you can't parry whose attacking you. You can also pick up enemy weapons, or use your shotgun for one-hit kills.Vehicular combat is where the gameplay shines the most: since the game is set in a wasteland, you will hardly ever crush into a rock or a wall. You can use a grappling hook to pull parts of the car, from the wheels to the driver himself, as well as revealing the gas tank to blow it up with a well-aimed shot. Whenever you aim, the game enters slow-motion, making things easier and less frustrating.The more you play, the more you can customize Max and the Mangum Ops: from new jackets, hairstyles, ammo belts and moves for the former, to new weapons, engines and armor for the latter. If you enjoy customization, there is a lot of it here. You can also use enemy cars to infiltrate camps without alerting anyone, adding a bit of strategy to the game.However, the open world missions can become repetitive pretty fast: you can destroy scarecrows, capture camps, explore locations for scrap, use air baloons to scout the areas and destory enemy convoys. Sometimes you will have the task to go somewhere and free some prisoners, but other than that there isn't much variety. However, the combat always keeps things interesting, especially when fighting bosses or destorying convoys.CHALLENGEThe game isn't particularly challenging: the camps feature many checkpoints and water stashes to recover health, and the car fights can be won by just pulling the driver out of the vehicle. Still, some missions are harder than others, and the bosses that you fight require more thinking than button mashing, so it all balances out.SOUNDYes, Mad Max is voiced by an Australian. And he acts very well. All the other characters are very cartoony, just like in the movies, and Chumbucket's voice actor does a great job at being funny and never annoying. However, the soundtrack is pretty mediocre, especially compared to the one in this year's Fury Road. But the sound effects make up for it: every punch you throw, every explosion you witness pack enough punch to satisfy the violent spirit inside every one of us.REPLAYABILITYAs with most open world games, you get quite a lot of content here: between completing all the missions and destorying the enemy outposts, there are many objectives that will keep you entertained for most of the game. You can also try your luck by exploring the Great Nothing, a infinitely big desert with ton of scrap to take.Overall, fans of the movie franchise and open world games will spend a lot of time playing this game thanks to its solid combat, beautiful wasteland and great performance. If you are on the fence, I recommend waiting for a sale.Story: 7.5Graphics: 9Gameplay: 8.5Challenge: 7.5Sound: 7.5Replayability: 8.5ENJOYMENT: 8.5FRUSTRATION: 5Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group "

												A true modern epic of masculinity. Mad Max is almost biblical in it's timeless retelling of one man's furious quest for vengeance. Production is top notch and the world speaks directly to the male soul. There is dust, death, regrets, blood and tears. By far the most underrated game of 2015 and one of the most enjoyable open-world gaming experiences out there. Very, very highly recommended.			"

												An open-world adventure game, full of salt, gasoline, blood, crushed metals and souls. Bitterness prevails above all of it. Still, this one is the helluva fun ride, all the way down the road.You can finish it in 10-20 hours, going straight through quests, but that would be a waste of time, from my point of view.Like I said, the game has bitter taste, and the story line will not give you satisfaction after final screen. So I beg you: play it like open-world adventure. Don't mind major quests, until you really have to. Just get yourself a decent car, and go for exploring this land. Eroded, crumbled to dust, but still striving for survival.Some time ago, I was really fond to Far Cry 2, which was baptized as horrid and bleak by the majority of players. But I found in Far Cry 2 one thing, for it can be loved: the driving part. Here in Mad Max, the same feeling of driving through wasteland, where there are no actual roads, only directions, and it goes 10 times better than in Far Cry 2!Let's settle pro and contra:+ Graphics and optimization are very good parts. All is smooth and fine with that.+ Driving is the selling point. It is one of a kind experience, I suggest everyone to get at least some of it.+ Fighting part is very similar to Batman's games, or Sleeping Dogs - strike and strong strike, parry&reposte, combo... It goes fine, for the most time. Although some moves Max showing are certainly not fit the realistic setting the game's narrative assuming. But the same can be said about the whole game: the realism is here, but steps away to make some emotions brighter. Still, after about 200-300 broken jaws, it is finally not that fun, as with Bats or Wei Shen... The Shadow of Mordor gives much more contentment, than Mad Max, at this point.+ The gameplay main features certainly looks familiar. Fighting from Batman, scrap collecting and gear tuning from Tomb Raider... you can proceed with the list, but here's the main thing: it was blended alright. Unlike Watch Dogs, Mad Max gameplay is not seems like Frankenstein style. All things there at right places, so the final expression the game gives is pure. You're getting a fresh new game out of long-known features. A good deal.- The only strong point I have against this game is amusingly overall accolade to Death. All those skulls, achievement for eating maggots nesting in the rotting corpses... All that gore is an over-act, an over-kill and exaggeration of the Apocalypse theme. I felt disgust sometimes during playtime. So I'm certainly not recommending Mad Max to kids or to sensitive persons.- The game is open-world, but it contains almost none of any sandbox experience. After you clear the given territory from the enemy presence, there are absolutely nothing to do. So you can't play this game by hundreds of hours, like Skyrim. Unless you really like driving in wastelands over all other gaming experience, of course.In sum: Mad Max is pure and solid action game. Very brutal, and quite entertaining for some time. You ride a death car, right in the middle with the real world and hell. And while your good deeds somehow fixing something around you, your hero goes deeper and deeper on the dark side. Very nice and very grim adventure in the post-apocalypse crack of world we used to know. Give it a go, but leave any hopes before entering.I mark it as 7.9/10. I like it very much, but it hurts something inside me. Let's just pray we'll never see this dream come true.			"

												TL:DR If you can handle a bit of repetition, the game is a great game.Story: Not to go into great depth, the story of Mad Max is quite interesting. Max teams up with his trusty side-kick,  Chum Bucket, a Car Enthusiast and god-tier Mechanic. Together they cause havoc across the map. With gripping combat and amazing destruction, the world comes alive driving around causing mayhem. At some points, if you don't do side-missions with the major missions, you will be forced to ""clean"" areas of occupying baddies. It can take from the story when you have to drive around finding side-missions and cleaning areas just to lower the terriorty threat-levels. Combat: The combat really comes alive while in  ""Fury Mode"". Doing WWE moves on countless numbers of baddies can never be more fun. The developers really hit the nail on the combat in this game.Driving: As you will mainly be driving in this game, the driving is quite good. The destruction is even better. One down-side, is that you can change your car on-the-fly. I mean, it leads to some amazing moments, but does take from the immserion when you can change a battle-ready car into a speed-demon in a matter of seconds without stopping. Apart from this small things in this game, the driving is amazing. Optimisation / Optimization: The PC port is amazing. Running easily on Medium/High on most settings on my R7 370 4gbs GPU. Just looking at some parts of the game... they are breath-taking. Just a head-up, sometimes the physics in the game causes some issues.Overall: The game is amazing, it looks amazing while also playing amazing. Just the odd mission requirements that require a certain terrority level. It can just take away from the game. There does come a time were repetition occurs, but if you pass that stage, the story takes over once again.[Updating for Steam Awards Nominations Committee 2016 Badge]			"

												Its good, very good this game. I know that people complain that this is a ""reskin"" of Shadows of Mordor and so on - no, its not - its a Mad Max game, its a post apocalyptic car game. Very very good one at that.-fabulous optimization and PC settings - rock steady 60 fps. And it looks very nice - nothing amazing, but immersion is great with the current visuals.-PC controls works great (M+K)-Quite detailed and immersive open world to explore as you please - the free roam is great.-destructible environment with great effects-tons of stuff to do - must have for open world game. -lots of stuff to customize and put on your car-first person view in cars - very fun.I wasnt sure if to buy this game asap - but one of my friends recommended it to me - thank you kind Sir, game is worth the full price. definitely recommended.

												It starts out interesting then quickly devolved into repetitive tasks. They could've done so much more. I was waiting for giant war rig fights but alas... they NEVER EVER come (the ending is a joke boss fight). The base-building was interesting at the beginning but then you realize that none of the people you help actually help you in the endgame save for just passively giving you scrap.There is nothing really to explore and I think the saddest part is you never get to go into great nothing and find stuff. This is one of those games that you put hours into and then regret that you did for the massive lack of payoff. Avoid.			"

												Mad Max is a post-apocalyptic, third person action-adventure set in australia.As in the movies with the same title, you are playing Max Rockatansky, a man who lost his family, roaming around the desert wastelands of australia, trying to find the ""plains of silence"".As you start the game, your car is stolen by a horde of outlaws, led by Scabrous Scrotus. You are left behind, half dead with nothing but your will of survival and your wish for revenge and the need to get your car, especially your V8 motor, back.The world is divided into several territories, each with a dedicated person which owns it throughout their outpost. In the beginning, the presence of Scabrous Scrotus lackeys is very high and you can do several things to reduce their threat by demolition scarecrows, killing snipers which are guarding the territories, destroying car convoys and destroying or freeing strongholds of enemies.Your car is your best buddy here and feels like your own fortress which, after some time and upgrades, it actually becomes.Better motorisation, better wheels, improved armor etc. Each of these does aso have an impact on your speed and handling. The better your protection, the slower you are and the harder your car is to handle.When on foot, it plays basically like every other third person brawler. Your fists are your weapon, punching your way through the enemies in combos, finishers and, if you need something stronger, your shotgun.You can also upgrade your character, skill wise (getting more loot, better health etc.) and also item wise (a better jacket with more protection, an upgrade for your shotgun etc.).Visuals are pretty amazing (watch my screenshot, watch my screenshots! :D ), the lighting is pretty good, animations are fine, details are good, the textures could sometimes be better but the details and the particle effects, especially the explosions, are superb.Overall the game is oozing post-apocalypse out of every pore. You can nearly taste and feel the dust and the dirt, the desolation and despair in this world is felt in every corner, survival of the fittest is the motto.The story itself is pretty much already told, Max is fighting his way through the wastelands, to get back his car/V8 Motor and is aided by Chumbucket, an Outcast, who will built you gladly his ""Magnum Opus"", a new car which will be better than everything else. He also thinks you are some godly/angelic entity from his dreams..or something. He is weird but fun and will sit on the back of your car, providing you with repair skills and he will also shoot explosives at other cars or use the harpoon to tear down structures in your way.I had a lot of fun with the game and would blindly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the setting or a good third person action game with a lot of driving.But it also has it's downsides, sidemission etc. do get repetitive and the wastelands aren't filled with anything else than the same objectives over and over again, but if you can live with that, i think you will have a blast with the game :)			"

												I loved this game being a fan of the film series made it an easy decision to purchase. I had a blast trying all the cars, getting all the upgrades for max and the magnum opus and exploring the whole map. I don’t think I left one piece of scrap on the map. Both fighting and driving mechanics were great and smooth. I loved exploring the wasteland and finding epic jumps and having demolition derby against Scotus's goons. The characters were great. The story was really good, but the ending wasn't what I expected at all. I’m ready for the next one. 96/100 Praise be.. The Angel of Combustion!			"

												TL;DR - Entertaining enough but doesn't justify its price tag.  Pick it up for $19.99 or less.Mad Max is a game attempt by Avalanche to leverage the legendary narrative from Kennedy-Miller with the aim of creating an action-packed open-world style game with vehicular combat and Arkham-style fisticuffs.While the game is entertaining enough - at least for a while - it gradually becomes apparent that Avalanche really don't grasp the reasons behind the design choices of other games and the importance of building complete systems rather than facades. And this is the essential problem.  Most of the wasteland's life is a simulacrum of reality where the seams are very much showing.  Now some might not regard this as problematic, however I'd argue they're missing the point.Take, for example, the convoy system.  Now taking down convoys is one of the more thrilling aspects of the game and many consider this a high point.  However standing back and taking a look at it reveals the completely shallow nature of this experience.  The convoys - the narrative tells us over and over again - are an essential component of the primary antagonist's war machine.  They take crude oil to Gastown and return with fuel for the outposts.The only problem with this is that every single convoy travels in a giant circle making no stops along the way.  The gameplay experience directly contradicts the narrative.  And worse still, the player's reward for taking out a convoy is a shiny hood ornament (which buffs the player's car in an indeterminate fashion) and the reduction of ""threat"" - a completely nebulous concept which supposedly determines the probability of your wasteland travels being disturbed by howling madmen screaming for your blood.  (Basically your convoy efforts affect a multiplier for Avalanche's random number generator.)This - and this is my primary impression of many aspects of this game - is a lost opportunity.  Gameplay is about choices and in particular, it's about allowing the player to make smart, innovative and creative choices.The convoy system COULD have been a network of convoys with real impacts upon the other systems of the game.  Convoy routes could be determined through observation and/or intelligence-gathering.  With that, the player would also need an understanding of the risks and rewards of attacking a given convoy.  Convoy A might impact fuel availability for roving war patrols in a specific area - thus reducing their ability to chase you - whereas convoy B might starve a fortress of the fuel necessary for defenses.All of a sudden, you elevate the convoy system from being a purely repetitive experience to one with strategic implications.  You enable the player to plan at a higher level and - more importantly - you make the convoy experience start to matter more in the strategic and narrative context of the game.The base system suffers from similar facile gameplay systems.  Perimeter base defenses consist of snipers, a wall of fire, thunderstick launchers and molotov launchers.  Each of these has problems.  A) Snipers DO NOT EXIST until you get within a specific range at which point they pop into being and conveniently shine a blue light allowing you to pinpoint them with minimal effort.  The color of the light changes depending on how close they are to firing upon you.  Now while sniping is a fun activity, this particular system requires minimal skill.  In the entire game, not once did a sniper ever come close to killing me.  I got hit about 5 times.  B) The wall of fire requires you to hunt for the attached tank and destroy it.  Not very challengine and adds little to the experience.  C) Molotov launchers can be taken out with sniper fire.  Thunderstick launchers cannot.  All of these elements detect the player whenever he moves within a specific radius.  Irrespective of line of sight.  Thus, while bases often have secret entrances, these entrances often require you to disable the perimeter defenses anyway and all you end up doing is bypassing the main gate.  (There are exceptions but these are few and far between).  Once inside, the player has no option for stealth and pretty much has to plow through the place with his fists while simultaneously searching for completely optional and zero-impact-upon-the-world collectibles.  (One of which is scrap, one is historical oddities and the other is antagonist insignia).  Sure, Max can always use more scrap - it IS the currency of the world, after all - but is he really going to care about insignia or postcards?  Those last two are pointless busy work - and I became thoroughly sick of it.  Essentially, the promise of an open-world environment is undermined by incredibly linear - not to mention repetitious - design.  And while I do have to give the level designers props for inventive use of 3D space - the levels are fairly well constructed - and kudos to whomever came up with the idea for the War Crier, the base clearing mechanic itself is a simplistic version of what it could have been.  The system for building projects inside strongholds initially seems cool - until you realise it's just a bunch of fetch quests which you repeat four times (once for each stronghold).  The idea is good but, once again, the implementation is facile and the repetition is lazy and unforgivable.  The minefields - oh dear God, the minefields.  This is absolutely the worst part of the game.  Not only must you hope to stumble across these (literally, there's no other way of finding them), but then you have to ditch your car for a buggy with zero offensive capability in order to defuse the mines.  Apparently the mine-detecting dog you've stumbled across is unable to detect mines unless he's in a buggy.  Or something.  The rationale for this was never made clear, but it - like all aspects of the minefield clearing - was intolerably stupid and inconceivably boring.  The scarecrows are more threat-reduction devices, present no challenge and require nothing more from the player than the ability to aim a harpoon in slow motion or crash effectively.  The balloons are good enough, but far too slow and the vague attempts to inject puzzle mechanics (by requiring the player to find fuel or navigate his way to a particular point) are trite and uninspired.  The wasteland encounters were largely a waste.  The intel encounters at least brought a little more depth to the base destruction system, but not much.  The others were optional and merely required the player to show up and say hello.  Boring, repetitious and unnecessary.  The long-term encounters (buzzard hole destruction, jumps, catapult destruction and gas valves) were standard open world fare but with a worthless payoff.  Ways to waste the player's time but with zero narrative payoff and an almost insulting player reward.  The voice-acting runs the gamut from good (Griffa and the stronghold leaders) to mediocre (Max himself) to the downright awful (every other Australian in the game).  In particular the female Australian voice-artist is dire.  She's not helped by the god-awful scripts she's been given, but she has no talent for voice-acting whatsoever and I cringed every time I heard her.  (I'm Australian, so more than familiar with our accent).  Summed up, Mad Max is a game of disparate experiences with elements of fun, but which fails to come together into a coherent and enjoyable whole.  It is primarily a catalogue of lost opportunities with the main issue being a lack of depth.  It's this lack of depth which undermines the open world experience.   Game played to completion, threat reduced to 0 in all areas.   Recommended buy for less than $20.  Ripper DLC has no impact on the game.  Score: 6/10.			"

												First off I would like to say that I am a huge fan of the Mad Max franchise, and when I first heard of this game I was thrilled. I expected a lot from the game after watching it's trailers, and I was not disappointed. Pros: Absolutely amazing vehicular combat, completely surpassing my expectations! Really fun ground combat! As a lot of you probably know the combat is very similar to the Arkham series of games, and that's definitely not a bad thing. You feel like the badass wanderer that Max has always been.Nice graphics! On max graphics the game looks beautiful, though my computer can't run it at max quality without a significant drop in framerate.Good voice actors! While some of the characters feel pretty lackluster, the majority of the characters are really brought to life by the actors.Powerful Story! I know some people might disagree with me here, as this game definitely isn't ""The Last of Us"". However, the game does a fantastic job of capturing the old story of Max regaining his humanity in the wasteland. Big (and beautiful) World! The world is big with plenty to explore, as well as tons of enemies to take down.Cons:The game can become somewhat repetitive as you grind away at clearing minefields or carrying gas can around trying to blow up every last transfer tank. However the game keeps things interesting with plenty of combat during these events so this isn't that large of a complaint. Overview:Really this is just a great game, and I highly recommend buying it whether you're a fan of the series or are just looking for a good open-world game.			"

												Just finished 100% on this game. Your gamepad skills will be tested to the MAX.Learn to master skills like:Pressing the A button for one secondPressing the A button for two secondsRapidly pressing the A buttonOnce you have mastered the above, you will learn previously unknown advanced techniques like:Smashing the Y button out of combo fearYelling at yourself for accidentally pressing the B button and wasting valuable ammoPressing the X button twice as many times as necessary to use repeated boostsOnce you have adequately destroyed the pad of your right thumb, you can sit back and feel satisfied that you have mastered the art of Mad Max combat and collection techniques. All will bow before your 1337ness.On a more serious note, this is a game that overcomes repetitive tasks with the sheer fun of playing in the environment and enjoying the atmosphere. The story won't blow you away, but the Mad Max universe stories never really did to begin with. Is it a great game? Maybe not. Is it fun? Absolutely.			"

												A perfect example of what optimisation means.  GTX670 running almost maxed out with no frame drops.  Smooth as silk.I am very early in the game but it looks great and plays great.Audio mix is spot on and the vehicle exhaust notes are awesome.I use a controller for the driving and kb and mouse for everything else.  Like everything else in this game you can interchange with zero issues.I have only one con so far and that is, there is no option in the settings to invert the mouse y axis.  You can invert the y axis for the controller not the mouse.   This is easily fixed by going in to the settings.ini file and manually change the mouse invert y to 1.  It really should be an option in the settings imo.I can see many hours spent on this game.A def purchase in sales times, if not now.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Avalanche Studios Publishers: Warner Bros Entertainment. Initial release: Sept 2015Genre: Action, Open-world, Post-Apocalyptic #Worth/NotWorth: #AlotofContentButTediousExposition, Concurrence and Summationffs Valve give me a sideways thumb optionMad Max is an open world very run of the mill game. It has all the things you've come to expect from open world madness. Think Far Cry but a brawler. Camps and oil bases take the place of outposts. The basic gameplay loop is that of drive to location, take down camp usually by blowing something up. Or some other overdone task. Grappling hook the tower down, destroy the convoy leader etc etc. Now, the game is VERY tedious. Most things that need to be blown up to complete the objective, at least early on, you will find yourself spending a lot of time looking for gas tanks or some way to cause an explosion. And that is not fun. However I will say there is something very survivalist about it. The subtle animation of placing an extra gas tank on the back of your vehicle grounds the world in some weird way. Whether you intend on using it to refill your tank or for something more dramatic.The very tired Batman/Shadow of Mordor combat is here but is feels a little unresponsive. Even after upgrading my counters I felt the game was purposefully making me miss or not allowing me to dodge the non counter-able attacks. It became much more of a chore than it was enjoyable or what I would deem a fair or fun challenge.The one thing I will say is the driving and physicality of everything from beating thugs against a wall and pulling down towers or boosting into other vehicles feels incredibly visceral. The camera shakes are nicely done. The camera lens cracks and everything has this very realistic and heavy feel to it.   THE GISTIt has all the bells and whistles of your average triple A game. Things are being collected, things are being upgraded and all the numbers are going up. Bases are gaining more and more functionality such as replenishing water, ammo and gasoline. It's just all very repeatable and it goes on and on. The story is very weird and not that interesting. It's kind of creepy to be honest. I spent most of the time playing this with a podcast or video going on the other monitor. Additionally the game runs really great. It's very well optimized.But the game is very lackluster as a gripping adventure. It's basically some relatively fun busy work and that's not a bad thing. I just would have a hard time recommending this before almost any other open world game. By itself, its fine.Follow my curation for more "

												Mad max is a blend of Red Dead, Shadow of Mordor, and GTA.  Open world games are always fun to play.  The draw distance on this game was pretty good too.  Seeing Gastown in the distance and slowly making your way to it is a cool experience.  Car modding, upgrading your character, and upgrading bases will keep you very busy in this game.  I found myself spending less time on the story and more time doing all of the side things you can do.  The story line was not overly complex, but held true to the Mad Max movies.All in all, this was a fun game that was worth the pickup.  If you liked Shadow of Mordor, this one is for you.			"

												At about 13 hours in, I've cleared an entire area of threat for a local stronghold leader, put some pretty nasty spikes on my car, learned how to use a hookshot thing to rid myself of idiots trying to chase me, upgraded the hell out of a stronghold, fought a bunch of dudes during a thunderstorm, got smacked with debris in said thunderstorm, picked up and thrown at a wall and then tossed like 100 feet up before falling onto a roof area in that thunderstorm. Pretty much, this game is awesome. "

												Mad Max is Awsome and after the Fallout series my favorit postapocalyptic game.This time i dont have a Power Armor a Casino or a Alien Blaster, no this time i have a car with V6 & V8 Engine, Nitro and cool Weapons. A beautiful Landscape, And a beautiful story in the form of Postcards which people have written before or in the apocalypse. (some are very emotional).I am now in act 3, It feels as if I would always do the same but does not lessen the fun.I want to find and collect everything, destroy the evil and help the weak, and tuning my Car :)  You want many quests ? not in Mad Max, the focus is to drive in locations find scrap metal, Car bodies, Gasoline for your Car upgrades and the Car is your Home, your Life insurance alternativ you find Postcards, Water and foodBut the higlight is the Screenshot Tool. You have many Settings for the Camera, filter, overlays, Distance and many more. Absolute great			"

												Mad Max is an open world, third person action game.The player steps in the role of Max and has to progress through the wasteland to seek revenge on a gang of raiders, led by Scrotus, who robbed him of his possessions. Max gets help from Chumbucket, a blackfinger (a mechanic) and together they aim to build the ultimate battle car: the Magnum Opus.While not doing the main quests you can explore areas on foot, discovering collectibles and scrap metal. You will need alot of the scrap to pay for upgrades which are more or less necessary over time.Also you can clear areas from Scrotus influence by destroying Scarecrows, disarming minefields and by taking over enemy camps. Unfortunately, you have to repeat those things over and over again if you want to clear all areas.It takes approximately something between 30 and 40 hours to finish the main story, for finishing all which has the game to offer it takes something around up to 60 hours.If you are an achievement hunter, and want to achieve 100% it will become pretty repetitive during the grinding process you have to go through.Overall, Mad Max is a good game besides of the repetitive aspect, also it is not necessary to know the movies before playing this game.Sounds 9/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Beating people up is incredibly satisfying.Blowing things up is incredibly satisfying.Upgrading Max and the car makes a visible difference to both driving and combat.Pretty much all missions affect the overall game, whatever side mission you choose to do, it will end up helping you in the long run so the incentive to play the entire game is clear and fun.You can't filter out the icons on the map.A lot of upgrades are limited to story missions.Hallways and caves can get confusing and you can easily get lost in the maze.In combat, enemies attack one by one which makes things relatively easy and they run after you one by one so you can easily spread them out and kill one by one.Farcry meets Shadow of Mordor meets Batman meets Rage.8/10 would dodge rocks all day

												Mean Max: Bloody RoadGreat game, Very nice and enjoyable gameplay combine together with awesome and beautiful environments, it is like the paradise to take screenshots and make you feel like the European group who travel to Grand Canyon, or American first time in Sahara. It very beautiful and amazing while you also enjoy riding your car around the world of madness. Fast travel in this game is like the less important thing to be use, drove for a miles just to pick up some goods, It more enjoyable than to use the fast travel.Also detail are one of the thing that make this game to be great, you can actually lost in desert here and everywhere you go it really different to another place that you just visited, fire from expolsive add on this too, it look so real that I don't take Max to walk close to it, even the cave that only had the one way in and out, would take you around 3 minute to get you out from there. Very impressing in overall :)About story and gameplay, it short but good for story, Max are more like ""Mean"" person than the ""Mad"" person, or just think about Batman with Gun and Shiv, that totally Max :P  But hey, it make sense and can make you hate the bad guy, so that very good for it. Gameplay, there are a lot of things to do here and many types of enemies with the unpredictable weather that can make you always focus on the game and make you stay with the game more than 10 hr. long, so yeah it very enjoyable for me :) However, there still had some bugs, like Enemies just disappear in front of you, or sometimes you get hit by your car that came out of nowhere, or fall off while you fight your enemies in the very high place, but all of these never make the game to be unplayable, it more like to make you laugh, so it no problem for me when I met these.I never write long review if I not really like it, this game I must say that it more than what I guess to be, no doubt why Mad max: fury road got one of the best movies in 2015, this game should be on one of the best games in 2015 too. It just unexpected with the great outcome.			"

												Mad Max:~~~~~~~~  In a post-apocalyptic world when sand dunes have replaced pretty much everything, this world is brutal and vast! Only a skilled and fearless warrior with a knack for driving can survive this ordeal. His name is Max, Mad Max!You will be playing Mad Max (no kidding), a tough guy on a mission to rebuild a new and slightly modified motor vehicle called the “Magnum Opus!” You will be assisted by ""Chumbucket"", a brilliant but strange mechanic who wears an unusual jewellery piece, a spark plug necklace!This game really reminds me of a mixture of a few games:  Shadow of Mordor for how the map is laid out, and instead of climbing towers to view an area, you take a trip on a small hot air balloon to pin point locations on the map; and the Batman series for the combat system. Great story line with well-designed missions but if you are like me you will go through the entire area to pick up collectibles, scrap metal and project parts, or you could even go racing - MARVELLOUS!!Make sure to collect all the scraps you can find so you will be able to add on features to your “Magnum Opus” but also equip your favourite warrior with well needed upgrades. Upon achieving missions and challenges, you will be rewarded with tokens which you can use by having a friendly one-on-one chat with Griffa. He will use his magic to put you to sleep and then you will be able to increase Mad Max abilities.In some locations, you will find project parts. These parts can be used to upgrade strongholds so when you stop there, it will regenerate your health, fuel and ammunitions.Let’s be  honest, Mad Max is absolutely magic in regards to graphics and the game runs beautifully well. Great voice over, the controls are smooth and easy to master. Just a stunner of a game!Positives:~~~~~~~  -	Big open world and lots to do-	Splendid graphics-	Great voice over-	Plenty of upgrades-	Achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Are you for real?Probably one of the best games I have played this year! What are you waiting for? Just get it!10/10MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

												I like Mad Max. About 12 hours in I got a solid feel of the overall game. The important thing to know about Mad Max is that it's fun. And that's the whole point. It is far from perfect, lacks in many departements but it also has a lot of positives which make it a good enjoyable game.The over the top action makes you want to play a little bit more all the time. Completists will have their hands full.The game focuses a lot on driving and does it well, there are so many upgrades for your vehicles, and so many of them.The on-foot action is also good, fighting is a little simple (like batman) but its fun nevertheless. I do wish there was more weapons and customizations for them. It is very thin in that department, and you barely find any ammo in the game so you practically never use your shotgun. The acting is good but the story is week. You don't feel like you're switching gears between the main story and side missions, they both feel the same, so you don't get that change of pace that breaks the monotony of tasks.The game feels a little sand boxy but that doesn't take away form the fun of playing it.The worst issue of the game is the character animation and movement. It's horribly done. The jumping in particular is the worst I've seen in any game the last 10 years, super clumsy. And the falling animation feels like you're a floating leaf. They really needed to work on that departement to make max feel heavier, with the ability to jump and grab etc. All of which aren't there and hurt the gameplay.The Positives:-Great Atmosphere overall. Enviroments are spot on and so is music.-Fun gameplay, fighting, driving and effects are satisfying.-Tons of upgrades and mods.-Lots of things to do.-Pretty good acting.The Negatives:-Weekish Story. Even main mission feels like a side mission.-A Little repetitive at times.-Abysmal character movement for a current gen game. Jumping in particular is terrible.Still, you will get a good 60-70hr atmospheric fun and thrilling gameplay out of this game. I'm enjoying it to the Max :)			"

												You get to play Max. What more could you want?In all seriousness I've just been let out into the first free roam ish area and I have to say. I'm really enjoying it. The hand to hand system seems a little lacking but the car combat is pretty cool. And the characters I've met so far are pretty awesome. Was it worth the price? I'd say yes. It does suffer from the usual sandbox issue (as far I've seen) of the main missions being in a bubble when compared to the freeroam but meh.I'm enjoying Max Max. I  hope to enjoy it for much longer.			"

												Mad Max is a third-person action game made by Avalanche Studios and published by Warner Bros. Although WB are getting a lot of hate for abandoning Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X on PC, this game is not the case! Avalanche Studios optimalised the game for PC perfectly! What surprises you for the first time immediately, is the game world. It's not as big as in Just Cause games, but that doesn't matter, it's still huge. You'll be able to explore through the wastelands, see all 50 shades of sand, kill many mad warriors meanwhile and collect tons of scrap.Scrap is the resource (or the currency) that is used in Mad Max for everything - you upgrade your weapons, your car or even Max's clothes with scrap. And there's plenty of upgrades for everything, so if you don't plan to get 100% achievements, you won't even unlock every upgrade the game offers. But the scrap isn't the only thing you need for unlocking the upgrades, most of advanced ones also require completing a specific mission or a simple task, like: Lower the antagonist's (Scabrous Scrotus) influence in area by taking over his camps or destroying his scarecrows (pylons that should let people around know who rules in the wasteland).While you can have about 5 basic car constructions (upgradable in any way you want) there are many more vehicles in the game, and you can control all of those! You'll find use for them in racing (death runs) that offers few types of races.The combat is similar to Batman Arkham series, with many similar animations (punching, kicking and jumping groups of enemies) and practically same controls. You mash the left button for attack and when anyone in the enemy group attacks you, you have to parry the attack with right button. With exception for knife attacks and finishing moves, that's all. Anyway, it's not any significantly hard and it's fun.What's also a great pro of the game is the attention for details that aren't mentioned much when people talk around the game. There's a specific weather (random) event that'll make you impressed, but I don't want to spoil the details. Through the world you'll explore, you'll be finding photos of the old world (before the sandpocalypse), usually with something written on the back side. Those lead you (and the Max) to thinking about what in the game world is already lost.The story is not bad for a game based primarly around combat, racing and exploring, it even tries to play with your emotions. But it'll most probably fail, because Max is stonehearted, so you'll get over all bad events like it was nothing. There's few really interesting characters that have interesting backstory, but there's also characters that you meet without any proper explanation of sympathies.I think that every player will be really excited to explore everything in the beginning, every small camp with scrap. But that doesn't last forever and most players will later find the ""breaking point"" where they found exploring being too much repetitive, leading to sticking just with the main story missions (they'll require you to do some regular exploring few times anyway).The content recycling in the game (repeating enemies, camps etc.) is made delicately, with exception for one thing that ended up pretty bad - the bossfight(s). There are many bossfights in the game (especially for the side exploring - beating the Top Dogs) but they all are the same, the bosses even still use the same weapon! Only thing that changes is the arena where they fight and number of other NPCs that spawn around to help the boss.The world of Mad Max has a day/night cycle, which is great but feels half-baked with the fact that you can't rest until specific part of the day comes. As there are few missions that requires to do them at night, you might end up having to do something else for about 90 minutes, while waiting for night.In the end, I was really entertained for more than 20 hours thanks to Mad Max. As a current AAA game I got enough satisfaction out of it and even though I have not found motivation to complete everything that's not mandatory in the game, I still think it's a great game and definitely deserves my recommendation.

												I tend to only write reviews if the game pisses me off to no end... Or if the game meets almost every expectation i had.Mad Max is definitely the latter.Pros:Brilliantly made portWonderful Performance (I have a little better than a mid tier computer and and able to run the game on the highest settings and havent yet dropped below 45 frames)Beautiful to look at (this is the only game where the cutscenes do the game no justice)Driving is fun and feels well developedMotor sounds (they sound loud af just like in the movies) <3Enviornment (everything is made with the steam-punk vibe that the game should have. There aren't quest items that look brand new)Sounds (from the wind to the guns to the engine its great)Item rarity (food and water, which replenish health faster, are very hard to find. Gas is also a moderately rare commodityCons:The sand storm sound is like earrape and you can't choose to only lower that sound.No difficulty levels (combat is easy most of the time)Nitro feels almost useless when you first get itNo stealth (A stealth option would have been fun. I would rather not run head on into 10 guys in a camp)Accidental cutscene skipping (when a cutscene is triggered the game says press ""E"" to skip... That's a lie... if you click anything at all it skips the cutscene. Because of this I've missed a few cutscenes D:)Overall the Pros outweigh the cons quite a bit! I would definitely recommend this game :D			"

												First 5 hours: 8.5/1015-20 hours in: 8/10+30 hours: 7/10Overall a very enjoyable game. Beautiful and fun, but once you've played for a while the game gets repetitive. A good example are the ""Top Dog"" camps throughout the wasteland, where you'll end up in a boss fight with the ""Top Dog"", the leader of the camp, which unfortunately looks and acts the exact same way as the rest of the ""Top Dogs"" you'll encounter.Main story is OK, although nothing special and pretty predictable.My suggestion? Do some side missions, explore as much as you want, finish the main story, and when you feel like you've seen all there is to see you can be happy with the game and stop playing it. I should've probably stopped after 20 or so hours just to not get tired of the repetitiveness, but here I am with +50 hours played.			"

												By no means perfect, but a solid and entertaining game. 7 ~ 8 / 10 from me. Pros -1. Car combat is addictive and excellently implemented. A great many types of vehicles are in the game, and a great many tactical options to fight them. No other game has handled car-combat with such finesse.2. The game is a must buy for Mad Max fans. The atmostphere is very faithful to the movies.3. Customizing and upgrading your vehicle ""Magnum Opus"" is a lot of fun. There many options, most of them are meaningful and open up new ways to play.4. Production values are superb. Audio, visuals, the design and voice casting of enemies and in-game characters, all beautifully done, bring the wastelands to ""life"", as much as can be possible.5. Combat is reminiscent of Shadow of Mordor, with a bit of gun combat mixed in.6. The wastland is pretty massive. Quite a lot of things to do in the game - car combat, capturing strongholds, improving allied bases, boss fights, even car races. A lot more than many famous open-world games.Cons1. Some of the missions and tasks can be a bit of a chore (eg Mine clearing).2. Melee combat can become monotonous by the end, especially in contrast to vehicular combat. Car combat remains so much more entertaining that I sometimes avoid getting out of the car whenever possible.3. I wish there were more settlements and characters in the game (but given the wasteland setting, I doubt there is much the devs could have done).Overall. a definite buy at anything more than a 25% discount. One of the better movie adaptations ever produced.			"

There are heaps of things to collect to 100% if you are one of those people that must collect everything. On launch day i was surprised the game ran soooo good (developers that know what they are doing) unlike alot of games releases lately, the waste land is pretty large with lots of places to drive to, the story isnt to bad, car combat is pretty cool and ground combat is the usuall WB combat system.VCG: 10/10 Will shank you in the face.

												Pro's:-Runs Smooth, well optimized, looks great, and didnt encounter any errors-Good Story-40+ hours of gameplay if you are a completionist-Car customisationCon's:-Main story feels relatively short -Very repetitive side missions and bosses-There is not much ""Survival"" to this game. Lots of food and water around.-Melee and car combat can get a little boring at timesI think the game could have been even better with a co-op feature were a friend could be in the back of the car instead of Chumbucket. Also needed to hear them shout ""Witness me"" more.			"

												Mad Max is a game I'd highly recommend. It does so much more than most games and is obviously lovingly crafted. From a story perspective it's there and it's in perfect quantity. You can rush through the story if you want and have a nice compact experience, or you could play for 15 hours after you get done with the intro not touching the story at all and just focus on clearing camps, taking out snipers, taking down scarecrows, clearing minefields, searching for scrap, taking out a convoy, or upgrading a fortress to its completion before you decide to take on another mission. The ending while I can imagine it being divisive is my favorite since Red Dead Redemption. I won't spoil it for you but I will advise you giving it some time to sit with you and reflect on how fitting it is.Touching a bit more on those optional objectives. I've heard complaints about the grindy aspect of it, and I will admit that if you don't enjoy a grind it may be a bit tedious for you. I am the kind of gamer though that enjoys a nice solid grind with a reward at the end. When I completely lowered the threat down in someone's territory I felt accomplished, I had a much faster and more dangerous vehicle, and my Max had gotten much better as well.Visually the game is gorgeous. To me the beauty of the Mad Max movies (particularly The Road Warrior and Fury Road) is the contrast between the deep blue sky and the browns/oranges of the desert wasteland and this game pulls it off perfectly. The visuals are also somewhat varied with white sea beds, tan dunes, orange earthy deserts, black tarry oil pumps, and black/gray dumps. Color isn't muted either and when you see a brighter color from a flare or an enemy covered in paint it's a very pretty sight.The sound is very top notch. The bass of the shotgun or the roar of your engine (especially when you get a V8) is very deep and a pleasure to listen to. The higher sounds like the scraping of your vehicle against another or the screech of your tires also comes off as real and fantastic.Your gameplay is going to be split into driving and on foot brawling. The driving is a lot of fun and is quite the spectacle. Taking out a convoy is a blast as you grapple off tires, shoot explosive harpoons, or use your shotgun while driving to blow up an enemy's gas tank. Driving feels fast and fluid and is a lot of fun on its own, the combat is great and is the perfect icing on top. When you're on your feet brawling around a camp it's very gritty dirty and fun fighting that's a blast. You'll be body slamming, drop kicking, and gut punching enemies into submission, and you can even dirty it up with a shotgun to the stomach, taking an enemy melee weapon and quickly disposing of a group, or a shiv to the throat when an enemy lets their guard drop. Brawling mostly consists of parries, hits, and dodges with an indicator above enemy heads to signal what they are about to do, if you're familiar with the Arkham series or Shadow of Mordor you'll feel comfortable quickly.Mad Max is a game that deserves a lot more recognition for the amount of fun fullfilling content it provides. It had a very unfortunate release date but if you ever get a chance it's definitely a fun game that dips its toes into a lot of genres whilst also making them fun and unique to fit its tone. If putting on some music and driving and fighting around a wasteland on a quest for a better car and better gear sounds like fun to you it's a definite must buy.			"

												8/10 FOR THIS EPIC GAME.During the first 2-3 hrs of this game, I felt like game is boring and repetitive. But later when the game goes on it become so interesting that one can keep playing until the game ends. Took me around 20hrs to beat this game. Very emotional and awesome ending. Pros:-Great storyline that will drive you into the game. Plot twists, awesome moments, emotional moments etc everything is in this game. One of the best I have ever played.-Amazing combat as expected from WB. Finishing moves, execution, punches, melee weapon etc are really great.-Graphics are awesome. Sometimes I felt like stop the car and enjoy the desert view. That sand storm is also great and realistic.-Gameplay is superb. One simply cannot expect better than this.-Optimization is 10/10. Played the whole game at Constant 60 FPS.-Side missions (Wasteland missions) are also fun to play. -Game characters are freaking awesome. Bosses, enemies, friends, leaders etc all the characters are made differently which is so enjoyable in game. Cons:-We can't even jump properly. i.e we can't jump on very low heighted rocks.-Handling is poor but not that poor coz once we get used to it, we'll enjoy the driving.-Clearing all threats in all region is freaking boring. -Keep doing main missions or else you'll get bored.I got this game at 50% off. The reason I played this game is because of its movie. Movie really made me the fan of Mad Max so I bought the game. And really worth spending money on this. In the end I'm really happy and satisfied with this game.Will recommend to all of my friends.			"

												In an effort to make this game look like it has 80x more content than it actually does, like so many modern games of this type, they've copy pasted pratically the same activity all over the map. If you enjoy doing the same 4 things over and over endlessly, then this is the game for you. I bought because I was a fan of the Mad Max movies when I was a kid. This game is probably only worth about $10.			"

Spoiler Review for the CompletionistAbout 50 hours into the game, while I was grinding achievements in a hypnosis-like haze the game had induced on me, I slowly realized the kind of man Mad Max is.Mad Max is the story of a psychologically unstable man who forces his own view of justice and order on a disturbed yet otherwise functioning post-apocalyptic society.Shortly after being ambushed by the warlord Scrotus the Immortan Jr., ""the crazy eyed road warrior"" Max, hellbent on revenge, goes completely out of his way: he topples down every single stronghold that probably without option declared allegiance to the tyrant Scrotus, he pillages every single isolated and obscure domicile where starving scavengers survive and get hostile only if anyone trespasses their territory and he creepily collect their private photos and diary entries, reading and cataloging every single one of them for god knows what reason. By the end of his rage induced rampage that he ironically performs in a chillingly and psychotically restrained composure, Max opts to kill a disabled and mentally handicapped man, Chumbucket, whose messianic delusions were ultimately exploited by Max to make him build his war-rig. As Chumbucket continually upgrades his life’s greatest work, appropriately named the Magnum Opus and have creepily ecstatic moments of joy as “his saint” Max drives it, he grows an unhealthy affection for him, most likely as a result of Stockholm Syndrome. The social bond that keeps the narcissistic-codependent duo together is Chumbucket’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic joy of having Max drive his car and Max perpetually feeding on Chumbucket’s unhealthy obsession.Perhaps falling victim to his ever building, self-mutilating, caustic hatred, Max suffers from a psychological breakdown. He becomes the sole prisoner of his rotten psyche and gets trapped in his own subconscious; his personal limbo. At the very end of his saga, every significant person that were unfortunate enough to cross paths with Max inexplicably come back to life in this timeless mental Wasteland, perhaps as a manifestation of his guilt.And Max spends his days here until eternity, where he was supposed to leave as soon as possible, surrounded by the unforgiving ""Big Nothing"" - the borders of his own subconscious, driving in his combustible, fire spitting mount restlessly, Chumbucket whispering praise in the wind behind him, with his inner demons only seeping out during fleeting moments as the red in his eyes.10/10 I’ve never been into cars, now I'm dreaming of building one.

												Wow - 75 hours I ended up playing this game for!!!  I certainly did not expect that after reading all the reviews here.  I'm somebody who really likes the Assasin's Creed style of repetative gameplay in an open world.  After a hard day at work it's fun to just kick back and knock out another 10 or 20 different tasks as you take over different parts of the map and increase your stats.  Just before this game I soloed The Division and both games scratch that same itch for me that these open world games have.Sure there was a couple clunker tasks that I did once and hated and never did them again, like using the dog to find mines, and all the car races. (And the one race you are forced to do as part of the storyline was almost a rage inducing instant quit moment.  Luckily I finally got it and kept playing until the end - a tip is to downgrade your suspension and armor)But I really loved the environment they had you explore and work in, very cool!  I also thought the totally bummer ending fit in perfectly with the spirit of the movies, well at least the original ones.Technically it looked and sounded fantastic.  Never had a crash or problem running under Windows 10.To help put my review in perspective, I tried to play Shadows of Mordor right before this and did not like it at all.  After 7 hours I gave up on that game because the tasks and fighting were just not interesting to me.  THIS game that seems to always get compared to SOM was so much better to me.			"

												I'll try and keep it as much straight to the point as possible. First off it's not tied directly to the films as such, you are not Tom Hardy's Max and you are not Mel Gibson's Max so think of the game maybe seperate from the films, it is it's own thing here. Best part so far, it works! It's not broken, there are no game breaking bugs. In 10 hours of game play I have had zero crashes or glitches. On top of that I'm about to do all this fully optimized with a 980 GTX. However do remember this will make your GPU work, so you may want something like msi afterburner to get those fans going faster to keep it cool. The first time around my card jump from 30c to 60c and that's without water cooling. I do have the water block for it I've just been too lazy to put it in.So what's the game like? The best way to think about it is, take concepts from Far Cry , Assassins Creed, Borderlands Humour and a Batman Arkham style combat system then this is what you get. And I've gotta say so far it's a success. Is it perfect? Of course it isn't, some would argue any game is perfect. For one I personally feel my controls are restricted for an open world, I want to be able to walk and run. I also want to be able to jump over and around things like you can in Assasins Creed and the Witcher but at times you can't jump over simple obsticles because you wern't meant to. But still, it's pretty minor and by no means a reason to give it a negative review.I say Far Cry and Assasins Creed because in this open world instead of using radio watch towers and high pirches you have hot air balloons that go up and you use binoculars to scower the area yourself. If you rush it, you could miss unlocking something on the map. And Batman style combat, well because that's what it is. Fun, quick and easy to learn and really awesome to look at especially with finishers and other moves you can pick up as you upgrade Max along the way.Ammo is scarce as it should be, it's a post apocolyptic world and there isn't exactly gun factories about so you have to concerve your ammo and use it wisely. If you take your time in the game and go to all the scavaging areas on the map then you'll come across plenty of ammo, and as long as you're not a♥♥♥♥♥♥it won't be a serious issue. You can upgrade certain perks by finding this myterious traveller following you about (looks familiar to!) who gives you upgrades and you can increase the amount of ammo you find amongst other things.One nice touch here is the levellng system. Think of Max as having a bunch of ranks. You start off at the bottom and you level lets say 10 times by completing various tasks and goals such as killing x amount of bad guys this way or that way, or running so many people over. As you rank up you get to unlock more and more powerful upgrades. Naturally the final rank is ""Road Warrior"".The actual map is interesting, it's done in such a way where it would be really easy to knock out expansions and make additions, it could never end if they didn't want it to. Also it is quite large, after a few hours in the game you'll quickly realise there's a lot of things to do.You get to upgrade your car, you can change Max's appearence a little. There's also sections with bios for all the charactors you mean and all the badguys and vehicles you can collect and use (there appears to be quite a few).At the moment I'm finding the game fairly easy, I wasn't presented with a difficulty mode and considering I've completed the Far Cry, Assasin's Creed (well Black Flag, Rogue) and the Batman series i've found this pretty easy to get the hang of and quickly learnt what was what. Whether I'll unlock a harder mode when I complete it remains to be seen.All in all, yes. Right now I'd say the game is worth the money (just). Let's hope we get some decent DLC for this to keep it alive for a number of years at least as it has potential to do so.			"

												Mad Max is a open world, action, post-apocalyptic, survival type game. Mad Max is a third person, action game set in an open world enviroment, based on the Mad Max film series. It was released on September 1st 2015 on PC, PS4 and XBOX One. You can explore plenty of deserts, canyons, wreckage, tunnels, hills. In the story, Max's car was stolen in wasteland by Scrotus. Then Scrotus beaten and threw him into Chumbucket's region. After few minutes Max wakes up and found Chumbucket. Then Chumbucket helps Max to build a war machine for Wasteland War. After all this, journey begins.Mad Max featured with massive open world map. We can do several things in Wasteland. Like terminating Snipers, Camps, Stop Dogs, Scarecrows. Even we can play Death Run races. Like Time Bomb and Finish The Line. We can earn cars by winning Death Run races as reward. There are many types of cars available for our collection.We can make better and proper progress if we play this game accordingly. There are quiet numbers of Side missions. We can earn great numbers of scraps for upgrading Magnum Opus, Max, Chumbucket, Weapons.If you wants to upgrade everything then you have to increase your legend rank.  Making progress of legend rank will unlock new upgrades for Max. Terminating Camps, Convoys, Minefields, Snipers, Scarecrows will reduce threat meter to 0 from 5. This will also unlock new upgrades for Magnum Opus.Pros :::1. Realistic Graphics Quality.2. There are few things to do in Wasteland.3. Plenty of Side missions.4. The fuel system and filling my cane with water is really amazing way for better focus in this game.5. This game featured with massive open world map.6. Highly Optimized Game. I am really impressed with it's optimization.7. Story feels really epic and emotional.8. Really a great style of combat with Fury Killing Ability.9. Driving Magnum Opus feels really comfortable.10. We can upgrade Max, Magnum Opus, Chumbucket, Strongholds.You can rebuild strongholds by Project Parts. You have to collect Project Parts after tracking them on your map. Like if you build Scrap Crew then this Crew will collect scraps from all over the Wasteland while your game is off. But you must need Internet Connection for collecting those scraps from Crew.You can play this game better if you upgrade your harpoon to level 6 which is max level of harpoon weapon. Also try to upgrade Max's Knucles and Jacket for his better defence.There are many types of enemy out there with upgraded in highly power. So you need best defence for Max that he can fight longer and defeat them.This game is highly optimized. You can play this game smoothly with low mode settings in your low config. If you got Intel Core i5 with 8GB RAM and 2GB GDDR5 then you can explore Wasteland in Ultra High Settings.Let me tell you that i am the 1st finisher of this game in Bangladesh. I got a best name for this game. Name's The Rising Legend. I found a best game after many years later. Like Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed Revelations, Life is Strange, Tomb Raider, Metro Last Light, Deus-Ex Human Revolution. Really it's a amazing game with epic and emotional ending. The ending of this game made me so much weak. The price of this game worth it highly. So that's what i want to say about this game.			"

												I will keep this short and sweet:Pros: Good gameplay, good content, open world, and can result in some pretty crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Melee combat is very satisfying, on the same level as the Batman Arkham series. Also there is a Capture Mode that lets you use the camera as an independent entity - the photo mode can be operated by one person, while the video mode requires the camera to be operated by another controller (by extension, another person). Oh, and flawless graphics optimization. My i7 3770k with a Radeon HD 7970 can run this sucker at maximum graphics with absolutely zero hitches.


Happy Birthday to your JAW!

Cons: No ""New Game Plus"" feature, can't carry over your earned upgrades to a new game (without story mode), any enemy content you clear is not repeatable. Basically, you can't keep repeating the stuff you love to do, and end up getting stuck with a dwindling pool of content to chew on as you build up the Magnum Opus.As of this writing, I've cleared just about all strongholds, all scarecrows, and all convoys. All I have left to do now is... *shudder*...the minefields. Such annoying, worthless gameplay that serves little more than to drive you insane with Dinky Di's incessant baying.Avalanche, a few more months of work on this game - and maybe a little bit of prudent forethought - would have resulted in a much more solid product.I would recommend this game to anyone who has no problem with a one-and-done execution on game design philosophy, as opposed to the heavily replayable content seen in many other open-world games.UPDATE, EXTENDED REVIEW EDITION: Just completed all ""hostile"" content (convoys, minefields, etc) and all Wasteland missions, got all territories to Threat Level 0. After just 32 hours of game time. What follows is my final impression of the game.The game is an excellent foundational game, but lacks the long term stamina to make this a game for people to keep coming back to even after they've beaten it. When you first step into the World of Mad Max, it feels very authentic, and the gameplay is top notch.


The Classic Hit-and-Run.

However, after you get through the majority of the content, it's as if the air has been let out of its tires. You don't encounter enemies as often, and you don't get to have a lot of fights unless you decide to go scavenging a lot (which is pointless after you've completed all the Stronghold Projects). Enemy encounters on the road, after all the convoys have been defeated, amount to just random roving war bands and the occasional parked WarBoy vehicle by the roadside.If Avalanche had implemented a type of New Game Plus feature that would allow the game's world map to regularly repopulate captured bases and defeated convoys with respawned enemy encounters, then the game wouldn't feel as empty at the end.In the current game design of Mad Max, as I've said before, Avalanche seems to have unintentionally turned the game into a ""One-And-Done"" game experience, rather than focusing their design philosophy on repeatable game content to ensure high replay value.Why do you think games like Grand Theft Auto 5 is popular? Because it's got plenty of content for you to chew on, and it's repeatable. Mad Max lacks this entirely.


Close Encounters of the Boombug Variety

In the end, Mad Max is a game with a great introduction for new players, and a fun amount of content, but it quickly becomes a very painfully average game that offers no reason for you to bother coming back once you've beaten the content. It's also very short for a $60 game, considering that I've beaten the vast majority of its content in just 31 hours. This game in its current state is NOT worth $60. I would peg it at $30.Even after all its shortcomings, if you're out for an authentic Mad Max experience, this game is recommended. Just wait for a Steam Sale that slashes it by 50%.However, if you are looking for a game that will continue to entertain you long after you've beaten all the content in it, you are going to be sorely disappointed, and I would recommend that you look for a different game.P.S. For those wondering: The War Rigs from Fury Road only make an appearance in this game in the form of a junked ride inside a tunnel. There are no actual driveable War Rigs.P.P.S. Let's be honest, if you are on a monthly gaming budget, and plan on spending $60 on a game, spend it on Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It did release at around the same time as Mad Max, the difference is that MGSV has much better entertainment value for your money.			"

												Mad Max is a really fun open world experience.


YouTube™ Video: Mad Max - 60fps Gameplay & Review - A Sheepish Look At

			Genna plays Mad Max. An open world, post-apocalyptic game with a heavy focus on vehicle and melee combat. Click here to Subscribe ► http://bit.ly/mrwssub...		

I'll start off by talking about the world itself. It's beautifully designed. Sure the environment is just an open and empty desert for the most part, but they really crafted some interesting scenery. Cool canyon formations, rubbel from the old world like destroyed ships, or wrecked buildings. The game's graphics look beautiful, and can actually be cranked up quite a bit considering the game is fantastically optimized.There are tons of different objectives to complete while out in the wasteland, all decently unique to keep the game from getting stale. Sometimes you can compete in a race, or scavenge some ruins for scrap metal, or infiltrate a base. Something quite interesting about the bases, is you occasionally have the option to get some intel from a nearby wastelander surveying the location. It's not necessary, but they might give you some useful tips such as a hidden entrance, or the Base leader's weakness.You use scrap metal for upgrading Max and your vehicle, and you gain it by doing basically everything. You can find it scattered in buildings, or pick it from the wreckage of a destroyed vehicle, or dropped from a defeated enemy.Something I love about the game is there's quite a bit of choice when it comes to a few things. Apart from allowing you to choose how to infiltrate a base. For example, gas cans can be used to refill cars, or lit on fire and thrown to blow up doors. The world is very dynamic. There's a full day and night cycle, and occasionally tornadoes will form. They're not very dangerous, but still freaky. Sometimes gigantic dust storms will sweep the land. You have the choice of either getting to shelter to stay safe, or drive right into the storm and attempt to survive flying debris, lightning hitting the ground in order to grab some valuable scrap metal boxes flying through. I love that the game allows you to risk it for the biscuit like that.Now to get to the focus of the game, vehicles. You can upgrade yours a very large amount. You can choose between car body shapes, colours, decals, engine types, spikes to stop boarders, rams and so on. It's very satisfying to see your car turn into a badass killing machine. Apart from ramming into your enemies, you can also use your arsenal of weapons. Either shooting the tires, or exposed fuel barrels with your shotgun. You may harpoon doors off a car, and then pull the driver out, or shoot a stream of flames.The combat when you're on foot is very similar to the Batman Arkham games. although it has a few stuff to keep it unique in its own ways. The better you time your counters, the more bone-breaking opportunities you have. In melee combat you can still use your shotgun or finite knives to quickly dispatch an enemy. As you fight you fill up your fury meter, which basically just makes you stronger and gives you more chances to instantly finish off an enemy with stronger attacks. It's some very satisfying fighting.Overall, I've had so much fun with the game, and even after the main story I've continued to 100% the game. My only real complaint would be the fact that in order to unlock some car upgrades, you need to lower the threat of certain regions. In doing so, less enemies are driving around that area, but that means you don't get to have fun killing those enemies with your newly upgraded car. A new game+ mode would be perfect for this. Apart from that though, incredibly fun experience, very well polished and generally awesomely fun carnage!			"

												You might want to expect some repetitive kind of feeling when it comes to playing open world-type of video game, the same goes to Mad Max.But its up to you, given an options whether to play straight forward Story mission, or spending plenty of time doing Wasteland missions (essential in upgrading Max's overall skills & abilities), you will also find excitement exploring the vast world of Mad Max which I can say, far too mesmerizing even for such wasteland (I lost count of how many panoramic screenshots I've taken).Overall 7.5/10Not enough Dinki Di, need to eat moar.

												I usually avoid movie related games, as they are almost always quickly pieced together and offer nothing more than a brand name on a mediocre game. But Mad Max is something else.Similar to the film, the majority of this game revolves around driving through the wastelands of a dystopian Australia. In addition to the stunning scenery and expansive stretches of desert coated highway, are a hive of strongholds, enemy towers and sniper nests you can chose to conquer. Vehicle combat is excellent, and is similar to that of older Burnout titles, such as Takedown. You can fine tune your car, the Magum Opus, to suit your playstyle, lightly armoured speedster, or fortified tank. Using either grinding and crashes to destroy enemy cars, or your harpoon gun to rip off their tires or leave the driver exposed by removing his door and shotgunning him.Melee fighting is taken from Warner Brothers other game franchise, the Arkham series, so is polished and well developed. Max himself can be upgraded with combat maneuvers and armour or damage boosts, and Skills such as increased health and weapon durability.Though the story is not of particular merit, the one thing Mad Max shines at is fun. You often spend hours driving around the giant open-world, littered with side missions, hunting scrap to upgrade your car. During your 30-40 hours of game time, you will notice the small touches the developers added, which shows you that they really cared about the game and wanted to produce something that stands in line with the Mad Max franchise.If you enjoy vehicle combat or wasteland based games, Mad Max is a great addition to your games library.

												The apocalypse made Australia slightly more liveable, none of the wildlife tried to kill me. Traffic is still murder though.But seriously: highly recommended. I couldn't stop playing this game.It's a sandbox game with a whole lot of sand, a great atmosphere, visual design taken straight of Fury Road and made by fans of the whole series or at least people who really documented themselves, with lots of details and easter eggs about the three first movies. As a fan of the Mad Max universe myself, I had a blast.However, just as in a real sandbox, it's mostly up to you to make your own fun. The story is a bit weak, and while there are a ton of locations (over 250 I think), all of them unique, all you do is drive and fight, either in a vehicle or on foot with a Batman Arkham clone system which is very brutal and satisfying and offers quite a bit of different possibilities once you've unlocked skills. You can upgrade your vehicle to make it tougher and meaner, get a few weapons for your car and unlock fighting skills for Max, but the core experience stays the same. If that appeals to you and you like to explore every nook and cranny in a game to find stuff (it's always scrap, but you need it for everything), go right in. If you need to be poked every five minutes by narrative to stay interested, it isn't the game for you.There a over 16'000 reviews already, so there isn't much I could say that you can't find elsewhere. I'm just going to say ""watch the trailer"", for once it isn't just an empty cinematics showcase filled with buzzwords but it shows you most of the gameplay and really shows you the game and what to expect.Disclaimer: I am a fan of the Mad Max universe since The Road Warrior, back in the days where there was no videogames and where it was the only post-apocalyptic experience around, so I'm probably biased.

												Wow! A movie tie-in game that does not suck giant balls! Totally worth the $20.00 I got the key from a third party website for!Open world with light rpg elements, upgradable vehicles. Think Just Cause 2 meets Borderlands, Far Cry 3 and a Mad Max movie poster in the teleporter from The Fly, out pops this fun recombinated creature that critics hate but actual gamers enjoy.			"

												I'm seriously impressed. I didn't expect much going in, and I've only scratched the surface, but I like what I've seen so much that I'm confident in giving this game a thumbs up before I'm anywhere close to being done. The game is great, the mechanics hold up, the balance between your character and your car is well done. I've hardly seen an open world game have such compelling reasons to actually hit all the landmarks and do all the things, asides from Shadows of Mordor. Actually, I think the only thing that would make this game more awesome would be the Nemesis system. That would be cool.			"

												Here's my 10 hours worth of gameplay review. I like the game enough to keep playing.+ I've upgraded my car quite a bit.+ I've stolen a few cars+ My beard has grown+ Lord Scrotus. LOL+ I've seen a wide variety of interesting locations and vehicles.+ Combat is fast and often very entertaining- Starter vehicle drives like it has one wheel.- Max walks like he's dropped something smelly in his underpants.- Max is a terrible climber. A small rock step is just too high.- Max takes lots of fall damage - even from small heights.- I've heard ""Look after the car"" and ""Stay here"" about 100,000 times.- Scrap, Scrap, Scrap. It's a grind.7/10 - I will continue to eat maggots and collect random photos.			"

												Well when I first heard of a Mad Max game I was sure it's going to be another crappy movie game like the majority of movie games, however when I started seeing what type of game it was I started to alter my perspective for the game. Although I never bought this on release, actually I bought this 2 years after, on sale might I say, and what I noticed was that It's GREAT! A fantastic open-world, post apocalyptic Mad Max game with endless things to explore and do. You start off as Max some guy from a movie who's the lost everything and as to survive the wasteland, filled with weird savages that kill you on sight... And it's MAD MAX! An open WORLD MAD MAX! WHO DOESN'T LIKE THAT?                                              ProsMassive mapPlenty of things to doGood story Good graphicsAmazing car upgrades Hand to hand combat is good ConsQuite repetitiveThe way the guns work is crapCut sences are as corny as Hopsin's music Overall great game and I would recommend.

												I was really sceptical watching gameplays on youtube about this one. So, honestly, I tried it via torrent and after that I decided to buy it.It has something that I can't describe in a proper words. Something like you can really empathize with the protagonist and then decide to kick some butts because you want to help him. I can't say that I would replay it more than two times, but the entire game can take you in a long journey, collecting achievements, exploring the map, or just to enjoy in a landscape of desolation, taking some cool screenshots etc. So, for me it is a great game and I love it.

Product received for free
IntroThis game was given to me by a colleague who had a spare copy. I put the game aside due to the general consensus that the game was ‘okay’, however when I did get round to booting up the game - I didn’t play anything else until I finished it! And I don’t get to finish many games…Story/BackgroundThe main story is a bit meh. The narrative has clearly been written to fit in with the game mechanics (you need to upgrade your car a bunch and you need a buddy riding along with you), though it does get a bit better towards the end.The side quests are nice because they have a level of narrative, don’t take too long and there aren’t so many of them that they detract from the main story. Post-apocalypse themes are always cool. The Mad Max setting is no Fallout. It is very brutal. There is death, violation, drugs and not to mention insane amounts of violence. I’m almost afraid to say I prefer this level of seriousness that almost everyone in this world wants to kill you purely for the fun of it. MechanicsCombat is truly where the game shines. There are two types; on foot and in car. Ground combat is just like the Batman games but super bloody and delightfully violent. It follows the action mechanic formula of punching and parrying, with weapons and unlockable skills thrown into the mix. Max has a gun, but true to the world, ammo is scarce so I found myself very rarely using it (much more fun to save for use in car combat).The car combat mechanics are awesome. The nature of it, though unscripted, comes across as highly cinematic, detailed skirmishes. Intercepting convoys is extremely fun, there’s nothing like scouting out a dust trail from atop a plateau with your ‘long lookers’, getting into your vehicle and T-boning the target car, shooting raiders off your bonnet in the process. Very fun.ProgressionMax and his car are the player’s main focus. Levelling up Max unlocks Max upgrades such as armor and skills. This system is very well done; rather than gathering experience points, you level up by completing challenges (blow up 50 barrels, do a 10-hit combo, etc.). Completing quests and eliminating threats unlocks car upgrades. There are many different combinations, the most expensive upgrades aren’t always the best to use. Sometimes the weaker upgrades are a better choice - they may have less mass, which allows for faster acceleration, for example.VisualsThe game is beautiful. From far away landmarks, right the way down to sand trails and dust clouds, the level of detail is impressive. There’s even a feature to freeze time and capture screenshots and videos. No loading screens interrupt traversing the huge open world.SummaryI’ve touched on the parts of this game that spoke out to me the most. If you are a fan of open-world action games, post-apocalyptic themes or good o’ violence ‘n explosions, then I highly suggest buying this. Some patience with the first introductory part is required until the game opens up and becomes much more fun. The game is NOT a survival game, Max is a very capable individual, though a bit simple and predictable - he fights like a total badass.			"

												★★★★✯This is an awesome game that even after finishing it and completing the majority of it (took me 45 hours) leaves me still wanting more . Get this game! It is Mad Max for bananas sake, this is a must play game for post-apocalyptic fans and especially Mad Max fans. It plays like a blend of Tomb Raider (2016) and GTA, meaning it has a nice combat flow but doesn't focus on it as much as it does on the cars. GG 4.5/5! "

												Mad Max is one of those solid mid-tier games that got pushed as a AAA title and shoved out to die, and that makes me sad.I'm not going to pretend the game is flawless, hell, two times in playing it I fell through geometry and got trapped, and I'm well aware of things like the ""your map vanishes forever"" bug that got patched out before I began playing (I waited on that fix), Mechanically, though, it's an enjoyable game hampered by a few design decisions. The combat's a bit repetitive by endgame, but your moves basically turn into a lot of shortcuts to victory and the shotgun is a huge boon in that it'll OHKO all but three classes of enemy*. Vehicle combat is cool and you can build the Magnum Opus (your ride for the game) into a variety of different styles: I went light armor, fast movement, and a lot of harpoon/tire-spikes to take out enemies, with a massive ram for a stylish finish. Someone else could just turn the car into a tank, or take careful shots at an opponent to blow them sky high, or spit flames from the car to consume anyone else nearby. It's a decent customization level, and that's one of my biggest issues with it:You don't get a lot of toys until the very end of the game, doubly so if you're like me and do a lot of side-content before main events.Which sucks! And while the story missions do put together some nice scenarios and events, I actually think some of the side stories are better designed or more interesting than the main game. The only really, really distinct thing the game did for me in its main story was the final gauntlet, which was actually kind of unpleasant to play through even though I can't fault it from a character standpoint. Meanwhile, the side missions and some of the camps took on a whole lot of environmental storytelling, from underground oil refineries, to the almost puzzle-like nature of some of the scrap hideaways, to scaling an old power structure to take down a warlord in his own home.The thing that leaves me most disappointed in this game is that this is one of those games that would be perfect with one more revision, they take this finished engine, tweak it a little, and spend all the time of a sequel on design rather than coding, but it's pretty much guaranteed to never happen, and I don't see anyone mining this game for ideas when the next Big Thing comes around and vehicular open world debauchery is going to be forgotten. It was really fun. Buy it.* shielded, huge dudes, and one specific boss fight where the dickweed dodges shells			"

												Amongst a multitude of open world games with maps littered by icons for collectibles as a substitute for gaming content, Mad Max does something with the genre: it turns all of these collectibles into exploration pieces. This doesn't exactly solve the problem; exploring over a hundred of tiny settlements becomes as tedious as hunting down a hundred of other collectibles, but it does turn what would be a collectathon into a series of adventures and the resulting product is that much richer for it.Mad Max is at its best whenever it turns into a dungeon crawler in post-apocalyptic Australia. Imagine Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor where instead of gaining intel on orc warlords you gain intel to take down enemy bases. Scout enemy camps from afar before taking out their perimeter defenses in your V6 engine car, then battle it out inside while seeking treasure troves of metal scraps.The features are what sets Mad Max apart from other games. There are definite improvements to the traditional Batman-style melee while car combat has a range of over-the-top special attacks such as the harpoon slam, drive-by shootings, THUNDERPOONS and flaming jets of incineration. Meanwhile, the weakness in the main story actually made me wistful for the Assassin's Creed franchise! Say what you will about their game balance; you knew absurd action hero♥♥♥♥♥♥was gonna go down the minute you accepted that Story Mission! Here it's the opposite: Story Missions are quite tame and most of the value comes from investigating non-essential camps and hunting down enemy convoys.One must enjoy the greater changes Mad Max brings to the genre if they are to appreciate their purchase. This could've just as easily been a negative review if I nitpicked every little thing that went wrong: Top Dog bosses follow identical patterns, the vehicles you collect from the enemy serve no purpose, ditto the archangel ""alternative car builds"", some cars are deliberately rendered hard to maneuver as artificial difficulty, the greatest threat to your lifebar is an impromptu event against which you are completely helpless (OH NO, A MIGHTY DUSTER!), same ol' chore list of tasks to do (""kill 20 enemies with wall finishers."" No, stop adding those), not to mention the glaring elephant in the room: you are STILL searching for collectibles! They're just properly hidden as part of your (side-) adventure rather than showcased on a map, so you end up longing for those traditional map icons whenever you're stuck searching for that one final object and be done with a particular encampment!Most games have you seek out upgrades in side quests, Mad Max makes upgrading your V6 engine into a V8 the main plot of the game. It's true! You get your car stolen in the opening, you vow vengeance, you find a substitute which you'll upgrade with better wheels, armor and such but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if Max Rockastansky is gonna drive anything with less than 8 cylinders of pure power! This is literally ""Upgrades: the Game"". Assault the various strongholds of Scabrous Scrotous to unlock upgrades, collect piles of scrap to pay for upgrades, perform feats of daring-do (or kill 20 enemies with wall finishers) for character upgrades. This is... ""pure extract of open world game"". Mind you; the upgrades are indeed wonderful, but there should be more to games than just upgrades. I don't want to play the world's most skillful scrap collector.There's just so much good in this game for it to warrant a Thumbs Down, despite my numerous gripes. However, I obviously cannot recommend this to anyone burnt out on open world games at the risk of seeing them puke map icons. Important: check your system requirements before purchasing as this game actually caused my computer to overheat when played at its highest graphical settings. If you're still on the fence, consider watching a few Let's Plays. I promise it won't spoil the story.REVIEW SLIGHTLY EDITED FOR LENGTH			"

												8.0/10 - Like a bad Ex-Girlfriend. Once Loved... Now Absolutely Hated.This game is pretty amazing for real. I just got immensely irritated at the end and by the looks of it tons of others did too! I put in a solid work week into this game; loved every minute from the combat to the car and it's plethora of upgrades. My only major dislike is that after nearly 40 hours of quests, combats and wasteland destruction... the storyline hangs on my ability to win a race inside Gastown. This is tough for me; and I find it extremely rage-worthy. As a huge fan of the franchise they could have at least had an alternative quest like a 'thunder-dome' combat based. Sighhh.So I won't finish this game unless I can get some savvy hipster to take my save file and complete the race... What's the point though... This game does excel in storyline and mass content and a huge desert world to explore. The game is set up really like Just Cause 2,3 where there are different bases around the world you must conquer. It can get a little repetitive but I honestly don't mind that when the combat and driving is so rewarding. Overall, this could have been Fallout 3 Epic to me... But it's not. Worth $30.

												I played Mad Max like a Mad Man after I picked it up on sale. I'm torn on this game, on one hand the Batman style combat is tried and true,(I have to add that after replaying Batman Arkham Asylum, the combat is a lot more responsive and fluid than batman) and the car combat is pleasant enough, on the other hand this is the majority of things to do in this game.The story what little of it there is left me wanting . There are certain choke points in the story where you are bottle necked into doing the highly repetitive ""side missions"" to reduce the threat level in each goofy dumb-asses territory you need to proceed through to the end of the story. The main content consists of shooting snipers off perches,with a very poor shooting mechanic only available from the back of your car. Blowing enemy convoys up with your car, which is the one of the better realized components of the game but becomes trivial after some of the late game upgrades for your car thus removing replay-ability.  Pulling down towers with your cars harpoon, also trivial but required to progress, but I had some of my most enjoyable time in the game just driving around the games world. The vehicle handing is fun once accustomed to it.The game has very few fast travel points compared to most open world games. But it can be exciting driving your death machine around the wastes.The most time consuming part of the game is going into enemy camps where section by section you use the before mentioned batman style combat to achieve a small set of simple and repeated goals. Although it is similar to other games combat it has its own unique touches that brought glee at times. The tools at hand in combat are gruesome and useful allowing the above mentioned fluidity to combat, making combat the most pleasant part of the game and consequentially the game play is what helped me push through to the end of the story. Although upgrading Max's abilities brings more tedium to the game, you are forced to drive to a roaming shaman-esque character in order to spend a skill point.Halfway through I found myself dreading the proceeding the bored cut scene pushed every time you visit this ""shaman"". So I took the route of letting five to ten points build up before i took the time to search out the shamans newly relocated position on the map. Which seems odd because my garage i.e the way to upgrade the car is simply in the game menu?....I found the game to be getting too tedious around the hour twenty mark, so hey I got twenty hours of funish game play out of it before i could take no more and just mainlined the story as fast as i was allowed. I decide to lean positive due to the fun I did have but fair warning, the game is VERY repetitive and i was disappointed when it was all said and done that the game gave me to compelling reason to play after completing the story.

Posted: September 25, 2015
												Mad Max is a solid open world experience, creating an immersive environment through ambient sounds and visuals from the Avalanche Engine (notably found in Just Cause series). A pre-release review labelled the game as ""exhilarating, fast, violent, and fun"" and I'd have to agree to that. The game puts heavy emphasis on vehicular combat, in which around 60% of the game requires the player to drive their car to fight against enemies.After a global collapse of civilisation and society, followed by an intense nuclear skirmish, Max's journey to the Plains of Silence takes an unexpected turn when a group of War Boys (run by warlord Scabrous Scrotus, psychotic son of Immortan Joe) run him off the road and steal his clothes, his supplies, his weapons, and his car before leaving him to rot in the desert sun. Traversing the wasteland in search of his prized Interceptor, Max meets a hunchback mechanic named Chumbucket, an overzealous individual that's hell bent on crafting the perfect vehicle, the Magnum Opus. After giving Max hope of exacting vengeance on Scrotus, the two form an unlikely partnership and set out in the base of the Opus in search of food, water, allies, upgrades, and redemption in a world devoid of sanity.The two downfalls to the game are the controls and the fighting capabilities. Controls make the game feel cheap, constant big HUD reminders for which key to press, and normally you have to hold the button down rather then just press it. It doesn't seem a huge issue, but gets incredibly frustrating the more you invest time into the game. Fighting capabilities are somewhat slim, with just a couple different buttons to use to fight and defend Max. I was really hoping for something along the lines of the Batman series in terms of combat mechanics, but was mildly disappointed. However, the violent nature of Max and his different styles of taking out opponents somewhat makes up for this. On a huge plus, this game makes you feel like the wasteland is alive. Constant threats driving around and notorious weather changes can drastically alter your initial plans. Its also extremely refreshing to find a game that doesn't include regenerating health, which makes scavenging for food and water supplies a nice change. The camera mode is superb and instantly reminds me of the one found in Shadow of Mordor, easily allowing you to capture your best images the way you want - with different vignettes/filters to apply and tweak your shots with. You will probably find yourself continuously busy in Mad Max, and with that said you will more then likely be rewarded around every corner of doing so, normally in the form of scrap (the games currency used to upgrade Max, vehicles and strongholds).Finally, the car combat is absolutely fantastic and really shines over the negative points mentioned. Numerous occasions I found myself wandering off of missions in hunt of enemies & loot. You will find yourself ramming, shooting and harpooning every vehicle/structure you find, not forgetting to mention lone snipers trying to pick you off at range. The ability to customise your vehicle (& character) to your liking is a personal favourite of mine and therefore lets you explore the wasteland as the Mad Max that you want to be. It all makes for a forward moving and overall fun experience. "

												The question I asked myself prior to writing this was ""What does Mad Max do that other games aren't doing?""  It feels like a game of missed opportunities.  There is this big, very well-crafted world set in a post-apocalypstic land with not all that much to offer an intrepid wanderer.  Yeah, you can drive around and see ruins of buildings and signs, but there is almost never a real point to doing so.  You can pick up tiny amounts of scrap (the game's currency), but after you've liberated some camps the scrap pickups become just another collectible.  Speaking of collectibles, the history relics started interesting enough - a photo, a postcard, a handwritten note of days gone by that Max wistfully comments on - but when I realized I'd collected dozens and wasn't even halfway through the list, I gave up.  They aren't THAT interesting.The story is cliche at best, the anti-hero just looking out for himself until he meets someone who reminds him of better days and then has to systematically destroy the bad guys.  It's awkward.  At least when you fight, it has real impact.  Punching dudes never really gets old in this game, but the combat has its drawbacks as well.  There is ""tap for light hit"" and ""hold for heavy hit"", and a counter button.  You unlock various finishing moves throughout the game that can be useful in group fights, but sometimes the game doesn't respond quickly enough and allows Max to take a hit while setting up such a maneuver.  When in Fury mode, he hits real hard and does some incredibly satisfying suplexes, but there is no way to do it on purpose - you just get lucky.Car combat starts off similarly, forcing you to think a little bit about your approach before you have upgraded your car.  By the time you can hurl thunderpoons at other cars, it's just not that fun anymore because everything explodes pretty easily.  As stated many times, the mini-bosses scattered around are a joke.  They all attack the same way (unblockable charge) and in most cases, you defeat them the same way - hit them with a real big wrench or something else lying around.  Occasionally there are environmental hazards that can aid you - say, but letting a boss charge into a flame burst - but it's nowhere near the extremes of something like Sleeping Dogs.After a while, you realize that reducing threat across the various warlords' regions by tackling side actitivies (read: map vomit) has stopped being beneficial, as Max is decked out in crazy gear and the car is nigh invulnerable (car upgrades are often locked behind getting threat below a certain level).  It just stops being fun.  I mainlined the last several story missions to get it over with and wasn't left very satisified by the ending.  It's probably worth a play if you dig the universe and don't mind icons all over the place (complete with hot air balloons that let you identify all the actitives in an area!), but it's not really anything spectularly different.

												""Perhaps it's not the killing you enjoy, but the moments of silence the fighting brings you"".Beautiful, entertaining and intense adventure game will not only attract fans of Mad Max, but also anyone who is looking for a good open world game with a variety of content and stuff to explore, do and destroy. Before I say anything else about this quality game, hats off to Avalanche studios for great optimisation. Game runs smoothly at 60 fps, no micro stuttering, no sudden unexplained FPS drops, it has plenty of different graphical options and is easy adjustable and reconfigurable. Let's start off with the map. It's apsolutely huge! One would think that stranded in a desert would be far from entertaing, but developers managed to pull this world off beautifully from occasional wanderers that ask for a sip of water in exchange for an information, to different camps, sniper's nests and so on. There is always something going on like convoys traveling on route, war boys attacking you and trying to steal your car and so on.Graphics wise, game is beautiful. Explosions, dust storms, all those tiny particles are visible and they really create unique immersion with not only the game but the main character - Mad Max. Gameplay - I'd say this is the focal point of the game. From driving, to looting, destroying, killing warboys, this game has it all. AI in this game I feel is really on point, chasing the convoy, demolishing cars, everything feels super polished. Driving in the beginning feels somewhat stiff and weird, awkward and delayed, but as you progress and upgrade the handling, it gets only better, easier and the vehicle itself gets stronger and stronger along the way. If you've played Batman Arkham games, the combat feels more or less the same, but with more brutality, suited to Mad Max's persona. It's very satisfying and rewarding.Not only you are able to fully customize your car as you wish with dozens of different body's, parts and such, you are also able to change Max's outfit, grow him a beard, make him stronger, faster, more resistable and so on. Game offers a lot without being too overwhelming on that part.When it comes to story, unfortunately I can't vouch for it and say that it's the better part of the game, but as you know, you're Mad Max, left alone to survive, find your peace and solace. Story is as good as Mad Max's story can go in my opinion.I'd say that the negative side of this game would probably be repetitiveness. Given that there are a lot of stuff do collect, smash, dismantle, loot and so on, I can see how it can feel for stale for someone who is looking for more vibrant kind of game. I'd rate this game a solid 8.5/10. Quality title and definitely worth the name Mad Max.			"

												This is an absolutely wonderful game from Avalanche Studios. The same guys that did Just Cause 2. While Mad Max shares the title name and protagonist of the Mad Max movies, the world and story is actually completely non canon to the film franchise. Max here is based on neither Mel Gibson or Tom Hardy's Max Max. Completely original, and leaving the player to their own interpretations on how to play as Mr. Rockatasnky. Max starts out the game having his trusty V8 stolen, and sets off on a grandiose apocalyptic adventure through the wasteland in an attempt to get back what is rightfully his. Early in the game you meet your sidekick and comic relief for the game in the form of a hunchback named Chumbucket. Chumbucket is also your trusted mechanic, who helps Max by creating a car for him called the Magnum Opus. A vehicle which Max can customize through Chumbucket a number of ways. It is also the vehicle Max will use for a large portion of the game. Mad Max takes place in a massive and barren wasteland, that shares no settings with the movies, but has completely original areas. And though the game has a lot of what you'd expect in a wasteland setting, it still seems to have a diversity lacking in most open world games. The world is as depressingly dreadful as it is also artistically wonderful. Luckily, Avalanche included a built in screenshot tool with editing features to capture some magnificent shots of the world. The gameplay is a mixed bag. On one hand you have a combat system that is reminiscent of games like the Arkham and Assassin's Creed games as well as Shadow of Mordor, with it's attack attack attack parry attack system, with little in terms of depth. This system has been found to be quite simple in other games, but Mad Max kicks it up a notch by requiring much better timing from the player. This might be a little frustrating for some players. And others might find it a bit boring. Luckily, the gameplay has you about 80% of the time in the vehicle, and this is where the game really shines. The vehicle combat is incredibly satisfying in this game. You will find yourself ramming into other vehicles, using a harpoon to tear vehicles apart, and even shooting a modified rocket launcher of sorts to cause even more chaos all across the wasteland. And it is all executed wonderfully. What's even cooler is that while the Magnum Opus is indeed your vehicle of choice, you can steal and even collect for later use any of the other vehicles found in the game. The structure of progression is pretty simple, but the amount of content in it is still quite massive. You have your main story progression, which sends you off on various missions to do this, collect that, kill that person. Pretty standard stuff. But you can not progress through the story entirely until you start doing some stuff on the side, like clearing out the threat of major gans in different areas, by eliminating them, taking over special convoy routes, taking over bases, and more. And there are still plenty of even more side diversions, like tons of places to loot for supplies, races, and more. Though the world may seem barren, it still has quite an enormous amount of things to do. There is a good deal of customization also to be found in the game ranging from your vehicle to Max himself. You can change the appearance of Max himself with unlockables you gain through a progressive ranking system, and also equip him with new moves for combat, new armor, and more. You can also do your usual upgrades to the Magnum Opus which involve different body types, armor, paint jobs, engines upgrades, tires, and more. The game also has a gas system, which means you can actually run out of gas while driving too much. Luckily gas is not hard to come by, and I have never actually had the displeasure of running out. Water is more scarce, but you never dehydrate. You only need water when you get injured in combat. you can also even feed on maggots from old corpses to regain health. Sick! There is not much realism in the gas and water system, but it's still kind of neat. anyone looking for a realistic game (I've heard the complaints), please look elsewhere. This game does not strive to follow the movies to the letter, but rather create an extremely fun and extremely chaotic game for fans of the ACTION from the movies.			"

												I got this game on a Friday.  Put 50 hours into it by the next Friday.  Yeah, it's that good.  The game is very addicting and the tasks that you complete are so much fun.  You get to destroy camps full of enemies with Batman style combat, drive around the Wasteland seeking different parts that are essential for upgrading your camps/vehicle, all wrapped up in a great story.  I highly recommend this game.  It has been a while since I picked up a game and played it exclusively until I finished it, and I'm glad this was once of them.  I had so many Mad Max withdrawals once I finished the game that I started watching the Mad Max movies.  Great game.			"

												Well... after 21 hours, I must say picking up scrap and dismantling camps - got very repetitive. They story was short, not that thrilling and the hand-to-hand combat was a childs play without creativity just demanding alot of button mashing. I would really have liked to see more variation and tactics required in hand-to-hand combat. Throughout the wasteland I was dying for more interesting quests and events, but they are simply not there. The explosions and action though, are top notch. And the game runs solid as hell on PC. It's an easy buy for 20£, but not worth 50£. Maybie I'm just open-world spoiled after playing Witcher 3, but this game has little to discover between A and B once you scratch through the surface.EDIT: Worst part in my whole Mad Max time, was when I spent 3000 hard-earned for hours scrap on upgrading a Stronghold's stockpile to maximum level, just to find out its just a pure cosmetic upgrade and it didn't give me♥♥♥♥♥♥in return. Instead of buying nice car parts or upgrading Max I literally spent a hefty amount on not getting♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ was that, retard game developer design meets evil of its pure form? Maximum V8 upgrade became far to reach again and I was done with all missions, so it simply uninstalled the ♥♥♥♥ing game because I can't stand such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			"

Neutral RatingReally not sure about this Game... It HAD potential, but I think a lot of it was missed. For me, the Game had more Negative aspects to it. I'd only recommend this during a Sale, and only recommended for someone who wants a Game to mess around in.The Story itself is extremely short with just 15 Missions which take no time at all to complete. Not only is the Story short, but it just bored me and not once did I really even care for it. It just felt like an empty shell. The only thing that made this Game have some length was the fact you have to complete tasks to unlock Story Missions. Complete so and so amount of Wasteland Missions, complete so and so amount of Stronghold Projects.None of the Characters were interesting, and although the Voice acting was decent, the cut scenes were just short, and quick to the point with no context.Surely the Gameplay would make up for it though. Unfortunately the Gameplay is hindered with the horrible Auto Camera [slow Manual Camera], and slow response on the Controls which felt like it had a slight lag after pushing in a direction.The Game has the usual Assassins Creed style combat, punch punch, counter when you see the Marker, but unfortunately, the Game doesn't allow you to turn the Counter Markers off, which just makes the combat so easy and boring after awhile. Infact, NOTHING in the Game was a challenge... Apart from fighting the Camera and Controls.The Game has 9 Boss Fights in total, 3 with Scrotus [the Main boss] and 6 ""Mini"" Boss Fights. However 4 of these Bosses is someone wielding a large Mace, ALL with the same animations, and same method to defeat [wait for him to charge, roll, start punching]. The remaining 2 are duel wielding daggers, again, same animations, same method to defeat [roll, counter when you can]. It is just absolutely lazy development.Come across a door you need an explosion for? No worries, just look 5 meters away and there will be a well placed Fuel can for you... Speaking of Fuel cans, WHY does the Game even have Fuel for the Car? The first and ONLY time I Fueled my car was at the start in the Tutorial, after that you will never really need to. I only completed my Project for auto Refueling in Jeets Stronghold [the first one which I never went to afterwards], and none of the others.Being an Open World Game though, there would be tons of things to do right? Here is what you can do;- Death Runs [Racing]- Scavenger Locations [You will encounter a max of around 3 enemies, and 2 pieces of Loot].- Minefield [Use your Dog to locate a few Mines].- Camps [Destroy either Transfer Pumps, or Oil Tanks to complete].- Scarecrows [Destroy them to lower Threat in the Region. Takes a max of 10 seconds to do].- Stronghold Projects [Complete Projects for Strongholds to give free Ammo ect. You will come across these in Camps and Scavenger Locations].This is around 90% of the Game. For an Open World, it just isn't much variety. The only thing that was half decent to do were the Camps, but this was countered with the simplistic Combat, and horrible Camera.A couple things I enjoyed were Harpooning people from my Car. As fun as this was, after your Harpoon hits, your Camera will follow your Target, even after you correct it. This will usually end with you Driving into a Wall beacuse you can't see where your going.The last 2 Missions were just great. It's the only time through the entire Game, that I felt something for the Story. The dialog, and the Gameplay were fantastic, and it really is a shame that the rest of Game was not at that level.Genre- ActionGame Elements- Open World- Day Night cycle- Weather elements- Combat- Car Modification- Racing- Stronghold UpgradesAverage Playthrough- 15 HoursLiked- Great Engine Sounds- The last 2 Missions- Great Visuals for ScreenshotsDisliked- Offered no challenge- Uninteresting Characters- Short and bland Story- Lack of variety of Side Objectives- Each Stronghold were exactly the same- Re-used Boss Battles- Slow Controls- Horrible Auto Camera [Slow manual Camera]- No option to turn Counter Markers off			"

												It's good, but it's not great. 10 hours in the curiosity will give way to tedium as each camp becomes a pattern of fight, loot, fight, loot, fight, loot, fight with nothing to stop one camp blending in to all the others. It's a shame because the developers have built a fantastic platform and sand-box filled with potential but didn't have the finesse to fill it with interesting things to do. Had they put the car-parts you needed in each camp or maybe had less of a reliance on collecting scrap it could have alleviated the tedium. The tedium reaches breaking point in having to methodically clear minefields one mine at a time. Infuriatingly mundane.The combat is solid but uninspiring. The driving mechanics are decent but the lack of a hand-brake is mind-boggling given much of the game is vehicular combat relying on ramming.The storyline is decent and includes some fairly brutal developments along the way that reflect the harsh world you find yourself in perfectly. Despite the negatives outlined above, I still sank 70 odd hours into it which is a testament to the underlying world. Max himself is the strong silent type you'd expect and between him and the 'Magnum Opus' there's sufficient cool to make it interesting - just. With just a little more time spent in the ideas department this could have been a classic. As it stands, it's a good game and worth it if you can get it at a discount.			"

												Fantastic game so far. I keep planning to only play for an hour or two, and then I look at the clock and 6-7 hours have passed. Really addicting to just roam around the map finding scrap to help upgrade my car.Huge open world, fun to drive around in and explore, great combat (both on-foot and in the cars), great music, solid voice acting and decent story with many small nods to all the films, and it's very optimized to boot! Avalanche did a great job on the PC version.Highly recommended!Edit:After 31 hours I've beaten the game. To be fair, I did a good bit of side missions and exploring, but I'm not even close to finishing everything the game has to offer. I haven't even bought most of the upgrades! I've put 31 hours into this game since it came out 7 days ago, and I still plan to put dozens more hours into this. It's so much fun just to roam around the wasteland, scavenging for supplies, taking over camps, stealing enemy cars to add to your vehicle collection.This game is damn good, and I can't wait to play more tomorrow.

Introduction:Being the first game of the series this is an amazing game. Love the fact that it was paid for by Warner Bros. who also made Tomb Raider which gave it the perfect feeling. A lot of the mechanics are similar to Tomb Raider games. This game didn't disappoint once. Pros:LOTS OF DRIVING (pro IMO, could be a con for you)Good graphicsLong storyGood plotGood selection of carsTon of upgrades for cars and MaxSo many side missions and collectiblesHuge mapExtremely optimizedMostly bug freeGreat special effects (smoke, fire, sounds)Cons:Only single playerReally hard bosses with no difficulty settingA few times certain sound effects were muteSometimes the game isn't clear with your objectiveYou can drive any car you find but can't use it as a primary vehicleConclusion:I had a lot of fun playing game especially after reading the book and watching the movie. WBs did a very good job with this game. When I saw the movie this was exactly the game I imagined. There's nothing I thought was missing except the multiplayer aspect. Especially after the story is done there isn't much. It would be cool if they made a The Crew type online mode where you see others. But other than that its a masterpiece.For more reviews check out  Original Curators Group  "

												I get to release all kinds of stress and anxiety with this game...Avalanche really captured the essence of Mad Max with this game, call me crazy but for some reason this game in bits and pieces reminds me of Red Dead Redemption.  Fantastic graphics, good sound, and fun gameplay for an open world driving game.  They did a decent job of balancing parts and missions unless you are the type of player that bombs for the finish line as quickly as possible, then you may run into some sticky situations.  I have been playing casually through and am about 3/4 completed with the game at around 60 hours.  Again casually playing exploring doing side missions and extras then onto the mainline missions when I felt like it.  They did so many things right but yet a few things are lacking in my eyes that yet need to be done.  For example a game+ mode to unlock after 100% completion resetting the bases, convoys, scarecrows, threat levels, etc.  Also game+ mode would be far more difficult and fuel would be far more rare and not to mention fuel consumption would be far more as well.  Sort of a ""hardcore"" mode after completion would have been nice touch to finish up this great game. People still play this game quite a bit even a year after release it's still picking up, not bad for a SP game.  I mean this game still has a daily average of 4 to 5,000 players.  I picked this game up on a sale and got it for 9.99,  if you love vehicle combat games not too mention a hand to hand combat system that is alot like Arkham then I would say it's worth even the full price as well if you love those types of games.  It consists of building you car and leveling your personal skills while going to war with Scrotum face's war boys. Competing in death races to unlock collector cars, raiding bases and looting, taking out convoys, building up allied bases for restock and constantly battling enemies until you get the threat levels down by dismantling bases, tearing down scarecrows, clearing minefields etc.It really is a fun game to play..10/10 Would put a chainsaw through Scrotum again...

												I will keep this review short, because I don't want to write about everything good that this game is, but rather let you experience the game yourselves.Mad Max is a 3rd person, post apocalyptic, survival, action game with large open world, brutal hand to hand and vehicular combat. You play as Max, a survivor in harsh and unforgiving Wasteland, controlled by bandit gangs.Laying almost dead, and bleeding on the burning sands of Wasteland. Beaten down by the bandit gang with all of your hard earned possessions stripped from you. Max must find strength to get up and take the Mad to the bandits.This game is basically Tomb Raider + Uncharted 2 with Carmageddon vehicular madness in post apocalyptic Wasteland. Thus you get similar movement, platforming (to extent), survival, looting and equipment upgrades as in Tomb Raider / Uncharted 2, with more refined and brutal hand to hand combat. And all the crazy vehicle madness from Carmageddon, in addition to the upgradeable vehicle parts and body modifications.Controls are responsive yet tad sluggish, but you get the hang of it fast so there's nothing wrong here. Voice acting is good, with great lip sync in cut-scenes, but not so much out of them. You drive your car mostly through sand so it's understandable it will feel a bit unresponsive, but you can modify so many aspects of your vehicle and fine tune it to the handling you need.Environment is mostly Wasteland, so rocks, sand, sandstorms, occasional dust devil, as well as some nice view distance on landscape. Once in a while you see some eye catching scenes at night or by day that make you stop the car and soak in the beauty, even though it's just barren Wasteland.Main currency in game is scrap, similar to Tomb Raider where you come across some crates with parts, here you pick up metal scrap that is hand placed through environment and also can be dropped by enemies and destroyed vehicles. You use scrap to upgrade your car, pay for Max's upgrades, modifications and gear.Main gameplay besides story is to capture, destroy different points on the map, to eliminate bandits and reduce gang presence in that area, so less bandit patrols, higher rewards from survival ally camps who take control of the camps you free.Hand to hand combat is brutal and often pleasant to the eye. You fight more than one opponent at the time with counter indicators that let you plan your attacks, defenses. The higher combo you keep, the stronger attacks are, you can combo fast and strong attacks with ground and weapon takedowns, and also with body to surface detection. So you can sprint bash someone into the wall and then beat him silly holding against it.Vehicular combat is all about ramming sensitive parts of enemy vehicle, ripping off car parts with harpoon to either get to the driver or just have fun and tear off tires from vehicle to continue the fight on foot. Enemies can jump on your car and get to you if you're not careful, so plan your car upgrades and invest in less defended areas.I already talked too much, even though I wanted to keep it short. It's very well made game, runs on Havok engine which is awesome. You can fine tune the settings to match your hardware, personally I didn't have any issues with it even being below recommended and playing on High. It looks like majority of players who bought this game are happy with it, and for the low price (not on steam) it's well worth the money spent.

P.S. Took me 75 hours to beat everything, with 48 out of 49 achievements. Didn't bother with last one because you have to do ALL in game challenges, and there are A LOT of those. In the end (with not trying to do them) I didn't have around 20, and I don't feel like wasting time completing those. Other than that I'm very happy with the game, I enjoyed it a lot, and it was money well spent.Enjoy.			"

												All I remember of Mad Max was a dusty Mel Gibson, a big bad car, and feeling a connection to the desperate wanderers he came across.  In a way, it's one of the first apocalyptic worlds I'd ever seen.  It has it's appeal.  Thunderdome and Tina Turner with the crazies and bloodlust.  These days it's all post-apocalyptic hell with zombies, so seeing a wasteland in a new but familiar universe of Mad Max wasn't hard to process and a nice change for all the end-of-the-world-ness in games I see.Well then, what's it all about?  Giant open world areas, some fun car caravan takedowns, the usual batman-eque fighting, using a  fast car to destroy stuff, and mostly enjoying the world of Mad Max in a video game.  A first I thought, ""Ok, Batman-junior with a car. Not bad"".  There is a fervor in the knuckle-fighting that is Max.  It's not a precise brawler, yet not a hack n slash either.  I couldn't really stop, though.  Insert coin, get video game fast food adrenaline rush.  My goal was to try and take them all down without firing a shot, that made the fights extra edgy.  The fun bit for *me*, though....the open world car takedowns.  And this varies from gamer to gamer because some folks dislike open world.  Personally, I just dive in and forget to actually play the missions.  After playing for a few hours I left the main campaign and drove around the open world leveling up for 20+ hrs.  Then I got back to the campaign all uber-leveled with a wonderfully growling car only to find I could not get to the next mission. I wasted about an hour or more trying to get it to work.  Finally, I gave up and looked online. I found I had to level *down* my car to get to the next mission.  What is up with that?  At least give me a hint, but to keep it completely out of the mission description?  Weird.  Why bother making an open world if you need a linear leveling playthrough?  So, *that* kinda stunk.Next up was learning to attack cars, gates, and snipers with my grapple hook.  Soon to be upgraded to a THUNDERPOON.  Yep, it's called a THUNDERPOON.  Basically having a lightweight RPG gunner in the back of your car.  Sweet.  But I preferred the grapple personally.  Maybe it's more batman-ish, but I enjoyed aiming it at tires and stopping bad guys with a hook to the chest.  Pooning was a bit too easy and I only used it for aiming at gas tanks at camps.  Some of those camps had several flame inducing gas tanks, snipers in tight areas, and defense towers made of shooting fireballs. These were a great joy to attack.  That was the best part really.  Once you got past the defenses, you crack some heads until you get to a mini-boss with minions and usually giant blazing stationary flamethowers.  I ran my bosses into those as a fast way to finish.  The problem?  ALL the mini-bosses were like that.  It got old after awhile.  Even down to the last side mission, it was all the same attack, evade, attack.  Not much to it.  Makes me scratch my head how come they didn't add some variety to the bosses.  It would have added so much more to the game if *any* of them had some special abilities.Now I loved the driving and chasing the bad guy on their supply routes.  It was sorta GTA style and even though the car was hard to maneuver I never got tired of it.  You can add more armor and stabilizers to get better handling, but I found the armor slowed me down.  Better to stay light to keep up.  Unless you skid out of control and end up in a ditch.  But, the car could take a good beating.  The death runs were okay and just required a bit of practice to remember where to slow down and speed up. Using nitro was also a good help on a straight path with it's fast speed boost, but in general made me lose total control if I made any sort of turn.  What NAILED me was the race against Stank Gum. It was there - after a bajillion attempts - that i realized i had too much armor and needed to lighten up the car to keep up. Once I did that, i was able to complete the mission with just a handful of tries.  That can be the hardest part of the game, or the easiest.  Depends how good you are at driving games and how heavy your car is when you start.Right around that part of the game, the story *finally* gets interesting.  Before, it was mostly summer-movie-story-action filler.  But towards the last 15% of the game the story makes some good progress. Which is great because after awhile I would just get bored and chat with my buddies on steam or watch twitch while I played 10 minutes every hr.  Some nights I'd play maybe 20 minutes with the game running all night long.  I was losing my interest pretty bad.  Past the Stank Gum mission, though, you may finish the game a little faster because it's getting more varied as you go.  I will say the end mission is pretty decent and I felt like it was a good ending.  I'm not going to spoil it, but that ending was a lot better than say the ending to Shadow of Mordor.  I had to play the Bright Lord DLC to get a good ending to Mordor - which is a shame because I *loved* Mordor other than that ending.  Mad Max ends well and becomes a decent game towards the last 15%  of the campaign.Story isn't much, but it's voice acted well and frankly I liked the storyline more than the movie.  That isn't saying much because the movie was mostly an action packed sequence with little dialogue going on ( in my opinion ).  But the game has a lot more going on.  What it *is* missing is the connection to the people surviving out there in the vast dry death of a world Max lives in.  You get some connections here and there, but mostly you bounce from camp to camp and just do missions without really talking to anyone.  Where is the love?  Max is a loner, I get it.  But, wow, there wasn't anything even close to a personal experience until the end.  Art direction is a gritty gorgeous wasteland.  A perfect Mad Max open world with quite a lot of detailed landscape and nicely working physics.  I got into it.  Maybe I'm a loner too, who knows, but it appealed to me.  At least until I finished and decided I need to move on to my backlog again.  Lemme drive all over and smash into bad guy cars.  I loved that.One more thing towards the end - and here I will be critical - it gets more and more glitchy.   A few scenes had my car inside of another car, I drove all the way to the end of a mission only to get stuck on geometry for 15 minutes while i wiggled everything possible, and the occasional cutscene where the person's head disappeared.  But my biggest gripe was the last side quest.  Someone decided to make it only work *at night*.  I could not fast forward time!  I tried upgrading the camps with scrap metal which seems to fast forward time a bit, but it would miss the nighttime somehow.  So, i drove around for over 2 hrs until I got to a night scene in order to finish the game sidequests. That was *so* annoying.  Somebody got cut a check for that idea.  Arrgh.  Please WB, it's *not* fun or challenging.  *Don't* do that again.Overall, a solid entry.  Nothing spectacular, but it has it's good points if you enjoy driving recklessly beating up brighly painted shirtless dudes in an open world.  Amazing? Nope.  Bad♥♥♥♥♥  Nope.  Worth the time? Um, yeah, as long as you like the above statement on driving and don't expect much variety in the bosses.  Plus, you get to be Mad Max!  7/10.			"

												It starts a little janky, but upgrades fix a lot of those initial issues. I can see it getting repetitive further down the road, but I'm still having lots of fun 16 hours in. It should also be noted that this game is incredibly well optimized. Maxed settings at 1080p, never once dropped below 60 FPS on a GTX 970. Warner Bros. works in mysterous ways.			"

												As some others have already written I really wanted to like the game. It was unfortunately not meant to be so, Mad Max is an incredibly pretty game, the car combat is a nice change of pace and definitely sets the game apart from others. The story is mostly interesting and well written. What in my opinion sinks the game is it's repetitiveness. Once you have completed first of the regions you have, outside of the main missions, seen everything the game has to offer. All of the strongholds are upgraded in the same way, while it was nice to see them change visually getting the same parts for the same thing for the n-th time was just plain boring. And don't get me started on clearing the regions to 0 threat, to achieve that you have to clear everything from the region (aside from scrap locations), minefields are especially annoying, requiring you to change the car, drive to the location, find 3 mines, get out of the car and dismantle each one. And you if you want some of the upgrades you have to do that.TL;DR Overall I don’t think I can recommend Mad Max, completing the game felt like a chore due to its repetitiveness. "

												What you are expecting is key to the factor of enjoyment you get out of Mad Max. If you are expecting a great GTA-ish game with a full fledged story, then you will be disappointed. If you are looking out for a fun and open world action game, with a great looking world, insane atmosphere and fun game mechanics (even though repetetive), then you will be enjoying it a lot. I did enjoy it a lot so far and it reminds me a lot of Far Cry and Assassin's Creed, missing the engaging story (there is one here though with nice looking cutscenes). Mad Max isn't a great game, but it is a good game and is good at everything it does. It pains me to see such great potential ""wasted"" in just a good game. They could have featured an embracing story and added elements to the gameplay, but they didn't. The pricepoint is perfect, 20 bucks are worth it (the keys cost way less, even more worth). I would be heavily disappointed with 60 bucks though, since it just isn't really having lots of content (as I said, the story isn't really great and all the content is the same as in all Ubisoft games prior to Watch Dogs 2, exactly the same formula).

												Only played the game for a short amount of time but i am already loving it (not that i am biased or anything) PROS:It has been extremely well optimised, its visually stunning and still keeps a constant 60fps. The car combat is fun and i thrilling, there is nothing more satisfying than ripping enemy driver out of their car with the harpoon gun. The hand to hand combat is reminiscent of Shadow of Mordor and the Batman games, i know not everyone likes that style of combat but i think it fits very well into this style of game.I love richness of the upgrade system for the car, aswell as the items and clothing that you can unlock for Max himself.Cons:To be completely honest i haven't found anything that i dislike in the game as of yet. In certain open world games i get tired of the hugeness of the maps but by having the car to travel around in its not like it takes you that long to get you from A to B and engage in some vehicle combat inbetween.Overall i am thoroughly enjoying it so far. In my opinion i feel its a shame that it was released on the same day as MGSV as i feel that a lot of people will play that first and probably try and pick this up later on in the year.			"

												I don't know how to play these games anymore. As they grow larger or more populated with loot, locations and activities, I get entirely lost in the monotony and unfortunately I tend to neglect the story, which I value as much as gameplay. After 30-40 hours or so I had to pry myself away from it, the grind of driving from one location to the next was having a very unpleasant effect on my self-worth, so if you're prone to mood swings I don't recommend playing it every day. The grind of looting is best illustrated by the random friendlies you encounter, because so little thought has been put into those encounters that they're often a tonal mess of mismatched writing and animations, making them utterly pointless, scrap or no scrap.I was shocked by the performance I managed to get out Mad Max using my aging laptop, without even meeting the minimum GPU requirement, so the first thing you'll notice is an incredibly well optimized game that keeps the spirit of its art design even when everything is turned off or set to Normal. I didn't have to lower the resolution to get a relatively solid 30fps, sometimes close to 40-50fps. It's even more miraculous when you drive to the very edge of the map and fall off, to fully appreciate the size and beauty of this game world. I haven't done it myself, but I watched a video. At least the people who still think the world is flat can find solace in video games.After taking a break from it I returned with missions in mind, so I completed one after another and got back into enjoying the story and being focused enough to complete it. This game isn't defined by it's story, but it does a good job keeping you relatively invested, along with upgrades that are tied to story missions. They're important if you want to get the most out of your abilities and your vehicle. Apart from Chumbucket though, the characters are forgettable and I don't appreciate it when a part of the story is spoiled with a loading screen.Despite the harsh rules of the world that George Miller created with his films, I didn't feel like Max handing over entire territories to Jeet, Gutgash, Pink Eye and Deep Friah was justified enough to run all these errands for them. Fully upgrading a stronghold provides you with all the necessities, but what's the point of upgrading all of them if you can just fast travel to the first one to restock? Is the player required to upgrade all strongholds in order to access Gastown? I just find it presumptuous when I have a map in front of me from the very start with these territories already divided among the four of them. It's not like you're going to stop seeing bad guys once the threat level in a territory is brought down to zero. The stakes aren't high enough for everyone involved and it's a relatively easy game with simple combat.The combat is fun and you'll get used to it very fast, especially when you've played other games with similar combat. The fun is extended to car combat as well and this is where I have to emphasize the importance of doing missions frequently, otherwise it will become a drag if you don't upgrade your car and weapons. That being said, scrap is everywhere and most of the upgrades can be acquired with scrap, so looting plays a big part in Mad Max, whether you like it or not. The most fun you can have looting is by taking on a camp, which are thankfully very different in design, number of enemies, etc.A part of me felt like I had to postpone a final mission most of the time, looking at the mission indicators that would appear on Deep Friar and right after on Gastown, mostly due to how they hyped up The Jaw and the territories being divided so distinctly. When seeing the indicators I was afraid that this was it, a fight with an army of vehicles and a big boss, which is why I cowered to looting and upgrading as often as I could. The game didn't even have to convince me of it, at first sight I thought The Jaw was the entrance to Gastown, but it was only the gate between the two halves of the map. Don't make the same mistake, you're perfectly safe to enter Gastown the first chance you get, as long as you can survive the trip over there.It's satisfying to explore a game world for the first time and recent years have given us great open world games. Mad Max is no different, but it's more closer to the Far Cry series, cos it has a lot to do with taking down camps or fortresses, if you like. It can be a barrel of fun in shorter bursts, but for me it's bogged down by several minor annoyances and missed opportunities. Despite it being a beautiful wasteland, with all it's limitations, they could've done a better job in making it more believable, starting with the friendly encounters. Nevertheless I recommend it, especially when you're an avid explorer and want to get more out of your aging PC or laptop.			"

												This is my first review on steam.  I don't write reviews becuase I am rarely pleased, let alone excited like I am with Mad Max.I have gotta hand it to the developers.  They did a great job making this game.  I have been playing for 32 hours so far and there hasn't been a single crash.  There has been the occansional slight stutter and drop below 60fps (according to FRAPS).  I am running WIN7-64 with a 3.4Ghz i7 with 32GB ram, RAID 10 SSD array, and dual AMD 290x's in crossfire(stock-clocked).  They are PCIEX 3.0 (one at 8x and the other at 4x, due to the RAID controller using the other 4 lanes)  I have a 4K monitor and I have everything set to MAXimum :-)I am very pleased with the gameplay and the performance.  I have been playing PC games as long as PCs have been around (Yes, I have some grey hair -- maybe more than *some*).  This is the first game in a long time (since DOOM 1.0 and early WOW) where I have been sucked in and immersed in the game.The overall experience, strategy and the pace of the game keep me coming back for more.  I find myself looking forward to playing and letting other responsiblitles slip in order to keep playing...I wish all of the last 10+ games I have purchased were even 1/3 as enjoyable as Mad Max.  I hope other publishers and developers learn from the Mad Max experience.I can't wait to see how things go now that the enemies and missions are getting tougher,..			"

												What an amazing game.I played like 60% of the story and it never got boring.Pro: -awesome grafics-great performance even on lower tier computers-absolutely love the screenshot function-great character customisation and upgrade possibilities-best ragdoll during stormsIt just makes a ton of fun jumping around in the dunes and ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" land mines out of the back of your car which looks like a hedgehog.Con: -pretty repetitive in terms of liberating all regions-map is sometimes bugged and you just can't open it which is really annoying because you cant fast travel / place markers-health is only regeneratable by drinking water and eating food which is sometimes hard to findConclusion In my opinion it's a really fun game if you are down for this whole ""wasteland"" setting. The car upgrading is made nicely, it does'nt take years until you got youre car on a decent level. The combat system is balanced and feels immersive. And the epic grafics make up a lot of the Cons for me.Definitely worth buying! "

												Mad Max The game follows loosely story of the new Mad Max Movie. Gameplay 8 of 10You play Max Rockatansky in a dystopian world full of not quite normal people. Collect metal scrap (the new currency) to update your car, a hideout or climb the skill tree that is available for Max. Fight your way through hordes of enemies, either with your shotgun or barehanded. The combat system is a little like the one from the Batman Arkham series. So a little simple, but works quite good for me. And it feels somehow a lot more realistic than in Batman. Infiltrate hangouts, race wild sand races against some quite tough opponents, do little side-missions, collect relicts of the past...and so on.Graphics     9 of 10I LOVE it! From the sandy dunes with the beautiful sunsets to the starry bluish nights. Absolutely amazing. My friend is playing it on a 4K tv screen and it's just amazing .The footprints in the sand, the incredible storms, the water. BIG thumbs up. And I might say it’s graphical wise quite a competitor for Fallout 4.Music          8.5 of 10 The music is generally quite soothing and somber. Very fitting for this post-apocalyptic world.The part where it really shines is the sound of the car engines. You really feel the V8 engine roaring. Final Verdict 8.5 of 10 A great game based on a movie. The graphics, the music and the gameplay form an overall nearly perfect game. Why nearly? Sometimes the fighting is a little repetitive and the taking of the hideout as well and the story is not that breathtaking. Still I strongly recommend it. Rarely has any games atmosphere sucked me in that much.			"

Great work.I complete the game at 100% and for me it was a very good experience, never getting bored.The game isn't just driving fights around wastelands, but also a lot of ground combat sections and exploration.Good variety of side missions, could be a little more, the map is very large, and although the locations may look the same, it offers a good variety of places.I suggest to buy it when your price idea will be ok.Your library cant miss this game.8/10			"

												Mad Max is probably the single most, 'I'll just do one more mission - still playing many hours later' game ever. Time vanishes. What you thought was maybe forty-five minutes, was four hours. I think part of the reasoning behind this is because it's repetitive in every way. I am surprised it doesn't get more criticism for this. Everywhere just about looks the same. The camps which you clear are all similar. Scavenging destinations are all similar.The really only parts that are not all similar are the main missions. However there are not many of those.Mad Max has other issues too. The engine-exhaust noise of the car is diabolical. I wear headphones and it screams albeit mid pitched (not high pitched) almost all the way through. I play on speakers too and it's as bad. Only later when you get the V8 engine is car noise acceptable.It is unfortunately nothing more than a long grind, and is possibly the grinder of all grinders. Salvage scrap, unlock upgrades, use scrap as currency to upgrade. From start to finish that is all you do. It has plus points. It often looks good. Bosses are all the same technique: wait for charge, dodge, attack for a bit; repeat. In other words there is no googling every boss encounter because you can't work out what to do. Gameplay is straight-forward. In fact all the gameplay is relatively easy. It's filled out by there simply being masses of it.Although I mark it 7/10 I could not in all honesty say to a friend, ""You must buy Mad Max"". Meaning no recommendation. However if you are fully aware of its format, you will have fun maybe half the time playing it.			"

												9/10I, like many others, was poised to be disappointed by Mad Max.  The ridiculous pre-order deals (I got it for 36 dollars at GMG), and the publisher connection to the recent Arkham Knight debacle had me worried I'd wasted my money.  I've never been so wrong.  This game is:1.  Fully functional from the start.  No stuttering, no texture pop-in, no frame-rate cap or issues, no glitches or bugs.  The optimization is the best I've ever seen for a AAA launch title - I was able to play at reasonable FPS at 4k with one GTX 970.2.  Achingly beautiful.  I said I was able to play at 4k, but I didn't have to because the game is so perfectly crafted that it looks suitable photorealistic and jawdropping even at 1080p.   Special emphasis on the lighting, shadows and particle effects (the explosions are phenomenal).3.  Raging fun.  The melee combat is smoother, harder, and way more engaging than in Batman: Arkham.  It requires attention and quick reflexes and feels intense and deeply powerful.  The sandbox world is massive and filled with violent activities.  The general goal of these can get repetitve towards the end of the game, but the devs did a marvelous job of making each and every location look and feel different to keep the excitiement to the MAX.  One issue here is that the boss fights at some of the camps are more or less identical.  There are four main strongholds that can be upgraded and expanded through what are essentially fetch quests, but still just as fun and varied as the story missions.   By far the best part of the game is the vehicle combat, analogous to the recent cinematic masterpiece Mad Max: Fury Road.  Along with random open-world encounters, there are convoys around the game world and you take them on singlehandedly using not only your car as a weapon but shotguns, harpoons, thunderpoons (grenade harpoons), and flamethrowers.  These convoy battles  get progressively more intense as the game progresses, and are a highlight of the playthrough. 4. All about the cars. They could've totally screwed it up and made a Mad Max game where the cars were a sideshow.  They did not.  Basically the entire plot centers on Max's desire to be reunited with his Interceptor, and in the meantime to build the most outrageous war machine possible with the help of his master mechanic hunchback companion Chumbucket.  Throughout the game you upgrade your car (The Magnum Opus) with body styles, engines, suspension, tires, exhausts, armor, weapons, custom paint and ornaments.  You can also collect any car you find in the wasteland for further use.5,  A sonic experience.  The car sounds are gloriously rabid, and each engine and exhaust mod makes your Magnum Opus all the more ferocious.  Play it in 7.1 surround and the vehicle combat comes alive, with earblasting explosions and roaring v6 and v8 thunder.  Voice acting for the main characters is sublimely realistic and emotional; wish there were more Australians in it though.6.  An unsatisfying story.  For me, the ongoing love story between Max and his Interceptor was enough, but they added a few mediocre plot devices which were inconsequential and didn't improve the game at all.  May have been better without so much story.7. A true addition to the Mad Max canon. This is a faithful and yet inventive new venue for Max.  His character is portrayed just right, with minimal dialogue and just enough haunted memories to make us believe we're really Max Rockatansky.  Visually, he's a hybrid of Mel Gibson and Tom Hardy, and his upgradeable clothes and weapons are legit and very cool to use and look at.To conclude, I finished the main story at about 25 hours of play, I've put another 10 in so far to complete the car upgrades and clear out enemies from the world.  The average player will probably get 20-30 hours out of this, but being a massive fan of Mad Max I'm not even close to leaving yet.  I recommend it to both newcomers and fans of the series -  its an action sandbox tour-de-force.  Enjoy.I would buy at $40 or less.			"

												Did you like Tomb Raider? What about RAGE? And possibly Batman? If you like all of those three games then why are you even reading this...go get it NOW!!! This is a game with a likeness to all three IMO. It has the same look and feel to Tomb Raider with very similar game play experience. You have plenty of neat little underground worlds to explore and if you dont want to go underground then mix it up like the Wombles did and go overground too. Why not try driving up to some deserted places like a crashed plane or sunken boat or deserted train stations and trains in the hills or far out in the desert. The combat is very satisfying with excellent effects and even better noises and bone crunching sounds. Visuals are fantastic on a high end rig. It has the same satisfying RAGE effect when driving a car. As in, you can blow stuff up...a lot. There are some great little upgrades you can add to the Magnum Opus car. These include flames coming out the side, spikes on the body to prevent enemies jumping on and boarding, a powerful shotgun, harpoon and rocket launcher (in essence) and some normal body and engine upgrades. You can have so much fun with the harpoon pulling building structures down, ripping wheels off cars or ripping a man out of his car and dragging hi, around like a rag doll! Combat and sound is very similar to Batman and the way it feels. Overall this was such a surprise for me this year and is easily in my top 3 games only behind GTA V at the moment. Wonderful experience and I am still no way near complete with 40 hours of game play! 10/10			"

												Releasing a movie tie-in game usually goes one of two ways: either it’s a rush job thrown out with the movie to get some quick bucks, or the developer actually has the time it needs, regardless off the potential loss of income because of a later release date. Thankfully, Warner has allowed Avalanche the time to make a solid, vast open-world that is a lot more fun than the colour palette might suggest.And there is an enormous amount going on in Mad Max; just so many systems operating at once. You can upgrade Max, or his beloved car, The Magnum Opus, whenever you like from the pause menu with scavenged scrap (the currency that runs the world), but there are core abilities that you can only level up using tokens received from completing challenges. These are the important ones, really, as they increase things like Max’s strength, or health, or even how long a full tank of fuel might last. But you can only upgrade these at set locations. They’re not hidden and are on your map, but it’s a little odd to have a conceit like this in play when there are so many moments that flaunt how gamey it is.Take Max himself, for example. Once the car takes a certain amount of damage you’ll have to get out and wait while your companion, Chumbucket, fixes it up. But the enemies don’t care, and will keep coming at you. The AI here is quite smart (elsewhere they will expertly dodge you as you drive around engaging them), and will just try to drive right over you, but if you have a decent amount of health, you’ll stagger a bit but not die. After a few dodge rolls and a bit of running round in circles (get used to doing this, by the way), you can jump back into your ride and get moving, harpooning a Wastelander out of his car to certain death.These moments are as stupid as they are cathartic. The way you can take damage is obscene, but all is forgiven when you enter slow-motion, harpoon a guy right in the chest and tap circle to quickly pull him from his vehicle, whereby he whips towards you, which lets you ram him head-on. The harpoon gun is a triumph, and the most Avalanche thing here. Driving around firing it into sniper towers and pulling them down never gets old, and the sniper rifle mechanic is interesting, too. Rather than giving you a sniper to run around with like the shotgun you have, it’s fired from the back of your car. Chumbucket can drive the car for you (though you control it) and you can creep up to enemy bases, slowly picking off their snipers. Again, it never gets old.Thankfully the wasteland survival ideas are well implemented. Water is scarce, sure, but most of the time you’re in a situation where you’ll need to use it to heal, it’ll be some kind of stronghold (small or large) so there will be a tap, or pool to fill up your flask. Gas is needed to keep your vehicles running, but it takes a while to use it, and again, tanks can be found at populated areas. In a nice touch, you can put a spare canister in your boot just in case you run your tank dry, but you can also pick it up and throw it at enemies, exploding it with a shotgun burst.The combat is the Batman Arkham melee method that, quite honestly, I’m nowhere near tired of. Mad Max’s world is a brutal one, and although you can happily pummel away at combos with the square button, and counter with triangle, things are mixed up with the addition of unlockable extra moves. A particular good one (early on) is simply to hold the attack button after two hits for a strong finisher. You can pick up weapons and integrate them into your move-set, too, and if you’ve collected any shivs you can finish people with them. Or, should you buy the skill, you could just get in close for a shotgun to the gut – it’s a one-hit kill, obviously. It makes for a violent, bloody system that feels damn good.Car combat is less successful at first, but not bad. Depending on how upgraded your vehicle is, you can use the harpoon to differing degrees of success, but you can also target the red barrels in the trunks to quickly blow them up. On top of that, another option is to simply ram into your enemy – which has varying degrees of success depending again on what you’ve spent your scrap on. There’s a lot of car combat, though, and the slow motion aiming is a Godsend that removes most of the frustration. But you’ll have to get used to it, as you’re a sitting duck if you leave the Magnum Opus for too long.It’s a very a-typical open-world game, in many ways, but one that’s faithful to the source material, especially when it comes to the characters. Max is an utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ but a badass with it. No matter what people do to help, he’s never nice to them. You could argue that this is because of the harsh, barren world he inhabits – everyone here wants to kill you, or use you for a deal. But the character you warm to the quickest is Chumbucket, so it’s hard to hear Max continually abuse him with his negativity. The voice acting is fine, for the most part, but the downtrodden, gruff Max is a little hard to like. It’s a very comic-book like universe, and the people are designed to match: burnt skin, tattoos, and even one guy who has razors cut into his skin – I’m not sure if that’s for effect or so he can keep his face beard-free.What Mad Max does best, however, is never, ever take itself seriously. The opening cut-scene (which I won’t spoil, obviously) is over the top, but also features a gruesome chainsaw scene. As you take control for the first time and realise the person in that scene isn’t dead, you realise exactly what kind of game this is. There’s no logical reason how he can be alive after what you saw, but there it is, and he’s the main antagonist you’re fighting back against.The story is generally fine, but nothing special. Most main missions see you have to chase something down and take someone out, and although there’s an attempt to make you care now and then, it falls flat. The fun is to be had just exploring, maybe getting caught in a horrendous storm that nearly takes your life.Technically, there are a few frame-rate hiccups that are seemingly par for the course with open world games, but otherwise the only way Mad Max suffers is because of the source material. Fire, sand, metal – the trifecta of the world. You can’t blame Avalanche for keeping to that, but it does sometimes make for a bland looking game. There are some excellent moments, though, like those storms, or when night is setting in and it gets cold. Particle effects and explosions are fantastic, and there’s a real sense of style despite the brown look, especially when it comes to the gorgeous sky.Mad Max is a fun game. You’ll happily lose an hour or two here and there, and feel great about it Nobody quite does that open-world charm like Avalanche, and the harpoon never stops being a source of mirth. The combat is great, and if you’re after an open world third-person title, you could do a lot worse.Pros:Harpoon gun is brilliant.Visually stunning at times.On-foot combat is great.Cons:Story is a bit dull.Car combat won't be for everyone.My Rating: 7.5/10 "

												Mad Max is the dirty big trashy sister of the Mordor series, it plays very similar to Shadows of Mordor minus the Parkour, but that isn't really a bad thing.  The game itself plays mostly without any hitches,  I had a few minor issues and one random crash through-out the entire playthrough, whilst I wouldn't say this game is perfect by any means and does get repetitive after a while, but it is something worth playing if you enjoy post apocalyptic open world driving/fighting games. Personally, I would have liked to have more varition of the activities and more bases to conquer, but for the the price I paid it was a really good deal for the amount of time I've spent playing and enjoying the game.    Now, there are some points to be made here, the game does have glitches and bugs, especially with defense which sometimes significantly bugs requiring you to reset equipment to get the stat 'working' again,  and the cars handling sometimes is strange - very easy to spin-out or lose control of the car and crash into one immoveable object in a large open world...the game loves to do that for some reason.Because of the cars handling, I'd really recommend playing this on a gamepad, especially the driving portions of the game which make up a large part of the game.   Overall, I still recommend this game even though it has a few short-comings.			"

												Mad Max is my GOTY for 2015. It's a fantastic open-world action game and it's everything I hoped it would be. I would highly recommend it. Prior knowledge of Mad Max is nonessential.+ Extensive character and vehicle customization and upgrades.+ Vehicular and on-foot combat is fun, challenging and engaging.+ Solid amount of content and things to do. I was never bored while playing and I enjoyed all 35 hours of the game. + Fantastic art direction and visuals.+ Great breadth of enemies, both people and vehicular.+ Very well optimised like every Avalanche game up until this point. (Runs great at 1080p on High on my GTX 560).+ Story is quite good, although I have experienced better.- Voice acting in some encounters is rather poor but does not detract from the overall experience.

												Mad Max is a post-apocalyptic, open-world action game featuring Max, a man haunted by his past. Your goal is to travel across the Sands of Silence but to do so you’re going to have to build a new car capable of the long journey, after your trusty Black on Black is stolen by the Immortal Scrotus. Much to Max’s dismay, he can’t build this car alone and must enlist the help of several characters from across the Great White, including the trusty blackfinger, Chumbucket.Pros:-Definetly one of the best pc port's of 2015-A very complete game, well done throughout-Looks great, and runs well on low end machines-Simple but satisfying hand combat-Unique, intense vehicle combat-Solid Ending-Best explosions i've seen-Engine sounds-Chumbucket-No DLC nonsenseCons:-Somewhat slow progression system at start -Repetitive objectivesVerdict:A essential purchase, especially if its on sale.

 I was able to finish the main story on the lowest settings possible on these specs:      CPU: Intel Core i5 3210M     RAM: 8.00GB Dual-Channel DDR3      Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000                     2048MB ATI AMD Radeon HD 7600M Series  Plot  – First of all the game is not directly connected to the movie even though being released on the same year. Max’ ultimate quest is to reach the Plains of Silence, a fabled land where he might find solace from his madness. But instead, he finds himself getting his V8 Interceptor stolen by the War Boys of Scabrous Scrotus, Immortan Joe’s third psychotic son. With the help of Chumbucket, a blackfinger, Max embarks on a journey to get his vengeance and take back what is his.The main plot and some scenes may be predictable to some, or maybe even a cliché to at least. But it doesn’t mean it’s bad. In fact, I personally enjoy the story all throughout and I’m pretty satisfied with how the story went.  Gameplay  – The game showcases two types of gameplay. First off is when a vehicle, the gameplay is somehow similar to Vigilante or the Twisted Metal series. Though you have the option to use other faction vehicles, nothing is compared to what the Magnum Opus, your own vehicle, can offer you. Other than the harpoon, sniper rifle, and the thunderpoon, you also have the freedom to customize your vehicle the way you want it to. And it is actually balance and just. Not because you have all the high-tier upgrades, it doesn’t mean it’ll be the best vehicle out there. No. And that is actually great in my opinion. And the upgrades can actually be seen in the vehicle, you can style the Magnum Opus any way you want it.Second is when you’re on foot. If you have played any Batman Arkham games, you’ll most likely be familiar with how this game works out. And this is one of the most brutal games I may have played not just because of the blood, but because of what can Max do to his enemies. I’ve been hearing multiple cracked jaws and bones everytime I beat someone and it is very satisfying. I have mentioned that there are upgrades for your vehicle; well there are also multiple upgrades for Max to help him out in his fights.  Environment and Design  –  The whole map is huge, at least for me. To be honest, I am more than surprised to see how amazing the world is. Sure, in a rough glance the world may seem too flat or bland. But wait until you start exploring side quests and maybe just roaming around. There are lot of stuff to see in this game.  Controls  – I’ve played this game with a controller, I feel like it would be easier beating up enemies and driving the vehicles with a controller instead. For problems, I’m glad that I didn’t run into any major ones to ruin the game for me. Though there is a thing that may become annoying to some as you progress through the game. Most of the time, the game will require you to hold the interact button or key for you to take action. It gets annoying because you will be doing it a lot of times.  Conclusion  – I may have finished the story of this game, but there are still numerous areas undiscovered, many camps aren’t looted yet, many towers not yet taken down, some snipers are still hunting. If you’re interested in games that still offer something even when the main story is done, then this one deserves to be in your wishlist. Even with the fps that I’m getting, I really had fun playing this game. A fair warning to those with OCD, when you’re in a camp, the game will show you the total scraps there is in a specific camp or area. And guess what, I used YouTube twice on two different areas just so that I can achieve a 100% on that specific camp and move on to the next one.  "

												“Only the living and the dead now. No egos.”Mad Max is an imaginative action-packed open-world experience. It feeds on the mythology left behind by George Miller, and it successfully brings the Wasteland to gaming, both visually and spatially. Racing and race-battling has never been so dynamic and thrilling, and melee combat is as polished as a combo-oriented gameplay could deliver. The core of the quest design revolves around upgrading a ""mystical"" car named Magnum Opus, and delving into revenge against Scabrous Scrotus, the archenemy who initially assaults Max and his Interceptor, leaving the drifter for dead in the hot white desert. Thematically, pride and an apparent sense of dignity are still present in the narrative. Max refuses to eat “long pig” (basically, cooked human flesh), and instead feeds on maggots from human carcasses. Thirsty wanderers can be given precious water from the protagonist’s canteen, and a feeling of gratitude is promptly served. Stronghold upgrade projects raise the morale of the inhabitants, and their impression of Max. The Wasteland is represented as a place suited for brutality and survival, but also hope – albeit often romantically portrayed.As regards story and plotline, there is not much to be said. Well, if you are interested in everything Mad Max, you probably know that a complex and foregrounded chain of narratives is not the franchise’s emphasis (especially if considering the latest film). The game follows that premise. What it does offer is a myriad of apocalyptic motifs, from the re-domestication of nature, to the emptiness of Earth’s post-nuclear shell, to the nostalgic grief over a long-dead world. Such motifs could inspire much more immersion were it not for Max’s always-melodramatic lines when collectable pictures from before the fall pop up. Additionally, the figure of Scabrous Scrotus is forgettable at best, and just a sootier and bossier version of Rictus Erectus.  The final battle against him and his petrol-powered retinue is underwhelming, a poor attempt at reproducing the famous Mad Max ending road skirmishes that ends too quickly thanks to the almost indestructible state of late Magnum Opus and the surprisingly reduced amount of hostile vehicles. Apart from that, a few tragic plot twists, unique writing and dialogues, and creative cutscenes might somehow redeem some of these negative aspects in writing. Characters are often tragicomic representations of eschatological personalities: they are usually on the edge of their beliefs. A fume-induced sadist, a pyromaniacal prophet, a bloodthirsty tyrant, a delusional road rider. Hope and Glory show little promise from start, and never actually manage to entice any significance or emotional attachment from the player, even towards the end. Chumbucket’s permanent company may intimidate the player at first, but with some time, they will find that his persona is an inseparable part of the game, an inseparable part of Max’s quest. There were moments when I was driving along in an enemy car and caught myself missing his very personal remarks about the landscape, the Magnum Opus, the dangers around, about everything worth remarking about in the Wasteland. The rest of the characters are interesting and colourful individuals that show precisely how they have survived the wretched world for so long under those sorry conditions, exhibiting perfect doses of leadership, insanity, and sarcasm.There were some other wee things that I could not avoid feeling annoyed by: no matter how you approach the open world configuration of the game, you will never complete a task only once. Be ready to scavenge repeatedly, fight repeatedly, rescue and explode repeatedly. Repetition is not necessarily a compulsory aspect in the exploration of the map, and it may not be a problem for completionists, but it is there to fatten playthrough time. Also, ignore what the first shots of the game tell you about the scarcity of Max’s basic resources: there will be plenty of them, more than enough to get you by until the end. You will most probably never run out of water or fuel if you look decently enough. Scrap can be an annoyance, but only if spent away carelessly or if the urge to scavenge seldom arises during your gaming sessions. The structure of quest design is much standardised, oftentimes a list of identical objectives to be ticked off one by one across the available map, until the quest is finally over. Although this works in perfect unison with the background story of these quests, it does not help much to have that layout, considering the game’s already repetitive nature of open-world tasks. All these aforementioned things – good or bad – are not even close to expressing precisely how much fun I had playing Mad Max. Only when you hop in the Magnum Opus, build it up little by little, and scavenge the entirety of the massive game world, will you feel that the hours you spent were worth it. However, I have to warn those who are not fond of open-world ""collectathons"" to think twice and watch some vids before getting hold of this game.			"

												So far I am only about 10 hours into the game so I will update this as time goes on.I must first say: This is NOT a console port! (the PC version was made in house by Avalanche alongside the other versions)... AND... This is NOT a movie game! The game was being made before Fury Road was even in pre-production some 4+ years ago, with rumors of it being made going as far back as 2008. This is a ""Mad Max"" game, meant to be its own thing in the ""Mad Max"" universe.This is how you do new game I.P.A mix of ""Burnout"" racing and ""Twisted Metal"" meets ""Carmageddon"", with ""Batman Arkham"" fighting, ""Shadows of Mordor"" multiple approaches, and ""Just Cause"" series open world fun, all in a post apocalyptic setting.This is an ACTUAL open world game! Not like GTA V was where you had the ""illusion"" of an open world until you did a mission and they only allowed you to do a mission in a certain way and you would fail if you did it any other way than how it told you to. Nope, in this game you get an objective and can accomplish that objective in any way you want (within the limitations of the terrain of course). You want to sneak into an enemy camp the back way and take them off guard? Go ahead... You want to snipe the camp from a mile away? Go ahead... You want to crash your car through the front gate and blow up everything in sight? Go ahead.Oh yeah, this is the first game in a long time that doesn't have ""regenerating health"" so you actually have to watch your health and start to worry when you have run out of ways to replenish it... Now it can be annoying at times, but it adds certain urgency to fights and exploration much like older games did back in the old ""med kit"" days, and it really fits with the Mad Max setting.I love the upgrade and customization system. Pretty much everything can be upgraded or customized, character armor, character stats/perks, main car ""Magnum Opus"", weapons, and allied bases/forts. I have to mention the car upgrades! I absolutely love the way Avalanche did this! Instead of just having incremental upgrades where the best car is always the end game fully upgraded car, all vehicle upgrades have benefits and drawbacks, so if you want a light and fast car you have to go with less armor, or if you want a tank of a car you will have a slower car. You can build the main car ""Magnum Opus"" any way you like to fit your play style.You don't even have to be a fan of the Mad Max movies to get into this game since this is NOT actually a ""Movie Game"" but more a game somewhat based on a Movie franchise, considering this game was in devlopment long before ""Fury Road"" was made, and George Miller actually helped with the initial outline of the game.And the writing is spot on! It actually creates characters I can care about, gives them their own personalities instead of the usual ""un-interesting NPC #20"". Lot of little bits and stories out in the wasteland to add a much needed depth to the game world, and I can't help feeling this is like a post apocalyptic ""Red Dead Redemption"" at times, and that is a good thing for me!.Speaking of the game world... All I can really justify is ""WOAH! Holy crap!"" If you like exploring, or taking screen shots, or games that are so amazingly detailed that you actually stop to admire the scenery, then Avalanche studios has done it again! They even included a photo mode... My screenshot folder is quickly filling up.I have been having so much fun just driving around and exploring that I have not used the fast travel feature at all.As for technical issues... This is one of the most bug-free, completely optimized, good looking, smooth running, Max settings running above 60fps stable releases, I have seen for the PC in a LOOOOOONG time!*****EDIT*****FInally beat the main story and side quests at about 30 hours. (there is still tons to do and explore even after finishing the main and side stuff) I wish it was longer because, well, I was really into this game and didn't want it to end (seriously Avalance, give us more areas and cars and upgrades! Add the Citidel and Bulletfarm and Bartertown please!). I'm already going to do another playthrough. And the ending! OMFG! This game IS Mad Max!I LOVE IT!This is one my new favorite games of all time!What a game! What a lovely game! Witness me! Optimized, shiny, and chrome!			"

												After playing for 30 hours, Mad Max is everything I hoped it would be and then some. That being said, I have a hard time understanding why reviews have ranged from the 5 to 8.4 range. 96% positive reviews on Steam means gamers have spoken for themselves. With a cool combination of Fallout, Borderlands, Far Cry, and Just Cause, Mad Max has stunning visuals, engaging combat in-car and on foot, and a great variety of characters. While I haven't found the story particularly enthralling, it is still fun. The open-world environment, however, is where this game truly excels. As I head towards an objective, I frequently find myself distracted doing other things, such as disarming a minefield with my trusty dog Dinki-Di, clearing out a camp, or being ambushed by a group of enemy vehicles. It is these types of fun distractions that make Mad Max shine. Everything in this game is upgradeable. Fortresses can be upgraded to give Max refillls on Fuel, Ammo, Water, and Health. The Magnum Opus has millions of possible combinations, from colors and insignia to the body, to engines and other parts. These upgrades make a noticeable difference to the feeling of driving the car, as well as to the way it actually sounds. Max himself can be upgraded in two ways: by visiting Griffa to enhance health or a variety of other attributes, or by adding armor, etc. that gives Max a boost in combat.I have not found the bleak, postapocalyptic landscape to be repetetive or dull. The graphics are extremely high quality, espcially with Nvidia SLI and AMD Crossfire support right out of the box. The sky and weather visuals are fantastic, especially when a tornado or huge sandstorm occur. Additionally, these storms never seem to be the same, with some looking like the lightning/tornado from Fury Road while others look like a sever haboob in New Mexico.There are some things I have not enjoyed about the game, and which I feel should have been included right out of the box. Despite his reputation as a road warrior, Max is not able to jump over simple obstacles. While he can jump, he will often need to find the predetermined route into a stronghold, generally marked by yellow paint. Something else that has bothered me is the low quality of graphics in Jeet's stronghold. Avalanche seems to be going for a rising heat effect, but the result is blurry textures. Despite these flaws, the game is still very satisfying.Driving is an absolute pleasure. As you upgrade your Magnum Opus, you won't want to fully upgrade everything. Putting a heavy ramming bar or armor on your car, for example, will lower your acceleration and handling, making the car less nimble. Upgrading your engine, tires, or suspension will have the opposite effect.Hand-to-hand combat is both gritty and brutal, with Max using objects in the environment to beat his opponents to a pulp. Fans of the Arkham series will be familiar with the controls, but the combat still has a unique feel to it. Anyone can button mash their way through this game, but there are huge rewards for using the special combo moves available to max. Players who take the time to learn and practice these will find their satisfaction with the combat increases greatly. Additionally, Max can build up a fury meter to unleash Fury Mode, which greatly enhances his attacks and allows for special Fury finishes.Mad Max doesn't break any new ground in the saturated open-world genre, but it is a rich, immersive game with fantastic graphics and satisfying combat. Reviews have been quite varied, but if you are looking for a new game to play, listen to the gamers themselves and pick up a copy of Mad Max for PC.Verdict: 8.9/10 A few flaws diminish the experience somewhat, but this is still a AAA title worth investing many hours into.

												I started off playing this game with a lot of suspicion.Due to the fact it's barely been marketed, I assumed it wasn't going to be anywhere near ""fun"". Turns out I was wrong, thankfully.Let's start off with the story; I've always thought that the Mad Max franchise would work best as a videogame, it just has that ""weirdness"" and exaggeration that you only find in popular game franchises. This game certainly proves--to me at least--that I was right in this belief.You play as Max (obviously), a guy who has some mental issues (though not really hinted of much). In the first hour or so, your car gets stolen and you are left for dead. Thankfully, you come across a ""Black Finger"" (mechanic) called Chumbucket. He's a little weird, to the point of sounding like a religious nut towards Max and the car, he even makes one liners towards... urhh... 'romantically' loving the car!Anyway with Chum's help, you set out to seek revenge and take your car back. The whole storyline is pretty much ""We need a V8 engine to proceed"". While it's simplistic, it works fine. Let's just say that the ending is quite obvious though.The fighting system is pretty much what you'd expect in this day and age from an ""open world"" action game. It's very much a Batman Arkham system, though not quite as refined (more realistic, for example you're not jumping around the screen to keep your combo going). I had some rare instances that it wouldn't even register my key presses (using a gamepad).There's not much else to say about it, it's pretty much as you'd expect from such fighting systems now days.It's the car that is the hook here.Using the various upgrades available, you can customise both the functionality and cosmetics of your vehicle. Like to go at high speed straight into people? Focus on acceleration, top speed and your ram. Like to get close? Make sure to get spikes to help prevent boarders.While there isn't a massive amount of upgrades, it's still enough to keep most people interested. Vehiclar 'fights' are quite fun, much more so than the repetitive Batman Arkham fighing anyway.The area you're in is a very, and I mean VERY, large section of desert.It would take you anything up to 10-15 minutes to drive from the furthest points, depending on your vehicle's upgrades. Doesn't hurt that the game is somewhat nice looking too.It has the 'Sync Points' that the Assassin's Creed franchise introduced, but with a twist. Enter a balloon and slowly assend. Now instead of just seeing a cutscene and that's it, you have to find everything with your binoculars. It's an interesting mini-game at first, but soon loses it's welcome.To unlock upgrades for your car, you need to affect each territory's THREAT level. This is done in much the same way Just Cause 2 did; take over camps and destroy stuff. In this case, you're killing snipers, finding and defusing landmines and bringing down 'scarecrow towers'.There's 3 territories, plus a no-man's land. Each territory has it's own set of the above things. A couple upgrades require to complete side missions too.In each territory, you have a 'stronghold'. Do side missions and collect required 'parts' to unlock projects. I'd suggest to always build the Cleanup Crew projects as soon as you possibly can. It's a godsend! Projects include health, ammo and water (which is like your 'medipack') refills.You upgrade Max in very much the same way as the car.Instead of territory THREAT levels, however, it's your 'rank' that unlocks items. Right off the bat, you should purchase the crowbar; it's required for a lot of looting. You can even get Max to grow a beard, if you're into that.Scrap is everything in Mad Max, so make sure to loot destroyed vehicles (Cleanup Crew project is useful for this) and camps whenever you can.You'll need scrap to level up Max, the car and fully upgrade your Strongholds.Lastly, do not rush through the main story.You likely will not enjoy your time playing if you do; instead try and work towards uprading Max and the car as much as possible before moving onto the next territory. Various story missions require you to grind anyway, so you may as well do so between missions!Mad Max is a game I'd recommend to both fans and non-fans of the franchise alike.You don't really need to know anything about the franchise due to this game being a standalone from both the original and recent reboot of the movies.HOWEVER, I'd suggest you wait until a sale of 30% off or more before purchasing due to it's repetitive nature.

												Okay, so lets get this out of the way to start with, yes, this game is a huge collection of fetch quests, however, it's what you do while fetching that makes this game so much fun.A solid fighting mechanic, excellent driving combat, a great story and interesting characters in a nice open sandbox world.Lots to find, upgrage and generally do, this game will keep you occupied for a good while if you decide to do the side quests, if you just want to blast through the main game (why would you want to do that?) then the game is considerably shorter.

												Well i beat the game and it only took me 42 hours ( Did not bother much with Death runs, because meh, but i visited every location). I have to say it was very enjoyable and awesome since you get classic Max's gear after you complete the game. The car combat was great, but the thunderstick tended to make this boring, once its fully upgraded and you one shot everything xD.If i had to rate Mad Max, i would give it a 9/10, because at some areas it got stale, mostly being too OP and running around the wasteland with fully upgraded Thunderpoons. The storyline was great and can't wait for DLC to addon.			"

tl;dr -> I have Fury Road's ""Escape"" and ""Brothers in Arms"" looped while I play. 11/10 I am the Road Warrior, the Wasteland Batman, the Chosen One.Note: Link to my full review[theroguereviews.com] because I hit the word limit here.I have always been a lover of post-apocalyptic themes in both games and movies, and I was extremely excited to learn about the Mad Max open-world adventure game - especially after being a fan of the entire Mad Max franchise (Road Warrior is second only to Fury Road for me). The gameplay looked a lot like the styles seen in games like Assassin's Creed (AC) and Batman Arkham, series that I absolutely adore. I was and continue to be thoroughly satisfied with my gameplay experience.If you enjoy open-world action and adventure, RPG elements, intense car combat, post-apocalyptic themes, gritty visuals, and the Mad Max franchise (especially Fury Road), then you will love this game.For full disclosure: my top game of 2014 was Middle: Earth-Shadow of Mordor (SoM), and while I will readily agree that there are much better quality and more in-depth alternatives available, I found SoM to be the most fun; it truly captured the essence of why I enjoy playing games and losing myself to immersion. Mad Max is very similar to SoM for me, in terms of fun factor and enjoyment. I completely understand that people may not like games like this - finding them too repetitive - however, I will do my best to provide an accurate and fair representation of the gameplay you can expect to encounter if you buy and play this title; but please keep in mind that I may still be biased in my review. I would also like to quickly point out that this game is NOT a simple copy-and-paste (or ""reskin"") of games that I have previously mentioned - such games are definitely formulaic, yes, but they are not direct copy-and-paste titles.The aesthetics are fantastic - the amount of detail in the environment, character/car models, and special effects is extremely high. Optimization is amazing (so long as your drivers are up-to-date), ensuring that you are receiving the best possible performance while you play (admittedly, I was a bit worried about this PC port following the poor launch of Arkham Knight). The special effects are beautiful - car explosions are massive and bright with pretty fire (moving close to fires will cause the world color to take on a more orange hue), the lighting and shadow effects are realistic (the glare off of your car lights at night time is a sight to behold), and storms are majestic (I implore you to brave a journey into the heart of one once you have a stronger Magnum Opus). The music and sounds are great, however, do not expect to hear any of the tracks from Fury Road (sorry, no ""Escape"" or ""Brothers in Arms"" playing while you fight off enemies); the game's soundtrack is still very good. Following the lore established by Mad Max: Fury Road, the story is interesting and engaging - although nothing too special (much like Shadow of Mordor); I will admit that a few times I have skipped cutscenes and/or ignored dialogue.Controls are not difficult to familiarize yourself with, especially if you use a gamepad and have played game series like Assassin's Creed or Batman Arkham. Unfortunately, you cannot rebind the controller keys, and you can only remap a limited amount of actions on the keyboard - this is definitely something that could have been improved for player convenience. As a result, you cannot easily call up the keyboard controls - in fact, I had to check the discussion boards to find out how to bring up the full map (on the keyboard, it is ""Tab;"" I thought it was ""M""). There is a series of tutorial missions that will quickly get you accustomed to the gameplay. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with open-world adventure games in this vein. You will encounter difficulty with mid-to-late-game main missions if you are not exploring and completing side objectives - this is the ""grinding"" aspect of the game that helps you build experience and obtain upgrades. This element is seen in other games like the Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham series (as well as Shadow of Mordor), so if you do not enjoy that style of gameplay, you will probably be dissatisfied with Mad Max. The ""boss"" fights are fairly easy, especially if you are keeping up with your character/car upgrades.Gameplay consists of you roaming the wasteland, with your final destination requiring you to first stop by Gastown. The road to Gastown is a brutal, dangerous one, so you will have to first gain more experience and upgrades in neighbouring territories, which are each ruled by leaders that you will meet and help. Each territory is split into smaller pieces and littered with different landmarks like enemy outposts/camps, scavenging areas (for delicious loot), and race meets. Balloons in each territory can be taken into the air to mark important areas, as well as reveal the surrounding land in your map (this is similar to climbing the tall vantage points in SoM and AC). If you do activities that directly affect the enemy - like liberating camps or disarming minefields (the latter being extremely boring) - it will reduce the ""threat"" level of the entire territory. Reducing threat ratings will result in decreased enemy patrol frequency and presence, making your travel time through the area quicker and less painful.Main missions progress the story, usually unlocking more of the map and allowing you to obtain better upgrades for your Magnum Opus (your beloved car). In contrast, upgrades for Max are tied to your ""Legend"" rank, which is increased by doing mostly anything - like destroying enemy vehicles with your shotgun, achieving high combo chains, or killing x amount of enemies; there is no actual ""experience points"" system. Whenever you complete these ""challenges,"" you will obtain a token that can be exchanged for an ability point, thus allowing you to level up. Each Legend rank (the top being ""Road Warrior"") is composed of multiple sub-levels, and obtaining a new one will grant you more upgrades for Max like appearance, ammo capacity, and physical damage (all accompanied by nice aesthetics). Combat is extremely fluid and responsive, albeit quite easy (as is the case in most of Warner Brothers' open-world action-adventure games) because of the counter prompt that appears over the heads of enemies about to attack. Something that balances the ease of countering/parrying is how the button input works - you cannot simply mash the attack button because each attack is a commitment, so if you are already doing an attack animation, countering will probably not work (encouraging you to be patient with your commands). Furthermore, countering right before an attack lands will execute a ""perfect parry,"" which will help build your combos faster and even allow you to disarm an opponent's weapon (further enhanced by Max's ability upgrades). ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

												At the beginning I have to admit that Mad Max is very stereotypical game, contains a few unimportant bugs, the plot is not the best (but not the worst) and unfortunately the potential has not been excavated to the maximum which this open-world game totaly deserves.But, you know what.. Let me introduce you seven fundamental reasons why the game forces you to play it!1. Optimalization. What a perfect optimalization! ... forget on Batman´s epic fail. On the highest settings the game runs like a Swiss watch. Many thanks to Avalanche studios for really good job.2. Wasteland. What a atmospheric wasteland! ... really big, really large and variable. 3. Details. What a impressive details! ... fortresses, various locations, points of interests and more.4. Sandstorms. What a real sandstorms!... I can´t remember better processed video games sandstorms. Maybe in Spec Ops: The Line, but in Mad Max sandstorm appears randomly in two variants.5. Ride. What a rough ride! ... feeling of riding is really enjoyable. Not only in Magnum Opus.6. Combat system. What a brutal combat system! ... simple but effective. You know his older and better brother from Arkham series.7. Visualization. What a sexy visualization! ... nice graphics, effects of explosions, mentioned locations. After 15 hours of gameplay, Mad Max caught a second wind, gets momentum and simply will not let you go. Despite the fact you´re doing the same thing all the time.I´d like to support devs by purchase upcoming Just Casuse 3. They deserved it in times of terrible console ports.

												8/10Short comment/Kurzkommentar/一言感想EN/ A successful open world game in the Mad Max universe. To survive, you will steal anything you can need from your enemies, kill them, and if necessary, you will eat maggots of their corps to survive. Law and rules are invalidated in this world. Those who wants to survive, will need a strong Will, and a highly customized car. Shoot on enemy vechicles with rockets (not realy a rocket), fish the enemy driver out of his vechicle with a wired harpune, etc..., there are plenty of ways to finish them off. It will also happen a lot that you will have to fight with your fists. In fact, Max is the good guy in this world, but it feels like that he is the baddest guy around... If you like opne world games with racing elements and a lot of explosions, then Mad Max won't be a bad choice at least.DE/ Ein gelungenes Open World Spiel im Mad Max Universum. Zum überleben stiehlt Max von seinen Gegnern alles was er so gebrauchen kann, tötet sie, und ggf. isst er Maden aus deren Leichen um zu überleben. Gesetze und Regeln sind in dieser Welt außer Kraft gesetzt. Wer überleben will, braucht einen starken Willen, und ein aufgemotztes Auto. Schieß die gegnerischen Fahrzeuge mit Raketen (ist zwar nicht 100% akkurat) ab, oder angel den gegnerischen Fahrer einfach mit einer Seil-Harpune aus seinem Fahrzeug, oder oder oder, es gibt so viel Möglichkeiten die gegner außer Gefecht zu setzen. Es kommt auch sehr häufig vor dass du mit deinen Fäusten zuschlagen musst. Eigentlich ist Max ja der gute in dieser Welt, aber irgendwie ist er auch der bösartigste.... Wer Open World Spiele mit Rennelementen und vielen Explosionen mag, macht mit Mad Max zumindest nichts falsch.JP/ マッドマックスの世界観を舞台にした中々に出来の良いオープンワールドゲーム。生き残るために主人公のマックスは敵さんから使えるものは全て頂戴し、そして殺し、はたまた必要であれば敵さんの死体に湧くウジ虫を食べたりもする。法やルールといったものはもはや存在しないこの世界。この世界で生き残るには強い意志と、ハイレベルに改造された車が必要となる。敵をロケット（紛い物だがｗ）で撃ったり、敵ドライバーを縄銛で車から引きずり下ろす等々・・、敵さんを倒す方法はそれなりにあります。拳だけを頼りに敵と殴り合わないといけない場面もかなり用意されています。本来主人公のマックスがこの世界のいいやつ役なんだろうが、場合によってはこの世界で最凶最悪の男にも見えてしまう。本来オープンワールドのゲームが好きで、それに加えレースや大量の爆発といった要素が好きな方であれば、マッドマックスを購入することにより損をすることはないと思う。Pro/良い点+Good graphics/グラが良い。+Large open world/広大なオープンワールド+Can be obtained relatively cheap/比較的安く手に入る。+A lot of different ways to fight with your car/車を使った戦闘で多様な戦い方が出来る。Con/悪い点-Relatively repeatative missions/比較的似たミッションの繰り返しが多い。-No coop or multi player/コープやマルチプレイが出来ない。-The main story is rather short. The game lives from the side quests/本編は比較的短く、サイドミッションに生かされてる印象。Example for In-game performance/パフォーマンス例Win10 64bitGTX 1070i7-6700k16GB DDR4 RAMAt 1080p, max setting: FPS 120 - 144. Most of the time constant 144. (144hz monitor)At 4k DRS, max settings: FPS 50 - 70It uses round about 33GB of your SSD/HDD space.			"

""I'm not crazy... I'm just mad""═══════════════════════════════════Mad Max, the critically acclaimed movie franchise, now has it's very own video game, and it's a really good one too!Mad Max is a post-apocalyptic action-adventure game, with a heavy emphasis on vehicular combat, in which the player takes on the role of eponymous character Mad Max═══════════════════════════════════Short SummaryNow, when you first think about Movie-Based video games, they're often not that good (Rambo for instance. good god that was a trainwreck). But Mad Max is nothing like that. Mad Max is an absolute gorgeous game, let alone it's optimazation is great aswell, the combat is extremly fun and the driving's fun and action packed. So witout further ado, let's review this bad boy!Pros: Story is great, immersive and really lurs you in, as Max is on his journey to find his beloved car and to find some solace.The charachters are really in depth, and has their own stories and journeys.Cutscenes are well made The game's gorgeous, one of the best Wastelands i've seen in a videogame. This game is like a mashup between Fallout (Exploring locations and scavenging for supplies) and Sleeping Dogs (Same combat system, and there's an emphasis on car-to-car vehicular combat.) Lots of customisation available, starting from Max's armor and jacket, to his haircut and facial hair. there's also an incredible range customisations available for the Magnum Opus, max's signature car along the game. Great SFX and voice acting, really gives that atmospheric feeling to it. You won't run out of thing to do! there's  alot  of activities and side quests to do. Combat system is really simple and great. Well made upgrade system. you can shoot ROCKETS FROM YOUR CAR!Cons: What would seem like a big surprise for a game that is so focused about driving and cars, there's no handbrake!The ending is really anticlimatic and short, and it just sums the whole fantastic story really badly (in my opinion of course). glitches oftenly occure, although most of them are minor and not that big of a deal.So, the final rating i give for Mad Max is -  9/10 For me, Mad Max is one of the best, funnest games i've played and is on my Top 5 Games of 2015.Heavily recommended, especially when it goes on sale for  20$ .

												Mad Max at its best. It's an open world action-adventure with all pros and cons that comes with it. Basically GTA in post apocalyptic world. You get most fun out of the game when doing just main quest and few extras. That should take around 20 hours. If you do more side quests, it will get repetitive and thus boring.Pros:- good graphic with some nice vistas- perfect artistic style for this kind of game- strong atmosphere- story mission Big Chief ~ it has it all (intro cut scene, GasTown race, Thunderdome - Two men enter, one man leaves.)- main characters ~ true to the MM universe with interesting backgrounds- for completionist there is pile of things to doCons:- if you stray a lot it will get repetitive fast- car physics could have used more physic- hand to hand combat is nothing special- there is that women in the story twist that you should care for. But game does nothing for me to rly care. I met her for like 3 missons.Recommended for all and must play for Mad Max fans.8/10			"

												After managing to purchase for only £10.45 instead of the £34.99 pricetag and muddling through the graphical settings to fix the slowmo this game has been a delight. Guns, demolitions, Batman style fighting dynamics, a friendly dog, an overactive hunchback, sarcastic enemies, hugely upgradable vehicles driven at break-neck speeds over a post apocalyptical and beautifully rendered landscape, unbeleivable weather dynamics, an accurate starry night sky and the delight of dropping too far to twist your ankle and hobble for a few steps before regaining focus, are all part of the wonder that is this game. Add to the the graphical delight and DaVinci styled perfection to watch we have what is 500% better than the new movie was and takes us back to the wonder that was the original Mad Max movies within a modern timeframe. Purchase it when on sale or from another cheaper reputable vendor as the full price is a little rich. Otherwise 7 thumbs up.			"

												Mad Max is a very good port (a port nontheless, so controls feel a little bit clumsy sometimes). It contains rather a lot of grinding if you're an achievement hunter, but it's not required when playing through the main story. The plot isn't original but it is very clear it was built on the climate of the original movies, which helps the game a lot. It's depressing, it's heavy and it makes you mad. So very mad. Especially the ending.Totally worth those few euros/pounds, especially if discounted.			"

												TL;DR - 2015's Game of the YearI'll start by saying that I knew nothing about Mad Max before jumping into this game. From what I can tell, I didn't have to. I didn't plan on focusing on the story anyway because I was purely looking for gameplay. Holy ♥♥♥♥, did it deliver. If you thought Rockstar put a lot of detail into GTA V....Avalanche put more thought and care into this game than Rockstar could ever dream of. (for example, when you're looting an area it will tell you when everything has been looted and if you're missing anything. As someone who plays games to find EVERYTHING, this made me very happy). First off, it's an amazing port (as long as you have updated drivers) aside from the menu controls on keyboard/mouse. They seem to have their querks, but it's nothing too bad. It performs great and I only encountered one crash and that's because my drivers weren't updated. The audio struggles a bit on Windows 10, but it's nothing major at all. The combat is very Arkham-ish but that's okay with me because it works and it feels good. I personally didn't even expect hand-to-hand combat, but there you go. The driving will take some getting used to; at least until you get your car upgraded and then the car handles beautifully. The vehicle combat can be a bit tricky early on, but here's a tip - level your harpoon as often as you can. You'll use that more than anything else (at least I do). There's plenty of map to explore, too. At the time of writing this review, I'm almost 9 hours into the game and I have only done roughly 4-5 story missions. To conclude, this game is beautiful and you should get it at all costs. My only problem is that Warner Bros. were involved with this game...but thank you, Avalanche, for another great title that IS NOT broken. I'm looking at you, Arkham Knight...			"

The graphics are beautiful,  but driving in this game is less painful as driving the ""Batmobile"" on Arkham Knight and much more fun. The combat system isn't exectly the same as Batman Arkham series, but it's clear based on it with some tweaks as the timing necessary to do a counter attack, smashing the triangle button won't do the trick. That's it MAD MAX is a lot of fun and a hell of ride.			"

The sound of motors fading in and out in the distance, a zealous hunchback rambling on in the back seat of my all important four-wheeled conveyance. I wait for the sun to go down over the course of minutes, pondering the vast wasteland before me. It’s a quiet and peaceful moment, which is striking in a game filled with screaming war boys and magnificent explosions. Sometimes the best parts of an open world game come between missions, when the mechanics and controls fade away and you are just in a new place beautifully rendered before you. Mad Max has its flaws, but its wastes are highly suited for wandering the roads in search of excitement, and the game does a great job of gradually making the player understand the titular road warrior.Want to know more?

												Combine the following for Mad Max:1 part Grand Theft Auto1 part Fallout2 parts Just Cause1 part Batman: Arkham Asylum1 part Borderlands1 part Elder ScrollsI've got over 20 hours into this game already, have completed around 30% of it, I've completed the game, and have decided to write recommending review because it has been an absolute blast to play.The game starts off a little slow, but the variety of environments, the enjoyable and satisfying combat (vehicular and on foot), and the Fury Road situations and lore make me loathe having to turn the game off for the night.  The game runs like a dream (and my computer is below the recommended specs), the explosions and visuals look incredible, and the sound effects are amazing.  Jumping in the Magnum Opus, firing up the engine, and slamming on the gas is enough to give you an adrenaline rush worthy of a War Boy.They really put a lot of thought into this title.WITNESS ME!  9/10			"

												It is a hell of a ride. The game is definitely more than the sum of its parts, and it can be pretty rough in some parts, but man, what a damn ride.The game's on foot combat is pretty much just doing a Batman/Sleeping Dogs thing. Not as fluid as either, and somehow less brutal than Sleeping Dogs's. It gets old. There are nice ways to avoid it, since  the shotgun is pretty much a ""end this fight"" button,  and while the ammo for it is plentiful, it is scarce enough that you are encouraged to save it for  big fights. It is always great to reenact the swordfightning scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but just like in that movie, you can run out of projectiles at the worst possible moment. The driving is a VERY big part of the game, as it should be, since this is Mad Max we are talking about. The environments are pretty distinct  from each other, which makes travelling a pleasure. The bad part comes that for the  optional races, you generally get to use a completely different car that handles unlike your custom rig, and it gets a bit hard due to not being used to the handling of  the race cars. 	Vehicle variety also suffers, since it feels like the factions each have the same cars, but with cosmetic differences.The convoys start as an interesting activity, trying to replicate the feel of the chase sequences on the films, but unfortunately they fall flat after a while, since the experience is repeated over and over, though it gets easier when you get more tools at your disposal.Funnily enough, the closest I had  to a chase sequence from the movies was in an optional ""wasteland mission"", where you have to drive a big, slow  truck with resources to a relatively far away point. That felt a bit like the final chase from the Road Warrior, but not quite the same, obviously. Apparently, if you reduce that area's danger level, there would be very few enemy encounters in that mission, which is an interesting detail, there were scripted pursuers  AND ones drawn dynamically from the regular area spawns. Enemy variety is kind of lacking.  The factions each have similar archetypes. And the ""top dog"" fights are unfortunately, not unique. All the top dogs  behave the same, which gets fairly old. They are optional, but it would be  neat if there were differences in them besides what comes in their arenas. The strongholds and bases are quite fun to explore, often having far more going underground than what you can immediately see above ground, they  feel like puzzle platformers at times. The game is by far the prettiest of the open world games I have played. Which makes the  use of the picture mode (shared with Shadow of Mordor) a  VERY welcome addition. Both are ridiculous eye candy and worth  absorbing.The  main story itself feels fairly aimless at first, but the set of endgame missions are ramping in intensity greatly, they are honed to a point. It ends with both a bang and a whimper, but be warned,  this is Mad Max. This is not Road Warrior. This is not Beyond Thunderdome (even though it has a tacked-on thunderdome), and even though it looks a bit like Fury Road, this is not Fury Road at all.The tone  and pacing is more like the original than anything else. And it manages to hit almost as hard as that one did.	Maybe even more so, because of the interactive nature of  games.There are many things that could have been better done, but for what it is, it is an amazing ride. If you have  a chance to play it,  do so. It might surprise you.			"

												All the mechanics work great, but this is a prime example of a game that is too big, something the developer Avalanche Studios, creators of the Just Cause franchise, seem to do a lot in their games. While Just Cause has many different methods of travel, Mad Max has only one, drive. The driving is good, it has weight behind it and the car combat hasn't been done anywhere else, but the enviroments are typical Mad Max large open deserts. Thats not to say they're bad enviroments, a lot of effort went into the world design, the entire map is vertical despite being one big desert. You start in the ocean bed and make your way up sand dunes until eventually you're driving past church steeples submerged in the sand. But at the end of the day, they're still open deserts, with the only things populating them being ubisoft icons; 100s of scavenging locations (to upgrade max and his car), dozens of camps and a massive amount of destructable collectables. The game could've benefitted from a smaller game world. The gameplay loop of exploring/fighting, getting scrap and improving max and his car (which has nice aesthetic and stat increases) is really great at short bursts. I haven't even left the 2 large ocean areas yet, since I just pop on for an hour and play until it peaks my interest. Story is alright, obviously not the focus, but I would've liked to see a bit more effort after Fury Road's decent attempt. Again, it's one of those 'Ubisoft' styled games where there're only 10-20 actual story levels in the game intermingled with outposts and repetitive side content. On foot combat is great, although it is essentially Batman Arkham's combat. Get the game if you're going to play it in bursts, otherwise it'll drive you mad.I'd probably give it a 6/10. Above average and worth a glance but the fact that I can't get myself to properly sit down with it and play for an extended amount of time on account of it being too repetitive means it's not an all-around 'good' game. If you want something similar but executed better, try Shadow of Mordor, the Batman Arkham games and Just Cause. As I said earlier however, the car combat while underutilised is definitely unique.

												Mad Max is a game set in a world where careless waste, political terrorism, and general public unhappiness was permitted to boil over into full out rage, leaving the world a scarred, barren wasteland.The world of Mad Max, is completely different, from the world you and I know. The world you delve into in this game, is ruled by violence, governed by strife, fueled by crude oil, gasoline, and rig job cars built for war, and the only living one does here, is a filthy, misserable, dry-mouthed and perpually starving one, but in this world, simply being alive is a luxury few can claim to own. In this world, a car is required to be anyone or anything, including alive, and nothing but death, and dry bones await those with no car to carry them over the seemingly endless dunes of sand, which have long since covered the unfortunate would-be's who tried to survive before them. Money is worthless here, little more than tinder. The only thing people care about here, the only thing one could safely call 'money'. Is scrap metal. Piles of it, things used to create more cars, and therefore, more survival.The game is set in an obscure area in future America, seemingly in an old refinery town long since lost to the sands of sorrow. The only thing still standing, and furiously customized to grow to a sorry, pathetic excuse for a community, is Gastown, a large refinery that still stands and pumps gasoline, natural gas, and oil from the ground below at reckless speeds to fuel the governing group of lunatics, psychopaths, and bestial, carnage worshipping madmen: The War Boys of Scrotus. Much of the game happens in the southern outskirts of this town, a small 'oasis' that, upon arrival in it, seems more like a cruel joke, this area is a small space in the middle of what seems to be an endless expense of send dunes, extending for as long and as far and as unforgivingly constant as the eye can see no matter how high into the sky you go(with airballoon included). Wastelanders and Madmen alike refer to this ocean of endless death and barren dryness that surrounds their homeland as ""The Big Nothing"", and is routinely referred to as the place desperate people go, not to seek a better life, no matter what they themselves think, but to die. Some rumors say that the oceans which used to fill the entire area, which receeded many many many years ago, still recide far far beyond the Big Nothing, and if one survives the trek across it, they'll be rewarded with a sight of an endless ocean, stretching as far, if not further, than the big nothing, a never ending blanket of pure blue. Many have tried to seek this, and have never been heard from again, which only spurs the rumors on.Gameplay:First of all, yes, this game is an open world action RPG game with a garnish of crash car derby style gameplay.You play between driving and on-foot exploring most of the time. Long-range weaponry like handguns or rifles are a thing of the past, and extremely rare. Few rifles exist, and even few small arms. The only shotgun seemingly in existence for hundreds or thousands of miles around is Max's own.Driving is by far the most entertaining, but also the most difficult, requiring some driving skill depending on what surface you drive on, what tire type your car has on, and how much armor you wear(Cause armor is heavy and might make you stuck in the sand!). Car combat is a fine-tuned dance between excellence, and complete failure, it is almost impossible to be 'sort of successful' or 'sort of failure'.On foot is more straight forward. Mad Max is not just the name of the game, but also the protagonist whom you play. He is indeed mad, and is prone to bouts of uncontrolable rage towards those who attack him, sending him into a state the war-like factions call 'Kamicrazy'. He is, despite his lunacy, extremely skilled at hand to hand combat, and is capable of downing dozens of manic enemies with little effort(Assuming you're good at the game).The game has lots of content, many side missions, and countless things to do and see in the world. From lowering the presense of the incredibly powerful and horrificly aggressive faction called 'The Warboys of Scrotus', to progressing the main story of helping Max rebuild his lost 'Black on Black' car, which he loses in the prelude to the game's beginning. A new car, which he begins to build with the help of his newly found friend and ally, Chumbucket, the hunchbacked 'black finger' super mechanic, who knows little more than twisted, gas-combustion based religion, and making engines go vroom and wheels to spin. This car is named by Chumbucket, and is named 'The Magnum Opus'. Foretold by Chum to become 'faster, stronger, and better in every way, than the black on black, filled with holy purpose.'Graphics:Note that these graphics are based on a powerful 4k gaming rig with a GTX 980ti graphics cardThe graphics are appropriate for the game, requiring not much in the way of fauna or foliage since no plants seemingly exist in the world, anywhere. There is just dust, rock, and crude oil oceans made up of saturated sand. The graphics can be good, without being crazy, and still look amazingly detailed and more than adequate for giving a very realistic, very high caliber experience. Based on what I can tell, it appears that a lower grade rig could play this game at lower settings than highest/max, but it's always a good idea to google 'can I run it' and see what that says about your chances.Sound:It supports 7.1 surround sound, which is pretty flipping wonderful. I wish more games did. It gives an extremely realistic settings that makes you feel like you're standing in the middle of it. Of course you'd need 7.1 capable headphones, which mine are. Other than that, there's no desyncing between the voices and the animation of the mouthes, and the sound quality is very high, from both voice actors' skill, to the sounds taken for engines, and metal grinding against metal.Final word:I'm sure all of you want me to answer this question: ""Do you recommend it or not!?"" And yes, I absolutely do. I have little to nothing bad to say about this game. Extremely well executed, extremely well put together, an overall victory of considerable magnitude for the developpers responsible for this fine-polished diamond of a video game. If you like steampunky, violent, bitter and gorey messy games that takes unbearable living conditions, and makes them the norm for human survival and living style? Then this game will surely scratch that itch for guzzoline guzzling, oil burning, oil slicked finger licking car games that many of us have.I, for one, have been absolutely addicted to this game for the past 4 days, and I see no end to the game yet.

												Rating: 8/10Overview: Open World RPGSimilar Games: Batman Arkham city/Knight, Shadow of Mordor,The Good+ The wasteland is beautiful yet deadly, it feels massive and empty yet there is plenty of things to do. Driving over sand dunes while the sun sets, exploring desolate locations,races, liberating camps, story and side missions etc. The first time you experience a massive sand/thunder storm is pretty amazing, you can either seek shelter and wait for it to pass to try to survive it and collect massive rewards. Things like that only re-enforce the perception that the wasteland is tough to survive in. The wasteland is a great example of how good art direction and design can take a seemingly boring environment and turn it into something special. + Scavenging locations and liberating camps throughout the wasteland allows you to collect scrap which can then be used to upgrade your character or your vehicle the magnum opus+ Lots of different challenges to complete, completing challenges grants you special tokens which can then be used to further upgrade your character. + Car combat is a big component of the game and destroying vehicles feels very satisfying. You can destroy enemy vehicles in a variety of ways. + Chumbucket, your loveable yet strange hunchback sidekick. The most interesting and fun character in the game. + Incredibly well optimized, plenty of graphical options  + Lots of side quests, collectables, missions, races etc that are varied and provide a nice distraction from the main quest. + Great soundtrack and sound effects. The Average:The combat is a shallow version of Rocksteady's Batman games. There isn't enough gameplay mechanics or depth tied to the combat so the majority of the time you are only punching or parrying attacks with the occasional dodge. Even when you upgrade your combat skills, it doesn't feel like much has changed. Parrying an attack isn't instant so many times you will be in the middle of an attack only to be punched/charged from behind. This is further aggravated by the camera angle which is zoomed in to close to the character making it hard to see where all the enemies are.   The story is decent but nothing really special either, it doesn't stand out but it gets the job done. The game is fairly easy especially if you are accustomed to the combat system. I never found the game to be challenging.Some annoying  glitches, nothing game breaking but every once in a while an enemy will disappear through the floor, characters getting stuck etc. If you want to do many of the optional quests, it can start to feel repetitive....like most open world games. The Bad:Boss battles are all the same which is a shame because there is so much potential here. Conclusion:A fun game that is great if played in short sessions. If you love a collect-a-thon, then you will truly love this game. The good news is you can skip many of the optional stuff and stick to the main story and still have a good time. "

												Real life Australia simulator: A giant wasteland desert full of criminals and vegabonds where everything can kill you.If you like the films, or just enjoy fun open world games you will find a lot to enjoy here. Think of Shadow of Mordor's open world system getting married to the combat of Batman Arkam Asylum/City/ect  with a touch of survival game, and then dumping those elements into the MAD MAX universe. That is what we have here. It may not do anything outstandingly new to the genre, but it blends several really good and fun elements together in a very enjoyable game with a game world that is both ridiculous and entertaining (Just like the flms.).  If that isn't good enough, the game is also INCREDIBLY well optimized, right from release. Everything works, no visible bugs in my hours of play, and with only a single GTX 960 the game runs on MAX (The games Ultra setting.)  at a fluid 60fps regardless of the action going on on screen. A welcome feature in a world of games which release unfinished.			"

 Summary: Mad Max is a collection of a variety of strengths and weaknesses that range all over the spectrum, and it really comes down to what kind of gamer you are. The game's strengths comes in short play sessions of an hour as the car combat is great with the use of the Harpoon, and the strong characterization of Chumbucket as he comments about what's going around you will keep you interested. It's got a great variety of level design, and the PC performance is exactly what you'd want for a PC game in 2015: It runs smooth and can get the best out of the top-end systems. But on the flip side, ground combat doesn't play to its own strengths as the camera becomes a major problem in the counter based fighting, and frankly, the game has a lot of repetitive elements to it and can really feel like the gameplay has been extended to the point of breaking. You get your moneys worth, but in the end, Mad Max is the perfect game to get on a discount: there's nothing that forces your hand to get the game right now. Gameplay Footage and Video Review: 


YouTube™ Video: Mad Max (PC Review): The Gods of Combustion 

			Views: 361		

			Mad Max has been getting scores all over the place from outlets, and the question is: is the game right for you? It's definitely all over the place in terms of quality, and the question of whether or...		

 Lists: +: The car combat is reasonable, with the harpoon being fun to use on almost everything. In fact, just the Harpoon alone at times makes for some chaotic fun. Chumbucket, the mechanic, shines as the most interesting character by far, with his religious devotion to automobiles and his excitement about all things combustion. Base Level Design keeps things fresh over the long haul. Reuse of elements are done in a way that it never is noticed.  The world is beautiful in particular with the sand locations. Character design takes advantage of the license in terms of visuals and voice acting.  Power comes in the name of upgrades, and opens up combat and options to a considerable degree. The amount of hours you can get out of the game is high and has a bang for buck. -: Missed story elements that really could have taken the game to another level, overall the narrative is poor and doesn't do well with the license. Ground combat doesn't have enough variety to it, and doesn't understand the strengths of the system in place. The camera is a major problem.  Focus on “realism” can hurt the game at times, with it hurting gameplay pacing in terms of naturally taking advantage of the open world.  Repetitive nature of tasks really becomes more of a chore. While there's a lot to do, there's a lot of the same thing to do. Ending actually fell a little bit flat for me, despite others liking it. Very minor. "

												Mad Max...After four successful and legendary movies,Developers thought that bringing a game would be great.And guess what? They were right.Game did a great job reminding us that old Mel Gibson movies and telling how max was born.You starting game as max who lost his battle car at the very begining.This loss means being completely naked in wasteland to our protagonist.As Max we must find ourselves a vehicle and resources to stay alive.During this quest Max meets some allies:Some stronghold leaders and a crazy repairman named Chumbucket. Chumbucket presents his battle car Magnum Opus to Max in exchange upgrading the car and joining gastown races with it.Max has his car,his repairman and resources.Only thing that left is taking down Lord Scrotus's empire in many different ways.This contains destroying camps,scarecrows,sniper towers and many more.You'll be learning Mad Max's past and having so much fun while you playing through.If you buy of course.It's your call...

												Everyone's already probably heard that Mad Max combines elements from Far Cry 2 & Batman Arkham, while being the spiritual parent to Borderlands. I liked all of these games, but the combat and cars reminds me the most of the excellent Sleeping Dogs. Gameplay is solid. On the ground you can hold your own but you're no superhero. Even the weakest enemies can overpower you if they are too numerous or your reactions are too slow. The best part is the cars. Three of the initial 5 car bodies are reminiscent of the classic Interceptor, so you can play the campaign in a heavily customized ride that ""feels"" right. Max's legendary set of wheels are automatically unlocked after completion of the campaign. Depending on your level of devotion to this world you can take your time with the story or just putter around exploring the barren landscape to hunt for treasure and fight bandits. If you are a completionist Mad Max could be a grind, particularly the vehicle combat. To accomplish all challenges, it is recommmended to avoid clearing areas totally to keep enemies spawning. Movie adaptation games are usually in the ""miss"" category of hit or miss, so I'm very happy how Mad Max turned out. Being fond of the original film & the excellent Fury Road made this experience all the more enjoyable.edit: 100% after 80 hours roughly.			"

												Okay... this must be a dream of some sorts... because I don't think this sort of thing has happened in the past 15 years of gaming.What do I mean? A well optimized seemingly bug free game being released in this day and age. It HAS to be a dream, it CAN'T be real.Very surprised how well this game is running on my PC. I do not meet the recommended specs, but I get 80-100 FPS with everything maxed out. You know the developers are doing something right when a game preforms so well that a game under the max specs, can run as if it exceeds max specs. Well done on this game. Really glad I bought this one. Well worth the purchase.(If I were someone that pirated this title, I'd be so impressed by now well it turned out, I would end up buying the game to support the devs)			"

												After putting 50+ hours into this game and pretty much doing all that I can, I have to say that it was worth what I paid. The reviews online that complain about all the fun things you can do in game seems to punish you and make you NOT want to play the game are from people who havent unlocked any of the upgrades for the most part. Yes flying off high cliffs or even small jumps will heavily damage your car when you first start. Yes slamming into cars full speed or walls will make the Magnum Opus explode fairly quickly as well. When enemy cars hit you from the sides or the rear yes you get damaged very easily.So what do you do? Play the game and start to unlock upgrades. There is alot to do in game from looting camps for scrap, car bodies, unique cars, and car upgrades. Alot of collectables that give history of the down fall of man and destruction of the world. The people you interact with are as they shouldbe all on the ragged edge no hope completly untrusting....at first. When you get to your first stronhold its little more that a hole in the ground with nothing to help you other than a place to store all your cars you start to collect. The first thing id recommed doing when you can start to upgrade your strongholds is seek out each of the parts required to make the, gas tank, water collector, ammo table (in some cases this will happen as you complete story or a wasteland mission), maggot farm, scrap pallet, and scrap gathering team.The various things you can do include races for Crow, attacking camps (doing this will put wastelanders in them that give you free scrap at diffrent intervals in game), wastleland encounters that range from intel on camps, to free scrap, Legenday encounters giving you much longer missions to do. On this not alot of the encounters are avaliable at the start many others will unlock as you do story and wasteland missions.Combat in your Magnum Opus is pretty stale at the start. Harpoon doors, rip them off, then harpoon the drivers, you can shoot the fuel tanks for instant kill, blow out the tires and ramming the cars is also another way to take them out. After you get the thunderpoon upgrade to blow up cars, upgrade the harpoon to rip the wheels off, get the flamers for burning the cars on the sides of you, and of course upgrade the bumper to do more ramming damage its alot more fun. When you get access to the sniper rifle you can only use it from the car but you can thin enemy ranks and blow up camp defenses pretty easily with it. I reccomend killing warcriers ASAP they make melee combat a real pain if the get everyone amped up increasing there damage and attack speed.As far as defense in the car goes adding body armor and boarding spikes is the way to go. No other upgrades in relation do defense.Ok on to melee combat. At first it will feel alot like just block, attack, block, attack, over and over......and it is. After you start to upgrade max you can truly get to having fun with diffrent combos, finishers, takedowns, usings shivs and melee weapons. Shivs break after 1 use, you start being able to only carry shiv, your starter shotgun only has one shot before you need to reload so only use them both when you really need to. After a few upgrades you can carry more shivs have a shotgun with up to 4 barrels and can carry many more shivs and alot more ammo. Suviving in the wastes and finding water is not TOO hard to get after you get your first strong hold up and running with all the upgrades along with fuel and ammo. You can get a full reload of everything about every 15 mins. After you unlock multiple strong holds you can jump back and forth to stay replenished very easily.The story is good and really starts to explain why max is so messed up mentally, hearing voices, and makes you really feel for Max. I wont go into what happens to ruin the story for you but it is well done.I would like to see some extra areas added to the game like Bullet Farm or the Citadel so mabey WB's will release some DLC's with them in it if we are lucky and this game does well. Thats my only real complaint about this game.Thats about it I hope you got somthing useful out of this review and enjoy playing Mad Max.			"

												After taking my time and completing the entire story of the game along with so many of the side missions, I can safely say that this is not a bad game and it is worth the purchase. However, I don't recommend it at full price.- The AI is very basic and very predictable, all of them are the same (including boss fights). So as soon as you learn the technique, you'll rarely ever get hurt from them throughout the entire game.- In terms of gameplay, you see everything there is to see within a few hours of playtime, aside from main story stuff.- Story isn't long at all if you remove all the filler missions they force you to take.- While the layouts of each camp are more or less different, the mission objectives of each camp are always the same.- You're apparently the only good guy driving around in the wasteland, everyone else is either bad or a straggler with info / side quest or beggar.- Your car is apparently a ticking time bomb whenever it's broken and if you don't get out within 5 seconds, it explodes, but if you do get out, your helper just fixes it back up and you can continue on your way... that is if the enemy that put you in that state don't just constantly run you over and not allow you any chance of dodging them since Max is ridiculously slow at getting back up and moving again once injured.- The NPCs in the game are so very afraid of the Sand Dunes area and always hype up the area to be extremely dangerous, yet it's much safer to hang out there than anywhere else in the entire game. Even the missions in that area are really easy.- Giving beggars some water seems to have zero effect to the game at all... even running them over with the car has no effect either. What's the point of having them in the game?- Apparently you're the only person that can save the world... or do anything at all in the game. Way worse than other games.- There is at least 1 known game breaking bug. There's a door that cannot be opened in one of the camps. You either have to do an extremely difficult stunt with your car in order to have a chance at shooting the oil pumps or you have to resort to cheating. For the record, I did the stunt.- Extreme weather events look awesome! But at the same time, they're stupid and they ruin the immersion of the game. By that I mean, the very second you go indoors, the weather effects go away, but if you stay outside and try to wait it out, it'll stay there forever (unless you drive through it). So if you trying to complete a mission and there's no way to go indoors, then you're probably going to die from it. I've also seen glitches where the weather effects continue happening deep underground.- Overall, I didn't feel like the game was challenging enough. The only time the game was challenging was usually due to the limitation of the game's mechanics or they just buried you in enemies hoping that will add some challenge.- I hated the ending too. It felt so rushed to the point where it just irritated the hell out of me. I don't even care that certain individuals died in the game even though I liked them... it's just how they died and how they rushed it all to happen so quickly. The story was only starting to get good and interesting and then wham! Stuff happens and the end, all within 20 minutes (that mostly includes actual gameplay, story is maybe 3 minutes?). But then, after the credits, you go back to your destroyed car and see ppl that should be dead but aren't... all as though nothing had happened. Talk about breaking immersion.There's probably many more issues I didn't like about the game, but you get the point. And yet I still recommend the game... on a good sale price, which is what I paid for it. The graphics are nice and run smoothly. The overall game isn't frustrating enough to get me to stop playing it. It's almost like playing something like Euro Truck Simulator... there's really no point to playing it, but you do anyways cuz it kills a lot of time and you don't mind spending that time on it. I doubt I'll ever play the game from start to finish all over again though.			"

												A great open world adventure with lots of exploration and side missions. Car combat is fun, upgrades to your car and bases give you natural progression and taking over territories on the map feels rewarding. The side missions are varied for each section of the map, however they are the same in each section, so probably about 8 types of mission you'll do 5 times each (if you want). Main story missions give you something unique to do each time for the most part.The game also runs very well and looks gorgeous. With my rig, (i7 5930k, GTX 980ti and 32GB RAM) I can run the game all maxed out at 4K 80FPS, not sure I know of any other game to do that and look as good as this one.I recommend playing with a controller, as the beat-em-up control scheme doesn't lend itself well to PC. PS4, Xbox and Steam controllers all work with correct button prompts on each.			"

												Mad Max is ultimately a quite solid sandbox game, with some flaws. The driving controls, at least on keyboard seem a tad bit off, I tended to just spin out on the most innocuous terrain. Also enemies tend to cheap shot you during execution moves which just feels cheap. There's a lot of collectibles to find and while I think they could have upped their value exploration is still worthwhile because they don't repeat layouts for camps and scavenger locations, Elder Scrolls this is not. The atmosphere is really good as well. Writing is pretty cliche and not good though, but Chumbucket, your hunchback mechanic is nicely written. It also lays the grimdark on a little bit thick, which is rather glaring considering that the movies aren't. Mad Max is one of those games that never truly achieves greatness though, it could have really been enhanced by stuff like Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis System. (I have no idea why they didn’t seeing is that WB published both.) Regardless if you’re looking for a good sandbox game, Mad Max will definitely deliver and while it’s not PERFECT IN EVERY WAY, it’s not MEDIOCRE as the reviewers are saying.			"

WHAT A GAME, WHAT A LOVELY GAME !!! Mad Max is an action packed 3rd person game where you play as the legend, Max, with his holy chariot, The Magnum Opus, roared through the wasteland in this post apocalyptic dystopian setting where livestock are extinct, eating maggots, rats and canned dog food are a luxury, water is a rarity, and freaky petrolhead with suicidal tendencies roam everywhere.  PROS+The graphics.. wow!+Game run smooth like butter in my potato rig, unlike his brother Arkham Knight. +The post apocalyptic landscape, stage and world design are a sight to behold, very immersive and captivating.+I've said it once and I'll said it again, the stage design in this game is very, very good, every basecamp is different, every place has it's own post apocalyptic charms.+Combat are a-okay, Max feels more human than Batman or Ezio (and other similar left click to attack and right click to counter themed action games) with his fury/rage system and neckbreaking german suplex.+Magnum Opus is freakin' Badass when you finally find the V8 in later stages of the game.+Storyline is pretty neat.+Stronghold cleanup and loot crew which saved my time grinding in this game.+The weather system are cool, The storm, the black death, which are randomly triggered is so awesome. +Car combat are great, I'm having a blast destroying those war boy's convoy.+Photo editor / Capture mode which are great for SS making.CONS-Minefield side quest are kinda meh.-Top dogs (Bosees) are all the same, design and gameplay-wise.-The grinding are slightly annoyed me.Troubleshoot -Every so often I would get crash followed with error message: Error, D3D Device Lost!Reason : DXGI_ERROR_HUNG: Graphics device stopped responding. There might be an infinite loop in a GPU program. Please verify that the latest graphics device drivers are installed.haven't search for a fix yet since I'm busy upgrading my Magnum Opus.It's a shame that such a good game overshadowed by the hype that is Metal Gear Solid V on it's release date.9/10 will eat maggots again!

												Mad Max is an open world game that puts you in desolated post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max universe.The thing about Mad Max game is that it goes with a ""play safe"" approach to everything - from world and quests to mechanics design.There's not a one new thing in this game - everything that you'll find here has already been made in pretty much the same way by a lot of companies (say, Ubisoft's open world games).But don't take that as a bad thing. On the contrary - if you do like open world game, or if you like Mad Max universe - you might easily find yourself enjoying this game (just as I did).It's true - there's nothing new in it. But all existing things are executed so well, you can almost see the competence of Avalanche Studios oozing from every polygon.The combat is very similar to batman/shadow of mordor combat, but has a little less variety (again, probably because of that ""play safe"" approach).The towers from Ubisoft games were replaced with balloons that you don't have to climb, just fly up (they are pretty awesome vistas though).Camps are camps - you either have to kill anyone inside or blow stuff up to ""capture"" them. Sadly, that's all you can do with them, no additional bonuses are given from them.And that actually goes for most of the side activities - all of them feel kinda useless (unless you are grinding for that next car part).I wish Avalanche Studios had more time (or freedom?) to try and go crazy with this game - there's so much potential and possibilities of fun things in there.And then there are those little details everywhere - like burning send left from fuel flying out of your old car's exhaust. Or like storms (that are very rare), but damn terrifying to be in.Or like the explosions that looks absolutely gorgeous. And capture mode that makes exploding things and making screenshots very fun (I wish there was a way to get into it using a hotkey, not through pause menu though).Voice acting's pretty good too. Oh, and don't forget the optimization - game runs perfectly well on just about any config that's close to recommended one.So, to sum it up - if you are OK with your typical (I just can't force myself to say ""classic"") open world game in Mad Max universe - go for it. It's pretty good, just more of the same good open world stuff in another universe.Watch the video for more detailed look here:

												Mad Max is a very good port (a port nontheless, so controls feel a little bit clumsy sometimes). It contains rather a lot of grinding if you're an achievement hunter, but it's not required when playing through the main story. The plot isn't original but it is very clear it was built on the climate of the original movies, which helps the game a lot. It's depressing, it's heavy and it makes you mad. So very mad. Especially the ending.Totally worth those few euros/pounds, especially if discounted. "

												Depending on what you are looking for, Mad Max will bore you to tears or entertain you for 50+ hours.  The game blends popular elements from other games into a post-apocalyptic open world with a focus on driving.  Fans of Assassins Creed, Shadow of Mordor and the Batman Arkham games will feel instantly at home.  You have the Batman combat, but surprisingly more brutal and less ""smooth"", which I think works pretty well as you aren't a superhero!  You have an enormous map, which is probably the biggest I've seen in a game like this.  Finally, you have an abundance of collectibles and that satisfactory feeling when you completely clear an area  and have it marked as 100%.  The game certainly is repetitive, but fans of collectibles and upgrading will enjoy this game and that part of the game appealed to me more than the lacklustre story on offer.What makes Max Max stand out from the open world crowd is the use of the ""Magnum Opus"", a car that you will do battle in, upgrade and race over the entire course of the game.  There's plenty of choice when it comes to upgrading weapons, making the car faster, getting the armour upgraded and adjusting the parts for the task at hand.  I enjoyed this part of the game immensely and I don't even enjoy driving games.  A slightly boring story and repetitive gameplay will turn a lot of people off, but the game does shine when it comes to its driving mechanics and how it gives you so much to collect and explore in its enormous map.  Graphics aren't the most important thing, but I have to say that the game is gorgeous and managed to make a game that is mostly sand look breathtaking at times.  I highly recommend this game to people who like the games I have mentioned and perhaps those who were intrigued by the driving sections in Rage.			"

												Even though I haven't finished the game yet, I've seen enough of it to put my thoughts in writing.Mad Max is pure bliss.The first thing you'll notice is, of course, how absolutely gorgeous it looks. This is one of the best-looking games ever made, and it performs flawlessly even on middling hardware.The sound design matches the visual quality and enhances the wasteland's hostile atmosphere.Melee combat is heavily inspired by the likes of the Arkham series and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, which to me is a good thing, but some may find overly simplistic.But obviously what sets this game apart from other open-world action titles is vehicular combat, and it's as fun and enjoyable as you'd expect from a game set in the Max Max universe. Your car - or should I say, the ""Magnum Opus"" - itself is a weapon (with which you can ram and grind enemy vehicles), but as you progress in the story you'll equip it with a grappling gun, a sniper rifle and a makeshift rocket launcher, making it the ultimate dispenser of death and destruction.There is, however, a distinct lack of motorcycles and larger, truck-sized ""war rigs"", such as the ones seen in Road Warrior and the recent Fury Road.Open-world games have been criticized lately for excessive reliance on inconsequential side-missions and collectibles, something that has been referred to as the ""Ubisoft school of open-world games"". Mad Max has side-missions, collectibles, strongholds, camps: the whole nine yards. But none of them feel like fodder. Every little place you visit has its own unique design and backstory, giving a sense of immersion that is sadly quite rare these days.Throughout your adventures you'll be assisted by Chumbucket, the horribly disfigured hunchback mechanic. I won't call him a sidekick because he's every bit as important as Max himself, and is really the heart of the game.And he's just one of many interesting characters you'll meet. Friends and foes are all equally well designed and voice-acted. It helps that the dialogue is great, too.Anyway, there's so much else I could say, so let me be perfectly clear and be done with it: this is not just a recommendation. It's a ringing endorsement.Buy Mad Max.			"

												So let's start off with the good bits.The port is very good, I can run this on high on my not-so-up-to-date computer quite smoothly, with frame drops only now and then which don't impact the game much. The animation is smooth, such as when Max swaps positions with Chumbucket, his entering and leaving a vehicle as well as the flow of his attacks just feels genuine. There are a lot of video settings combined with the fact that the visuals itself looks pretty good and the presence of rebindable keys is even better. However, there is no toggle aim for those who like it, though this game does not feature very much shooting in general which does not really impact the gameplay for me, despite my personal preference.Now for the bad points.The gameplay in general is quite stale and at times quite pointless. The ground combat is its weakest point, and I give it a 1/10. It largely resembles the Batman fighting style where you spam left click while waiting for counter attack indicators or non-counterable indicators at which you then just dodge. With the attacks, you have light and heavy, but most of the time you end up just spamming light attacks as you cannot dodge while in the middle of charging up a heavy swing, which means heavy swings are reduced to largely finishing off opponents or when there are no undefendable attackers. And in the end, regardless of whether there are defendable or undefendable opponents, it's still a left click spam fest with very little thought input. With an added note that boss fights are exactly the same, just one big guy instead of many smaller guys. One word: Tedium.The car combat was also quite uninspiring. It had potential, but the biggest problem was that it ended up being a Harpoon Simulator 2015... on land. Instead of harpooning fish or sharks, you just harpoon buildings and people (in cars and out of them). Ramming into other cars while driving is pretty difficult, while also taking substantially longer to kill opponents as opposed to just harpooning them; though damage greatly increases if you were to run directly into them while boosting. So the easiest way is to just harpoon the people out of the vehicles which leaves you to freely destroy/ram stationary vehicles which explode into meagre amounts of scrap. Now some general problems. Fuel is something that's used to run your car (obviously), and you'd think in a post-apocalyptic world it would be a very valuable resource... except it isn't when you can basically find an unlimited supply of jerry cans at every balloon fast travel point. Added to that fact that your car also does not even use up that much fuel when it travels, means that the extra jerry can in the back ends up being more of a door opener than anything else. Capturing camps generally has three objectives, blow up x things, disable y or kill z boss. And there's only two approach to all of these objectives, force your way through via the front gate with your car, or find a side hole to just walk through. Then basically the gameplay becomes all the same because you're forced into ground combat which becomes a tedium (as described above). There are also some pointless mechanics such as: spam x to break open door/crate, or, 'this door requires explosives' when there's a jerry can basically right next to you.Overall.There's no stealth mechanic nor grabbing attacks which forces a very linear gamestyle, your guns are more or less just there to do objectives rather than supplement combat flow, car combat becomes a harpoon simulation, while the concept of fuel as a resource becomes moot. If you like the Batman series fighting styled gameplay, then this might be for you.			"

												The game was amazing in the first couple of hours, but then it got repetitive fast. Although you may see positive feedback that says ""it doesn't matter"" you should still think twice before buying Mad Max. I didn't finnish the game because of repetitiveness and cons below. Simply put I got bored clearing all the areas.Pros:+ Combat is really neat and has variety+ Game sounds, especially when you get the V12 (although there can be minor glitches in sound world)+ Car customization+ Excitement at the beginning (speed pursuits, fights generally)Cons:- Repetitive especially when clearing all the zones (and there are lots to clear)- Even though your car is customized to the max the lower enemy cars can keep up with you which is annoying- Minefield clearing is absolutely boring and you can't fight the enemy cars the way like with your main car (because you need to clear them with special car)- Unlockable cars don't have anything special on themIt may seem like cons are minor things in Mad Max, but they are constant when playing the game and were major to me. The gameplay is designed the way that you should first do the main quests and then clear everything. If you do latter first, you can get the best car parts but some quests still require worse car parts which were also annoying. If you dont mind repetitiveness and can cope with the cons I suggest you get the game when it is in discount.			"

												To be honest i was sceptical at first, another movie licensed title hits the gaming world and i sincerely hoped that mad max would not join the rest of the terrible titles the post movie game adaption pile of death. Humbley and happily Mad Max will avoid being classified as another movie licensed failure but instead of one of the more successful and sound examples of not onyl a good movie licensed game but a good game in general.Mad Max seemed humble and a little slow at first, until i came across the major plot sequence and central focus of the game. Customising and building your very own wasteland beast. Not only do you get to customise a pre-existing frame of a vehicle, but have the option of many different vehicles, and on top of that many vehicle body, engine and wheel modifications, that combined in different arrangements make deadly combinations to tear other vehicles apart. This is without a doubt Mad Max's strongest feature, alongside its gritty and earthy combat system in both hand to hand and vehicular. The hand to hand combat feels viseral and real, hitting someone in the face with a wrench makes a satisfying sound, and a believable reaction. The vehicular combat, can be tough but damn is it satisfying, running a car off a road into a rocky out crop and see it break into pieces and blow into a flaming heap of spoilt chrome.Mad Max is a solid game, with a great level of optimization across the board, and great gameplay. Its only setback in my Lore loving eyes of the mad max world is its realtively weak Storyline and weak central protagonist, in both voice acting and overall appearance. All in all, this game is truly exceptional and i give it a high recommendation. "

												Great game with gorgeous graphics and fleshed out open world. However it gets boring after a couple of hours and I can see why people wouldn't even bother with the side missions and exploring the wasteland and just rush the story. Still a great game though, 7.5/10.Recommended, but not at full price			"

												This is the game i've been waiting for since Mad Max on NES. Avalanche Studious definitely delivered a great game to enjoy. Keeping it short i will say that the combat is arkham-like ( obviously ) but much more brutal and the punches and kicks are so much more impactful, the car combat is also very good and fluid, optimisation for PC is GODLY ( every studio should learn from avalanche ) , post apocalyptic wasteland haven't been done better than that. Period.  GOTY for me :P			"

												Despite having a tad too many scavange locations / Collectables, Mad Max is easily one of the best Movie-to-Game adaptions ever.The cars control well and it's combat is quite enjoyable, also being able to build the Magnum Opus into your own little design is awesome.The on-foot combat is very Arkham-like, with your normal attacks, your parry and your shotgun to deal a quick kill.The story, although maybe a tad short, is very enjoyable, not found one character to dislike, also pleased with how the do the Max-Chumbucket talk, we know Max wouldn't care to expand, so we have good ol' Chum to do that for us (Love your mechanics people)Also unlike most Movie games, there is alot to do in-between and more than enough to add many hours onto the clock, worth picking up if on sale (always goes dirt cheap) and you never know, it might convince you to give the movies a go.Overall a very pleasing & surprising game, worth the time if you got some to spare.

												PRESS CLTRL KEY TO JUMP!!!CONS:-Can get repetetive with similar maps and side missions (like Shadow of Mordor). Can still be fun, but is grindy.-Not sure if developers intended the terrain to NOT rely on jump, as I managed the first 12 hours without jumping just fine, until it got frustrating in some parts, and then I found out the jump key existed in the form of a CLTRL key.-Several ""gaps"" during missions, leading to people (myself) included to think that there was a bug (e.g. Completing the Jack, and Selecting the Dog and Buggy Mission ). A mission journal with detail on next steps would be good.PROS: -Map is large and littered with things to do (although it could get repetetive) .-""Historical Relics"" actually made me curious about the back-story and history of the world.-Love has definitely gone in to bringing the world and it's characters of Mad Max to life. Character and location library available (albeit looking a little stale).-Levelling system available for skills, armour, cars etc. so kept me sufficiently motivated to keep playing.-Special in-game camera settings for those who like to take beautiful snaps.Still a better game than Mafia 2.

												I feel that this is one of the most underrated games on modern consoles. It has excellent car combat as well as a simple but satisfying hand to hand combat system. The story is also surprisingly engaging, and I really enjoyed the variety in the characters. As a huge fan of the Mad Max series, I can say that the atmosphere of this game is amazing, and I love all the little nods they give to the earlier movies. Honestly, I could just drive around in this game for hours, stopping only to take out the occasional War Boy patrol, and I'd still be having a blast. I'd say the main downside to this game is that it can get repetetive, but it's the same way with most open world games in this style. Overall, a truly excellent game.			"

												I will admittedly say that because this game was inspired by a movie, I was half expecting it to be a flop... I was pleasantly proven wrong.This game provides a nice open-world experience with plenty to do and a fun combat system that makes running around doing things that seem tedious actually quite fun.The story is relatively minimal, and the way the game lays out your ""objectives"" leaves a lot of interpretation up to the player as to how you go about completing your missions. Many missions will have criteria that must be met for you to start (such as previous objectives, certain upgrades, etc.) that will force you to go out and complete tasks in order to earn those upgrades and progress further into the story.The game is based very heavily on driving, specifically, your very own car that you upgrade with you like a man and his dog. The car will become your primary source of combat, means of travel, as well as the ability to reach new areas. One aspect that I thought was pretty intuitive was the introduction of the fuel gauge-- that's right, your car has to run on actual fuel. At first, it seems like the fuel supply is low, restricting your ability to go anywhere and do anything, but there are numerous ways to increase the efficiency as well as find spare fuel all over the place (you can also get special projects in each stronghold that will give you an instant full tank), so I never actually had an issue keeping the tank full.The gameplay and the controls are pretty well implemented, following gameplay style like the Arkham series and Shadow of Mordor (both WB productions), and with the detail of Just Cause 3 (same dev). The only complaint that I'd have about the gameplay, is the jumping... your character can jump, but not more than a foot of the ground. You rarely have to use it, that it just seems like it's there to keep some semblance of realism. It's more of a gripe in that it somewhat restricts your ability to go ""anywhere"".The music is also very well set to the game, it provides an ambience that puts you right in to a savage wasteland with some creepy inhabitants, and never feels like it gets in the way.The menu system is pretty comprehensive but I will give a summary of my pros/cons that will address a few quirks I noticed.tl;drPros:+ Fluid gameplay mechanics+ Interesting combat system (both on foot and in car)+ There's lots of content that can be accessed before completing major missions+ Upgrading your car and customizing the builds are satisfying to your type of play (speed, attack, weaponry, etc.)+ Fuel is plentiful (you just have to be observant)+ Map and fast-travel system is very useful+ Engaging story and fun missions+ You can cheat in death runs (races)Cons:- The main side content is just different takes on the same few concepts (which can get repetitive quickly)- Finding large quantities of scrap is annoying- The game can ""hold your hand"" in places (look for yellow everywhere to indicate where you can go)- The menu interface can be annoying when you find a new part and you have to switch back and forth to effectively compare two parts (hood ornaments mostly)- The jumping mechanic is just fillerOverall, I had a good time with this game. Give it a chance if you like open world, combat focused entertainment.			"

												This game is fantastic. I have said that I will never again buy an EA exclusive title or an UBIsoft Port because of all the dishonest and incompetent things they have done in the past. Well, the door swings both ways. After Shadow of Mordor and now Mad Max, I will make it my business to buy as many Warner Brothers products as I can. Seriously, they show respect to the industry and this game is yet another living testimony to that fact. Avalanche studios (the developer) has outdone themselves and Warner Brothers (the publisher) had the respect of the industry to publish it in this fashion. Excellent work. So why pay money for this title? 1)	The design is conducive to the player having a lot of varied and dynamic fun. Driving, exploring, running, fist fighting, knife fighting, car rallying, hot-air balloon riding, sliding, talking, car upgrading, character progression…you name it, this game has got it. The best thing is, it all comes together seamlessly.2)	The detail in the world is amazing and the attention and respect of the lore is equally worthy of praise. You fight someone, there’s a complete description of how that character or enemy fits into the world. You see a base, landmark or resources centre, there’s a complete description of the site’s function and strategic significance. You pick up so-much-as a flash-light, and there is a complete run down of the object. Brilliant detail.3)	The dialogue and voice acting is top-notch. I have enjoyed the characters and cut-scenes in this game more than the film on which the game is based (and I loved Fury Road). The genius incorporation of Mad Max discourse and specific idiomatic terms makes you feel part of the world. 4)	The graphics are great. Not perfect but amazing non-the-less. The fire, explosions, and smoke effects are nothing short of brilliant. It runs on my system at 80 frames per second with no lag while running fraps and Xsplit in the background. Amazing optimisation.5)	The driving is extremely cinematic as the combination of graphics, sound design and game-flow produce extremely stimulating encounters. 6)	It’s a big game. You really do feel like you are embarking on an epic adventure and you are getting plenty of content for your money. Bravo to the folks at Warner Brothers. Bravo you amazing game designers at Avalanche Studios. The only criticism I can possibly muster involves the voice actor for Max. He does a truly great job but his voice is a little too deep. Seriously, that is as negative as I can get and I append the qualifier that the voice actor still does an amazing job within his scope of ability – not his fault he has a deep voice. Keep it up WB!       "

												1+ hours in and I can say the following based on progression through zone 1 - that's the disclaimer for peeps who want to know what $60 will buy at release.*Watch the cinematics; they're decently rendered and entertaining, at least the first time through.  Unless you're a twitch-monkey who just wants targets, you also may be interested in the plotline, and (so far) explain the point of each phase of the missions you perform.**The E key is your primary form of interaction; controls are not difficult, and can be remapped easily.1.) Linear progression as opposed to open world/WoW, where you can literally go anywhere you want, if you can live/get there.  This is in regard to advancing the plot.2.) You can explore the zone you're in to your heart's content, provided you have the fuel or want to run (and run and run...)3.) Combat is formulaic, rather than spontaneous, and at early stages you get key-hints to tell you ""block"" or use other skills.  Blocking nub enemies is only practice; you can just beat the snot out of them without defending.4.) Weapon use is not yet part of the game, despite possession of a shiv and a shotgun, except for shooting nub vehicles to 1-shot blow them up.  This is on the quest to get your new car.I'm having fun so far, but tbh, not $60 worth of fun.  I considered refunding the game on the basis of cost alone, but after 4-5 hours of download time, and the realization that I will want to play the game more, I'm gonna stick it out.At this very early view of the game, I give a 7/10 review, and expect that evaluation to go UP as I play more.  Review will be updated later on.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~21 hours in; I've owned this game for ~4 days.Madness.  Great game so far.  So good, in fact, that I've temporarily abandoned the storyline because mugging convoys for scrap is more fun than driving past them (i.e., letting them get away).  There's so many locations in the world, they seem almost endless in this stage of the game, and all of them are either NPC strongholds, lootables, destroyables, or some combination of the three.The game remains linear in terms of plotline, but in order to advance it (and enter new terrirtory) you'll want to have some side missions done/locations explored.  Scrap is how you buy up your gear, both personal and vehicular - thus, you need to loot, and kill stuff to loot.This brings me to the single down point I find in the game so far, unless I'm just not yet to the point where it changes: you can collect cars you defeat (unless they are destroyed) and bring them back to a stronghold for later use... but if you want to salvage parts from them, you have to destroy them on the road.  Funny how a whole car isn't worth much but the collector value, and a destroyed car is worth ~1/10 (if that) of the value of buying an improvement to your own car.The obvioius up side to this hitch is that you have (""GET"") to destroy more stuff on the road.One thing that stopped me up at first was the enemy insignia in the camps; you destroy the Scabrous Scrotus insignia at these locations to 100% clear them.  Some are hard to find, and of those, some are too high to reach.  Thus, you need a shotgun shell (rare items, at first) or some other tool to destroy them when they're out of reach.  Have a shell on-hand unless you want to come back, but always look for the alternative - a thrown gas can, or an exploding spear, conveniently placed at various places throughout the enemy camps.Current evaluation of the game is now 8.5/10.  Good ambiance, great cutscenes (except the one for putting a gas can into your car... that one is getting annoying), good character actors and rederning, easy controls, well planned plot progression, and fun combat and adventuring, both on foot and in vehicle.XD ~~Great job, Avalanche!~~ XD			"

												Superb addition to the Mad Max universe & a wonderful game.This game proves that a Warner Brothers produced game can be wonderful on PC. It's a solid PC port & that's good to say. Unlike the latest iteration of Batman this game offers virtually everything you want from a console to PC port. Full mouse and keyboard integration, endless graphical settings including refresh rates of up to 144Hz on multiple resolutions all the way down to 640p. The game is stunning to explore and enjoy & so far (10 hours in) it has kept my attention. While there could be more activities to do & the looting is somewhat repetitive at this stage, the storyline is as you'd expect from a Mad Max game. If you're familiar with the franchise, this game is a solid entry, not quite as rocking as Fury Road was as a movie, but very remiscent of that title.If you aren't familiar with the franchise, this game will open up the world of the movies to you. Oil is scarce, cars are becoming a thing of the past, they are weapons, a show of power, an extension of your last remaining remnants of humanity. Which is more important to you? Water or Oil? You're constantly reminded of this throughout the game as you are in the movies.It's an apocolypse that's all too real. It turns people insane & one which unsurprisingly could happen in the not too distant future.			"

												Ok this time for real.This game spikes up and down in quality very rapidly. You'll be enjoying yourself one minute driving around then the next you'll wish the pain would just go away as you slog through some of the most punishing combat and driving I've seen in a far cry collectathon. Upgrading your car is nice but I wish I could more readily use the others I collected wtihout magically phasing into the magnum opus for every cutscene. You'll engage in some very tedious, repetitive base raiding all for the purpose of unlocking new car parts. There is virtually no variety in enemies or bosses. There are other games that do this genre better and there isn't much unique to see here. While it isn't suitable for my tastes I can recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre.			"

												Mad Max finds himself stranded in the wasteland, his car wrecked and taken away from him: soon after he finds an unexpected ally in an exiled mechanic who thinks Max is the appointed driver to the car he dreams of building: you then set onwards trying to assemble said car so that you can finally get revenge over those who wronged you.Mad Max is a competent and quite fun open world game that truly succeeds in recreating the environments, characters and events that made the fanchise famous while providing an enjoyable mix of vehicular and melee combat: a few problems can instead be found in the cliched story, simple mission design, slippery car handling, paper-thin characters and some annoying bugs.PROS:-excellent design and art style: the wasteland really looks nice and has lots of small details, different enemy factions all have their own character models, armor, weapons and cars-the graphics, while not great, are generally done well and sport a good amount of detail in character and car models-good soundtrack, even though it feels almost too unobtrusive at times-Max's character is great and truly feels like a shell of a man driven by his sense of guilt-Max's car has alot of customization and upgrade options available, slowly rebuilding it in a force to be reckoned with truly feels like an accomplishment: if you want to mix things up a bit you can also steal enemy vehicles and add them to your garage selection-car combat is pretty fun once you get a few upgrades, combat on foot is simple but works well enough-great ending sectionCONS:-some unimpressive textures-certain 3d models for buildings repeat a bit too often-car handling feels too slippery, even an upgraded and armoured hulk of a car can spin out of control if you hit a small obstacle: this makes some driving/ car combat sections less fun or downright frustrating -mission design is very simple, most boil down to drive to a place/fight on foot/pickup an object or free someone with little variation overall-side activities get dull after a bit, while liberating camps by either beating everyone in them or blowing up certain objects is fun having to roam around to shoot a sniper/ tear down a structure/ clear a minefield gets repetitive quite quickly-some camera problems during melee combat, especially in cramped spaces: the camera autofocusing on certain explosions during vehicular combat can also make you crash since you can't see the road clearly-apart from Max and the mechanic most other characters are really undeveloped and just act as quest givers or cliched enemies-some assorted small bugs with a few flashing textures, cars disappearing and reappering in front of me, died once and for no reason when exiting my car, car engine sounds not working until you exit and enter again etc: nothing is gamebreaking but a some can get annoying

Mad Max is a very good game overall and I had fun in my 30 hours with it: the story is simple and cliched but engaging enough to make you want to finish it, the side quests are decent, car and foot combat are nothing spectacular but work and are enjoyable and upgrading my car to tailor my gameplay was something I really liked. Eventually all the side activities do feel like just some extra padding and get quite dull unless you're a completionist, but to be honest that's a problem with many open world games nowadays.The car handling is perhaps the biggest problem, I honestly thought that my car generally felt slippery and sluggish...slippery as in easily entering a spin whenever I hit an object as if my car was an empty eggshell rather than a fully armoured beast and sluggish due to its generally bad turning radius and bad acceleration (upgrades that add weight makes it worse ofc). But driving around and car combat, while suffering a bit from the aforementioned issues, do manage to stay fun and that's what matters: the only exception is a badly designed and unskippable car race where the handling problems come up pretty badly, thankfully some pointers on the forums'll help you making it more manageable.All things considered Mad Max is a pretty good game and one that'll last you for quite some time before the repetitiveness sets in and you decide to just finish the story: you can already find it for way less than its full price and I can easily recommend it if you're looking for more third-person action but want something different than Assassin's Creed.

												I can play the opening action scene from The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2), driving in first person mode, chased by spiked cars, getting stabbed with spears by punks, jumping on my hood, while my car is on fire, driving off a cliff. Roaming in the most beautiful, endless Wastelands, chasing car parts, gasoline, dog food and water, which eventually sort of always end up in car battle explosions and or fist fights, before I use a shiv. I can play this forever.			"

												I am pleasantly suprised how optimized this game is. I'm running a GTX 760 2GB card and yet I am able to maintain a constant 60fps with everything maxed out. ON A WB GAME at that. So far, I'm loving the atmosphere and supreme graphical fidelity of this title. Impressive voice acting and believable wasteland helps to immerse you into this apocolyptic world. Fluid combat brings memory to recent title MD: Shadow of Mordor and the widely known Batman games. This combat system is effective and more games should implement it as long as they pour a little of their own flavor into the pot. I haven't played too much yet but I definitely wanted to let people know that the game is worth buying so far if you wanted confirmation on optimization. Well, I'm about to dive back in, pulling myself away to write this short review was hard enough as it was.			"

WITNESS ME! I AM AWAITED IN THE GATES OF VALHALLA!This game... Is completely awesome.Upgrade yourself and your car... to the MAX!DO ANYTHING TO THE MAX!The game is full of little side activities and plenty of locations to explore so when you try to do the main story you often get sidetracked heavily. A great game. I suggest you pick this game up when the price goes down a bit. This game gets a 9/10 for me. Mainly due to the fact that sometimes after you have cleared every area the game can get empty. Other than that, this game is a majestic piece of work.			"

Product received for free
												Let's just start off, it's another great game published by Warner Brothers.The game definitely gives a ""Mad Max"" feel and really matches the movies (from what I've seen) in my opinion. Fighting is great as ever. Pretty close (if not exactly the same) to Batman Arkham. When it comes to hand to hand combat, there isn't hordes of enemies to attack unlike Batman titles, but even with less targets it is still a interesting and exciting fight. Car functionality is pretty good. A lot better than the Batmobile in Arkham Knight. Granted, they're both really different but at times I had issues driving the Batmobile. Even though it is great, it still doesn't compare any Need for Speed driving, but not bad at all. Graphics are very nice in this game. I am running at ""max"" settings and have no issues what so ever. Even tested on a lower grade machine and even on medium settings, it looks perfectly fine and runs solid as well. Regarding story and the open-world aspect of the game. I would say that the story was very good, and really protrayed the sadness of this wasteland and kinda wanted to make me cry at times (perhaps I'm just a baby!). Not exactly sure where it falls into place with the original stories as for I've never watched them, but even from a view of knowing nothing about the story of Max, it made perfect sense and really left you the ablity to do whatever you want. Rather you want to wait on the main story and do side-missions or even other way around, it totally leaves the choice up to you.  When you first begin, you think there is a lot of places to see in the small area you are currently at, but then you look at your map and see the miles of miles of endless driving to the very top of the map, you think otherwise! That feature made it even better, offering lots of areas to explore and left plenty of room for driving or taking down enemy vehciales. There are only about 6-8 different kind of side missions which are spread across the whole wasteland of Mad Max. While it kinda gets to be repetitive, it can still keep you interested. I however see that once your car is fuly upgraded, there will be no purpose to playing.  Quick recap!Great game of Warner Brothers, fighting is awesome and intense, driving functionality is farily decent, story was great and open-world / side missions are enjoyable but also repetitive. There are a few minor changes I would have made to the game, but honestly...they don't matter as much cause they did great everywhere else in the game. So again, if you like Batman titles, you'll more than enjoy this game. If you like open-world game with a mix of Batman / Fallout setting, this is a great game to spend countless hours on.- Captain Price			"

												Let me just say this game is really not that bad. In fact , its the best movie-tie-in game  I've ever played which you really do feel like Max on a post-apocalyptic wasteland . My opinion about this game is like a tug of war and it really does have its highs and lows . Highs Beautiful setting - Although it really is a wasteland , it doesn't feel that repettive . The game developers try there best to make the experience of driving around the wasteland actually more entertaining with each region have a unique character to it . Alogn with change of weather and nighttime. Gritty Combat - Akrham-y combat mechanic without the cool gadgets and kungfu moves  . When your playing Max , the only combat experience is your two fists and boy it really does feel good suckerpunch a godamn war boy in face . World - If you like the crazyness of the franchise, then this game gives that same lust of insanity and madness that we all crave with specific tribes with there own culture and beliefs . Typical Mad Max trope to survive by scavenging scraps , food and water is also the main theme for this game.Car mechanics and Combat - The soul of this whole franchise and this game is the car combat . Its basically Pimp-My-Ride with your sidekick Chumbucket as xzibbit . Car Combat is as entertaining as it gets especially when you high tail a convoy all by yourself , rampaging through dozens of cars jsut to get that head ornament as the cherry on top of your sweet Magnum Opus . Story - This is probably in the middle but like any Mad MAx movie . It is kept pretty simple with a clear objective LowsThe Grind - This is the bad apart about customizing your car , to upgrade the best parts for it you have to start doing small missions by destorying camps and clearing the region which is a chore especially if majority are almost the same . This is what BREAKS ME for this game , its tiring &repetitive and I had to take a long rest from playing this game before going at it again . THE DOG IS USELESS - At first when I saw the dog at the first part of the game you'll be like "" hell yeah , Dog partner in wasteland just like Road Warrior "" NOOOOOOPPPEEEE . The only thing that dog does in this game is to sniff out mines and there is no reward other then clearing the region out of doing this . It is menial and boring as heck . Mini-Boss are the SAME- THroughout parts of each region theres a mini-boss camps for you to beat to get that sweet paintjob on your crib but my god is it boring . Each Mini-boss has the same moves , body and mask and it is repetitive and lazy which makes the game almost a cakewalk . Verdict Overall , its really not a bad game but for those who enjoy a collectathon with a same-y sandbox gameplay with added car combat and collecting while experiencing post-apocalyptic franchise then you would love this game but for me it felt like chore .

I intend to update this review when I have finished a more significant portion of the gameA quick and dirty review while the game's still fresh out the oven:I enjoy this game, I really do. It's not mindblowing, or perfect. But It's good. There's plenty of proven game mechanics in this game; from the setting to the fighting, everything feels borrowed. Yet the game doesn't feel tired or old, there's enough new stuff that you don't get bored. Game mechanics are married in some very clever ways, the game feels like a coherant experiance instead of the frankenstien's monster I was expecting. The general structure of Mad Max plays similar to Shadow of Mordor, with the large open map with plenty of enemies to encounter. Of course there's the Arkham-style fisticuffs. I get the same kick from this game as I did from Shadow of Mordor, I can play for 4+ hours straight- contstantly creating new little objectives for myself. Mad Max also runs stupidly well. It's been so long since there's been a port this good for PC, it puts abominations like Mortal Kombat X and Arkham Knight to shame. The game looks fantastic as well, it's incredible considering the desert landscape. I just can't stop taking screenshots!I could go into detail about the driving being solid, the slightly wacky control scheme or the tasty little novelties. But I think I'd just be dancing around the point: Mad Max is a solid game. If it looks like the kind of thing you'd enjoy you probably will enjoy it. It's a little rough around the edges, but there's a lot love.			"

												Mad Max may be a bit repetitive. But the things you can do - upgrade the car, leveling up Max and his weapons & gadgets + great setting (wasteland looks gorgeous in a  twisted way), graphics, sound and combat system makes this game a real fun to play. Story itself is like a story in Mad Max: Fury Road - in terms of amount. There IS a story, but it is not a main part of the game. Basically its a classic revenge story, when Max is trying to kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who stole his precious Interceptor. Thats it. There are some side quests, some of them are great, some of them less great. In the end, this game is all about gameplay, cars, combat and destruction. Which is totally fine with me.8/10			"

Really well optimized, stable (I remember only like 2 crashes) and certainly visually appealing game that pinpoints the wasteland and its feeling.			"

												I was excited when I saw the trailers and gamplay of the game . But was bit confused after i saw the movie Mad Max Fury Road. But I decided to pick it up and give it a go. And I wasn't disappointed.  What a game. Although I didn't have much time to play, but here are my thoughts after playing . And Wil include more in depth analysisPros:-Good Optimization. Runs perfectly on my laptop with GTX 860M GPU- Brutal Yet Addicte combat System. Batman arkham series would find it more interesting - Vast Vast Wasteland to cover .- Love The Cusomization.-Fun to do quests and finding scraps.-Fuel system and water system is damn good.  Really liked it. It forces me to focus on the game - Survival at its bestCons:- Sometimes the gamplay can be a bit repetitive.- There should be an speedometer :3 . It's good to see the how fast ur car can go.- Story Is a bit disooriented . One thing just popped up in my mind. There could be a multiplayer system of mad max. There could be Online races, car combats among the players like carmeggadon.  There could have been some crews formed among players and fighting among  the crews over the territory control .It would gave the game a big edge and could have make it a bit more interesting and different from many games. I hope devs will listen to us.The fact is, it will push you to the limits. U can take risk but it has to calculative. Any wrong move and your car is done for sure.  And It's even risky to stay out open in the wasteland. Either Snipers or the cars will kill u for sure :3. Need to keep u r canteen filled up or eat a dead body for food""all these things just made me fall in love of this game.  Let's see how it ends up!			"

Posted: September 3, 2015
												(Warning: much words, such tl;dr)To start I will say this: I like this game so far, there's plenty that's good about it.That said, I'm sure everyone and their mother will be posting reviews about why it's good while glossing over the negative bits (which might not be negatives for everyone, I suppose). So I'm opting to talk about what I don't like here instead.This is, of course, personal opinion, just because I don't like something doesn't make it bad.-----------------------------The on-foot combat mechanics... I believe someone said they are ""reminiscent of the Batman: Arkham series"". If by 'reminiscent' you mean 'practically torn straight out', then I'm inclined to agree. The mechanics aren't bad or anything, it's just kind of disappointing that they more or less copy/pasted the brawling instead of trying to make something a little more unique.-----------------------------Certainly a more personal gripe, but I find the open-world collectible-hunting to be very tiresome. People compare it to Just Cause 2, and I see what they mean. Problem is, I gave up on JC2's collectibles less than 15% of the way through finding them all because I got bored of basically looking for the same few things over and over and over again in a colossal playable area where it was kind of difficult to distinguish one section of the world from any other save a few landmarks here and there. I'm not even quite finished with finding all the things in the first main area of Mad Max, and it's wearing thin.-----------------------------The bosses. Good god do I hate the bosses so far. See, I always imagined that if a Mad Max game was going to have bosses, they would be awesome. Like, each boss would actually have tangible importance, each would have a unique look, voice, personality, specialization. Most importantly though, they would have an awesome mobile death fortress of some kind, and the showdown with them would include a huge running battle where you have to use all the tools at your disposal to pick apart their defenses one piece at a time while dodging smaller support and assault vehicles before finally delivering the killing blow.The vehicle for each boss would be unique and require different strategies, and the baddies themselves would have enough backstory that you'd know why they need to die outside of the usual ""me good, they bad, they need go boom"" deal. Finally, when you killed them, it would matter. Enemies that once served under that boss would be more likely to either run from you in terror or go kamikaze in hopes of a glorious death against a worthy foe. NPCs would tell (probably exaggerated) stories around campfires of how you took down some of the scariest dudes in the wastes like it was nothing.Maybe even have a sort of Crackdown-esque kinda deal where each boss provided some important service that strengthened the final villain you'd have to face, and each one you took down would make the final challenge just that much easier.So, what are the two bosses I've faced so far? Well...The first boss was a huge dude with a gimp mask and an oversized mace that attacked by charging at me and swinging said mace.The second boss was a huge dude with a gimp mask and an oversized mace that attacked by charging at me and swinging said mace... and he had a bit of paint splattered on him and there were some random goons and jets of fire.I honestly could not tell you what the name of either boss was or what they had to do with anything. For all I know, they had nothing to do with Scrotus and were just upset because I walked into their favorite BDSM club and started murdering everyone. Considering I seem to be at least 20% through the game, and the only bosses so far seem pointless and practically identical, I get the feeling I'm going to be fighting Mr. Gimp's several other identical twins in more-or-less matching uniforms before the end of the game.Perhaps I'll be pleasantly surprised by a unique and interesting boss at some point, but even so... it's a really terrible first impression, and it makes me wonder whether fighting the bosses is really going to be worth it.I'm not looking forward to fighting Mr. Gimp VI with his fedora, and his gimmick weakness that sounds like the devs just wrote up slips of paper listing every way an enemy can die, put them in a hat, picked one at random and said ""Okay, so you have to kill this boss by performing shiv executions on him over and over again. Otherwise you'll have spend 3 hours whittling his health down with those shriveled mouse testicles you call knuckles"".-----------------------------On the topic of things that are terrible, what I thought was a glitch during a boss fight, I now believe be be the result of a very poor design choice (though I might be wrong). Whatever it is, I hope it gets patched out.See, the first time I fought the first boss, I died after running out of shotgun shells and dodging at the wrong moment one too many times. I respawned right outside the boss arena, and was ready to go in and give it another shot... when I realized I had no shotgun shells, despite having had a full load of four when hitting the checkpoint before the boss. The boss, of course, had full health (I expected that would be the case). I thought this was just an awful glitch. Later, I was driving around and boosted at the wrong second in the wrong place, and died as a result. Before the screen confirming that I had, in fact, not survived falling several dozen meters popped up, I noticed that the game autosaved as my corpse burned in the wreckage.Now, I know nothing about the fine details of programming a game, or how save systems work. But I am thinking that what happened during that boss fight earlier is that I used up all of my ammo and died, and the game decided to autosave the state of my resources at the time of my death, then punt me back to the last checkpoint with the same amount of resources I had upon dying. Which would be expected if this was made by FromSoftware, but it's not. Having your head splattered with a mace only to resurrect a short distance away might fit the Dark Souls lore, but it doesn't really mesh with the Mad Max universe, I think. If you die, you're dead. Ergo, when you load the last checkpoint/autosave, it ought to be as if everything after that point in time never happened.(tl;dr plz fix autosaving on death so I can find something else to whine about)-----------------------------To wrap things up, I'm going to change gears and relay the most awesome moment I've experienced with the game so far:Driving to a minefield with the turdbuggy, dog in tow and only two shotgun shells on me.A wild Scrotemobile appears!""♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just what I need right now.""Get in front of him, try to line up a shot through the windsheild, but the shotgun decides it wants to try targetting his rear left tire for some reason.Realizing that I'm going offroad, I look forward to avoid driving off a cliff or smashing into something.Barely swerve left to avoid ramming into a pillar.Weird physics stuff happens, resulting in the buggy spinning around a couple dozen times at mach 10 before landing in a perfect stop on all four wheels facing the exact opposite direction I had been driving.I instantly start aiming with the shotgun in hopes of killing the enemy driver, causing the game to go into bullet time.Apparantly, the baddie hit a bump and went flying through the air.The exact instant the game slowed down for aiming purposes, the Little Scrotemobile That Could torpedo'd the pillar with all the force of a great typhoon, resulting in what I can only refer to as 'what would happen if Michael Bay was directing a car chase scene for a Mission Impossible film after having gone three months without beating it to explosions'.There was much rejoicing.Ahh, if only the entire game could bring me that level of amusement...

												After the last PC fiascos coming out from Warner bros: Batman Arkham Origins/Knight & MK X, i hesitant to buy this game, but then, i give one more shoot to WB and in my younger days i loved the triology of movies Mad Max. With fear i buy MM and then install and start playing with afraid of the problems, bugs and gliches that could be appear, but miraculously the game its one of the best surprises of last times and now i never stop playing this sick title, I am completely surrendered to the Beauty of Mad Max, is so good, with a great history in extra large brutal post-apocalyptic, the combat system is similar to Batman's but much more evolved and extremely well done, Beautiful environments with a awesome graphics, perfectly optimized to this gen, i have a modest GPU (GTX 550 ti), and the game runs smooth and perfect.The game drinks influences of great titles, such as Rage, Red Faction Guerrilla, AC, Fallout 3 & LV, Tomb Raider (2014), Batman Arkham City, Far Cry, GTA, Fuel (Drive parts) and Just Cause, these are some of the titles that influence in the best way Mad Max, gonna get the positive aspects of these games and being well balanced and with a bunch of things to do. Of course Mad Max is not a GOTY, has some flaws, there is no multiplayer, confusing menu of the main quests, and the no apperance of the original Mad Max: Mel Gibson and Tina Turner (the legs, i never liked the music!!!!). Now guys surrender yourself to this game, as I did and now I might see the new movie of Mad Max: Fury Road, because this game open my appetite for more universe MAD MAX			"

												So... This is your typical sandbox as well as a literal one - you drive in a box across miles on miles of sand. And that is the game's problem. Sandbox games require lots of interensting or funny content. And it requires motivation. This game does have quite some content scattered around and if you count by numbers it's not bad, but the thing is, the map is way bigger. It is true to the series, lore, which is good, but not good for the game, especially, when existing content is not really that interesting. Besides, gameplay revolves too much around the car. Again - good for the lore, not so good for the game. Even though you have a goal, like to reach a certain place, yada-yada, in reality you still are doiong all this in order to pimp your ride. For me - it's not a motivation. This should be a side show and not the main dish.Technically, the game is not that bad. It looks good. Controls, even though a bit weird are fine. Although I am having issues with counter-attacks - it seems to be reacting with delay. ANd overall the quality of the game in general is good. If it was a linear game, a smaller one I think I would have been able to enjoy it, even though dialouges are like from the b-movies. Still, in sense, true to the origin.I am marking this as recomended, since Steam does not give us much choice, but I would recomend it to fans only. It does have a proper atmosphere. But if you are into sandbox or free-roam games... Well, you can try it on discount, but not sooner. Better play Borderlands then. They have sand and boxes, too.			"

Posted: September 23, 2015
 TL:DR at the end, scored 8 / 10 as of 31st October 2015 Borba likes:Genre - Third person action adventure in an open world environment. Sporting on foot and vehicular combat, progression through upgrades and exploration,with repetitive side missions and objectives.Narrative - Being a fan of the Mad Max universe, the story was spot on and the characters were distinctive and interesting. The overall plot was somewhat unpredictable, although a bit short, and the ending felt rushed and unimaginative.Gameplay - The on foot combat has similarities to Batman series' combat. You chain attacks with possible finishers and executions, parry when a visual cue appears, dodge roll and may use your firearm or enemies' weapons. Vehicular combat is more interesting, with targeted damage and several ways of destroying or disabling vehicles. Overall, its easy to learn and satisfying to perform.Interface - Obviously designed for consoles and gamepads, it performs solidly for keyboard and mouse users, despite being a bit buggish when accessing the garage to upgrade and swaping to the archangels section.Graphics - Taking into account Mad Max's apocalyptic world consists mostly of sand, rock and some metal, there are plenty details and landmarks to take in, and some interesting biomes to discover. The game is well optimized and looks great, in a grim and depressing way.Music - Both eerie and discrete during exploration, it quickly shifts into an energetic and tribal tone during combat. Borba considers it perfect in setting the mood for this universe.Sound - From simple sounds such as footsteps, to the crunchy combat and spectacular ambient effects, it adds much to the whole game experience and immersion.Polish - Going against the trend of ill-optimized triple A titles and the ""release now, patch later"" attitude, the game released with very few issues, and none that prevented Borba to perform a full playthrough within the first week of release. Despite a couple of graphics driver crashes that occurred, no save data was lost and the game's performance is consistent on high settings.Borba dislikes:Replayability - After finishing the story, Max gets back on the map so he can find all collectibles, get all upgrades and finish all challenges. Despite that, Borba doesn't feel compelled to do another playthrough, and feels this end game should provide more enemies to fight on foot and on vehicle, perhaps in the form of several arenas or more varied challenges.Design - This, is what separates a mediocre game from something truly special. Overall, Mad Max is pretty mediocre as an open world action adventure game due to the fact it has such repetitive side quests that provide an obligatory grind to get the upgrades needed for the main quest line. Solid and fun game mechanics ( combat ) mitigate this situation, but one can only wish there was more love put into the enemy strongholds ( fighting the same bosses in different environments doesn't cut it for Borba ) and more interesting dialogue into the encounters with friendly characters. Maybe with some DLC, introducing new things to do ( arenas and on foot / vehicle combat challenges! ) other than finding collectibles, completing the map and racing challenges.Borba feels like despite Mad Max being a solid game with fun combat and many upgrades to unlock, it could have been so much more than a wasteland grind for completionists such as himself. If unsure, consider the game when it gets a good discount, for it is still a solid game that looks as well as it runs, great!8/10 "

												What a game! What a lovely game!!!! All Shiny and Chrome riding into Valhalla has never been so satisfying. Sorry I just had to. If you liked Fury Road you are going to love this game. Combat is exhilarating meaning I had a grin everytime I blown something up. Mad Max is wonderfully optimised I get an average of 80fps at 1440p on a single 970 which is quite an achievement in this day and age considering the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports we are getting in the past few years. Story is interesting but I will update the review after I complete it. Apart from main missions there are quite a few activities in the wasteland ranging from capturing bases(far cry style but better) to taking down sniper nests and so on but I like the random encounters quite a lot. Their is a dynamic day & night cycle at certain times the game is a sight to be hold. I love this game I literally cannot stop playing this who knew scrap MaX would be so much fun.10/10 Would Valhalla again!!!			"

												Just finished the main storyline / campaign.It's a good, solid game.Didn't have to deal with any of the sadly almost obligatory typical release date issues with most major games nowadays.That in itself is a bonus.For people who love the mad max franchise there is plenty of stuff, details, characters, places etc that fit right into this universe.The environment including day/night cycle, weather, sky, clouds etc is beautiful.The story/setting as a dystopian world with all hope gone works. It is dirty, brutal, bloody, gory and i loved it.The melee based combat system works and is pretty satisfying.Repetition might be an issue however: think of any other open world title which features more or less similar gameplay mechanis - these suffer similar criticism. The bases/places to 'conquer' vary in design/look/feel. I don't compare this game to mgs 5, coincidental release dates do not mean one has to decide for one or the other. Enjoy them both.Overall a nice open world game with a refreshing dessert apocalyptic ( australian )  setting. Recommend it - for open world enthusiasts in general and for mad max fans in particular.			"

												There's undoubtedly something awesome about Mad Max. Its open world is sprawling, its driving fantastic, and its melee action is simple, but effective. The problem with Mad Max, if you can call it that, is that it's filled with ""filler"" content. Tasks that seem there just to give you something to extend your playtime. Some of it is fun, others (like mine fields) are pretty uninspired. In the end though, Mad Max is still a good game. I just hope it's the beginning of a franchise, one that can grow and become something even better.			"

												I have been playing this game since it came out and must say its nice to not be let down like so many games of late. I had fears this may be a glorified GTA: Mad Max game but its so much more. Nice graphics and a great combat system both on foot and in vehicle, Really captures the feel of the early max movies scavenging for food, water and the scarce ammo of course. Day and night cycles with random weather elements thrown in such as dust storms and the deadly electric storms seemingly coming at you at the most inopportune moment or when there is no cover near. Every NPC u meet is not necessarily hostile with random wasteland survivors seeking water and such and ur choice whether to aid them in return for information or just to keep your sanity.Runs great on ultra all maxed out settings and i look forward to playing much more of this game, u know your enjoying it when you can simply be completing side quests at your own leisure without being forced to complete huge story chunks to unlock new areas. The world is open completely from the start of the game to explore at your own risk. I would definately recommend this game to max fans and people who are into apocolypse games. I hear some critics panning this already but it simply shows how wrong some can be in their opinions when the steam community seems to be enjoying this title overall.			"

												I absolutely love this game. It's like Far Cry 3 in that you have to take camps so allies can occupy them, and it's like Rage with the way enemies come at you on the road. There are also strongholds that serve as home bases, and there are various ways of building them up so they serve Max better. I've seen some reviews claiming it's too survival heavy because ammo, water, etc, is scarce, but if you build up the strongholds, you really don't have to worry about all that and just have fun wreaking havoc.Scrap metal is a necessity if you're to upgrade your car and even yourself so you can handle the increasing difficulty of the game.I feel this game nails what it set out to do, which was put the player in a Mad Max world, and I especially love the car battles! I keep wanting to gather more scrap so I can turn my car into more of a beast, and this need is also the driving force to do favors for others, which moves the story along and keeps the action pumped.The characters are fun and well-acted, and the Batman-type combat is fluid. Buy this game and be witnessed!			"

												Mad Max is a great game if you love open world action games.The story was okay. Max himself is supposed to be this broken man who has given up on trust and others, which ties into his character. I found out that this made him more of a mundane character over an interesting one. He only begins to show interesting desire at the end of the game. The story kept me mildly interested most of the time.The gameplay is very fun. I was hesitant to get this game after hearing that it is repetitive, but I found that I experienced none of that. The combat is extremely satisfying in the Arkham style that so many games are copying these days, and the open world aspects are done well. The customizing of the Magnum Opus is fantastic, and I was always excited to get it upgraded further. The bosses were very dissapointing, with really only a few types of bosses reskinned over and over.This game is definitely worth the buy, but I found the main story was a bit shorter than I would have liked. If you don't only do story missions and actually take the time to complete the open world aspects, it works.			"

												Finished this game after 56 hours. Basically most of the game consists of this scenario:You drive towards something and get attacked by some enemy vehicles. You blow them up then arrive at your location which is either a camp or a scavenge location, both are shown on the map.You kill all (very dumb) enemies at the location clicking left and right mouse button and your movement keys. And collect scrap metal (that is the in-game currency) scattered around. The game tells you how many scrap metal the location has.That's it. The redeeming factor of this game is the combat, the enemies, the cars, the locations and the scenery ooze Mad Max atmosphere. Even though exploring a location only rewards you with scrap metal it is still fun because everything is so well done. All locations have little details and a LOT of gore. It is Far Cry 4 without a stealth mechanic but with car combat.Is it a good game? No. Is it a fun game? Yes.EditOh and the minimum requirements are wrong. I have exactly the minimum required CPU, the Phenom II X4 965, and run this game with everything on high, some stuff at very high and everything enabled. I could probably turn the settings up even further but haven't bothered because the game already looks excellent.			"

												So,What do you get when you combine an apocalyptic wasteland with great characters, spectacular gameplay, the chaos of vehicular combat and a great levelling system?Answer: Mad Max.And so begins my review.Graphics: Stellar, with mild system requirements. Any mid-range rig (~2014) should be able to handle this title at high settings with playable framerates. At the present, there are no glitches, stutters or crashes observed while playing this title. Well optimized.Gameplay: Engaging. Nothing here comes free, not even upgrades. Prepare to maraud and survive in this titular wasteland as you sCAVENGE for scrap, come to blows with Scrabrous' minions, destroy oil rigs, disarm mine fields and upgrade your vehicle. Story: This is damn good. Characters are well portrayed, and the Mad max themes from the genre are easily carried over as a homage to the series. We see unrequited love, betrayal, greed, malice and survivalism. The Hope and Glory's arch moved me deeply; well developed characters who met an untimely end out of Max's choices and Chumbucket's betrayal at the end. However, the linearitty of it all lowers it a notch; the player has no real choice to make.Overall rating: 9/10 for the fine work, attention to detail, stellar graphics and customizability, the epic photo mode and an epic and engaging playthrough. One of the severerlyunderrated epics of 2015.You will not regret playing this. Promise.All in all, comes highly recommended.			"

												Lemme tell you... This game is amazing. I don't write reviews for products on any platform normally, but I think this game deserves it.  It captures barren, wasted Australia better than I could ever imagine. In the vast plains of drought, you'd think this game would be somewhat boring, driving around along the dirt roads, surrounded by empty space. This is not the case at all. Mad Max has provided one of the most interesting possible cases for a post-apocalyptic world. It illustrates, in my opinion, the constant threat of a kill-or-be-killed universe far better than any of the movies. I would have bought this game at full price even if the gameplay wasn't to die for. The progression involving your companions and machines is well put together and really makes you want to do everything there is to do in that game to make yourself as badass as possible. The story bits may be few and far apart, but all other aspects of the game compensate more than enough. If you have the hardware and the cash, buy this game.			"

												If devs could mix assassins creed combat with GTA racing, Mad Max would be born. The game starts with a roar and ends with the gamer wondering if doing it again is worth it.The story (which is a pretty interesting one to say the least) revolves around the gamer playing as Max, a man scavenging the desert wastelands. As you progress through the game, you unlock upgrades for your car and perform different missions for various warlords. Max does this in hope of getting to gastown, a town filled with all the guzzoline (not gasoline) one could wish for. Unfortunately, the whole wasteland is overrun by Scrotus's War Boys. Max has to clear out their camps to get rid of the threat in different areas.The gameplay is simple but has it's moments of fun. There are only two buttons required for combat : parry and strike. While it is simple, clearing out 10 to 15 guys in a in a camp is satisfying until it starts becoming redundant.  Additionally while engaging in combat, cans of gas can be lit on fire to blow up enemies and shotguns can be used to get enemies at a distance. The driving part is fun due to it's simplicity but isn't as action packed as clearing a camp The driving controls are your basic right trigger to accelerate and joystick to control the wheels. The car has the ability to ram into others with a simple tap of the button. The car, the Magnum Opus is very customizable. The areas that of the car such as engine (transmission), body armor and thunder poons, which is the coolest weapon. Additionally,  players can acquire cool hood ornaments that give the car upgrades. To take down enemies in towers, sniper rifles and harpoons can be used for extreme distances. There are many ways to keep entertained when roaming around, you may clear out scarecrows, scavenge war boy locations, and (of course) clear out gas camps.Graphics and sounds are also well done in this game. If your car takes damage, it's very apparent. Max will be bruised up and walk with a limp if he falls a certain distance. Your car can also go up in flames if you damage it too much. There is a neat visual feature in which Max's hair becomes longer over the course of the game. Max himself is also customizable. The sand looks very clean as do all the enemies. (When you bump into rocks or drive through a large pool of sand, the environment will react to you. There is a huge variation in the Scrotus War Boys compared to the many enemies that appear very different. The camps also look amazing. Many details are put into secret entrances into the camps so it is difficult to find the small opening you need to get in. The progression through camps is also what makes them special. Many small details go into making the huge world look clear to the human eyes. The water and sand look like they should but they vary in their appearance depending on which region Max is in. The enemies make noises when they fall off ledges and get hit. The sound is clear and grunts are well heard. Max seems to be in an active environment at all times.The story line/campaign could have been better but seems to be the high light of the game. As I've said, it becomes repetitive : go collect or defeat this warlord can lose its grace after a while. Clearing out minefields and scarecrows can easily become tedious (and booooring). Also, when you have to drive across the map for sulphur, that's enough to drive anyone crazy. The game is good but has the potential to be a lot better. Following missions and clearing out camps can keep only keep you busy and entertained to a certain extent. All in all, this is a decent game. If you enjoy driving around in a free world like GTA and a bit of action raiding camps, this will appeal to you. It seems everyone I talk to either quit this game after 2 hours or kept playing it. It truly is a game in which I feel anyone can pick up and learn to play easily within an hour (which isn't always necessarily bad)!I will recommend this game but with extreme caution. If one of your friends has this and their sharing this game with you, better to play it that way!RATING : Regular average 7.0/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C Overall  C+ScreenShots :////to come			"

												tl;dr version in the end-----------I usually don't make long reviews, unless it's a game that got overlooked and worth giving a chance.Mad Max Is an Action RPG Open-World game developed by the same studio that brought you Just Cause games.At first you would say ""Another game based on a movie? Nah, it will be crap""But this isn't the case. This is really probably the best movie tie-in Video Game in long, long time.This Game feels like a 3rd person version of RAGE (remember RAGE? another post-apocalyptic game).You get a car, you upgrade it and your arsenal, gets to several areas/strongholds/camps, meets new people, gets missions and so on.Story: 6/10The Story, however isn't really that outstanding.Mad Max gets picked on by War Boys, stole his car and he want to get it back to continue his journey, instead he found a guy that offered him a ""Car with potential"".

Your Magnum Opus equipped with a Harpoon to pull enemies and objects with and a Rocket-Launcher-like weapon to destroy other cars and metallic gates and a Sniper Rifle to take down long range enemies.

There are historic relics that give you some other people's thoughts and concerns from the world before the Nuclear weapons fell. They are really interesting to read.Graphics & Design: 9/10The game is surprisingly very detailed. The environment, the locations and in-doors places are very well-designed.like the sand hills which looks beautiful and realistic in the desert areas, and the mountainous and valleys areas looks damn gorgeous giving the perfect post-apocalyptic sight.The Character models and animations are detailed, high quality stuff.Bosses: 5/10The worst thing about this game is probably the Boss Fights. There are several Bosses (named TopDogs here)in each Stronghold and at the end of several missions. But the problem is.... They Are ALL the SAME.They are all the same design, same pattern, same animations, and the same way you have to do to take them down.It feels like it's just 1 boss that spawn in different locations. No variety at all. Good thing they don't appear all the time so it's just a matter of choice to encounter them all.Upgrade System: 7.5/10Another unique, but annoying feature of the game.The upgrade system doesn't rely on the player experience points gained from battles or missions. Instead, it rely on Challenges made throughout your actions. Like defeating enemies with specific ways or take them down within a specific time. In addition to character upgrade point which you can spend on Health Points, Loot/Ammo/Water/Food bonus,etc...That's for Max's character abilities. For Car's upgrades, they get unlocked for more reduction of threats you made in the world.Other upgrades are only unlocked for completing specific missions.Conclusion: 8.5/10 Don't really know if i can recommend it for a full price or on sale. I got it $20 and enjoyed it.So, it's depends in your budget.Quick Summarized Review: The Good:+ Too many things to do+ Combat System is well-made+ Taking over Strongholds and Camps is fun+ Collecting relics is a fun read+ Upgrading Max and the Magnum Opus is super rewarding+ Beautiful and detailed world environment + Missions and side missions are variedThe Bad:| Upgrading things you want can takes too long time to unlock| Lowering threats for car upgrades can be repetitive and annoyingThe Ugly:- Absolutely no variety for Bosses. It's just 1 Boss with different skins.- Max has an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character.			"

												Great job Avalanche and WB, you have managed to get things right and delived a very good game, In my opinion that is..It may not be based on the latest movie but there are indeed some dlc options you may want to consider like the itroduction of motorcycle gangs etc as they are as much part of Mad Max lore as the iconic interceptor			"

												tl;dr version in the end-----------I usually don't make long reviews, unless it's a game that got overlooked and worth giving a chance.Mad Max Is an Action RPG Open-World game developed by the same studio that brought you Just Cause games.At first you would say ""Another game based on a movie? Nah, it will be crap""But this isn't the case. This is really probably the best movie tie-in Video Game in long, long time.This Game feels like a 3rd person version of RAGE (remember RAGE? another post-apocalyptic game).You get a car, you upgrade it and your arsenal, gets to several areas/strongholds/camps, meets new people, gets missions and so on.Story: 6/10The Story, however isn't really that outstanding.Mad Max gets picked on by War Boys, stole his car and he want to get it back to continue his journey, instead he found a guy that offered him a ""Car with potential"". But Max found out that car can't withstand the harsh environment, so he need to work hard to upgrade it so he can get out of the place to somewhere else.Gameplay: 8.5/10Mad Max is a 3rd Person Action RPG.

												Mad Max is an action, open-world game that sends you inside one of the best movie of 2015. Usually, I tend to avoid games based on movies, because more than often they are rushed titles whose only purpose is to sell using the name of the movie. So, what happened that made me change my mind about buying such a potentially bad game? Mainly, Steam reviews. With a solid 90% positive reviews I thought to give the game a chance, besides I'm also a big fan of Mad Max movies, a post apocalyptic genre lover and the game was 66% discounted during Christmas. I bought it and it was a real, amazing surprise.TECHNICAL ASPECTS***GAMEPLAY 8/10Mad Max gameplay is amazing, but unfortunately it is flawed by some aspects that may bore the gamers. As I said, the game is open-world, Max can travel by foot (not a very good nor smart idea), by car (best idea) or by fast travel (anti-boredom idea). Why is fast travel anti boredom? Simply because the world is HUGE, it's like Skyrim but in a desert with almost no life, so even with a car, but nothing to do it gets boring. The environment is really well made, don't get me wrong, I tried to avoid using fast travel (I'm not a big fan of it), but if you want to 100% complete the game, traveling, even with your fastest car, becomes a nuisance.Now, let's talk about fighting. Take the Batman Arkham franchise, strip the Bat of it's costume, grow Wayne a big bushy beard, give him some ragged clothes, a double barrel shotgun and throw him in a desert, done ? Good, you now have Max, a man that fights (kinda) like the Gotham vigilante. What is great about this in Mad Max is that you can perform some finisher moves depending on the environment. Is your enemy with his back against a wall ? Grab his head and smash it on said wall. Is your enemy the sniper in that tall tower that just blow up one of your car tires? Find a way to sneak up on him and push him over the ledge of his tower, no more sniping for you ... Baiatch ! Do you like the sound of your shotgun? Grab an enemy and gut shot him... again, and again, and again, and ... damn I ran out of ammo.Once your enemies are all dead you can go back to your car and chill out... wait no ... a war party approaching !!! Fighting in Mad Max doesn't end when you enter your car, it really begins there. If you have seen the 2015 movie you know what I'm talking about, if not go buy the DVD and then buy the game (I'm not joking). Car fights are almost exactly like the ones you see in the movie: ramming, grinding, burning, harpooning, blowing up tires, fuel tanks or drivers. The only problem about cars is that the game doesn't like to see cars upside down, so whenever you flip your car and start sliding on your hood, some mystical force flips your car back on its wheels.All of this you'll be able to do by buying the right upgrade for Max or the car, there are a lot of them. For Max there are the classic upgrades : better armour, more HPs, special combos, etc. For the car there are car bodies, tires, ramming grills, engines, hood ornaments, harpoons, spikes (to impale enemies that try to jump on your car) pipes that shoot flames and much more. Each upgrade will cost you scrap (the currency of the game), you get scrap by completing missions, looting enemies or locations and by destroying enemy vehicles. It is hard to have enough at the beginning, but doing side missions helps you a lot and eventually you end up having more than you need. Last thing I'll explain about gameplay is what made the Steam reviews drop from 97% positive to 90% : the lack of diversity for what concerns side missions. In Mad Max you have the possibility of roam free around the map doing things like destroying enemy convoys or liberating outposts. Although these things are fun and give you the opportunity of doing something other than the main quest, they are basically all the same, they just get a bit harder the more you go on. These enemy outposts for example, are different only in their appearance, one is inside a chasm, while another was built on an abandoned oil rig. The problem is that you always have to do the same thing, fight your way among enemies and blow things up or kill the boss. Here, the bosses, or I should say ""big guys who look all the same except for the colour of their clothes"", this is the worst thing of the game, these guys are supposed to be generals, not cannon fodder, so I expect them to be unique, to fight in different ways, to die in different ways, well... no, they are all the same, they fight all in the same way, and you kill them in the same way.***STORY and LORE 9/10It's not the main thing of the game obviously, but I guess it's noticeable by the fact that I wrote a poem about the gameplay and almost nothing about the story. However, it is good, not excellent but good enough, it follows up the event of the movie but doesn't cross them, so the game and the movie remain separated but in the same context. It also seems that George Miller, the director and inventor of Mad Max, supervised some aspects of the game, the lore in particular, I've read that he likes the idea of being allowed to explain things (in a game for example) that you cannot explain in a movie (for obvious reason of time). So, when going around doing quests you come across some ""relics"" that give you hints on what happened to the world. When you start the game you may think you're in a desert in Australia, but it's not just a desert it's  the bottom of the ocean, now dry due to some mysterious event, (probably global warming) .If you want a short summary of the story keep reading (I won't spoil anything important)The game starts with Max driving his beloved Interceptor, you get attacked by Scrotus (one of Immortan Joe sons) you manage to kill Scrotus but your car gets stolen and scrapped. Then, you encounter a hunchback named Chumbucket, a blackfinger (title given to those who are skilled mechanics), who wants to help you because he says to have seen you in a vision and thinks you're the ""Saint"" (an envoy of the goddess called Angel Combustion). He builds a new car, the Magnum Opus and comes with you to help you get a V8 engine that is supposed to allow you to continue your journey through the desert.During the game you come across other characters, some crazier than others, who help you if, of course, you help them first and you do that until you reach Gastown. What happens then, I let you discover by yourself. ***GRAPHICS 10/10Amazing, nothing less. Even though it's not perfect I give the game a 10 because it runs at a steady 60fps on (Mad)Max settings 99% of the time, I dropped under 50 only twice, but there was really a lot going on on screen. The game is so well optimized that makes other AAA games look bad. Everything about the environment is unique, each region has its unique features and look. You don't have the impression of being in the same place, even though you're in a desert with only rocks, sand and some scattered ruins, but what really shines here are the storms.Storms are random events that can occur when you are out in the open, your companion Chumbucket will scream ""Storm approaching !"" and will point in that direction, you move the camera and you see it : a front of black clouds of dust moving towards you at incredible speed. You may try to outrun it and find somewhere to hide, but you'll miss all the fun, so pedal to the metal and run inside the storm. Everything turns black for a second, the wind howling covers even the sound of the engine, lightning starts falling from the sky and you have to steer to avoid being hit... it is so damn fun, if you manage to find some crazy enemy inside a storm is even better.***SOUND 9/10I'm running out of space to write so I'll just say that sound is great: engines, explosions, bone breaking or dislocating, car grinding to each other. Best part of it is voice acting.OVERALL SCORE 9/10			"

												This is a good game… but also not a good game. How do I explain? Quick thoughts below:Just a line on the graphics and the performance of the game, both are excellent, it is a lovely ,looking game and it runs flawlessly (bodes well for Just Cause 3), now onto the game itself.Mad Max about 3 things, Driving, Fighting and Upgrading your car, everything else in the game is merely a vehicle (no pun intended) to allow you to do one of those 3 things. Tasks in Mad Max are repetitive with copy and paste quests and objectives as you explore the map, which some people, including myself would describe as busy work, or padding, or even grinding if I were to be harsh.Thing is though, they are all tasks which let you do three things;  Almost always you’ll first be driving around meaning you’ll be blowing up, ramming and dismantling other cars with your harpoon gun whilst hurtling through an apocalyptic Australian outback complete with dried up seabed’s and places to explore and scavenge. You'll then get to where you're going and you'll be Fighting, usually against multiple opponents in an Arkham style fighting system with brutal animations and sound effects, Max isn't a well-trained ninja but a brawler, handy in a fight and able to look after himself and that really comes across.After that you'll have earned some scrap to upgrade your car, as well as Max, buying new engines, tyres, armour, weapons, special moves etc etc.And... rinse then repeat. It is this pattern over and over with some slight variance here and there for story missions. Whether you like this game or not comes down to how much you enjoy those 3 things, and for me, I really did. That's why I played it for 41 hours and finished a lot of the game before doing the story.Of course it isn’t totally as simple as that, there are other things for you to do and even the above 3 activities are wrapped up in narrative driven reasoning or have a tagged on objective, but trust me when I say you’ll always be driving, fighting and upgrading. That is the meat and potatoes of Mad Max.Those 3 mechanics might not work for some and therefore they would bounce right off it and think it is an average or even a poor game. Not in my eyes, one of the most enjoyable games in 2015 for me and I hope you think the same should you give it a go. "

												A great game in the Mad Max universe, more in the atmosphere of the 2015 movie than the older ones. I found myself really immersed in the gorgeous open-world with a vast amount of locations to visit and things to do. The wasteland has beautiful sights to see and the ruins of the old-world call out for exploration. Graphics are excellent and I believe this was the best optimised game for PC in 2015. Combat on foot is in the style of Arkham series with nice animations and fluid moves. Vehicle combat is a little hard at the beginning, but gets a lot more fun once you upgrade the vehicle. I left no stone unturned, so this game took me about 50h to complete. There is no replayability, except maybe for the races, but the time spent was of high-quality. Overall: one of my favourite games in 2015 and I can not recommend this enough if you are into the open-world genre.			"

												My life fades. The vision dims. All that remains are memories. I remember a time of chaos... ruined dreams... this wasted land. But most of all, I remember The Road Warrior. The man we called ""Max."" To understand who he was, you have to go back to another time... when the world was powered by the black fuel... and the desert sprouted great cities of pipe and steel. Gone now... swept away. For reasons long forgotten, two mighty warrior tribes went to war, and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all. Without fuel they were nothing. They'd built a house of straw. The thundering machines sputtered and stopped. Their leaders talked and talked and talked. But nothing could stem the avalanche. Their world crumbled. The cities exploded. A whirlwind of looting, a firestorm of fear. Men began to feed on men. On the roads it was a white line nightmare. Only those mobile enough to scavenge, brutal enough to pillage would survive. The gangs took over the highways, ready to wage war for a tank of juice. And in this maelstrom of decay, ordinary men were battered and smashed... men like Max... the warrior Max. In the roar of an engine, he lost everything... and became a shell of a man... a burnt-out, desolate man, a man haunted by the demons of his past, a man who wandered out into the wasteland. And it was here, in this blighted place, that he learned to live again.			"

Talking about big map with nice details.. Story is pretty well made of and its kinda long. Tons of things to do but most of the things you will do, will get pretty repetitive. That is the only downfall for the game.

												If you're a fan of the franchise, this a game you can't pass up. It has everything an action genre fanatic would love and then some. The car battles and the on-foot combat are filled with adrenaline inducing moments that'll keep you going. The combat is like the Batman Arkham Asylum series. I can't say more on that really except that it was oh so rewarding...The car mechanics are polished enough that you'll actually feel the subtle differences in each car upgrade whether it be the suspension or the engine upgrades.The story is just as good as the movies but don't expect anything grammy worthy.The NPCs voice acting is terrible but everything else can distract you from that. The Environments are so damn beautiful, I'd get lost from time to time just looking at em. I think this is where the game truly shines. The team behind the game really managed to make this world feel like Mad Max.			"

												Look, overall this game just gets boring too quickly, its a very grind heavy game with very little reward, however if you pop an adderall and can really sit the hours of dreary grind, the games mechanics aren't that bad. This game was too grind heavy for me personally which is why I cannot recommend it to others, but some may have no problem with an overly grindy system.			"

												""Where must we go, we who wander this wasteland, in search of our better selves?""-The First History ManI just completed all the achievements for this game,  so I thought I'd drop some thoughts.  Mad Max is a solid and immersive experience, though it does have some significant flaws that prevent it from being amazing. The story is fitting for a Mad Max tale, though like the films, it's the action that makes the game fun. There is some interesting mysticism sprinkled here and there as well.  Max himself fits the reluctant hero archetype very well. His sidekick, Chumbucket, acts great as Max's foil and comic relief to the harshness of the wasteland, which itself is beautifully rendered. There are other characters scattered here and there, though not enough for the player to care for them. Ground combat follows the Batman formula; various finisher unlocks help keep it fresh. Vehicle combat is where the game shines as you can upgrade your car to have some killer weapons and defensive items. PROS:-Performance (Best PC port in a long time, looks beautiful, runs smooth)-Vehicle Combat (You can harpoon stuff!)-Environments (Lots of detail for an open world; the wasteland is filled with all kinds of scenes that tell a story of the apocalypse without having to spell it out for you. Lots of cool and disturbing imagery all around. I found myself in the game's great photo mode grabbing amazing screenshots that now serve as awesome wallpapers)-Immersion (You are Max, and you are a cold, yet broken badass. Very easy to get lost in this wasteland, much more interesting to me than the other post apocalyptic game right now)CONS:-Side quests too repetitive / too much grinding -Lack of End Game content (This is what keeps this game from being amazing; you spent a long time upgrading Max and your car, only for the game to be virtually empty by the time you are ready to be a true Road Warrior. The best vehicular combat scenarios, the convoys, for instance, never respawn. The game is desperately in need of a way to reset enemy camps and convoys, or a New Game+ mode.. not sure this will happen as Avalanche is busy with Just Cause 3)-Difficulty (It's pretty easy, and you can make Max pretty overpowered pretty fast - could use a Survival mode of some sort)OTHER THOUGHTS:I'm not a completionist usually, but for this game I didn't want it to end so I did a lot of grinding that I don't like doing.  Note: If you want to 100%, look at the challenges first and plan your attack; if you get rid of all Threat Level in the game too early, it will be very difficult/annoying to complete some of the challenges required. See End Game comments above. Where are the War Rigs? Would be awesome if the convoys had big trucks that you had to board. Imagine fighting War Boys on a moving behemoth, before finally taking out the driver and hijacking the truck. Generally this game needs more convoys and maybe even convoy escort missions.			"

												You got amazing franchise, and created huge, beautiful, smooth map.What would you do next?1) Create stunning story? Pfff, bad guys destroyed my car, I need another one with V8 engine.2) Ok, maybe interesting quests? Pfff, I said no, you are the errand boy, go there, take this, maybe beat some♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this guys.15 or so would be more than enough for anyone! All others are just collectibles in sake of collectibles, or achievements. 3) Ok, ok, different factions and enemies? Yeah, I will just copypaste them and reskin, that would be ok, nobody will notice.4) Oh, about reskins, how do you like fighting the same boss 8 times? No? Why, I think this is awesome, and all of them have different colors!5) What about NPCs? Well, they are actually cool, they have personalities, in fact they have much more personality than Max himself. BUT (this game is a huge BUT), NPCs have so little on screen time,that you will never have time to feel any empathy to them. (Chumbucket does not count, he is the BEST that this game have)Third plane NPCs are just decoration, if we remove them, the game will loose nothing.6) And the last is game mechanics, ohhhhh, it is GOOOD, BUT (did I tell you about BUTs in this game?) it is implemented so poorly. The game is VERY EASY. Car and Max progression, made the way, that after 1/3 of the gamenothing have a chance to stop you. This made the game DULL. Huge map and nothing sensible to do with it.Unfortunately this game is just a husk of something that could be so awesome...			"

												An absolutely unbelievable game, exactly what is to be expected from a ""Mad Max"" experience. My only real qualms with the game are that while it is ""Open World"" one has to complete a set of tasks to move to the next part of the world itself. That being said these tasks are generally quite fun and generate scrap ""Mad Max Cash"" either way, so no biggie. Certainly there will be alot of people comparing this game to others, it has various games it draws from for sure. Specifically Batman Arkham City, GTA V, Shadows of Mordor and even Red Faction Guerilla. If you like any of these games, this is sort of the baby.  And don't forget, WHAT A LOVELY DAY!

												Im only 7 hours into it. yea its an ok game. it looks great. however..... it is basically fetch quests over and over again.and be prepared to see the same mini cutscenes a million times....no, I don't need a close up everytime I eat maggots, dogfood or drink water. its ♥♥♥♥♥♥.my main gripe, its my fault, is that I didn't realize it was 3rd person only.It seems like a console port thatis shined up. combat is basically button mashing.driving is kinda fun but gets old too.get it on sale if you want it.

Posted: September 5, 2015
												So my constructive review on Mad Max Game!As many of you know about my reviews, I go into more detail than needed but it works out in the end.So lets start with the basics:Graphics: This game is extremely well made on the optimize section. Maxed out graphics is super smooth on my crossfire 7950s and the game does look really nice. I played maxed out at 2560x1440p and the game was smooth as butter, even streaming game it ran smooth without a single problem. The most optimized game to date, better that GTAThe graphics in total are decent, really they are nice to look at and has some really cool effects with the glass effect on the cars, dents and scratches. Really well done!Audio: There is not much to really comment on this, you have car sounds bombing around, but the car sounds do sound pretty nice, with the grumble from the different engines. The main character looks and sounds like the guy from ""The Last Of Us"" Literally and the music I find annoying, so I turned it off, the overal bumps, sand poof and what not is nothing special.Controls: This is what I do not like at all! The car handles horrible, really... If you ever played APB: Reloaded then you know what I am on about here because it handles about the same! When driving and turning, it's like you are trying to ride an ice cube, down a wet iced path and hit a pin at the end. It's really horrible to drive I think, and takes some time getting used too. The way the character moves aswell is also annoying. You have to be RIGHT infront of the ladder to actually climb it, no matter if you are looking at it and beside it, up against it.. You MUST be directly played infront and sometimes you can just tap the key and the character will dart off an edge or something. The way he moves it annoying! Gameplay: So this is an open world game, kinda sandbox if you will but limited. You have a car, a man and a chum to go on your quest. Lots of missions in the game really are stupid, go here, talk to this man, go back and talk to chum, now chum wants an item, go and get it and come back, but sometimes the items are less than a few feet away, but he STILL wants you to get it, then you get it and it's done, like ""THE HELL!!!""Also jumping, the character barely jumps over a book and you often find yourself running around things because he cannot get up the size of a paper back book.... I was able to jump around things and yet he could not step over something and it forced me on one path ONLY. The game is kinda linear in that aspect.Shooting.... When you press right click, your character will stop dead in his tracks and you CANNOT, I repeat you CANNOT move at all... You cannot move and shoot, you must stay still.. What the hell is with that I do not know!You spend most of the time doing the same missions back and for, talking just to build the car. This game is all about the car parts it seems. Not much about anything else from what I can tell.  So far the missions I have seen has been the same as every other one... Bored me!The combat is simple button smash, right click and back to smashing.... Literally batman fight system and it's okay for the first fight, maybe the second but then it's boring!There are no grabbing attacks, holding to counter to attack someone else, using proper fighting... It's simple button smash fighting. Taking a strong hold... (Take it sniper, take out flame thrower barrel) enter and beat more people up... Every single base is the same to take out. Nothing new in any!You can only carry ONE jerry can (Fuel can) in the car at one time, no matter if you find more, they are wasted. You can only carry one supply of water on you at a time, you cannot even store any in the vehicle! Which is a very stupid thing to do when the game is meant to be a post apocalyptic world.  (These are things that annoyed me and made me bored)There is also a lot of this fuel around, even though your car barely uses that many... You can find near enough every point a Jerry can to fill up the car, but barely using that much fuel you do not need it, you cannot store it so you just waste it. Pointless!There is also no coop or no multiplayer.. LITERALLY!!! So people may say, ""Yeah but it's a wasteland and you are the last man alive"" and too which I reply ""So who are the other people you meet and greet in the game?"" There ARE normal people in the game that are not physco and this game would benefit so much more having a team behind you, making a stronghold together, increasing the odds of forming your own alliance, but no! Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only just and I really mean only just... 51% so 49% no, because it does offer some good gameplay for a few hours but then it becomes the same thing around, scavange, talk, fix, scavenge, talk, fix and that too me is the reason plus above no coop I stopped playing the game. So it only, and I mean ONLY just gets a recommend from me!			"

												This is the worst kind of open game.It has little challenge, and you will not be stuck anywhere because its too hard.It has alot of upgrades. But you dont care.It has alot of collectable photos of the past. But you do not care.It has alot of sidemissions for different factions. But you do not care.So why do you not care? Because there is no soul in the game. You just drive around and do the same thing over and over. "

												After over 50 hours' gaming time, I've still left nearly half of the entire map unexplored. Repetitive as the gameplay is, it's fun and cool. And I don't care to repeat doing something interesting, just as the things we all like to do in bed. And by that I mean sleep. Don't get me wrong :)This game is also a fan game if you like the movie edition of Mad Max (the 4th sequel). The characters' style design plus the story's background are pretty much the same as those in the movie. I like the movie, so I enjoy this game, too.I especially think this game is worthwhile because I bought it on the passing summer sale. I recommend you do it too someday,  because it'll make you feel even better when you are enjoying such a gorgeous game at the super nice price.Also, the game's optimization is as awesome as being able to run smoothly at 30~40 FPS with graphic quality switched to HIGH on my Nvidia 650TI GTX card, I5 processor, more than expected and totally acceptable for me.So if you have become bored in the luxury in the city or the scenery in the wild, I truly recommend you try this game for a bit change. What you will get is a big post apocalyptic desert world which you've never experienced before. If you happen to have watched the Japanese anime ""Hokuto No Ken (Fist of the North Star)"", you'll find they share a very similar historical background. Actually I've been always humming the theme song of the anime during my gameplay: YouはShock~Come on, men~ Start your engines!			"

												Looks nice and runs very smoothly on my 7 year old PC, but the actual game itself is boring. You will spend most of it doing a checklist of collectables and busywork - all just padding the game out to make it longer than it actually is.

Regardless of its combat system, beautiful graphics design and maddening enemies! Living in a world where religion knows no place, gasoline and water are sacred to you and of course, Max looks brutal and tougher! Should watch the movie too!			"

100% Achievements Review (Bahasa Indonesia/Indonesian)The Good :Mad Max, game open world ini cocok banget buat lo semua yang suka dengan game adventure ditambah aksi-aksi fighting moves-nya yang brutal abis. Gaya bertarungnya mirip-mirip Batman combat system, namun di sini lebih bloody and gory. Lo bisa bertarung dengan tangan kosong, senjata atau kendaraan mobil. Mobil pribadi lo (Magnum Opus), shotgun dan juga harpoon bisa diupgrade dan mobil-mobil musuh bisa dijadiin koleksi di garage. Fitur fast travel khas open world game bakal membantu banget kalo lagi males nyetir atau mau kabur dari kejaran musuh. Pemandangan jalan tandus dan gurun ga seburuk yang lo bayangkan, pengaturan cahaya di game ini dan weather effect-nya keren abis. Badai gurun nampak realistis, petir yang menyambar saat badai keliatan jelas dan nyata, begitu juga dengan percikan dan nyala api dari setiap benda yang meledak. Karakter juga audio cukup bagus dan story-nya juga ga kalah seru dengan movie-nya game ini.The Bad:Di beberapa bagian game ini bisa bikin lo jenuh, beberapa side quest dan looting scrap bisa agak membosankan kalo terus berulang. Boss battle di sini juga bisa dibilang repetitif, dari mulai tampilan Boss/Top Dog-nya yang cuma beda warna sampai cara bertarungnya yang lo pasti cepet banget hapal setiap pergerakan serangannya. Karena serangan yang lambat dan mudah dihindari, bikin boss battle di game ini kurang menantang. Pergerakan karakter Max juga ada sisi negatif khususnya saat kita lompat, hanya tempat-tempat rendah dan tertentu saja yang bisa dilompati atau dipanjat.Detail tambahan: Grafik yang bagus cukup ringan walaupun dengan spec PC yang tidak terlalu powerful. Kisaran waktu tamat game ini 15 jam waktu main dan untuk para completionist atau achievement hunter, dalam waktu 70+ jam semua achievement bisa lo dapetin.Score : 7/10 (Semua game yang gw review gw kasih jempol, walaupun penilaian dari gw kecil. Untuk memberi kesempatan para game dev untuk bekerja lebih baik lagi.)[Dear Gaben, please make Indonesian as an official language on steam. We have a large community here. Thanks] "

Posted: September 6, 2015
												So here we have it. Mad Max. Id never seen the movies until I bought this game and playing it made me watch Mad Max 1 and 2 tonight. I didn't even know about this game until a friend mentioned he was quite hyped close to release. I waited until after release to buy it actually due to the ""wonderful"" launch of Arkham Knight (sarcasm). But in all seriousness this game has slapped me in the face and proven me wrong. I have enjoyed 37 hours of Mad Max so far and I have not enjoyed a game this much since one of the Assassins Creed games which im not going to go in detail about as I am not here to promote AC. Every new title that comes out nowadays gets me worrying about optimization and whether the game will actually be in any way playable at launch. Mad Max is 100% playable and 99.9% bug free. A 2MB update could fix the only issues the game currently has and the best part is that the bugs aren't game breaking! The gameplay is extremely fun all the way through and even though im a guy im not afraid to admit that the main story has some emotion in it. There were moments that I actually gasped in shock lol. The driving is very smooth and I would compare it alot to GTA's style of driving but it feels like driving the Batmobile from Arkham Knight quite a bit when it comes to vehicle control and drifting etc. The vehicle customisation is great. You can change every little piece of your car to your liking but it comes at a price of course. Combat. Once again very like Warner Bros Batman Arkham combat although you do notice the difference in moves and overall let's say ""gore""? Yeah gore. So ive actually completed the main story now and I was worried that when it is done will I still play Mad Max? Yes is the answer. The main story may be complete but still I had only 43% completed the game. It was beautfiul in it's own way. When it comes to character customization I would choose the word endless. You can change Max's facial hair, his head gear, wrist armor, jacket, gun and unlock new fighting moves. So after watching the first 2 Mad Max movies I would compare the game to Mad Max 2 the most. I was watching the very long car battle near the end and right away I was getting flashbacks of vehicle combat in the video game! Even the map/scenery makes me feel like im a part of the 2nd movie. Most interesting feature of the game:Chumbucket. This is a character you meet in the game. After meeting him he leeches onto you and never goes away. After 45 minutes of playing you are very thankful to have him there. 3000 pieces of scrap later you are extremely happy to have him with you because your car will begin to look beautful because of him. He is very helpful throughout the game and got me through some situations. Ive usually found that having a character like this who constantly is with you in a game gets annoying. It's like Roman from GTA IV. ""Hey Nico! Want to bowling?"". I know Roman wasn't physically there but he still got me trying to find subways so I could escape the world of phone signal. Although Chumbucket knows what he is doing. He knows when to speak and when to shut the hell up. That's always a great thing. Right?Sooooo graphics! Beautiful! Some may shoot me virtually for this but im gonna compare this game to the Arkham Knight graphics. I know ive compared it to Batman enough but seriously it is the best and most accurate example and it's by Warner Bros for god sake! Honestly the graphics are great. The game is very well optimized and im extremely shocked that it is due to more recent games and their examples. Warner Bros have done a great job at recreating the Mad Max world for us to free roam around in with our rumbling V8 engines. Good job. And yeah here is the gretaest part of all for people worrying if they can run this game. Im using an AMD Radeon HD 7870 with an AMD FX 6350 on high 1920x1080. No stutters no lag and 30fps+.Also on the main menu I see a DLC tab. The excitement is real and the wallet is open!9/10			"

												Bought it for $6 on a flash sale.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!! I absolutely recommend it.This game is so very fun.  If you're already a fan of the Mad Max universe, buy it and jump in.  You'll love it.  As far as gameplay goes, if you played open world games like The Saboteur and Assassin's Creed, it's just like that without all the sneaking around.  There's tons of stuff to do.  You can do all of it or none of it.  You can roam the wastes trashing cars and getting into fights or search the dunes for loot.  I'm going to give his game a 8.5 out of 10. Oh and the ending..... get ready for THAT.... It took me 30 hours to beat and I'll be back for sure to finish everything off.			"

												In my opinion most underrated game of 2015. It was buried in media under the MGS hype. But definitely it's one of the best game of the year and one of the best movie license games.It was very hard to keep pace of awesome Fury Road movie, but developers made it. God, how f***ing beautiful and atmospheric game is! Just watch top screenshots on community hub. I'm in love with gameworld. There most beautiful weather effects i ever seen in video games. Sandstorm and thunderstorm just AWESOME. Also locations made with big love and details. I can't describe feelings when you first time enter the Underdune or buried church. It's locations of Buzzards and I'm loved how they shown in the game. (In movie it was just one scene, but there we have a lot locations where we can how they live)Plot is simple but good. Fights on foot god and fun, Batman-stylish but with lot of blood and brutality. Battle on cars also fun and cool (i'm worried about that moment). Also car design of enemy and you own car - is incredible.If u loved movie - BUY IT! If u love car action - BUY IT! If u want harsh and brutal post-apocalypse - BUY IT! This game is really, really good.			"

												If I had to imagine what a Mad Max game would be like, it would be exactly like this game.  Graphics are pretty decent, the gameplay is solid. Not too strong of a story but it's Mad Max. Lots of violence and things blowing up. Badass cars and a well crafted post-apocalyptic wasteland. Couple of complaints I have is that the game gets repetetive, going from territory to territory scavenging scraps and collectibles, clearing out camps of baddies yet I couldn't stop playing. I also ran into bugs once in a while like clipping through objects or character body parts dissapearing and mines in the minefield not showing up properly. Coincidentally this game was made by Avalanche, same developer that made Just Cause 3 and somehow this game didn't turn out to be a buggy mess like that one but I digress.The things I liked were the cars, specifically the Magnum Opus, the pinnacle of badassery. The wasteland itself could be quite beautiful and pretty to look at too during certain hours of the in-game day. The flow of combat is pretty simple and looks great when chaining combos and counters together. You get a sidekick named Chumbucket who's just the best lil hunchback sidekick ever.I had a lot of fun with it and would definately recommend it to strangers and my friends if they like driving and action games.

												Yes, it can be a little repetitive, yes, the hand to hand combat is pasted from the Batman games, but the beautiful environment, car combat and close attention to little details make this game a rough jewel that'll make you want to play it more.Do you like high-octane action games, car combat, gorgeous post-apocaliptic open world environments and absurd plots ? Where the Mad Max movies enjoyable for you ? Do you want to feel like you are in Fury Road ? Then GET THIS GAME.8/10 - Good surprise. One of the best movie to game adaptations ever.

""M1, M1, M1, M1, M2, M1, E"" - Max's response to anythingI had tons of fun with this game, and played it to the 100% mark.As an affictionate of the backstory/movies I wasn't let down.If you do not want to play it to full completion, the oh so bland grinding can be avoided. +The car combat feels great, even if some options for dealing damage as just not as viable as others. +The game runs beautifully, and is well optimized.+The World looks beautiful and is quite interesting.+Great overall atmosphere.+Nice character design-Ground combat feels dull and is just interesting if there is a lot of enemies. Upgrading Max's moves really freshens it up.-Car upgrades are often redundant or offer a too small improvement over each other. -No option to reset camps or even the entire world, making playing on with your buffed out Max impossible.-The plot is ""Meh."" with a lot of ""Oh come on!"", and the ending is garbage.V6/V8 not Mediocre, but could use some improvements. Can recommend tho.			"

												Pros:+Combat system works well with one exception+Car customization is in-depth and increases the playtime exponentially+Map is unique, not just sand dunes everywhere, there's variation and interesting landmarks+History Relics were an excellent touch, Max's responses were great+Tons of things to do+The missions are set up to make you explore, some require you to go out into the wasteland and liberate camps+Optimized amazingly+Sound design is good, it's so satisfying to punch people in the face and hear bones breakingCons:-Combat system fails when you're attacked by 2 people at once, you can only counter one of them, but even then you're usually knocked out of your counter by the other guy hitting you-Cars are somewhat hard to control, now I'm not sure if this is because of the way I customized my Opus or not, it's usually not noticeable except for this one mission where I'm racing some people through a collapsed and half-buried airport (and indoor segments in general)-Some sound glitching, when I jump off of a cliff for example, the engine sound gets stuck until I land, sometimes bombs don't make sounds-Doesn't capture the survival aspect of the wasteland, it would have been nice to have a hardcore mode-Multiplayer would have greatly extended this game's life-span, even something simple like racing with your custom cars			"

100% Achievements Review (Bahasa Indonesia/Indonesian)The Good :Mad Max, game open world ini cocok banget buat lo semua yang suka dengan game adventure ditambah aksi-aksi fighting moves-nya yang brutal abis. Gaya bertarungnya mirip-mirip Batman combat system, namun di sini lebih bloody and gory. Lo bisa bertarung dengan tangan kosong, senjata atau kendaraan mobil. Mobil pribadi lo (Magnum Opus), shotgun dan juga harpoon bisa diupgrade dan mobil-mobil musuh bisa dijadiin koleksi di garage. Fitur fast travel khas open world game bakal membantu banget kalo lagi males nyetir atau mau kabur dari kejaran musuh. Pemandangan jalan tandus dan gurun ga seburuk yang lo bayangkan, pengaturan cahaya di game ini dan weather effect-nya keren abis. Badai gurun nampak realistis, petir yang menyambar saat badai keliatan jelas dan nyata, begitu juga dengan percikan dan nyala api dari setiap benda yang meledak. Karakter juga audio cukup bagus dan story-nya juga ga kalah seru dengan movie-nya game ini.The Bad:Di beberapa bagian game ini bisa bikin lo jenuh, beberapa side quest dan looting scrap bisa agak membosankan kalo terus berulang. Boss battle di sini juga bisa dibilang repetitif, dari mulai tampilan Boss/Top Dog-nya yang cuma beda warna sampai cara bertarungnya yang lo pasti cepet banget hapal setiap pergerakan serangannya. Karena serangan yang lambat dan mudah dihindari, bikin boss battle di game ini kurang menantang. Pergerakan karakter Max juga ada sisi negatif khususnya saat kita lompat, hanya tempat-tempat rendah dan tertentu saja yang bisa dilompati atau dipanjat.Detail tambahan: Grafik yang bagus cukup ringan walaupun dengan spec PC yang tidak terlalu powerful. Kisaran waktu tamat game ini 15 jam waktu main dan untuk para completionist atau achievement hunter, dalam waktu 70+ jam semua achievement bisa lo dapetin.Score : 7/10 (Semua game yang gw review gw kasih jempol, walaupun penilaian dari gw kecil. Untuk memberi kesempatan para game dev untuk bekerja lebih baik lagi.)[Dear Gaben, please make Indonesian as an official language on steam. We have a large community here. Thanks] "

												Bought it for $6 on a flash sale.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!! I absolutely recommend it.This game is so very fun.  If you're already a fan of the Mad Max universe, buy it and jump in.  You'll love it.  As far as gameplay goes, if you played open world games like The Saboteur and Assassin's Creed, it's just like that without all the sneaking around.  There's tons of stuff to do.  You can do all of it or none of it.  You can roam the wastes trashing cars and getting into fights or search the dunes for loot.  I'm going to give his game a 8.5 out of 10. Oh and the ending..... get ready for THAT.... It took me 30 hours to beat and I'll be back for sure to finish everything off.			"

												Mad Max is a perfectly enjoyable game, but don't get it expecting the reinvention of the wheel for gameplay or a deep story. The gameplay is, basically, Assassin's Creed / Batman Arkham Asylum: parry, hit hit hit, evade; go to a very high place (balloons in Mad Max) to reveal maps and unlock fast travel; collectibles everywhere and so on. As you play the story missions or unlock... unlockables you get to upgrade and customize your car, your gear and your skills.The game is, to me, a lot like the new movie: something that you lean back and enjoy for the action, the ""Mad Maxy"" vehicles, the road fights and the craziness of the post-apocalyptic world. There's something special about impaling a guy with a harpoon fired from the back of your car, pulling him through his windshield and then dragging him across the desert. The game is as violent as the movie, perhaps even more. It's all about VROOM VROOM VROOM! BARK! BARK! CRASH! BOOM! POW! PEW! PEW! VROOM VROOM VROOM! Does it get repetitive? Absolutely, but if you're enjoying it, who cares? Bugs, I haven't encountered any after 9 hours of gameplay. The game's physics are a bit crazy, little things will sometimes send your car flying. The environment, character and vehicle graphics are all pretty good.			"

Entertaining game and nice addition for the fans.Repetitive? Maybe, but I didn't feel like it was. I absolutely love the brutally violent and proffesional fighting system and the road encounters aren't horrible so I really wanted to play what the game offers. Including completing the camps to the 100% since what you collect is actually useful and things like the history relics are also cool because of Max's commentary. The story... well, it's pretty Mad Max honestly, it may not feel personal, but it makes sense and is not bad at all.Mad Max's amazing concept and a deeper look at how things are in the Great White.Amazing graphics and cool scenery. Smooth performance.Cool characters with personality. Characteristic Mad Max dialogue.Huge gameplay time.When it comes to cons I can't really mention any that you'll agree with.			"

												Is it worth $60? Regrettably, no.Mad Max has a monotonous grind to it. But if you can see the details that make it stand out.  The story is good albeit short and the actors are great. The final showdown was simple and quick. The bosses weaknesses and methods are identical except for Stank Gum and Scrotus (who has only a slight variation to the regular bosses). Which was refreshing but still not too difficult. The map is rich in areas to explore. The airport terminal was expecially cool but quick.All in all it is designed as a console arcade game and the learning curve is very easy. There were times that I wished some fights would drag on. Early on convoy takedowns required time and strategy but as soon as you got the exploding harpoons they became easy and boring. I played 20 hours trying to clear each area then got bored and rushed through the story. I just got tired of collecting loot.  So if you would like to support the devs then pay full retail but if your on a budget then I suggest you wait for the sale. Either way you should get some enjoyment but I'm not so sure about replayability. p.s. Devs, please add some more of those great stories along with that supurb acting. I'll take story over loot any day.			"

												In my opinion most underrated game of 2015. It was buried in media under the MGS hype. But definitely it's one of the best game of the year and one of the best movie license games.It was very hard to keep pace of awesome Fury Road movie, but developers made it. God, how f***ing beautiful and atmospheric game is! Just watch top screenshots on community hub. I'm in love with gameworld. There most beautiful weather effects i ever seen in video games. Sandstorm and thunderstorm just AWESOME. Also locations made with big love and details. I can't describe feelings when you first time enter the Underdune or buried church. It's locations of Buzzards and I'm loved how they shown in the game. (In movie it was just one scene, but there we have a lot locations where we can how they live)Plot is simple but good. Fights on foot god and fun, Batman-stylish but with lot of blood and brutality. Battle on cars also fun and cool (i'm worried about that moment). Also car design of enemy and you own car - is incredible.If u loved movie - BUY IT! If u love car action - BUY IT! If u want harsh and brutal post-apocalypse - BUY IT! This game is really, really good.			"

												So here we have it. Mad Max. Id never seen the movies until I bought this game and playing it made me watch Mad Max 1 and 2 tonight. I didn't even know about this game until a friend mentioned he was quite hyped close to release. I waited until after release to buy it actually due to the ""wonderful"" launch of Arkham Knight (sarcasm). But in all seriousness this game has slapped me in the face and proven me wrong. I have enjoyed 37 hours of Mad Max so far and I have not enjoyed a game this much since one of the Assassins Creed games which im not going to go in detail about as I am not here to promote AC. Every new title that comes out nowadays gets me worrying about optimization and whether the game will actually be in any way playable at launch. Mad Max is 100% playable and 99.9% bug free. A 2MB update could fix the only issues the game currently has and the best part is that the bugs aren't game breaking! The gameplay is extremely fun all the way through and even though im a guy im not afraid to admit that the main story has some emotion in it. There were moments that I actually gasped in shock lol. The driving is very smooth and I would compare it alot to GTA's style of driving but it feels like driving the Batmobile from Arkham Knight quite a bit when it comes to vehicle control and drifting etc. The vehicle customisation is great. You can change every little piece of your car to your liking but it comes at a price of course. Combat. Once again very like Warner Bros Batman Arkham combat although you do notice the difference in moves and overall let's say ""gore""? Yeah gore. So ive actually completed the main story now and I was worried that when it is done will I still play Mad Max? Yes is the answer. The main story may be complete but still I had only 43% completed the game. It was beautfiul in it's own way. When it comes to character customization I would choose the word endless. You can change Max's facial hair, his head gear, wrist armor, jacket, gun and unlock new fighting moves. So after watching the first 2 Mad Max movies I would compare the game to Mad Max 2 the most. I was watching the very long car battle near the end and right away I was getting flashbacks of vehicle combat in the video game! Even the map/scenery makes me feel like im a part of the 2nd movie. Most interesting feature of the game:Chumbucket. This is a character you meet in the game. After meeting him he leeches onto you and never goes away. After 45 minutes of playing you are very thankful to have him there. 3000 pieces of scrap later you are extremely happy to have him with you because your car will begin to look beautful because of him. He is very helpful throughout the game and got me through some situations. Ive usually found that having a character like this who constantly is with you in a game gets annoying. It's like Roman from GTA IV. ""Hey Nico! Want to bowling?"". I know Roman wasn't physically there but he still got me trying to find subways so I could escape the world of phone signal. Although Chumbucket knows what he is doing. He knows when to speak and when to shut the hell up. That's always a great thing. Right?Sooooo graphics! Beautiful! Some may shoot me virtually for this but im gonna compare this game to the Arkham Knight graphics. I know ive compared it to Batman enough but seriously it is the best and most accurate example and it's by Warner Bros for god sake! Honestly the graphics are great. The game is very well optimized and im extremely shocked that it is due to more recent games and their examples. Warner Bros have done a great job at recreating the Mad Max world for us to free roam around in with our rumbling V8 engines. Good job. And yeah here is the gretaest part of all for people worrying if they can run this game. Im using an AMD Radeon HD 7870 with an AMD FX 6350 on high 1920x1080. No stutters no lag and 30fps+.Also on the main menu I see a DLC tab. The excitement is real and the wallet is open!9/10			"

												This is one of the most memorable games I have played. It puts you into the actual shoes of Mad Max in ways no movie can (but I wish I could see in the future).I have never felt so 'in the shoes' of a character as I did playing this game.My memories of the game are endless. Intense and lingering. I played through several times. Each time, learning more about Max and his World. This game is one of the reasons I upgraded my PC to a 64 Bit platform, and I am more than glad that I did.I've never been through more depressing runs of brutal warfare and survival in all my 30 years of gaming. I would gladly play through a fourth time.In the End... No Spoilers... ... ... ... ... ... ...It is what it is. That's the only way Max could have it in this life. Constantly trying to survive. I truly felt like a 'Saint' of the wasteland in every playthrough. Hearing the people I contribute to thanking me and telling stories of my accomplishments throughout the visiting of each Base was encouraging and rewarding as any game could deliver.I also love that this game ties into the Fury Road movie, which is in my top ten. I can't explain how they intertwine b/c spoilers, but it was very well done, in my opinion.A must play for fans of Batman games or fans of the Mad Max Universe. Lots of gory backgrounds, Brutal Combat, Mature Cutscenes. Drug use. Some minor sex references.I have over a hundred hours in this game, all well worth it. The Storms are awesome. Sieges are awesome. BEING. MAD. MAX. IS. AWESOME... Everything left me wanting more. I wish to see a sequel in the future, whether on the Big Screen or on my Gaming Rig. Hopefully both.4.9/5			"

												Its actually the first time ever I take the time to review a game.I never had much to do with the Mad Max franchise until I saw Fury road and I was immediately sooked and almost made a salto when i heard of a standalone game instead of a crappy movie adaption for the franchise as I love cars, explosions and desert wasteland settings.Technical aspect: 9,5/10 Story:the story needs some time to get going and as im at like 20% of the game ( yes i like exploring) i havent seen much of it- however the game takes its time to introduce you into the characters, story and wasteland as much as it rushes you into the customisation and missionobjectives- overall that makes a good balance to me as the objectives are fast paced and short, rough fun but the story promises to take a deeper breath and contrasts well with the overall pace.However the story builds up more with the questions that are not asked rather than with those asked- the game gives plenty of hints if you are willing to observe characters and the world as to what happened, why people are the way they are and how everything went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ the brainchild you are producing while driving through endless dunes, seeing oiltankers and airplanes alike inbetween dried salty coral reefs and giant chasms is a sight to ponder and behold.8/10Gameplay:As most people already delved into the way the game plays ill just quickly summarize it: batman like hand to hand combat with powerful combos and finishers , but not as deep as one would like to wish... well what do you expect of a wastelander- meaty fistfights and crude mean weapons. The game doesnt do much in that regard but it does everything right that it attempts. the animations are fluid and dont evoke a repetitive sense as the enemies are plenty.Stronghold invasions can be done the mad max style or the mad max style- one way or the other you will make stuff explode, fall down and die- here and there are some sneaky bits if you dont want to bother trying to rip down a fortresses defenses but eventiually things will explode.Exploration is immensely fun, one would think a wasteland is hard to make feel alive but every time i started to get bored with the environment i got something new to look at and behold thrown at me. The game strikes a perfect balance of wasteland and living world to me and you can always spot a lovingly handcrafted wreckage or sightseeing spot around the next corner. (dont look too close tough- sometimes the graphics designers got a little bit lazy with the textures)The survival aspect does get a mention but is rather something that adds a little athmospere than anything truly survival-esque -- youll never have to really bother about water, food and gas but its just a nice immersive aspect to take care of these things- i rather eat maggots and the occasional lizard that eating one medpack after the other and never actually drinking ( lookign at you tombrider) It just fits into the game and the developer noticed its a smart move to just immerse you a little bit morescavenging is a good balance between exploring and reward- sometimes it gets a slight bit frustrating given the low rewards , but youll find story sniplets and nice vantage points ever so often- and overall the game isnt so littered with collectibles that you lose interest in picking them up  at some point *cough far cry cough*Cars:now here lies the fun- the customization options are fun and plenty, you actually have noticeable impact on the behaviour and playstyle of your car when you modify it- its an actual second character- Drawing a line to assassins creed black flag here- in Assassins creed the ship felt like a static thing to me that i would just upgrade- the magnum opus however has its characterchange for every addition or substraction you make and that brings a lot of diversity and fun- if you get bored with your heavily armored boulder of a car- how about ripping all those armor plates and bumpers off to create a fast and furious but very squishy dune racer?You can even do this on the fly so you never have to enter a situation unprepared ( even tough i would rather have the garage only accessible in the safe havens- yet i understand that would hinder gameplay a lot, given the constantly changing world and objectives- so i understand the descision to make the garage acceccible at all times)car combat is everything michael bay has to offer and it feels like the movies. Its fast, unfogiving and lots of metal will fly through the air. Shiny and Chrome factor 9/10Verdict:you like desert wastelands, survival, cars ,explosions and mutated people ? get the game, its definitely one of the best releases 2015 9/10			"

												Just finished the story and can say that this is a winner. Movie properties being made in to a game is more often than not a negative. WB publishing that game is another negative. 2 negatives make a positive and this game is properly good, well optimized and with varied gameplay. I reckon you could do this in about 10 hours if you really went for the campaign only. Probably stretch it to 20-30 if you dithered about doing ALL of the little side quests. Either way, get this game. I got it discounted at £21 and it was money well spent.			"

												This game has drawn many comparisons to Shadow of Mordor and Assassin's Creed (or Far Cry), as those have become shorthand for a certain type of open-world game design. That's not entirely inapt, but the game which Mad Max most closely resembles is actually Red Faction: Guerilla.			"

												Where is my chrome spraypaint?You don't often see a AAA game that actually runs good AND looks good at the same time. Additionally, you don't often see movie licensed games that really any good. This game is a shining exception. The gameplay is solid and the characters and scenery is interesting. Overall good game.			"

												What a great game.  It combines elements of the Far Cry series, Batman and racing games.  Graphics are great and the day and night sequences are pheonimal.  Playing at night makes you feel like your really in the desert.  Can get repeditive at times but keeps you playing all night.  First impressions after 7 hours of gameplay are buy it!			"

												Mad Max is a perfectly enjoyable game, but don't get it expecting the reinvention of the wheel for gameplay or a deep story. The gameplay is, basically, Assassin's Creed / Batman Arkham Asylum: parry, hit hit hit, evade; go to a very high place (balloons in Mad Max) to reveal maps and unlock fast travel; collectibles everywhere and so on. As you play the story missions or unlock... unlockables you get to upgrade and customize your car, your gear and your skills.The game is, to me, a lot like the new movie: something that you lean back and enjoy for the action, the ""Mad Maxy"" vehicles, the road fights and the craziness of the post-apocalyptic world. There's something special about impaling a guy with a harpoon fired from the back of your car, pulling him through his windshield and then dragging him across the desert. The game is as violent as the movie, perhaps even more. It's all about VROOM VROOM VROOM! BARK! BARK! CRASH! BOOM! POW! PEW! PEW! VROOM VROOM VROOM! Does it get repetitive? Absolutely, but if you're enjoying it, who cares? Bugs, I haven't encountered any after 9 hours of gameplay. The game's physics are a bit crazy, little things will sometimes send your car flying. The environment, character and vehicle graphics are all pretty good.			"

Entertaining game and nice addition for the fans.Repetitive? Maybe, but I didn't feel like it was. I absolutely love the brutally violent and proffesional fighting system and the road encounters aren't horrible so I really wanted to play what the game offers. Including completing the camps to the 100% since what you collect is actually useful and things like the history relics are also cool because of Max's commentary. The story... well, it's pretty Mad Max honestly, it may not feel personal, but it makes sense and is not bad at all.Mad Max's amazing concept and a deeper look at how things are in the Great White.Amazing graphics and cool scenery. Smooth performance.Cool characters with personality. Characteristic Mad Max dialogue.Huge gameplay time.When it comes to cons I can't really mention any that you'll agree with.			"

												I've gotta say, I'm really surpised at all of the mediocre critic reviews so far for Mad Max. I'm really enjoying everything about this game so far. If you're a fan of The Road Warrior series and enjoyed any of the recent WB 3rd person action games then this is worth your time. Especially if you can snag one of the 40% off deals floating around as I did. The key to really making this feel like a proper movie tie in is to first watch Fury Road then turn off the in game music and crank up Fury Road's soundtrack. When you're chasing down a convoy as a massive sand storm hits you'll be hard pressed to not scream WITNESS ME! "

												This game has impressed me on many levels. It's very well optimized, it looks gorgeous and the gameplay feels good and works well. The story is not bad but it's not great either. It's pretty generic and is made up of the most common themes of RPGs. The combat feels satisfying but is most of the time not a big challenge as your enemies will almost always attack one at a time which can easily be dealt with by parrying. If there are multiple types of enemies performing different types of attacks in can get quite tough at times.The driving in this game is very good. The sound of the different types of engines are great, the handling feels realistic while still being arcadey enough to be fun and challanging at the same time and the vehicular combat works well.Mad Max looks really good. Not particularly in terms of texture quality but some of the effects are really stunning especially the explosions. The atmosphere of the whole post-apocalyptic wasteland is also very believable and authentic. There are lots of incredibly detailed areas to be explored.			"

												ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF THIS YEAR --- DEFINITELY A CONTENDER FOR GOTYI wasn't expecting much of Mad Max before the release but I was blown away when I played the game. I'll start off by praising the developers for the perfection that they've put into optimization of this game. I hardly notice any frame drop, it runs at constat 60 fps on maxed settings @ 1080p. You wouldn't exepct much from a wasteland in terms of versatality but this game is unbelieveably dynamic. I mean going from town to town, you'd see the environment changing big time. Every town is different than the other in many ways. While playing this game, you'd never feel like you're stuck in same cliched location.What makes this beautiful game even more beautiful is the awesomely implemented, better version of Batman style hand to hand combat with lots of upgrades to keep the game fresh till the very end.Chumbucket's engineered Mangum Opus (Oh saint, the angel cumbustion wants you to drive it) So probably ya'll  know that this game offers great deal of cars combat but on top of that you have this one main car, called The Magnum Opus, It offers soo many different upgrades that even when you finish the game, you still wouldn't be able to have unlocked all the upgrades. You can modify the car in many different ways, whether it be in terms of its appearance or its performance.Story - I still haven't finished the game, I've been doing side quests mainly because I don't wanna finish it fast but thus far, the story has been progressing nicely and it's quite engaging. I'd totally recommend this game to everyone.			"

An atmospheric post-apocalyptic Distraction - The GameYou're driving through the destroyed landscape and notice a pillar of smoke behind the hill. Let's check it out! Before you reach it, you are attacked by a car patrol protruding with spikes and flamethrower nozzles. After defeating them, you notice on the minimap that there is a treasure cache nearby. Let's check it out, I need some more scrap! Before the last bend, you see a big ramp beckoning you to try out the newly upgraded boost and jump wherever it leads. After jumping you are notified that you reached a new wasteland level and that you should go and upgrade your skills at the shaman/psychotherapist.Where was I and what did I want to do?This is Mad Max in summary. Just as other games in the genre, you keep getting distracted by myriads of activites everywhere. This is held together by two things: Threat level, a number representing how much activities in the region you already did, and the story.ProsGreat writing in some places, especially in the main quest line Chumbucket, your sidekick, is one of the best written characters in action games I played. Griffa has also very interesting dialogues, but ultimately they lead nowhere in terms of character developmentThere are a lot of fun small environmental puzzles. How do I get there? How do I lower the bridge? Where is the last insignia hidden? Those environmental micropuzzles are what holds the gameplay together. So soMelee combat is the standard fare brought by Arkham Asylum - one button for attack, hold for strong attack to break defenses, other button for defense, if you time it right, you have a perfect parry. Skills open up more possibilitiesVehicular combat is mostly fun, but the physics get a little bit strange the more upgraded your car is. With the strongest V8 engine, thickest armor and most offensive spikes/flamethrowers/ramming equipment installed, the car starts behaving wonkier than at the beginning. Suddenly most jumps damage you which didn't damage you before, stones are suddenly bigger obstacles than with lighter cars... It's kind of hard to describe, but a fully upgraded car wasn't more enjoyable to drive and fight with than a weaker one. Which wasn't what I expected.It's a distractathon game, so there is no one activity holding the game together. There is not one core gameplay loop but three or four. That comes with the genreUneven writing. Max has three different personalities - one in the story missions (distand and detached), one when commenting history relics (where he is much more pensive and melancholic) and another one during the endingConsA propos the ending: It made me really angry. And I don't think it was the writers' intention. At the very end, Max suddenly changes his personality and does something that is completely out of character when he kills Chumbucket. That's not what my Max would do. I helped all wastelanders, didn't harm anyone, gave water to all pilgrims. But most importantly that's not what the writers' Max would do! There is a huge discrepancy between how Max was written throughout the whole game and what he does at the end! There is no warning, no transition between those behaviors.Second, the scene doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't Chumbucket jump off the car?Third, the impact of the scene is immediately rendered useless, because you respawn back in the landscape with both Chumbucket and your car unharmed.Just like in each distractathon, there are a lot of chores here. I would normally avoid them, but many of them are required in order to unlock certain upgrades. I would never clear minefields on my own, for example.The controls are unresponsive. There are a lot of animations that must play out until the end before the game starts receiving input again. Those animations are short, but there are a lot of them: Disarming an opponent, wall bash, picking up a weapon. The game shows input hints, but doesn't receive input until these animations play out.Many (almost all) actions require you to hold a button instead of pressing it. This makes the whole gameplay a lot less responsive and slower. Looting, kicking down doors, picking up weapons, entering the car (exiting is just one button press, though)...There are also a lot of unskippable small cutscenes. Eating food, disarming minesOf the similar games in the genre, Shadow of Mordor, Arkham City, Assassin's Creed and Mad Max I enjoyed Mad Max the most. It is definitely not without flaws, but as far as 3rd-person distractathons go, its gameplay holds well together. It is mostly well written, the two combat modes are fun and the distractions hold well together for the most part.			"

OVERVIEWMad Max is a third-person open world action game set in the post-apocalyptic world of the movie series.You play the titular Max, who has every right to be mad indeed! There you were, cruising the wasteland on a sunny afternoon, searching for the Plains of Silence, when Scabrous Scrotus, the local bully boy, descends upon you with his horde of try-hards. Before you know it, they've beaten you up and stolen your car, and even cutting half way through Scrotus's head with a chainsaw didn't seem to slow him down.GraphicsThe graphics in Mad Max are phenomenal. Character models are top notch, with beautiful mapping and excellent animations. Max's fighting style is brutal and bloody, and he flows well from one movement into the next. The wasteland characters are ridiculous and over the top, exactly how they should be in a Mad Max game.Environment graphics are unbelievably good, too. The weather effects are excellent, with the powerful static storms being the most obvious example. Dust clouds rise from convoys, too, and the lighting when looking out across the wasteland is a sight to behold. How did the artists manage to make such an inhospitable place look so good!?And the car models are excellent as well, full of wildly silly designs, destructible components and crude, but effective, weapons. And there's such a lovely assortment of them, too. And oh, yes, what fabulous explosions!Truly, Mad Max continues to wow me with its graphics, even after playing it for almost 70 hours.SoundSound, too, is top notch. Everything is spoken and it's mostly spoken extremely well, from the rage-filled shouts of random marauders to Hope's dulcet tones as she tries to sway you to help her. Chumbucket's wheedling is so annoying, but somehow comforting, too, after all those hours with him at my side. And Max is brilliant, sounding just like the broken, tortured, post-apocalyptic mercenary that he is. Some of the wasteland encounters let the side down, though, with outrageously broad Australian accents that made me cringe.Car engines make suitably throaty growls, Max's shotgun makes a satisfying boom, and each time I mash another Roadkill's face into the dirt I swear I can hear his bones break.Music must have fit the game well, because I don't remember it being out of place, but I certainly didn't turn it down.GameplayAfter the opening scene and brief introduction that holds your hand through the basics, you're left with Chumbucket the 'blackfinger' mechanic to support and guide you, and let go to roam around the smallish first area. After a couple of missions and getting the hang of how everything works, that then opens up and you're free to do pretty much whatever you want, although I'd recommend that you follow the storyline.Your ultimate goal is to recover your stolen car, or create one even better -- the Magnum Opus -- and doing that requires getting your hands on a V8 engine: The Big Chief, which is only available in Gas Town, at the other side of the large world map. Getting there takes many hours of work, though, and you'll make a number of allies along the way.Mad Max plays like a post-apocalyptic Grand Theft Auto with characters more over the top than Saints Row. You basically spend the whole game driving around a big wasteland, blowing stuff up, taking over enemy camps, scavenging for scrap, and engaging in plenty of hand-to-hand and vehicle-to-vehicle combat.Vehicle combat is fast and fun, and cars handle well. Melee combat is reminiscent of the Batman Arkham games, with lots of timed blocks and counters, and some very brutal moves. Water in the wasteland is a precious resource and Max can drink from his water bottle to refill his health. But never mind if you do take too much damage and poor Max bites the dust; you can always resume play at the last auto save, which happens whenever you do anything of note.I tried to do most of each wasteland area before moving to the next, and I think that decreased the enjoyment I could have had. Before I'd even reached the third stronghold I'd maxed out Max's abilities, which made the second half of the game feel more grindy than I think it should have. If there's a big complaint I have about the game, then that's it: there's not enough character progression for the amount of content available.So the game isn't perfect, and it does have a number of smaller issues, too. For a start, I don't think the instructions ever mentioned that Max can jump (by using Ctrl), and you can use the Magnum Opus's harpoon to pull down locked ladders. There are a few small bugs that still remain, too, including challenges that don't always unlock properly, character and location bios not always displaying properly, and an issue with on-screen information sometimes disappearing. But a restart normally fixes these issues. I also had one crash to desktop in my 69 hours of play, so that's not too bad.PROS AND CONSPros:+ Absolutely fantastic graphics that are optimised well+ Great realisation and extension of the movies' world+ A large map with a lot to see and do+ Excellent car physicsCons:- A few very small, niggly bugs- Can get repetitive towards the end gameCONCLUSIONMad Max is one of the best games of last year. It's long, violent, bloody, and very over the top, and I love it.9/10 "

												The game is fantastic. The environments, the post-apocalyptic settings are amazing. The gameplay is solid and keeps you on your toes cause it can go very bad quickly if you're not fast enough.  I never had such a blast to just ride my car in a sandbox game. The amount of destruction I left behind me makes me smile all the time. The story could be better, that's true, but for me, the atmosphere makes up for it and I DO want to stay in the game for hours. I'm really not a completionist in games, far from it, but Mad Max makes me want to do everything and it's a sign of an exceptionnal game. I had less fun to complete GTA 5 and I thought it was really good. The game is not more repetitive than other sandbox games but it sure is a lot more interesting to do the side stuff, than let's say, Assassin's Creed XYZ. The car is amazing to use for destruction. And for those interested in the hardware side of MM. I'm running it flawlessly on a i5 4670k and a Radeon 7970 ROG Matrix Platinum. It looks so good and runs so smoothly that it makes me ""mad"" at other's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC ports even more. This game is an example of a PC port well done.9/10  A story a little bit more ambitious would have make this game deserve a 10/10 easily for me.			"

												I rarely write reviews but i salute whoever made this game, this game is Strongly RecommendedPros: - This is one of the best games i have ever played so far. It just belongs there along with epic games of the same open world genre that i played and enjoyed (like the recent installments of GTA, Fallout, Just Cause, Assassins Creed .. etc) - Post-apocalyptic (Mad Max universe, watch the latest 4th movie of it before playing to know what this world is all about) - Open world (like GTA 5 but a much bigger map), but you can't really wander off anywhere easily, you'll need enough water and gas or you're gonna die in the wasteland. - Mix of combat methods which are epic, i love how you can fire a harpoon at a sniper tower then pull it with your car to bring it down. Car combat somewhat reminds me of Twisted Metal. - Amazing graphicsCons: - Following the Mad Max movies world, the steering wheel is on the right side of the cars (australians) which is something most of the world isn't used to, this has no effect on the playing quality but dammit i keep going to the left side of the car thinking i'll reach the steering wheel faster xD, however i do underrstand and appreciate the game makers sticking to the legacy the mad max movies created. Overall:- if you enjoy open world games in post-apocalyptic settings, car customizations, cars chases & combat, survival then this game is good for you.			"

												Easy combat.Fuel is not hard to get.Short  storyline.Max is not Mel Gibson.No Tina Turner.No Interceptor as the main vehicle.Only Max has a gun, how did that happen?Vehicles crash stupidly, not even close to GTA4.No bugs.Too much Ballas' graffities and cocaine packages to find.Health is not regenerating --- GOOD for a game of 2015!Good, Bad, and not Mel Gibson.

												A game made in support of a movie.  RUN AWAY!........An Aussie Cult Classic remade, amended and updated by...... AMERICANS!  Gaaaaaah.There's two strikes, but guess what.... it works!Mad Max the game captures the spirit of the traditional Mad Max movies, and blends them well with the current Fury Road movie as well.An easy game to get into, a little 'console' in nature, it's just a fun way to spend an hour or two.  No overt brain power required, just a good bit of escapism.Pros:   Runs well on moderate systems.Accessible and simple to learn.Atmospheric.   I feel parched everytime I play!Graphics ( esp burning cars ) is VERY well done.   Scenery is excellent on PC.Cons: A little repetitive ( but you can streamline and concentrate on the story line )GasTown not as imposing as was elluded to in the movies and lore.  Feels underpopulated, protected and generally underwhelming.Knit Picking Side Notes:   For those who do not know or even remember such a thing as Aussie Slang....   Dinkie Dye ( yes, pronounced Die, not DEE as done in the game ) means 'The Real Thing'  'The Genuine Article'  'Not fake or artificial'  'The Real McCoy'  'The Real Deal'.  You get my drift.  I'm assuming that Chumbucket pronounces it ""Dinkie DEE"" because he never went to finishing school, and not because Americans have no clue on how to pronounce 'Australian'.  I tell myself this because to miss pronounce it otherwise through ignorance would make this a 2/10 game for me, instead of a 7/10.Enjoy.			"

An atmospheric post-apocalyptic Distraction - The GameYou're driving through the destroyed landscape and notice a pillar of smoke behind the hill. Let's check it out! Before you reach it, you are attacked by a car patrol protruding with spikes and flamethrower nozzles. After defeating them, you notice on the minimap that there is a treasure cache nearby. Let's check it out, I need some more scrap! Before the last bend, you see a big ramp beckoning you to try out the newly upgraded boost and jump wherever it leads. After jumping you are notified that you reached a new wasteland level and that you should go and upgrade your skills at the shaman/psychotherapist.Where was I and what did I want to do?This is Mad Max in summary. Just as other games in the genre, you keep getting distracted by myriads of activites everywhere. This is held together by two things: Threat level, a number representing how much activities in the region you already did, and the story.ProsGreat writing in some places, especially in the main quest line Chumbucket, your sidekick, is one of the best written characters in action games I played. Griffa has also very interesting dialogues, but ultimately they lead nowhere in terms of character developmentThere are a lot of fun small environmental puzzles. How do I get there? How do I lower the bridge? Where is the last insignia hidden? Those environmental micropuzzles are what holds the gameplay together. So soMelee combat is the standard fare brought by Arkham Asylum - one button for attack, hold for strong attack to break defenses, other button for defense, if you time it right, you have a perfect parry. Skills open up more possibilitiesVehicular combat is mostly fun, but the physics get a little bit strange the more upgraded your car is. With the strongest V8 engine, thickest armor and most offensive spikes/flamethrowers/ramming equipment installed, the car starts behaving wonkier than at the beginning. Suddenly most jumps damage you which didn't damage you before, stones are suddenly bigger obstacles than with lighter cars... It's kind of hard to describe, but a fully upgraded car wasn't more enjoyable to drive and fight with than a weaker one. Which wasn't what I expected.It's a distractathon game, so there is no one activity holding the game together. There is not one core gameplay loop but three or four. That comes with the genreUneven writing. Max has three different personalities - one in the story missions (distand and detached), one when commenting history relics (where he is much more pensive and melancholic) and another one during the endingConsA propos the ending: It made me really angry. And I don't think it was the writers' intention. At the very end, Max suddenly changes his personality and does something that is completely out of character when he kills Chumbucket. That's not what my Max would do. I helped all wastelanders, didn't harm anyone, gave water to all pilgrims. But most importantly that's not what the writers' Max would do! There is a huge discrepancy between how Max was written throughout the whole game and what he does at the end! There is no warning, no transition between those behaviors.Second, the scene doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't Chumbucket jump off the car?Third, the impact of the scene is immediately rendered useless, because you respawn back in the landscape with both Chumbucket and your car unharmed.Just like in each distractathon, there are a lot of chores here. I would normally avoid them, but many of them are required in order to unlock certain upgrades. I would never clear minefields on my own, for example.The controls are unresponsive. There are a lot of animations that must play out until the end before the game starts receiving input again. Those animations are short, but there are a lot of them: Disarming an opponent, wall bash, picking up a weapon. The game shows input hints, but doesn't receive input until these animations play out.Many (almost all) actions require you to hold a button instead of pressing it. This makes the whole gameplay a lot less responsive and slower. Looting, kicking down doors, picking up weapons, entering the car (exiting is just one button press, though)...There are also a lot of unskippable small cutscenes. Eating food, disarming minesOf the similar games in the genre, Shadow of Mordor, Arkham City, Assassin's Creed and Mad Max I enjoyed Mad Max the most. It is definitely not without flaws, but as far as 3rd-person distractathons go, its gameplay holds well together. It is mostly well written, the two combat modes are fun and the distractions hold well together for the most part.			"

												My Game of the Year for 2015 Mad Max is a thrilling joyride through beautiful terrain with brutal combat, amazing car chases / races, and an authentic look inside the mind of madness. I bought the game at full price, 60 bucks, and got every penny's worth.Done by the Just Cause guys, the world is almost overly massive. I didn't get too deeply into Just Cause because I felt like there was just too much crap I had to do. It can get a little repetetive crawling around abandoned bases trying to find that last piece of scrap metal to fully complete an area, but it manages to do the GTA thing where its fun just to drive around. The Combat is lifted from the Batman / LOTR games, but this game definitely does the style the best of those 3 titles. It achieves the rarely achievable ""It's awesome to kill somebody every single time you do it"". Brutal crunching sounds and primal screams, awesome animations and satisfying finishers. I found myself getting out of the car and baiting dudes just so I could punch their faces with Max's spiked gauntlets.The Car, the Magnum Opus, is the real star of the game, and yes, you do level up Max, but the car is the real main character. So many times I was supposed to play for ""just a little bit"" and then I kept going because I wanted to get the next engine upgrade. Cleverly tied to clearing the map, the car upgrading system - and the fact that, there isnt a ""BEST"" configuration, just a configuration that best suits your style of play - is the main hook that will keep you coming back.At this point im taking a slow burn on finishing it completely because I love it that much. The game is like a 6 pack of high quality imported beer - as tempted as I am to chug the rest of it, I'll keep it for when I really need to have some fun. You know what part I was always terrible at in writing class? the conclusion			"

												TL;DR Version:  Well, I enjoyed it more than Fallout 4.It's Batman Arkham meets Carmageddon and GTA w/ the Mad Max license.  If that doesn't entice you, I don't know what will.Don't rush through the story missions and do try to unlock fast travel spots ASAP.Always carry a spare gas can.------------------Maybe it was just me, but the game did not feel as repetitive as some others have complained about.  Yes, the landscape looks similar all over, but it's to be expected when you're in the middle of the desert.    Yes, tasks do repeat, but how many games these days don't follow some kind of grind cycle?  I never really felt bored through it, though.  Part of this may be a result of me spending a lot of time clearing scrap sites and knocking out territories as much as I could and really only advanced the story when I needed to do so.  The base story itself doesn't really have a sense of urgency (at least to me) until I start the quests specific to getting the Big Chief (a V8 engine), so in a way I felt more encouraged to take my time.  It probably would have felt like more of a grind if I just blitzed through the story missions ASAP and didn't do the side quest options.  So if there is one recommendation for playing a new game, it's take your time and explore.  I would also recommend unlocking fast-travel spots as soon as you can.  The Hot Air Baloons (which allow you to scout the area) as as fast-travel spots, but so do the Death Run spots.  Just drive right into the Death Run spot (not just passed it when gives you the bio for the place) and you have and automatic fast travel zone.  It does makes traversing the desert a lot quicker.  One thing I will note is by using fast-travel, you always spawn with your Magnum Opus.  So if you actually do play around with the specialty cars (not counting your Archangel mods for the Opus), it will reset and you will need to go back to a stronghold to re-obtain your car.The combat is mostly akin to the Arkham games, but now you have a shotgun, shivs, and can actually use the melee weapons.  Controls feel very responsive.  I don't feel “quite” as responsive as Batman in Arkham City, but I am playing as burnout ex-cop/soldier with bad knees and a death wish, so it isn't jarring for me.  It might just be me.  Even with that, the vast majority of times I died it was due to stupidity and not bad or unresponsive controls.  The camera can, at times, go a bit stupid.  That said, it's not enough to detract me from the experience.I have now beaten the game, but not 100%.  The ending was bittersweet, which is fitting for the Mad Max universe.  At some point I may go back and just scrounge around for scrap and history relics and collect the one car I am missing, but for the most part I am done and ready to tackle another game.  I will say I actually want to go back spelunking in the game at a later point, which I can't say about some other games I have beaten.  My largest gripe about the game is actually nothing to do with the overall scenery, story, mechanics, or anything else of that nature.  It's actually the pointless product placement rammed in it via the (admittedly minor) DLC which comes with purchase.  Two of the hood ornaments and one of the cars unlocked in the game are just ads for Rockstar Energy Drinks.  Kind of wrecks the immersion just a bit.  The hood ornaments are at least useful in early game (before you unlock the others), but the unlocked car is a pig's♥♥♥♥♥♥  All that aside, I still enjoyed my time in the game.  As of this writing, the game is currently retailing for $19.99 and I would consider it money well spent.  Lord knows I've bought other more expensive games which were greater letdowns.			"

												This had potential, but for me failed to live up to my expectations. Basically you are driving around performing the same 3 or 4 tasks, over and over with no incentive to do so.Here is a sandbox, let's put dots everywehere on the map, and when a user gets there, lets annoy them with cramped and unimaginative level design.The total lack of story and bad driving really ruined this game for me.Pros- Runs smooth- Nice graphics and character design- Easy to understand upgrade system- Water, Gas, & Food system was nice- Finding land mines with your dogCons- Cramped level design- Very Poor driving mechanics- Fighting was a bit boring and limited- No story at all   (Build a V8 engine... That's the whole story)If you want a great sandbox game to play. Play 'Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt' it's awesome.			"

												What is bad about Mad Max?Probably only that sometimes you end up doing quests  that you should have done ages ago, thus unlocking an item that's behind what you currently have and that the ""TOP DOG"" characters are all pretty much the same.What is good about Mad Max?Pretty much everything else.This game has surprised me, it went from a game I bought because it was cheap (£10 @ CDKEYS) to a game that I would say is one of the best I've played in ages. I even went and watched the first 3 Mad Max films and noticed the game pays homage to atleast road warrior and thunderdome, it was nice to see respect from the developers.I think it's a must have, stick with it and enjoy.

Mad MaxMad Max is an open world third-person action-adventure game that has elements of both a PRG and a Shooter.  I have been watching this game for a long time and of course I pre-ordered it as soon as it was available but I have to admit I was a little worried after Batman: Arkam Knight.  I can honestly say that so far in I am really liking this game.  Port StatusMad Max plays great. The controls work well with the exception in the menu where I was forced to use my controller to log into WB.  Now this may only be an issue because I have a controller plugged in, but it was still an issue all the same and I should not have to unplug a controller to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. GraphicsThey have done an awesome job optimizing this game.  I did have some lighting issues with flickering but after downloading the new Nvidia driver 355.82 it was flicker free.  With Vsync off I am getting well over 200 fps with every setting maxed out.  The graphics are Next Gen and look great.StoryI really like the story, but then who doesn't like Mad Max. It is the familiar post appopolyptic story where Max has lost everything and revenge.  The open world game with side quests are great.  The environment is easy to immerse yourself in.  I just wish you had choices and consequences. Furious BugsThe game is bug free for the most part although some people have experienced issues with the map, I have found an entirely different issue.  My bug relates to an earlier quest I completed in the first zone unlocking ammo stations in the last two zones.  Unfortunately my ammo stations are not unlocked and of course there is no way to replay the quest without replaying the game so I am unable to collect an achievement I earned unless I replay the game to do so.  The game has been patched several times but my issue remains.  After 75hrs in this game, I still enjoy running around in game, racing, and destroying cars but I am not too excited at the prospect of finding all of the loot objects again.  ConculsionThe game delivers in almost every aspect and I recommend it without any hesitation.			"

												Absolutely stunning. Absolutely beautiful. So when I first opened the game, I had never heard of the movies. I admit, I might have been living inside the barrel for a while, but I played the game 20 hours until I watched ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". And guess what? I definitely enjoyed it. Mad Max is a game about a man who has lost everything, in the beginning his car, and then starts his hunt to get the car back only to meet Chumbucket, a hunchback who will build him a new car called ""The Opus Magnum"". So in a nutshell, Mad Max is a game about a man who looses his car, meets a hunchback that builds him a new car and now is searching for a V8 motor for the ""Magnum Opus"" in a desert wasteland.As I said, the game itself is open-world, post-apocalyptic and on times challenging: not too hard, it's repeating a lot of tasks. There's no hard ending due to repeating tasks. Surely, it's not like some other games, but it's still great. It's filled with places to loot to with enemy camps and easter eggs which are easy to miss if you haven't watched the movies or played other games from this studio. I mean, there's a lot of references are straight to the movies, like eating the ""Dinki Di"" food to restore health. So I'd recommend watching the movie(s) and then play the game. I currently play with a EVGA GTX 980 Superclocked (4GB) and I minor problems with the game. Some minor crashes in certain locations, but overall the FPS was solid 60. Definitely a huge plus. Even in the most intensive sandstorms the FPS stayed as a solid 60 with no drops at all. The game is amazingly good optimized, looks pretty, even runs pretty.If you don't like to drive from one location to another or hates driving, the game isn't for you.Otherwise, I truly recommend the game. Great game and it even has replay potential, 10/10.			"

												A good action game. The graphics and effects are cool, but need a powerfull hardware to run, even in low quality. Has little bugs, like sometimes keys not respond or do it late. The mechanics is very good. There are upgrades for skills, gear and vehicles, but personal weapons are very limited: no crossbows and only can carry 5 skewers and 11 shotgun cartridges. The combat is based on combos of punching, kicks and spectacular fighting technics, against many enemies, rarely less of 4. They are few types, but with different behavoirs. Vehicles are more diverse, but there arent big trucks or War Rigs. There are static globes, but no gyrocopters. The survival system is not well implemented, scrap, water and gasoline are abundant and crafting is limitated to proyects in allied fortresses. The map is sandbox and can explore locations at will, demolish enemy structures, attacking convoys and take forts by assault; but there are circuits of car races, an idea not related with Mad Max films. Great duration: accomplish all tasks, get at least 90% achievements and explore the 200 places takes more than 100 hours of fun.			"

												This game is unfortunantly a bit underrated, It's realy a nice and enjoing with a great story, immersing atmosphere, great graphics and scenery, and joyful fighting mechanics both in car and on foot.The main problem is very frustrating driving physics wich make driving and and espcially racing very hard, also the game gets repetative after a while, you drive to your next mission, and fight your way against bandit's cars, each time more of the same, a bit tiresome. otherwise: worth the money if you get on a good sale, 7/10.

												Excellent and very addictive game.I think i need about 50-60 hours to complete all things, but, maybe I am not sure, all in all, one of the greatest action/survival games in history of video games.Also this game has weird start up (cannot start for one day, but next day it will start up without changing DLL files), and also, one of the greatest hits that is perfectly optimized for ALL PCs (yeap, about 200 fps on r9 290x in ultra sets on 1080p FHD)! 9/10			"

												Excellent graphics, Very optimized, Really big open-world, Best explosion and vehicle carnage, Great special effects and so many amazing locations to discover ! Post-apocalyptic game 8/10 ********A wasteland game that is heavily influenced by the movie of the year (2015), Mad Max: Fury Road. Though the main story doesnt exceed even the least of my expectations before the game's release but it delivers a vast open world with so many unique places to discover and pillage. Which happens to be the best part of the game.The main attraction of this game is the vehicular combat and the car customizing functionality. Learn to drive like a mad man to best your opponents in the desert wasteland and you will be visually rewarded with beautiful explosions and chaos. The combat style flows closely with the Batman: Arkham games ( made by the same developers ) but IMO: they made it much better and more violent like it should be. Experiment with all kinds of weapons you can find during a battle because they will never fail to amuse you. ( My favorite was the Thunderstick ). Setting aside the main quests, this game heavily relies on exploration and side quests. It may seem that the developers spent more time in designing the entire world than focusing on its story that reminds me of some other post-apocalyptic themed games I played before ( Fallout ).Bottom line is, this was an amazing hotseat video game that I could just turn my mind off to and relax.

												Mad Max... four movies... a few books... plenty of content to draw from to make a game. This one supposedly created BEFORE the the latest film so therefore should draw on that content. Let me give you a quick rundown on the game and what I ultimately think of it with about 20 hours in the game. If your A.D.H.D. wont let you read for more than 2 minutes... skip to the bottom for my final verdict. Note that this is a review from a 25+ year gamer who is just over 30 years old.  OverviewYou are Mad Max. A long time ago a lawman in the Main Force Patrol, Max has been forced to become more animal than man as he struggles through life in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Australia, In the films we see him get more and more lost as a person, and more and more brutal while trying to cling to the past. In the game, you are trying to live and make peace with yourself and your past. Not quite the deranged killer like in the latest film.The game starts out with your vehicle getting stolen (one of the Pursuit Special Interceptors). It is stolen by the Warlord and his men, Scabrous Scrotus (who ultimately is the son of Immortan Joe). Max is stripped of his weapons, clothes, and belongings. He has to learn how to survive again while making two very important friends along the way (this is your tutorial of sorts). After a certain key moment in the game (I wont give it away), you are thrust into the open world and allowed to follow the main storyline or do side questing. GraphicsI reference graphics early on in most games because there are a LOT of graphics ♥♥♥♥♥s out there. People that wont play a game unless it is up to par with current standards. You can be rest assured that the graphics while not next-gen, they do well for the setting and are pleasing on the eyes. They're good enough, but don't tax your PC. I'll explain more on that below in the review.I did see some screenshots of blurry graphics and abominations... but didn't experience any of that myself. I only ever ran into two graphical problems:1. While getting in my vehicle in front of an outpost, I looked back and could see through the front gate and into the world. For some reason at certain angles the graphics de-rendered. 2. While jumping off of a wall climb, I could see through a cave wall into the nothingness that is below the rendered world.Not bad all things considered. StorylineAfter the pivotal moment in the storyline... you'll get the option to explore. If you stick to the quests you'll be looking for a place to hide. Continuing with that will provide you with some unique objectives. The storyline itself seems... meh... at best. Your character doesn't seem so hellbent on revenge as I would have been. He instead goes off on various side tasks that seem to take away from the main story.The storyline does flow rather well and compel you to keep going. 20 hours into the game and I'm only into my second region with many more to go (thought I have been hitting up the side quests).Side QuestingThe side quests consist of everything from providing water to parched pedestrians (say that 10 x fast)... to clearing out stronghold camps... to collecting items from scavenge camps and more. I found myself reaching the second region, and going back to make sure I got 100% of the items from the first. I've done that in AC, JC2, and other games where I need to get a 100% and apparantly that's my OCD. The side quests are repetitive. No two areas seem the same... some are above ground, some below. Some have buildings, some have tunnels. Some places you blow up, some you have objectives in. They're different enough to keep doing them, but I can't help thinking that eventually, I'm going to grow tired of it (like I did in JC2). CombatI like the combat both on ground and in vehicles. But it does get repetitive. I went from being amazed and blown away by it all... loving every image that popped across the screen... to blanking out and then coming to after it was over. Just becomes something I have to get through, just to get through. The vehicle combat is either disable/destroy their vehicle, or hop out and hope they'll eventually do the same. Then it becomes a ground fight. I did that more often than not until I upgraded my Harpoon to level 4 (where I could then rip tires off). After that, I rip wheels off, and go to ground and fight or run them over. I can also harpoon them and fling them around for S's and G's.Most of your combat will be on the ground in strongholds and such. Get used to it, and try to do things differently if you can. Skills that Max acquires later will make the fighting more unique when he can do different finishers. But that comes later.Skills, and UpgradesYou can upgrade your character from the clothing to his finishers. You can upgrade his weapons, and add skill points to his health, how much water he gathers, etc. It's pretty extensive and makes your character feel unique. A lot of the upgrading as well as with the vehicle is done with scrap. Scrap is found across the world in mini-camps, destroying enemy vehicles, and more. The first few upgrades will seem easy. They then multiply and become increasingly expensive (like 600, 900, or more scrap). If you complete the main storyline you will have the opportunity to return scrapulance (scrap vehicles) to the base for a payout around 500 scrap each. This will help you upgrade quickly. I was impressed with the amount of things you can upgrade. Especially with the vehicle. Everything from the wheels to push bumper to engine to exhaust, etc. Some content unlocking is restricted to the story however.Game PerformanceI run a PC with the following specs:AMD FX-8370 (8 core CPU) @ 4.01ghzG.Skill RAM 16GB @ 1600mhzAsus GTX 960 2GBWindows 10I can run the game at 60fps on 1920 x 1080 with almost ZERO loss of frames with the graphics settings maxed out (except shadows which are on HIGH). Only once for some odd reason did I drop to 44 frames which then instantly went back to 60. I will always hover between 59 and 60 when just running around no matter how much I have on the screen (this is also while streaming). This is probably the SINGLE BEST port to PC that I've ever seen when it comes to performance. I've only run into a couple bugs, and really splitting hairs... I only have a few complaints about the game. It's not my ""favorite"" game... but it is absolutely solid. I had a few people message me about how it is... and I couldn't lie... it's decent.Final VerdictRepetition aside... the game is pretty fun. I still feel like I'm seeing some new things each time I load the game up. I'm generally liking the characters and how vastly different they are. The world is bland (desert environment) but then that's the whole premise behind it. The whole world is now waterless. Don't expect Just Cause 2 where you can go from swimming in the water to snow capped mountains in a few minutes. I feel the game is lacking a bit in terms of depth (they could really do something with the gang warfare to make it feel like a real struggle in the wasteland instead of mindless killing of a vehicle that just drove by). They could have allowed you to venture off and build your own fortress... and really feel like it's YOURS. Maybe become a Warlord yourself (but then would that really be ""Mad Max""?)... all sorts of possibilities are in place for this game and franchise. It'll be interesting to see what they add in DLC's (I imagine we'll see at LEAST 6 different paid DLC's if JC2 or similar games are any example).Should you buy it? I bought it at $36 from Green Man Gaming. At that price, I say HELL YES you should buy it. For $60? Probably not. Find a discount price for the game... but use a REPUTABLE source. You don't want to lose your account over this game.			"

												What is bad about Mad Max?Probably only that sometimes you end up doing quests  that you should have done ages ago, thus unlocking an item that's behind what you currently have and that the ""TOP DOG"" characters are all pretty much the same.What is good about Mad Max?Pretty much everything else.This game has surprised me, it went from a game I bought because it was cheap (£10 @ CDKEYS) to a game that I would say is one of the best I've played in ages. I even went and watched the first 3 Mad Max films and noticed the game pays homage to atleast road warrior and thunderdome, it was nice to see respect from the developers.I think it's a must have, stick with it and enjoy.

Posted: November 2, 2015
												Mad Max can easily be summarised by the following.... Do you like Shadow of Mordor? Do you like cars? If so - then this latest WB release will be right up your street.The game centres around the main hero of the same title - finding and progressing his way through the desolate landscape that is synonymous with the story setting. Dry, vast expanses are covered fairly quickly by means of different vehicles as well as key locations being found that allow a much needed fast travel ability.You start out with literally nothing - though you quickly acquire a close follower called Chumbucket who's main role is to repair your vehicle - but also performs the function of a 'turret' from the rear platform of your vehicle. Low-level equipment unlocks allow a basic harpoon to be fired into opposing cars tyres, doors and even drivers - disabling them instantly and allowing you to close in for the kill. Higher-spec enemies are armoured, meaning that the harpoon too has to increase in ability, in order to immobilise the enemy. Later on, thunderpoons come online - literally a crude bazooka type weapon that can instantly render an enemy vehicle into burning wreckage, or failing that - Max himself can take aim from his driving position and fire the sawn-off shotgun with highly effective results.The car driving and battling is very well done. Don't for one minute expect Project Cars levels of vehicle dynamics - but what is there is accessible and more importantly - easy to understand and make sense of. Adding beefed-up armour may solidify your vehicle (affectionately known as the Magnum Opus) against head-on collisions. But the increased weight takes a heavy toll on the performance of the standard engine - even with modifications to the exhaust and other vehicle components.There's also a nice balance to the frequency of the car battles too. Not too many where progress becomes a chore, though not too infrequent as to be lacking. Aside from other wasteland drivers awaiting to take you off-road (in a far more literal and permanent sense) - there are convoys to attack in order for you to steal their prized cargo. Convoy attacks add an extra level of fun to the battles as the Magnum Opus is often out-numbered by 5-to-1 and escort vehicles that are rammed away can quickly make a return to the fray. The carnage that ensues is usually fast, frantic and enjoyable - especially when you become the victor through your own driving abilities.Max also slugs it out on foot - and this is where the immediate comparison to Shadow of Mordor appears. Hand-to-hand combat is very similar indeed - involving fists, feet, but also unlockable moves involving shivs, shotgun blasts and brutal finishing moves against walls or the floor itself. Boss fights occur when attacking a story or plot-line target and usually after taking on his henchmen first.One key aspect where Mad Max is superior to SoM however, is with the enemy respawning. SoM was totally and utterly ruined in my opinion, by the crazy respawn of orcs. 20, 30 sometimes even 40+ spawned enemies were battled against single-handedly, with little in the way of an end being in sight. In Mad Max, you assault a target with a fixed number of enemies - and those enemies don't magically respawn behind you once you turn a corner. It's a small change, but it makes for a much more rewarding experience and one that you feel that you're making genuine progress with.Underpinning Max's travels are the strongholds - visits to loosely allied centres of opposition across the map. Although very few in number, they need Max's help just as much as Max benefits from them. Upgrading the strongholds through mission completions allows the refilling of water canteens, ammo belts, health and petrol for the Magnum - with each returning visit. They are a safe bolt-hole should the enemies outside get a little too much. However, the people that run these strongholds clearly have their own agendas to be wary of.Mad Max, although superior in gameplay to SoM - isn't without some issues. First off, the fact that with only half of the game map currently revealed to me so far - I have already maxed out Max to the one-man killing machine that he has become. Also, the fast travel ability back to the strongholds makes it easy to flee the battle as ammo starts to run dry, resupply and then go back and carry on where you left off. Blocking within the melee combat phase can be a little hit and miss too - Max being committed to the attack animation, then being unable to block, despite frequent and sometimes frustrating presses of the block key. Another slightly silly aspect, is that despite the premise of fuel being more valuable than life - Max spends a considerable amount of time blowing up transfer tanks and other oil related production equipment. Someone also appeared to make fuel within the game very plentiful too.The crown jewel for Mad Max however - is the backdrop. It is stunning to look at in the most desolate and weary way. There's a beauty in the barreness of the wasteland that few other games have managed to capture. I recall being equally impressed by a very small number of titles to the scenery that unfolds before you. The Elder Scrolls Oblivion upon leaving the jail was one - as was exiting the Vault for the first time on Fallout 3 and finally peering off into the vast distance from a hillside on GTAV - which at the time was running on the minimalist hardware of the XBox 360.Mad Max instills into you, the clear and welcome need to go out and explore. There's a small plume of smoke on the horizon - what's over there? If I drive the car up to the top of that ridge, what can I see from up there? Many a time I find myself driving about simply because I can - and admiring the Sun bleached vistas before me. Even at night - the Moon shining high in the sky and stars set as a backdrop, hidden occasionally by the wispy clouds - or the oncoming onslaught of fierce storm. It's a very nice game to look at - especially with each location looking unique and not merely a clone of somewhere else, close by.Overall, I would heartily recommend Mad Max. It's a game that you can take at your own pace and plod through. It doesn't have the depth of similar background games - the Fallout and Wasteland series immediately spring to mind. However, if they were to create a love-child between themselves and this title - I believe that game would be the pinnacle of post apocalyptic escapism, imaginable.8/10			"

While jumping off of a wall climb, I could see through a cave wall into the nothingness that is below the rendered world.Not bad all things considered. StorylineAfter the pivotal moment in the storyline... you'll get the option to explore. If you stick to the quests you'll be looking for a place to hide. Continuing with that will provide you with some unique objectives. The storyline itself seems... meh... at best. Your character doesn't seem so hellbent on revenge as I would have been. He instead goes off on various side tasks that seem to take away from the main story.The storyline does flow rather well and compel you to keep going. 20 hours into the game and I'm only into my second region with many more to go (thought I have been hitting up the side quests).Side QuestingThe side quests consist of everything from providing water to parched pedestrians (say that 10 x fast)... to clearing out stronghold camps... to collecting items from scavenge camps and more. I found myself reaching the second region, and going back to make sure I got 100% of the items from the first. I've done that in AC, JC2, and other games where I need to get a 100% and apparantly that's my OCD. The side quests are repetitive. No two areas seem the same... some are above ground, some below. Some have buildings, some have tunnels. Some places you blow up, some you have objectives in. They're different enough to keep doing them, but I can't help thinking that eventually, I'm going to grow tired of it (like I did in JC2). CombatI like the combat both on ground and in vehicles. But it does get repetitive. I went from being amazed and blown away by it all... loving every image that popped across the screen... to blanking out and then coming to after it was over. Just becomes something I have to get through, just to get through. The vehicle combat is either disable/destroy their vehicle, or hop out and hope they'll eventually do the same. Then it becomes a ground fight. I did that more often than not until I upgraded my Harpoon to level 4 (where I could then rip tires off). After that, I rip wheels off, and go to ground and fight or run them over. I can also harpoon them and fling them around for S's and G's.Most of your combat will be on the ground in strongholds and such. Get used to it, and try to do things differently if you can. Skills that Max acquires later will make the fighting more unique when he can do different finishers. But that comes later.Skills, and UpgradesYou can upgrade your character from the clothing to his finishers. You can upgrade his weapons, and add skill points to his health, how much water he gathers, etc. It's pretty extensive and makes your character feel unique. A lot of the upgrading as well as with the vehicle is done with scrap. Scrap is found across the world in mini-camps, destroying enemy vehicles, and more. The first few upgrades will seem easy. They then multiply and become increasingly expensive (like 600, 900, or more scrap). If you complete the main storyline you will have the opportunity to return scrapulance (scrap vehicles) to the base for a payout around 500 scrap each. This will help you upgrade quickly. I was impressed with the amount of things you can upgrade. Especially with the vehicle. Everything from the wheels to push bumper to engine to exhaust, etc. Some content unlocking is restricted to the story however.Game PerformanceI run a PC with the following specs:AMD FX-8370 (8 core CPU) @ 4.01ghzG.Skill RAM 16GB @ 1600mhzAsus GTX 960 2GBWindows 10I can run the game at 60fps on 1920 x 1080 with almost ZERO loss of frames with the graphics settings maxed out (except shadows which are on HIGH). Only once for some odd reason did I drop to 44 frames which then instantly went back to 60. I will always hover between 59 and 60 when just running around no matter how much I have on the screen (this is also while streaming). This is probably the SINGLE BEST port to PC that I've ever seen when it comes to performance. I've only run into a couple bugs, and really splitting hairs... I only have a few complaints about the game. It's not my ""favorite"" game... but it is absolutely solid. I had a few people message me about how it is... and I couldn't lie... it's decent.Final VerdictRepetition aside... the game is pretty fun. I still feel like I'm seeing some new things each time I load the game up. I'm generally liking the characters and how vastly different they are. The world is bland (desert environment) but then that's the whole premise behind it. The whole world is now waterless. Don't expect Just Cause 2 where you can go from swimming in the water to snow capped mountains in a few minutes. I feel the game is lacking a bit in terms of depth (they could really do something with the gang warfare to make it feel like a real struggle in the wasteland instead of mindless killing of a vehicle that just drove by). They could have allowed you to venture off and build your own fortress... and really feel like it's YOURS. Maybe become a Warlord yourself (but then would that really be ""Mad Max""?)... all sorts of possibilities are in place for this game and franchise. It'll be interesting to see what they add in DLC's (I imagine we'll see at LEAST 6 different paid DLC's if JC2 or similar games are any example).Should you buy it? I bought it at $36 from Green Man Gaming. At that price, I say HELL YES you should buy it. For $60? Probably not. Find a discount price for the game... but use a REPUTABLE source. You don't want to lose your account over this game.			"

												Mad Max... four movies... a few books... plenty of content to draw from to make a game. This one supposedly created BEFORE the the latest film so therefore should draw on that content. Let me give you a quick rundown on the game and what I ultimately think of it with about 20 hours in the game. If your A.D.H.D. wont let you read for more than 2 minutes... skip to the bottom for my final verdict. Note that this is a review from a 25+ year gamer who is just over 30 years old.  OverviewYou are Mad Max. A long time ago a lawman in the Main Force Patrol, Max has been forced to become more animal than man as he struggles through life in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Australia, In the films we see him get more and more lost as a person, and more and more brutal while trying to cling to the past. In the game, you are trying to live and make peace with yourself and your past. Not quite the deranged killer like in the latest film.The game starts out with your vehicle getting stolen (one of the Pursuit Special Interceptors). It is stolen by the Warlord and his men, Scabrous Scrotus (who ultimately is the son of Immortan Joe). Max is stripped of his weapons, clothes, and belongings. He has to learn how to survive again while making two very important friends along the way (this is your tutorial of sorts). After a certain key moment in the game (I wont give it away), you are thrust into the open world and allowed to follow the main storyline or do side questing. GraphicsI reference graphics early on in most games because there are a LOT of graphics ♥♥♥♥♥s out there. People that wont play a game unless it is up to par with current standards. You can be rest assured that the graphics while not next-gen, they do well for the setting and are pleasing on the eyes. They're good enough, but don't tax your PC. I'll explain more on that below in the review.I did see some screenshots of blurry graphics and abominations... but didn't experience any of that myself. I only ever ran into two graphical problems:1. While getting in my vehicle in front of an outpost, I looked back and could see through the front gate and into the world. For some reason at certain angles the graphics de-rendered. 2. While jumping off of a wall climb, I could see through a cave wall into the nothingness that is below the rendered world.Not bad all things considered.

												Excellent graphics, Very optimized, Really big open-world, Best explosion and vehicle carnage, Great special effects and so many amazing locations to discover ! Post-apocalyptic game 8/10 ********A wasteland game that is heavily influenced by the movie of the year (2015), Mad Max: Fury Road. Though the main story doesnt exceed even the least of my expectations before the game's release but it delivers a vast open world with so many unique places to discover and pillage. Which happens to be the best part of the game.The main attraction of this game is the vehicular combat and the car customizing functionality. Learn to drive like a mad man to best your opponents in the desert wasteland and you will be visually rewarded with beautiful explosions and chaos. The combat style flows closely with the Batman: Arkham games ( made by the same developers ) but IMO: they made it much better and more violent like it should be. Experiment with all kinds of weapons you can find during a battle because they will never fail to amuse you. ( My favorite was the Thunderstick ). Setting aside the main quests, this game heavily relies on exploration and side quests. It may seem that the developers spent more time in designing the entire world than focusing on its story that reminds me of some other post-apocalyptic themed games I played before ( Fallout ).Bottom line is, this was an amazing hotseat video game that I could just turn my mind off to and relax.

												One of the best games I've played in recent years. The car combat is very satisfying and even the somewhat simplistic arkham style ground combat is fun, especially because the game switches the two around constantly. Like other reviewers have noted the game has a lot of ""busy"" work but I never found it to be any more ""grindy"" then what you generally see in pretty much every open world game these days.Also it needs to be said that the game is absolutely gorgeous. They actually managed to make a mostly desert area look beautiful and interesting. The day and night cycles are also noteworthy. The whole game just looks like a benchmark game, but it's extremely well optimised and fortunately never feels like one.It's one of the few games I actually 100%'ed this year and that says a lot about it. I could never put myself to do so in games like say: assassin's creed, and it's mostly just because the combat and the upgrading mechanics for the car are so much fun.Highly recommended!			"

												I haven't played much so far, but I am VERY pleasantly surprised with the level of quality this game has. Made by the same people who created the Just Cause series, Avalance have pulled out all the stops. I was reluctant at first because whilst Just Cause 2 in particular had very entertaining gameplay, the story and replay-value was lacking. I'm happy to say this isn't the case for Mad Max. The graphics are phenomenal and the map is beautiful and vast. There is vehicle and character customization, as well as levelling. There is a story with numerous interesting characters, a huge number of side quests, a brutal combat system, and many different environments to explore. I am usually sceptical of games based on movies (even by name, if nothing else), but this stands alone as a wonderfully crafted game with a unique atmosphere, and you will often stumble upon places that give you a sense of how the world was like before the apocalypse. The game delves into details I wouldn't ever have imagined it would. You have a journal that contains details on every aspect of the world. The countless different enemies you encounter in the wasteland, the different characters, weapons, items, relics, and so forth. The one issue I have found so far, is that the game isn't particularly challenging. I haven't died once yet (apart from the one time I accidentally rolled off a cliff, but that's a story for another occasion), which I find disappointing. Whilst enemies oft swarm you in large numbers, Max is considerably stronger (even before levelling up), which means I feel overpowered even before I've begun. A difficulty level choice would be a welcome, welcome addition.So far, I'd give it an 8/10. Surprisingly atmospheric, in-depth, and enjoyable. I'd highly recommend it.			"

												Man I had allot of fun playing this game more then I thought I would.I wasn't sure if I would like it, because the game is very based on your car.But I did like the game, you basicly have to survive in a Wasteland that I would call Australia.You fight on enemy's either on foot, but also battles between cars and try on the path upgrade your car to make it better.What I like about the upgrading is that it's not your default +1 level armor upgrade, but it's about balancing stuff out so you create the ultimate beast, for example a better engine will decrease your handeling, so you add something to balance it all out.I pretty much only used the base car with some pimping to make it beast offcourse, but the game offers you allot of different body types for your car so you can change it (named Archangels).This game just has allot to offer and it can be repetive for people, but If it didn't have some of the same elements like taking over a Top Dog Camp then you would finish the game to early and get less value for your money.You don't have to do all the side stuff you know. Anyways I loved the game and played it for 46 hours then I had enough if you go for 100% it probally takes about 50 hours.			"

(not as epic as in the movie but i can live with this one :D)- camera setting during vehicle combat and melee can be annoying at times- mob fights are ridiculously hard at times- boss fights not too challenging- characters are not that strong compared to the moviesif you enjoy the movie then get this game, i think the story is not connected but the atmosphere of the movie is clearly there, though not all of it but its a well made title.

Mad Max is a combat racing and beat'em up adventure game. Having lost the Black-on-Black Interceptor to Immortan Joe's son Scrotus, the Road Warrior known as Max teams up with a blackfinger called Chumbucket, who sees Max as the Holy Driver that will help him build the greatest car the Great White has ever seen: the Magnum Opus.Pros: The story is bitter, as a Mad Max story should be: you aren't a hero, you a survivor that cares for no one, grudgingly making uneasy alliances strictly if it benefits you. The game seeks to be a love-letter to the post-apocalyptic franchise all other games, from Fallout to Borderlands, were inspired from. The landscape is much more varied than you'd expect from a desert, including volcanic sulfur pits, pearl-white sea beds, rocky canyons, black sludge marshes, even storms go from windy sandstorms to thunderstorm hurricanes, making sure each regions has an atmosphere of its own. The car combat mechanics are excellent, while the hand-to-hand combat is a brutal but instantly recognizable game of block, hit, parry and combo. Car customization is pretty sweet, some upgrades go without saying while others require you to balance speed and strength to fit your play style.Cons: The game lacks interactions, you may only speak to characters (which are pretty few) when there's a main or sidequest available, with the exception of the occasional encounter with scavengers. Many world objectives are repetitive, and camp bosses are simple reskins of each other, the level design being the only difference you'll find from one camp or convoy to another. There is no personal customization except for beard, the rest being straightforward upgrades. If you don't bother with lowering threat levels, completing Death Races or collecting cars, you will find the game to be extremely short.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!I really liked this game! The intuitive car combat makes it fun, so much so that I pretty much forgot the game allowed fast travel! I really wish there was more to the story, more people to interact with, but I guess that would make it too much of an attempt at a Fallout clone, so I'll take it for the depressing world it is, and give it a strong recommendation!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

 ""I am the one that runs from both the living and the dead. Hunted by scavengers, haunted by those I could not protect. So I exist in this wasteland, reduced to one instinct: survive."" Genre: Action Adventure, Open WorldYear of Release: 2015Developer: Avalanche Studios Presentation The graphics are spectacular; everytime I start up the game, I find myself continually in awe at the pretiness of the environments and beautiful graphical detail. Even better, this is an amazingly optimized game, so maintaining high-end settings won't be a problem for most people. The sounds, from the roar of car engines, the fiery explosions, and even the small echoes in the wind are appropriately mixed and sound excellent. The music however is not all that great and ends up being very forgettable, which is a shame given the epic score Junkie XL recently made for Fury Road. All these elements work together to create a world that really feels like a good blend between the feel of George Miller's original Mad Max films and the visual asthetics of Fury Road.   Story You are Max. Your world is fire and blood. Chances are if you've seen a Mad Max film, you know exactly what kind of post apocalyptic wasteland world Max lives in. But if you haven't, the game provides an intriguing look into the Mad Max world that's friendly to newcomers of the series. Lord Scrotus, son of Immortan Joe (the villain from Fury Road) has stolen Max's Interceptor, so now Max is on a quest to get it back. In doing so, he'll team up with the love child of Gollum and the Hutchback of Notre Dame, Chumbucket, a lowly mechanic who will help Max build the ultimate car, The Magnum Opus. The story, in spite of introducing characters and plot points that try to imitate the madness one would come to expect from a Mad Max story, just ends up being mostly forgettable. The story's greatest strength however is the fact that it is weak; it allows you to enjoy a much greater wasteland adventure outside the main quest line, and at no point attempts to pull you away from the fun you'll have exploring the world. So while it may be far from remarkable, the story in Mad Max is certainly passable, and does feels like the type of tale you'd expect to see in the films.  World As simple as a desert wasteland open world may sound, it's actually treated with incredible care and attention to detail. Driving through the abandoned leftovers of civillization and exploring landmarks such as highways or submerged airports provide a unique-feeling open world that's never boring to explore. Unfortunately, its paired with a mixed bag of side acitivies that may provide for several hours of gameplay, but quickly boil down to an Ubisoft-style arrangement of side-content. Some activities are very fun and usually worthwhile, but begin to feel repetitive after some time playing. The thing that keeps you coming back to do more of these activities is the sheer fun of exploring the beautiful and dangerous open world. Gameplay The gameplay formula in Mad Max is probably best comparable to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag in the sense that roughly half the game is spent on land while another is in boat/car. Your car is fully customizable and upgradeable-- engine, suspension, armor, exaust, etc. are ALL elements that can be upgraded. Not all of the upgrades progress linerally (ie some upgrades raise certain stats while lowering others), forcing you to create a car that best fits your needs. Max also has a variety of upgrades to improve health and damage, but they're no where near as useful or as necessary.The driving is a big sluggish at first, but only takes a few hours of playing to master. Car combat is amazingly fun and the most well-done element of Mad Max. Every car combat encounter can be tackled with clever use of your harpoon, shotgun, thunderspoon, or just straight-up charged ramming into other vehicles. Factor in the wide variety of enemy types and levels, and you have a fairly deep car combat system. The harpoon and thunderspoon also double as a useful tool for destorying environmental obstacles or clearing pathways. Ultimately, this game really sets the bar for car combat/encounters in video games (*cough* Arkham Knight *cough).The on-ground gameplay is not so stellar. Mad Max is yet another game that borrows its combat system from the Arkham games, though admittedly this is one of the better takes on it. Max is a dirty fighter and the combat emulates that pretty well, but it eventually becomes repetitive and a bit clunky due to an awkward camera that actually makes combat harder than it should be. There's also a fair bit of boss battles throughout, but most of them end up not being fun or all that challenging due to the combat's simplicity. On-ground combat may occupy a good bit of the game, but it's not enough to stop you from pushing on. Conclusion Max Max is a fun and action packed adventure that provides a faithful representation of George Miller's Mad Max world. The story, though weak and somewhat forgettable, sets up a grander adventure outside the main plot you're bound to enjoy. As beautiful and unqiuely designed as the open world may seem, it's paired with a lackluster variety of side content that's fun, but somewhat tedious. The car, including its combat and upgrades, is a huge truimph and the best element of Mad Max. On-ground however, Max's gameplay falls a bit short due to clunky combat. In the end, while Mad Max may be somewhat repetitive and uneven in its design, it has several moments of greatness and kept me coming back again and again to play more. Final Rating: 7/10 Worth it if bought slightly discounted or cheaper. "

												I went in not knowing what to expect. In my experience, movie games tend to be poorly made cash grabs, but I had heard good things about this one. The leveling system is rather unique. Rather than being based on experience, quests or the like, you raise your legend rank by completing specific tasks, some of them repeatable. This in turn gives you ""tokens"" which you can redeem with the enigmatic Griffa, who I am not entirely convinced isn't just one of Max's hallucinations. Now, how many tokens you can spend on any one aspect of Max's abilities is gated- a gate which increases as your olegend rank increases. While this does prevent you from just maxing out health right away, it also encourages you to spend tokens in other attributes- and you have to spend them all. Reaching the (heh) Max level is not that hard- by the end of the game, I was 84 levels over the ""max"" level after I ground to around level 90 at the first stronghold. Not that you have to, but it does make the game significantly easier. The Magnum Opus, well, she's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, once you get fully upgraded thunderpoons there is nothing in the game that can stand in your way. On the other hand, in order to have anything resembling decent handling you have to keep her relatively lightly armored. God forbid you want to do ramming attacks as well, although with thunderpoons, the stock harpoon, and a fully upgraded shotgun you won't really have need of those. Strongholds... now there's a fun mechanic. Strongholds are safe havens which you can upgrade to give you various benefits, such as free ammo refills, water, a full tank of gas.... basically, everything you need. And the more you improve a stronghold, the more it improves visually as well- you can see the difference you are making as it gets more built-up. Getting all the pieces required to do so can be a bit of a pain, but the payoff is well worth it, and thankfully you can mark their locations on your map while you are in the stronghold. The threat mechanic is two things: first, it determines how dangerous an area is by determining how many patrols there are, and second it acts to gate Magnum Opus upgrades. This is a bit of a mixed bag; on one hand, scarecrows and snipers are easy to find, and you can find a number of them just by using the omnipresent balloons which are in every region. On the other hand, clearing camps can become frustrating if you cannot find the last objective to destroy, as these are not in any way marked on your map. Minefields are actually not that bad, though- their is a mechanic for finding them, and it has a good bit of range to it. And generally, clearing out the camps is fun. Convoys are generally meant for when you are highly upgraded- the early ones can be taken out by Max with a fully upgraded shotgun, but the later ones almost certainly need high-powered thunderpoons to do readily. Now, the story... the wstory actually made me not like Max that much, but it fits; he's trying to survive, and trying to avoid becomming close to anyone. He is very single-mindely focused on his quest to cross the plains of silence, and to build a car that will let him do so. And he does not let anything or anyone get in the way. Could the story have been deeper? Almost certainly. But I do think the story was decent.  My conclusion? The game is fun, but as with any game, there are cons. But in my opinion, they do not outweigh the pros.			"

												Wow... just... WOW!  I cannot remember the last time I was so violently enthralled with a game from the very get go.  I was not expecting this to fully capture the FEEL of the mad max movies as incredibly well as it has done!  Though I am not very far into it at this point, it has been pure pleasure since the very beginning!The visuals are absolutely amazing, and optimization... holy sh*t!  I don't think I have ever seen a game that looks so good and runs so flawlessly!  This is probably one of, if not THE best looking games in my library and it runs on my 3440x1440 ultrawide smooth as silk on ultra settings!They did an amazing job giving you a huge wasteland to roam and explore, yet while the area is so vast, so far it has definitely not suffered from the traditional ""open world sandbox travel through miles of nothing to get to the patches of content"" syndrome.  Or at least it hasn't felt like it.  Maybe that's because the gameplay itself is just so d*mn much fun!  (did I mention how well it captures the feel of the films? :D)The ""on foot"" combat is very very much, the tried and true assassins creed, batman, shadows of mordor formula as many have stated, with the very refreshing alteration of being more brute strength and rage based then graceful cat like ninja.  You're not leaping all over hell and back, doing fancy spin kicks and back flips, it's more the ""walk up to someone, grab em by the neck and smash their face into a table"" type.  Absolutely LOVE it!Vehicular combat... this is the crème de la crème feature of this game, the grand masterpiece!  OMFG it is so much fun!  It's... well... it's something you really just have to experience for yourself, but... ya... wow!  I have seen a few reviewers complaining about the driving controls, personally I don't see it.  To me the driving has been better than most I have played.  The car has been easier to handle and control for me than most other games of this type.  Granted, I do not play racing games, where the entire effort of the game has gone into the driving / vehicle handling, but I do play most all of the sandbox games that involve guns and cars, and imho this one is better than most as far as vehicle control and driving is concerned.  (or again, maybe it's just because driving in THIS game is so much more fun than the others... I mean... when was the last time you were racing through a debris filled desert mashing it up with other cars and shot the driver with a harpoon and yanked him out of the other vehicle through the window?  Come on... so brutal... I LOVE it!)There is so much to go on and on about with this title in the way of comparison with other open world sandbox rpgs, but really... at least for me... there's no need, while all of those things do mashup to equate to the overall completeness and  complexity of the game (and they do so very well so far, and I have not yet found anything lacking in the way of systems or things to do), what it really boils down to for me... is fun factor... this game is SO much fun to play!  Based on what I have seen so far, I could wander aimlessly through the desert for hours just engaging in random encounters and still feel like I was getting my moneys worth on this game.  All technical, feature, and systems talk aside, it is just plain and simple, good old fashion fun!Def recommend this title to anyone who even remotely likes the Mad Max movies!			"

												7/10I enjoyed this game!Pros+ Excellent vehicle based combat. Especially convoy missions where you have to chase down and destroy a vehicle that's protected by other vehicles.+ Well-optimized. I'm playing on a laptop (i7, GT750M, 8GB RAM) and FPS is 45-60.+ Arkham-style hand-to-hand combat. If you've played the Arkham Batman games, you'll feel right at home.+ Interesting locations in the big world.Cons- Average story, but the main story mission builds to an exciting ending.- No real stealth gameplay. You will take out most enemies using combat, or by sniping from far.- Almost all the bosses you encounter are reskinned versions of the same model, and use the same moves.P.S.I played this game during Patch 3/4 and encountered no bugs yet. Some people have mentioned their map disappears, but it should be fixed after Patch 4. Whatever you do, don't modify game0.tab to try to fix the missing map, because apparently it causes some camps in the game to reset and get into a corrupted state.			"

												This game is exactly what I always wanted from a Mad Max game. Granted, I bought a Steam key from a friend pretty cheap, so I am judging the game based on spending $25 for it, not $60.Pros:*Open world filled with things to do and some really cool locations to explore.*Cool storyline.*Awesome driving with upgrades that really change the feel of your cars.*Optimized for PC - my PC is decent but not great and it runs it perfectly on ultra-high settings.*Combat is very Batman: Arkham City, especially once you unlock the cool maneuvers.*Length: I have 40 hours in, and I am still only at 50% completion.*The world conversations react to things you have done, so you see your legend grow.*Never felt like it was a grind for scrap, unlike some negative reviews. Decent pace for upgrading both Max, the strongholds, and vehicles.*YOU GET TO BE SHINY AND CHROME! WITNESS ME!Cons:*Only being able to climb/jump in specific areas means that you will get stuck sometimes. Like, if you fall off a walkway, you may find yourself stuck and unable to climb the ONE FOOT rocks hemming you in.*Easy. Like, the game is rather  too easy, especially if you are  like me and ignore storyline to do all the side quests and scavenging. By the time you do the storyline, you're walking through boss fights. I usually only die from stupid mistakes, like falling off cliffs or blowing myself up. *The bosses that rule the strongholds are all the same, just with different amounts of health. I feel like this was a cop-out. ""AAAAAAAH.... MEDIOCRE!""All in all, I am having a BLAST playing this game and recommend it heartily. 9/10 at this price, 7/10 at full price. "

												I wouldn't go out my way for it if i was you, but it's not like it isn't enjoyable. Here is the major problem. The game is 90% padding. There is fun, even in the padding but the studio obviously designed it to increase the length. If you're a completionist... just ignore the game. There is too much fluff which should be ignored, but will likely annoy you if you don't complete/remove it from the map.The worst part, i can't tell if the studio added stupid little touches to pad the game out further, or if they added bits that unintentionally lowered my enjoyment and increases time taken(by a small bit). For example, in sub upgrade menus, it will kick you back to the main upgrade menu if you buy something. This is not a problem when changing upgrades already bought. Also a dialog box will appear, telling you, you bought the item you bought, but to make matters worse, it has a short 2 second time preventing you from clicking the close button. These don't sound like a big deal but i'm guessing there are over 100 upgrades, some being purely cosmetic and i doubt you'll be wanting to grabbing these 1 at a time for the most part. There is just stuff like this, which on it's own in another game, you wouldn't dare call padding, but given statements from developer in the past, and how this game plays, you could be that cynical and think you're justified.Game pauses when you alt-tab, even in loading screen (You might care). With a GTX 970, and I7 4700k i was playing on high preset with i believe bloom and motion blur turned off. I was getting at least 100 FPS most of the time, but there was one area which i saw a constant 50FPS. It wasn't a dip! this was the area itself or possibly some other bottle neck in the system. When you launch the game, When on linux OS, if you aren't using Ubunutu or SteamOS, it will give you a warning that the game isn't optimized for your system (Message can be disabled). I was getting this with latest version of mint, which is based on Ubunutu but as said i was getting 100FPS on high.Basically, i don't recommend it, but if you've had your eye on it, maybe pick it up as one of your semi-risky but cheep buys. In terms of DLC, they didn't nickle and dime like shadow of mordor which has near universal bad rating for DLC (I hear the expansion DLC is good). It's a solid game, but it's covered in padding, that the developer thinks gamers want.			"

												I think this most appeals to true mad max fans, so if you aren't that into mad max, or only saw the most recent film and thought it was 'pretty cool', but haven't seen any of the others, or don't care about the mad max lore/setting, then you might not like it.. Although it has 96% on steam so you probably will anyway...Looks great, and runs amazingly well, I usually stay above 70fps on my laptop with ultra settingsI feel inclined to leave this review 'cause I've seen a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reviews from 'game critics' on those sites giving it a 6/10 and whatnot, which is a load of rubbish, I feel like they either don't 'get' mad max, or have been payed by Konami to give mediocre reviews to try and get people to buy MGS5 instead... I would not be surprisedI wouldn't call it a perfect 10, there a bunch of things that could be better, for instance pretty much the only few things you can loot is scrap metal and ammo (so far). You'd think in a wasteland survival game, finding new items/weapons/clothing would be a pretty big deal, but not in this game (so far anyway, I have only played a few hours and I could be totally wrong..). Which is a shame.Everything else is pretty good in my opinion, nice combat system, driving mechanics are alright, and the setting is amazing, they captured the mad max environment perfectly. Plus the story has been good so far.All I want you to take from this review is not to trust 'professional' game critics, 'cause they're usually full of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Here's my short form for a Steam product review:Bought the game when it was brand new for way more than the sale price now. I truly believe that this game is one of the greatest games to ever come based off of a movie, it comes really close to Batman but I feel this takes the prize. What I really love is that the game runs so smooth and the controls are near perfect for me, I had a blast playing through all the missions and I still go back on occasion to take the Magnum Opus out for a ride. Sales for this game have been amazing, the port runs really well with no issues at all, occasional glitches here and there. Other than that, great story, A LOT of replay value, and the movie was damn good too! Pick this game up for a low price and you will not be disappointed.			"

												If you enjoyed the burnout series, Need for speed hot persuit, GTA V NSPD mod, Just Cause series, and/or including any of the above, then this is for you. Batman WB fist-fight mechanics, just cause enhanced car gameplay (more boosts, side ramming/grinding, other upgrades which I cant mention without spoilage)All in all if you like the forementioned games, you'll love this. I especially appreciate where they didnt riddle this title with DLC or latch on Game for Windows Live (GFWL is a nightmare drm for those unfamiliar.)I must note also that you do not need to be at all familiar with the ""Mad Max"" movie series. While it helps, its not required; the game does a great job on that. Being said, if you're an entusiast you should check out Mad Max movies (the old ones with mel gibson) before playing.Highly recommended			"

												I looked at the min specs last night and was pretty sad, I have a 660ti and thought ""well I guess my card is officially opsolete"". BUT I was really looking forward to this game and didn't really want to buy it on a console so I figured ""if it looks like garbage I'll just return it."" So I installed it and ran it for the first time, saw the opening cinimatic and it looked amazing. I figured ""must just be the cinimatics being prerendered or something."" So it ended and the game started and it looked amazing, I checked my settings and everything was preset at Ultra!!! I am blown away with the optimization of this port. I am consistantly at 60FPS and running at 1440P with Ultra settings on a card this old is just awesome!I only have a little bit of time in the game so I don't want to say much else about it yet other than so far the game is very fun and that the hand to hand sounds absolutely brutal (as it should). In fact, the sound in general is very nice so far.I will update this review after I am further along and can speak more on the gameplay aspects.			"

												I expected explosions, I expected epic car combat, I expected brutal combat and a harsh world, I got it all. Gameplay feels very solid, performance is GREAT, you can litterally run this on max with a potato, graphics fits very well with the wasteland feel. I had tons of fun with this game with a few nitpicks which I will write below.You start out with nothing, your legendary v8 Interceptor is stolen from you and you want it back! You drive around the wasteland scouring for scraps and blueprints to upgrade your new car, the Magnus Opus. To get car upgrades, rewards and good amounts of scraps, you will have to do certain things like destroying scarecrows or wiping out camps in the different areas. This can get a little repetive but the locations all have different designs, and by doing said things you get some badass upgrades for your Magnus Opus which makes it rewarding.Pros:+Excellent Performance.+Great graphics.+Great gameplay.+Sandstorms are epic.+Races with leaderboards and different modes+Convoys are great fun, feels very much like mad max.+The world has many interesting locations, specially in a certain sandy area.+History Relics are interesting and I really enjoyed the dialogue that max says when he looks at the photos.+Photo mode for screenshot enthusiasts ♥♥♥♥♥yeah).Mixed:-+The tasks in the zones feel a bit repetive, but they are all designed differently which makes most of them interesting.-+Story is a bit shallow early on but I got very engaged towards the end, nice buildup and imo a great conclusion.-+Thunderpoon makes the game feel super easy.-+If you have the friendly camps fully upgraded, you will refill all your ammo, fuel, health, water every time you fast travel or visit a friendly camp which removes a bit of the survival feel of saving your bullets and eating maggots to survive.Cons:-Minefields.-Random people you find in the world that you talk to, they feel shallow and when speaking to them you are frozen and can't move, so be prepared for yourself and the other person to get pancaked into the dust over and over again.-Scavenging locations, there are like 3-4 locations that I remember after finishing the game, (I did them all) they just feel like a grind.-Some areas can be a maze, mountain areas in particular, where you have locations that are hidden inside a mountain and you need to drive around 10 times to find the entrance.Is the game worth a buy? definitely, I've had tons of fun with this game and would recommend it to anyone who asks.

												Definitely one of those rare movie games, pulls off the fun of driving around and combat. Customization of the Magnum Opus is great, but in the end you seem to end with the same car as most other's, guess that's why they have the Archangels though. Myself being a scrublord only had some trouble with some races, but still was eventually able to get the Legendary times for them, and every once in awhile during combat pulling off a counter didn't seem to register(which could of just been on my end[too many things running]). Overall, it's just a fun game that you can sink some hours into. Definitely worth a purchase if you enjoy action games, and even on lower settings it's still a beautiful game(but of course higher setting does make is shine).			"

												Supports Vulkan API on Linux now. It's in beta but my framerate went from approx. 45 to 80 with nearly all graphic settings enabled. Regardless of what you think of this game go buy it and play it on Linux (I'm running the game in Fedora Workstation). See this post for instructions on how to get into the Vulkan beta: http://www.feralinteractive.com/en/news/753/I've only played one hour and I cannot tell much about the game itself. It's your regular open world game with a pretty solid car combat. The goal seems to be building your car and tuning it. The game has that Batman: Arkham Asylum combat when travelling on foot. It gets most Mad Max things right from the get go and it is a fun game to play if you get into it.Visually impressive landscapes. The game has decent soundscape but nothing special. Music is fine, I guess. The game controls are fine. It has proper mouse & keyboard support with proper key pop-ups for them on screen. Also supports controllers. Steam Controller works fine.

												The one things some players I seen on you tube is they go in thinking this is fury road, but what was done is basicly they took aspects of the movies and did a outstanding story line of there own version for the lone wolf Max. The location is the bottom of a dried up ocean, it wasn't so much the ships giving me the clue but the coral and dried up sea weed as well. You have your rivle bandit gangs. You have your mission story lines, one of the things I did was wounder off on my own in the game, And yes, you can do that.Being a Stalker in the Zone from the stalker series, I am use to exploring and looking for salvege anyway. So this game comes home to that for me. The most outstanding thing in the game is the ability to asign key bindings. I use a speacle combat key layout compatable for many of my games that work in STALKER series, COD series, Elder scroll series, and the fall out series. And it is so refreshing to see I can also use that here. And the binding are split between the car and ground(foot) controls which is a sweet deal to prevent control conflicts. Driving can be a bit tricky, but I have discovered you do not have to fly at high speed all the time, speed can work against you. For example one of the cars chasing me from the grave yard was on me, but I turn right and left and it cause him to shake loose giving me enough room to lock up the brakes, he passed me, and I blew up him up by shooting his tank. They realy put serious thought to actuly plauseability car control. The positive I have been coming across so far in this game, I have no choice but to recomend it!EDITED 4/18/2016I had finished the game, I didn't care much for the death races, they really were not my thing. So really the only way I will do it, I have to be forced into it. SO... I was. The Stank Gum race I hated the most. You really have to configure that car. All the speed is not that answare, nor is all the armor. I used the wild hunt through the whole game, and I had it almost stripped down to a compleat stock car. You may get a bif time gap before boom, but that was all redundant. The key was how fast you can take out stank gum in the race. I had to finsh him off inside of a lap. So going into the second lap after passing the start line I defeated him. Then its like the game gets crazy.In the end the game is open for free roaming.

Product received for free
												A mix between Batman and budget Twisted Metal. Driving feels nice and the sound design is top notch, but that's about all I could take away as positive from it.-Vehicular combat feels incredibly awkward throughout, especially early on where you lack varied means to take other cars on. -Liberating outposts gets old very quickly and there's little enemy variety to back it up.-hundo'ing strongholds/reducing region threat seemingly holds no final reward, not even a pat on the back, besides apparently eliminating all enemy patrols from that region, removing one of the reasons to drive around in the first place.-Once you take down your tenth scarecrow, and disarm your twentieth mine, you'll realize how shallow side activities can be in a giant desert sandbox.-The wasteland seemingly has no likeable characters, only ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Even Max is thoroughly unrelatable, a stoic one-faced man in his pointless quest to build a V8 machine for seemingly no reason other than to go fast until he goes catatonic or dies. The game is pretty and stable, but so is a movie, and that one won't waste your time as much as this game will. Maybe watch that instead of playing this.			"

												When I beat the game and took a break I went back to it and realized how good it really is.  Ignore the story, we all know what it's about. The visuals and the gameplay are what make this stand out. I wanted an open world driving game for a while, and this hits the spot. And spekaing of visuals, the exhaust smoke in this game changes depending on the type of exhaust you have on. I almost wanted to put on a lower ranking exhaust because the smoke looked better.After beating the game and then seeing the movie I can honestly say I enjoyed the game much more. This truly is an underrated gem.			"

												I seriously have been waiting my whole life for this game. Outlander for the SNES came close and Rage tried it's best, but this was the Mad Max game that I had dreamed about since I was a little kid. Massive and gorgeous open world wasteland that's fun just to drive around all day. The side quests and collectibles are great and the story is not tied to the movie in any meaningful way and stands on its own really well. The combat feels very much like Batman's Arkham series and I'm more than ok with that. The way you level up both Max , his abilities and build up the car using separate upgrade systems for all three works really well.The artstyle and graphics are gorgeous and it seems to run buttery smooth on almost every system I've come acrosss.  It's too bad that The Phantom Pain seems to be overshadowing this game because I think this is seriously the best game out this year (better than GTAV for fanboy reasons of my own) and I hope it gets it's due because Avalanche have created a masterpiece here and any fan of the movies MUST own this game. My fifteen year old self will never stop playing this game.			"

												Well where to start. There are a lot of really great things about Mad Max and thing's that reveal themselves over time to the displeasure of the gamer. I'll detail some pro's and con's seeing that there isnt alot of usefull information out there about this game and a lack of any official forum that ive seen. *I've looked, nothing but links to twitter and facebook on the main site*Con's1. Complete lack of any moral decision making outside of killing random wastelanders that want water or are trying to share scrap with you and no effect on the overall story whatsoever, there arent any repercussions to killing the random wasteland either. This means you wont have the choice to do the right thing or the wrong thing, just whatever the designers wanted you to do for the story they wrote. 2. Lack of multiplayer in a game that would have benefitted it greatly.3. Minimal HUD options can take you out of the world fairly easily.4. Wonky camera control while first person driving, its especially irritating in combat.5. Nothing to do after completion of game besides minor random car battles that are overly easy, I never felt like I was fighting for my life and they tend to run away most of the time near the end of the game.6. Every ""Top Dog"" boss is essentially the same boss battle over and over and most of the times with a palette swap, very lazy considering the universe mad max is set in is very diverse with their wastelanders generally.7. Car customization isnt so much car customization as it is just upgrading stuff, your stuck with the same batch of weapons even though you see other cars with neat stuff and can use them allthough they are never as effective as the magnum opus since you can only use your shotgun do to the lack of Chum not being available on any ride except for the opus. There's no way for you to truly make the car your own either, your limited to about 6 paint jobs that are used on all the cars in game pretty much, no personal decal deisnger so your stuck with the base in game decals which are passable if you find one you like and about 6 or so car bodies most of which look like crappy sports cars with the exception of the death rattle which resemble's nux's car from Fury Road.8.Wasteland base upgrades are a neat concept but ultimately outside of refilling your ammo ,gas,health, and water *making the survival aspect of the game nil and void* they don't do anything aside from maybe open a back area where you can't do anything or perhaps add some cloth drapes to an overhang. That and I dont see myself co-operating with people that willing participate in a slave trade.9. Max's movement at times since clunky and underdeveloped especially when you realize there is a jump button and its♥♥♥♥♥♥poor and is mostly there so you can hopefully hop out of whatever broken mess of♥♥♥♥♥♥you landed in. I've had to restart the game due to being stuck at least 10 times.10. No contextual cover and movement meaning that there is no cover button in a world filled with cover. No ducking behind your car or crocuhing or sneaking. Max is more or less a wrecking ball, The opus can handle almost entire camps without having to actually do much other than torch people as you lead them to your car.11. Severe lack of character development and meaningfull interaction. In a game where the main character is known for being a man of few words you'd think the extraneous characters would recieve mass amounts of attention but after realizing the game was being made with an american voice actor before fans flipped out and they did the right thing hiring an australian I realized they didnt have a good grasp of the source material and what drives these characters.12. Lack of ranged weapon's, Okay this is something I kind of understand, in an apocalypse theres not going to be a ton of weapons floating around with normal people being ditched due to the lack of ammo. Well in the setting they used the bullet farm exists and not only that but you help a guy find sulfur and saltpeter to make black powder. So why is there a complete lack of any actual firearm outside of max's shotgun and car usuable only sniper rifle, not even a pistol is to be seen anywhere. 13. The Max menu for character customization is also just an upgrade menu with minimal choices for max's look and gear. The facial options you can take for max are things like max with beard, max with beard and bandanna, No clean shaven max's of yesteryear for the fans.  Your relegated to ending up looking lika a commando if you want to use the better gear. The knuckle dusters you make and the armor doesnt feel like anything max would have ever used. your shotgun upgrades read as such * max add's a barrel to the shotgun* add's a barrel? how? with what? where? just scrap metal? This game would have benefitted from an actual equipment system instead of just assuming you have these things like plyers and for some mystery reason the only thing you ever have to buy is a crowbar which is a completely pointless mechanic to open some doors and box's considering how cheap it is it can be bought at the beginning of the game making the doors and chests just irritating.14. Car combat is ultra repetitive and barely entertaining after awhile, using the harpoon gun to destroy pretty much everything gets boring.Pros.1. The game is beatiful if you have the power to run it maxed 2. Hand to hand combat feels brutal.3. Fun till completion of the main storyline.4. A good first try at a Mad Max game in over 20 years. Hopefully one they expand on and get right next time.5. Cruising around in crazy storms is fun but ultimately you end up sitting in the same spot for 5 mins if your on a mission or doing something where you cant be destroyed.			"

												Hold A to Do Things: The Game.Alright, Jesus f*ck, I'll do an actual review. *clears throat* Mad Max is a game that has a lot of great qualities, but those great qualities get buried under a crushing weight of collectible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and dickish game design, which is apparently common for sandbox games nowadays. Below are my thoughts:First, the good. The car combat is pretty damn good, with ramming grills, tire grinders, rocket launchers, harpoons, flamethrowers, a shotgun, and more. It's fun to occasionally just buzz around, destroying enemy cars in various ways and trying to avoid getting destroyed yourself. It's let down, however, by the terrain. You'll notice that in the films, most car battles take place in flat, featureless desert. Because of this, the focus is on the cars' interactions, not their trying to stay on the same path. The game's world, on the other hand, is filled with hills, cliffs, ditches, and bumpy patches, so you can't trust that you won't crash horribly or go completely off course while taking your eyes off of the road to shoot at an enemy. This makes the car combat significantly less fun, which is a shame.The melee combat is basically the same as that of the Arkham games, but with a few key differences. First of all, the animations for everything, especially the finishers, are hilariously over the top. It's like Max learned everything he knows about fighting from watching Arnold Schwarzenegger films and professional wrestling. If nothing else, you can get in brawls just to have a dumb chuckle at how Max decides to dispatch someone IN THE MIDDLE OF A REAL FIGHT with a SUPLEX, of all things, and then go after his friend with a headbutt and a leg-lock (although enemies not dead after one one finisher will be perfectly happy to stand on their broken legs and punch you with their shattered arms). Second, it's generally easier overall, which there's nothing wrong with if you want to make an easier game. Third, you have the option to dispatch any enemy bothering you at any time with a shotgun blast at the cost of one shell, which is hilariously abrupt. Fourth, you can use melee weapons and single-use knives, which adds a nice bit of variety. Fifth, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥ily programmed. Especially near the end of the game where the enemies start piling up, you can occasionally press a button and have Max not do the thing you just ordered him to do, which is ridiculous and frustrating. Finally, you can get attacked in the middle of finisher animations, which is just stupid. It's perfectly realistic to have someone hit you in the back while you're piledriving his friend, but in a game where you can't do anything about it it's the very epitome of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty game design.There are bases scattered around to liberate that are really interestingly designed, with catwalks, teetering structures, towers, ziplines, and lots of nooks and crannies that are fun to explore and seem like interesting places to live. At times, though, the various collectibles scattered throughout are so well-hidden that I had to consult walkthoughs to find all of them.The car upgrades overall are really neat and varied, but they can be applied everywhere, instead of just the garage. Normally I wouldn't mind such convenience, but it wouldn't make that much of a difference in this case and it doesn't make sense if you can completely overhaul your car anywhere.The game looks very good, especially the wasteland and the fire effects, but not as good as Just Cause 3. (But then, what does?)You're allowed to run over random neutral NPCs, even questgivers, which is always fun.The sound design's good. The mocap's also good. There's a nice limping animation for when you take fall damage, and there's a dog in particular who looks and acts exactly like how you'd expect a dog to act, except for the fact that he seems perfectly content to sit in a confined box for the entire game.There's judicious use of slo-mo throughout the game that adds a lot to car crashes and fight scenes.The Cleanup Crew upgrade is really convenient, as it automatically collects Scrap (the game's currency) from car wrecks you just created, but I feel like it should also apply to Scrap drops from fallen Scarecrows and enemy troops.Alright, that was all the good (although looking back, a lot of those were backhanded compliments and damning with fine praise), so here's the bad. Prepare for a lot of petty complaints.The world is outwardly the same world as the Mad Max films, specifically the same general area as Fury Road. There are a few problems with this, though. First of all, the plot has some ties to Fury Road, but none of Fury Road's characters show up and that's not Tom Hardy we're playing as, so I'm not sure what the point is. Also, the main villain is Immortan Joe's (until now unmentioned) son, Scarabus Scrotus. He's another 7-foot-tall goliath, but he doesn't have any severe physical defects (at least at first) like Joe's other two sons, which completely undermines Joe's emotional conflict in Fury Road. More generally, the world is outwardly the same Mad Max world as ever, but it's lacking George Miller's deft touch and artistry. The cars are either basic hot rods or lumps of incoherent vehicle instead of machines with personality and theme, and the insane people just speak random pidgin English instead of the natural-seeming dialect of the films. Giant lumps of muscle like Humungus and Rictus Erectus were anomalies in the films, but they're just all over the place here. It's clearly someone trying very hard to be George Miller, and while I don't blame them for not having the guy on hand at all times and having to make do without him, it's still very noticeable in-game.The story and characters are just kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Max has a couple of nice moments (laughing at a guy who thinks a fiberglass helmet will protect him from headshots springs to mind), but most of the time he and everyone else are annoying, entitled, and stupid.Fury Road's toxic masculinity overtones become just toxic masculinity...tones here. Scarabus Scrotus wears a spiny♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on a codpiece for some baffling reason, and lots of other minor villains have weird sexual backstories and fetishes that the game brings up constantly. This driving game doesn't have handbrake turns for some baffling reason. They could even bind it to RB! Why isn't it there?There's supposed to be some sort of survival element, with constant shortages of scrap, gasoline, water, and shelter, but resources are f*cking everywhere and you can quickly unlock the ability to get infinite ones every time you return to a garage, so I'm not sure what the point is. Scrap in particular is ridiculously abundant; by the end of the game I had about 15000 in reserve with nothing to spend it on.There's two different upgrade systems for Max, but both are easy to fill out fairly early in the game (making you overleveled and overpowered for most of the rest of the time) and neither make sense, as this is another game with a protagonist already fully formed at the beginning with no real room for improvement.The population density is absurdy high for the apocalypse.This game has the worst jump button I have ever seen. It's unreliable, clunky, and only necessary for a handful of optional Scrap locations. If you don't need one, don't have one.There are lots of other small problems, but overall, the game's main issue is that there's a ridiculous ♥♥♥♥ton of content for content's sake. Scrap, Scarecrows, Snipers, relics, bases, minefields (those are a chore), side missions; I felt compelled to do all of it, and got drawn into an endless pit of boring, repetitive collection. I started out thinking this game was OK, but over time those feelings dissolved into hatred of the endless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Any joys the game has are eventually consumed by the endless, meaningless  stuff . Ugh.Get Just Cause 3, not this.			"

Could be an incredible game if it had more focus.Can't imagine how so much got past testing, did nobody mention how painfully boring 75% of this game is?Attacking convoys almost makes up for all of it to be honest, it's an absolute thrill. And the world is beautiful, and truly captures Mad Max.			"

												The Best Worst Game it was a nice try but the game turned out to be boring and repetitive`before you start this mission we need to upgrade the car`to upgrade car you need to lower the threat lower which is time-consuming.			"

												After fully completeing this game i can now say that I would not recommend it based solely on how un challenging and repetitive the gameplay is, you get spoon fed all the hidden objects, loot etc you just have to drive near it and it will be permenently marked on your map. The enemies dont increase in difficulty at all while max just becomes unstoppable within the first few hours, you can max out all maxs skills before even completing 30% of the game making the griffa tokens a pointless edition espically when they just hand them out for no reason half the time. The storyline is weak but still followable. The side quests and loot locations are repetitive and become boring after the first large territorial state is cleared fully. Minefields are just a waste of time offering no real loot value while taking the longest time to get to since you cant quick travel with the dog. Cars are quite cool as is the combat with the vehicles while the ""Races"" are more just you trying to reach a certain location while a bunch of slow weak cars try to ram you off the road to stop you reaching your destination, all you need to do is use one nitrus boost and you can outrun them for the entire race. Combat is basically just punching someone and pressing block button when it notifys you someone is about to hit you, you also have a shot gun with limited ammo. The fighting is redicoulously easy and i would be suprised if you ever die in combat during the entire game. Pros:Good graphicsFun cars/ car combat40+ hours gameplay with all content included in one priceCons:RepetitveNo ChallengeNo skill or tatic requiredWeak StorylineLots of cutscenesLots of pressing activation buttons during battlesLots of waiting and holding E to open things and interact with objectsBoring race tracksBoring Bland MapRepetive LocationsUniteresting Spoon Fed CollectiblesRepetitiveRepetitiveRepetitiveRepetitiveRepetitivebut i did spend over 40 hours playing it so it wasnt the worst game just not as good as other games avaiable at the moment for cheaper.

												I liked this game to begin with, unique idea, highly customisable vehicles etc. I did love it, and i wish i still do. However theres a few things that reallly dissapoint this game-Its a generic grinder game to get the best gear-repetitive missions-NO CHALLENGE ONCE YOU HAVE THE BEST GEARThe last point is the main one. With no difficulty adjuster id seriously have no joy playing this game againLuckily i only picked it up for less than £5. NOT WORTH £25!!!			"

												Well - the game is fun to a certain point. Crusing through the area, beat the sh*t out of enemies, advance your character and build a car which reflects your style of driving.But at the near end end of the story, all of your hours of collecting and building and experience were wasted time: you have to drive the ""race of the race"" with a crippled down version of your favourite car.Gave up after the 30thsomething retry (tried keyboard and controller), next game please!

												Very underrated game. No idea why gamespot gave it 6/10 and polygon gave it 5.5 . The only site ive seen to do justice to this game is IGN with a solid 8.4 rating which i totally agree with. TOTALLY BUY THIS GAME!!!pros- runs great without errors or lags-hooking story (though short)-insanely fun with respect to racing, and upgrading the magnum opus(your car) as well as battles on foot.-beautiful visuals, ( though its mainly a wasteland,it does good to give that 'post apocalyptic feel' ..like RAGE)-very satisfying collecting scrap to upgrade max-excellent weapons(on car and on max), excellent vehicle controlling.-very wide variety of characters and enemies,excellent voice acting.-overall just insanely funWhether it be crashing into cars, blowing up enemies,fighting,upgrading max, there is a wide variety to do, and this game will have you hooked on it. Even though, you may sometimes get bord of collecting scrap at various scavanging locations,if you stop for 10 minutes, you will definately feel the need to start back playing this game. Its addicting!Cons:- it just glitched on me twice and i ending up spawning somewhere else when i died, it fixed itself after i completed the mission and probably will be updated very soon.-nothing elseTLDR: BUY IT, you wont be dissapointed "

												Very under rated game.Most open world games lose my interest fast as they involve a lot of repeat content. All those side activities and missions end up feeling indentical after you have done a few.  I figured madmax would be the same. I was pleasantly surprised when I started noticing how each little side area and objective were not only hand crafted/designed to be different, but many had different mechanics from each other. No two warcamps are the same. Hell, even the balloon quick travel points are different and require a unique mechanic to complete (ie: one might require you to refuel the balloon, another has you driving your car around to remove the cables that are tieing it down).The game feels very mad max. The world is closer to feeling like the newer film than the older (which is fine, I love all of them). Driving is a lot of fun, and the batman like combat is also fun. I enjoy the combat in this better than in batman for a few reasons. 1. The rage system - It makes combat that much more interesting than in batman. 2. Unlike batman, there are times when you realistically just cant counter an attack, even if you see it coming. If you are in the middle of grabbing some guy and breaking his neck, its just not realistic to think that you can suddenly counter another attack. Dont worry though, you can still counter 9 out of 10 attacks if your timing is good, but there is a bit more realism with the system than there is in Batman (where you will go flying accorss the screen no matter what you were doing, to counter an attack).The amount of customization and upgrades in the game is pretty insane too. You have TONS of car options and upgrades, character upgrades, a skill/train system with upgrades, and a ""hideout"" upgrade system that lets you build things in your base of operations. The car upgrades are by far the most impressive. The sheer number of things you can add and customize is great.The voice acting is also top notch and very accurate with a Max film. The characters all have that no longer part of the reality we know behavior, much like the films. The visuals in the game look very appealing too. Sure, its not super 4k ultra mega Alpha X resolution textures and special FX, but it still looks darn good. Not only that, it runs VERY well. Smooth framerates 99.9% of the time, plenty of video options to adjust. No complaints here, and im VERY picky about graphics and graphical options.My ONLY 2 gripes about the game:1. Getting enemies OFF your car is just a pain. Even after you put spikes all over your car, people will still jump on it. If you are low on shotgun ammo (which you are most of the game), you dont have an easy way to remove them. Smashing into another car sometimes does the trick, but if you dont have another car to smash into, then the best option, believe it or not... is to stop your car... AND GET OUT. WTF?? Really? It really breaks the whole ""high speed action car chase"" if the best option is to stop and get out. Id like them to add some more ways to remove enemies. Especially if they are on the driver side. Let Max reach out and punch or pull them off the car. Maybe your hunchback can push them off? Maybe once you have spikes, it drains their life the longer they are on the car, until they die and fall off? Something more needs to be added. Its a minor gripe, but one that pops up every so often during car combat.2. Climbing up on things. Imagine this situation. 2 cargo storage containers. Both the same size. One has a yellow marked metal bar on top, signifying that you can jump up, grab it, and pull yourself up. The other doesnt. Er... why cant I climb the other one? Worse yet, there are things that are only 3-4 feet high that you cant grab and pull yourself up to. Thankfully, most of the game doesnt revovle around needing to get up on these things, but from an open world exploration, or even ""which path should i take"" aspect, it can be kinda annoying.Both of these things however dont take away from the games fun, or keep me from recommending it. The game is a blast to play and a visual feast for mad max fans. The one thing id like to see from a DLC, would be a co-op play via the net. Would be super fun to do all the racing and car combat with another person by your side. (doubt that will happen though)			"

												An accurate simulation of life in Australia, Mad Max has great driving physics, and beautiful graphics and sound design. Just listen to how the engine note of the Magnum Opus changes slightly with every upgrade or take Chumbucket's buggy rockclimbing and note the detailed suspension movement. This is a solid game.This game plays great with a keyboard, but doesn't support controllers other than a 360 pad. Steering wheel support should have been a consideration with a game so heavily focused on driving.Occasional UI glitches appear; Most of the time your mouse cursor will appear over gameplay, which can be solved by pausing and unpausing. Other times, the pause menu's back button will continue to be drawn over gameplay, which can be fixed by clicking it. Other than that, the game runs flawlessly.The game looks somewhat difficult to mod, with all data files being stored in proprietary archives. As a singleplayer-only game, mods and user-generated content are key to its survival.			"

												Made by the same studio that made the legendary Just Cause 2 (best $5 you can spend on Steam, by the way - nab it in the next sale!), Mad Max is an open-world game in the Just Cause vein, but set (as you can guess) in the world of the Mad Max films. Coming from a studio that have proven themselves so capable of open-world games before, it's no surprise that the game does a great job of turning Max's world into a massive vehicular playground.The game does an amazing job of bringing the Mad Max world to life, right down to details you don't think about in the films, such as the sheer scarcity of resources. Unfortunately that attention to detail is also the game's biggest flaw: once you've spent upwards of ten minutes just scrounging for something to restore your HP and only find enough medical supplies to heal yourself by half, you begin to realize that outside of the car chases, the Mad Max world ... really isn't all that interesting. It's just a flat desert with few settlements, all of which are cobbled together from ugly junk, and populated by scattered bands of savages whose most intelligent battle strategies are to ram you with their car or punch you in the head. The movies cut the experience down to just the cool parts - in a video game, you also have all the dull stuff in between.That's not to say this game isn't fun - because it is, especially if you love the movies - but if you're looking for the next awesome open-world game to top Just Cause 2 or GTA V, this probably isn't it.THE GOOD:- Even for a game in which 90% of the world is brown sand, this game looks BEAUTIFUL. There is so much fine detail, right down to Max's tracks in the sand. If Just Cause 3 looks half this good, we have a lot to look forward to.- Even though the world is very empty, it makes up for this by making most objects smaller than a building destructible or otherwise interactive. Run over a rocky hillside and knock the rocks down. Ram a rusted-out car body and watch it shatter. Blow stuff up with gas cans, because nobody in Mad Max Land has ever heard of conserving fuel. It's fun just to see which environmental objects will react when you mess with them.- Your car, the Magnum Opus, is (somewhat) customizable, and it comes with a Jockey from Left 4 Dead 2 who performs repairs for free any time you hop out. Minor spoilers: the iconic Interceptor is stolen in the opening cutscene, but one of the Magnum Opus' body styles is nearly identical, so it's almost like you still have it. I'm 100% sure they added that just to make fans of the main car happy (like me!).- Lots of NPC vehicles, which are a collect-a-thon in and of themselves (can you steal them all and gather them at your strongholds?). They all look like the kind of crazy machines you'd expect to see in the movies.- The game and its world feel very authentically Mad-Max-esque. It feels more like Road Warrior than Fury Road, perhaps just because the action tends to be less in-your-face. The story has loads of references to Fury Road though, and the main plotline has you trying to reach Gas Town from the movie.- Some people hate the weird quantities in which you find Scrap (the game's currency), but I like it because it provides a touch of realism. You wouldn't find stacks of neatly-sorted and counted-out metal in a real wasteland, would you?- The explosions are awesome and sometimes in slow-mo!- The villain in the intro movie rides a ridiculous motorized throne in true Mad Max villain fashion.- There's a dog!THE BAD:- This game reveals the disappointing truth that life in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland isn't all high-adrenaline pedal-to-the-metal car chases. Sometimes you have to search for food. Sometimes you have to scour an abandoned camp for car parts. Sometimes you have to kill a dozen guys with your bare hands just for a sip of water. Most of the time you just have to drive in a straight line through the blank desert, hoping to stumble across something worthwhile.- With Chumbucket the seemingly-invincible mechanic riding the storyline's Magnum Opus vehicle and providing free repairs, there's no real reason to use any other car in the game. The MO is basically indestructible (if it gets to low HP, you just have to get out and let Chum repair it), and oftentimes you'll need Chumbucket's advice in order to complete a mission, which you won't have if you take another vehicle.- The Magnum Opus' customizability is fairly limited, and chances are you'll end up with all the parts by the end anyway. None of the ones I've gotten yet required me to swap out anything except the body shell, so I don't know if I'll have to choose mutually-exclusive parts down the line or not.- Goals aren't always clear - I have to keep talking to the same NPCs to remember what I'm supposed to do. One guy keeps telling me he's getting impatient, but I forgot what his mission actually is.- Combat is awkward at best and wonky at worst. Basically all you do in melee combat is spam M1 except when an enemy is about to knock you down, in which case you press M2. Car combat is limited to ramming your opponent full-force (the quickest/best option), sideswiping them repeatedly (difficult and doesn't do much damage), or impaling the other driver with the Magnum Opus's harpoon gun (fun, but not that fulfilling).- The keyboard controls are a bit weird, requiring you to hold down keys to perform simple actions (e.g. hold E for ~1/2 second to pick something up) rather than just tapping the key like other games. Stranger still is that it isn't even done to make up for key-taps being bound to other actions - tapping E does nothing, for instance. I'm still scratching my head as to why this is done this way.Definitely recommended for fans of the Mad Max films. If you want an amazing action game and haven't played Just Cause 2 yet, go play that instead, then come back to this on a sale.			"

												I enjoyed this game, the combat felt alot like shadow of mordor.  I wouldn't pay full retail for it but if you can find it on sale somewhere like I did then it's worth picking up.  Overall it was a little repetitive, but you can always go through the story faster then doing all the side missions/ objectives like I did.  Customizing your car to suit how you like to play was cool as well.  Scrap is a little hard to find at times.  I just wish you could unlock somethings faster and the pre-order bonus of another car + engine didn't work for me even when it was showed installed but the core game was alright.			"

Tho the story is rather short,it still gives you a lot to work,all the side missions are more then enough to keep you busy. Worth the money,worth the hours played. 9/10			"

												Very underrated game. No idea why gamespot gave it 6/10 and polygon gave it 5.5 . The only site ive seen to do justice to this game is IGN with a solid 8.4 rating which i totally agree with. TOTALLY BUY THIS GAME!!!pros- runs great without errors or lags-hooking story (though short)-insanely fun with respect to racing, and upgrading the magnum opus(your car) as well as battles on foot.-beautiful visuals, ( though its mainly a wasteland,it does good to give that 'post apocalyptic feel' ..like RAGE)-very satisfying collecting scrap to upgrade max-excellent weapons(on car and on max), excellent vehicle controlling.-very wide variety of characters and enemies,excellent voice acting.-overall just insanely funWhether it be crashing into cars, blowing up enemies,fighting,upgrading max, there is a wide variety to do, and this game will have you hooked on it. Even though, you may sometimes get bord of collecting scrap at various scavanging locations,if you stop for 10 minutes, you will definately feel the need to start back playing this game. Its addicting!Cons:- it just glitched on me twice and i ending up spawning somewhere else when i died, it fixed itself after i completed the mission and probably will be updated very soon.-nothing elseTLDR: BUY IT, you wont be dissapointed "

												I've played tons of games based on Movies, not some but all of them were crappy, but now we've got Mad Max, This game is not only perfectly optimized, it's massive open-world game, lots of fun, tons of unlocks, there's purpose to do the side missions, not just small rewards, It's a very intresting game and I actually never thught I'd buy another Movie game, especially if it's only single player, but I saw lots of Reviews and whoa, It's amazing, I recommend this to everyone that loves games like GTA, Saints Row, Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs (It is similar to sleeping dogs with fight techniques and defense also), driving physics are really good, customizations are kind of limitless, it's alot! :D			"

MAD MAXReleased in 2015, Mad Max Takes place in the iconic 80's style Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland where everyone is insane, and Max is just trying to get to the plains of silence, a peaceful place, when his car gets wrecked and stolen.He now has to join forces with Chumbucket, a talented mechanic, to build the Perfect car for this mad world, and get his revenge.Pros:+ HUGE and Fantastically crafted open world, the best desert wasteland I've ever seen in a video game.+ BEAUTIFUL graphics, I stopped the game to take screenshots and admire the vistas countless times. + So many different and interesting places to explore.+ Great attention to detail, everything feels used and you can see the remains of the old world all around.+ The overall world and lore take heavy inspiration from the best movies in the series, Fury Road and The Road Warrior.+ Good Story, gives you reason to go on+ Chumbucket is a nice character, but can be a little annoying sometimes (Like saying ""A MIGHTY DUSTER!"" every 10 minutes)+ Combat is Great, both Car combat and Hand combat feel heavy and visceral (Hand combat is a lot like the Batman Arkham series)+ Good Physics+ Fun missions+ Great Car variety, every faction has their own cars+ Max's Car is VERY customizable and upgradable+ Max himself has a good amount of upgrades and customization+ Random Sandstorms are very cool and feel a lot like Fury Road.+ Races are cool.+ Great Photo-mode, I wish every game had one like this. + Good Collectables, Historic Relics shows the old world, the fall, and max's thoughts+ Great sounds+ Very well optimized game[b/Cons:[b/]- I would like to have the dog around as a companion. (and not stuck to a single buggy)- It becomes very repetitive after a while, since you have to do the same activities over and over again to progress.- You have to grind A LOT to get the best parts.- Too many collectibles.- Looking for every scrap becomes a chore very quickly. (and is needed for 100%)- It will take you VERY long If you want to get 100% completion (75+ hours), and after all that, there is a chance the game will bug and refuse to show you 100% stats or give you the last achievement.- More and harder survival elements would have been nice.Despite the negatives, This is a great Open world game, I completed it 100% and I plan on playing it through again in the future.I really recommend it if you like open world action games, and this is a MUST PLAY if you like the Mad Max series.""My name is MAX, my world is Fire and Blood...""

												The first thing you should know about Mad Max before you buy it, is that it borrows a lot from other games.There are camps that you can capture, that pay out resources occasionally. Before you take these camps, it is ideal to scout out their defensive features, such as snipers or flame thrower traps. You do this by standing nearby, somewhere out of sight, with your binoculars which will mark these defensive features for you (much like in far cry 3, except it does not mark individual enemies). Each of these camps also has a myriad of minor objectives to complete, such as finding all the scrap, historical relics, or whatever other random things are scattered around the camp, or destroying insignias. Once you do this, you get a nice shiny 100% on that camp.The melee combat is fairly fun, though a bit more weighty than some might like. However, it is the same system as assasins creed, or the batman games. You will spam (light attacks) or hold (heavy attacks) the x button, and press the y button to parry (ideally at the right time, so you have a better counter). Some attacks can't be parried, so you will have to roll out of the way.The driving itself (aside from boosts, weapons, and other such things, of course) is fairly similar to GTA V's as far as weight goes. The vehicle combat is also pretty fun, with a fairly large variety of enemies and tools at your disposal.There are also a few survival aspects, such as a canteen you want to keep filled with water so that you can heal (you don't regenerate health), or cars burning gasoline (which can be scavenged at many places on the map).Overall, I found it to be very fun for the first few hours. However, if you have played a lot of Assasin's Creed, or any of the Batman games, the melee system may be a bit more dull for you. If you have played either, I'd suggest picking it up on a sale, as the world of Mad Max is still very fun to drive around in and experience. If you like vehicle combat in games, or generally just driving around and exploring the map, this is definitely worth considering.			"

												I bought this game for 10 bucks in the steamshop. I have seen some twitch streams about the game, but I never paid too much attention to it. I expected the game to be very linear, storymode kinda game. It is not. It is an open word and it pretty much blew my mind by how much there's to do. You can follow the missions (and there are many) and do that linear straight-ahead mode, or you can just take a break from them and do things to please your allies (like clearing out minefields, the dog is an awesome addition), and also just build your car(s) and characters more. So far I have 26 hours in it and I am far from done. I still have to finish the main missions, still have some sidemissions to do and still have to clear out some bases and so on.Pro's: Open world Plethora of missions Awesome graphics DiversityCon's:  Some missions can be broken (had to google for a fix for 1)Overall its a great game, well made and brings a lot of variation.

They actually have the first listing on google when you look up information about the game. It's as if they are paying to put down this game because it is a little minimalistic with your character but I'm pretty sure most people will find that the game is based around leveling up your car not necesarily your character... I mean hell most of mad max's fighting is on and in vehicles. So everyone that likes this game be sure to attack the moron on that site ars technica on his review :D			"

												After watching some streams of the game and reading the reviews of the ""critics"", I was slightly skeptical of the game.I was wrong. Right from the start, the beautiful cinematics grab your attention and throw you straight into the story. There wasn't a whole lot of screwing around with the settings to be done, as it was already optimized for my PC. The controls are very easy to learn and use (as they are similar to most games). The combat so far has been fun and you feel so powerful when fighting. It's a whole lot of button mashing though and there isn't a whole ton of skill involved in the melee combat. The story line is quite linear, but I like it! It's easy to follow along with and stay on track- but at the same time you're in an open world. I don't like games where you get lost on what to do, or where to go, and this is definitely not one of those games.I feel like the post-apocalyptic look could use some more scenery rather than just boulders and desert (yes, I know this is how the movie is), because it feels bare and somewhat static at times. Although, this is the complete opposite at some points when it comes to the intense scenes with the storms and what not.My first two hours of the game have been pretty great. If it wasn't 4:30am already, I would play this game for hours.I would definitely recommend this game. It's a great way to pass the time in a single player environment.			"

												First impression:Really good actually. Didn't expect to enjoy the game as much as I do so far. The atmosphere is great. The visuals, audio/music and voice acting are great.  They've captured the world of Mad Max perfectly. Good driving mixed with Arkham Asylum combat and some survival game aspects. Fun. On a technical side, this game is the best PC port this year. A gazillion graphical settings and in has rock solid frame times no stuttering and great performance at 4k. It's a shame this game came out on the same day of MGS V. It deserves much more attention that it will get.Will update once I am several hours into the game.EDITED: After 30 h of gameplay I can safely say that I am still really enjoying the game. Upgrading the cars is fun. The gameplay mechanics, while simple, do their job. The atmosphere is pure Mad Max. I can see myself spending a lot of time with this game.			"

												Loved it, normally I hate racing games but this one didn’t force you to just race but do a few mad max style extra things. Many people have compared to the batman games and after playing them would agree the fist fights are very similar, however max has much more. So…Pros; Great cinematic graphics loved the lens flair and some of the scenery shots you can take. A bit of base building and stranger. Massive open world with plenty to do and enough diversity that you don’t feel like to you have to do a section of the game you hate. Nice story although very Mad Max with very little deep concept it had nice array of characters to meet.Cons; Game can be a grind at some points especially when trying to progress the story as not grinding can make some missions very hard (could be a pro if you like that kind of thing). Some of the experience elements I thought were wasted especially if you can bypass them in other ways (ammo, water, fuel).Overall though I would say a good game and was a bargain in the last winter sale.

												Great game. The gameplay is similar to Just Cause, because it's a huge open-world and lots of (VERY repetitive) stuff to do on the map.It reminds me of life in Poland. You get mugged. You drive a car made out of scrap. When it breaks down, a homeless guy repairs it for vodka. You scavenge for scrap, which is a very valuable currency. You have to fight with squatters defending scrap-rich locations. Roads are♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the traffic is crazy, so you need more scrap to reinforce your car. Just like in Poland.Pros:- Realism- Great optimization (runs 40-60 fps maxed out on my old core 2 quad)- Driving fights- Huge, beautiful, desert environment - Lots of locations- Constant action- Mad Max!Cons:- Soundtrack is♥♥♥♥♥♥ turn the music off and play something else in the background- Lots of grinding (not a problem for me, i like it)- Gets repetetive (destroy a base, go get scrap, upgrade car to reach some other place, where you do the same)- No quicksaves, only checkpoint autosave (not a good thing in an open-world game)8/10 - worth it's price.

Overall it was a little repetitive, but you can always go through the story faster then doing all the side missions/ objectives like I did.  Customizing your car to suit how you like to play was cool as well.  Scrap is a little hard to find at times.  I just wish you could unlock somethings faster and the pre-order bonus of another car + engine didn't work for me even when it was showed installed but the core game was alright.			"

Quest Gated Upgrades, Fast Travel and fits of crafting madness.If you are not too burned out on Open World Games then this one will appeal for a long while.

												Mad Max is a collection of great ideas poorly tied together and capably (but not perfectly) executed.  It's shallow gameplay is outstnding fun when taken in small doses.  Just don't plan on powering your way through this game in a few sittings; if you do, the lack of polish, disjointed story, and repetition (oh lord, the repetition!)  will kill your buzz all too soon.Mad Max has been compared and found wanting to Assassin's Creed and Batman: Arhkam games (and rightly so while on foot), but the best part of Mad Max takes place behind the wheel.  The car chases (enemies chasing you and vice versa) and convoy battles will stick with you and drive you to play even more  ...at least while they last.  Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of convoy missions (and no free-roam convoys), which is a shame since this seems to be every player's favorite activity.  There are still randomly spawning enemy vehicles roaming the wastes, but they seem fewer and fewer as the game progresses, and enemies flat out run away once your vehicle becomes moderately equipped.If you're looking for a good gap filler - a game to play when the latest MMO has become stale, but before another massive time-sync game - this is a great place to start.  Just don't be in a rush to finish.			"

												An accurate simulation of life in Australia, Mad Max has great driving physics, and beautiful graphics and sound design. Just listen to how the engine note of the Magnum Opus changes slightly with every upgrade or take Chumbucket's buggy rockclimbing and note the detailed suspension movement. This is a solid game.This game plays great with a keyboard, but doesn't support controllers other than a 360 pad. Steering wheel support should have been a consideration with a game so heavily focused on driving.Occasional UI glitches appear; Most of the time your mouse cursor will appear over gameplay, which can be solved by pausing and unpausing. Other times, the pause menu's back button will continue to be drawn over gameplay, which can be fixed by clicking it. Other than that, the game runs flawlessly.The game looks somewhat difficult to mod, with all data files being stored in proprietary archives. As a singleplayer-only game, mods and user-generated content are key to its survival.			"

												Mad Max is at its core, a movie tie-in game, while that isn't to say ""its a abomination"" it does mean it borrows heavily from other games, as is the standard for them.Pros:-Gorgeous Level design and variety (The amount of visually distinct areas when all they had to work with was ""australian outback"" is downright impressive!)-Very cinematic combat and gameplay.-Incredibly in-depth ""capture mode"" for taking screenshots with a free-camera. (Combined with the first two, I like to describe this game as ""screenshot pornography"")-Lots of nods to the Mad Max films.-Good writing.-Every upgrade confers a visual upgrade (♥♥♥♥ing love games where upgrades arent just invisible stats. More ammo? Bigger pouches on max. Better upgrade speed? More tools on Chumbucket.)Cons:-Can be repetetive as hell.-Avalanche wants completionists to suffer for their sins-Copy-paste boss models.-That one ♥♥♥♥ing mission with the ""Big Chief""I do not reccomend getting this game if you plan for it to be the only game you are playing, its best played with breaks in between bouts, it makes for a great time killer between other games. I also recommend you come in with having seen all four Mad Max films, as its just not a ""original"" enough game to stand on its own without that. (In stark contrast to the films, now that I think about it.)Overral its a good game, filled with plenty of fan-service, and is a movie tie-in that isnt a utter disaster.			"

												Mad Max has climbed up to my list of top favorite games. Considering that includes Super Metroid, Mass Effect 2 and Witcher 3, that has to mean something!I must preface this review: it's been years since I have personally had a game like Mad Max land on my doorstep. A game that is just pure fun, that is almost completely stress-free, yet at the same time is not stupid and mindless with mediocre gameplay. Oh no. This is a great game.So, let's begin (no spoilers).--Mad Max shares a lot of similarities to Far Cry 3 and 4. It's just a huge open world with a bunch of objectives to complete and places to explore. There's the story, but you kind of do it inbetween your open world rampage. That's definitely not the primary reason to get the game, but it's not a bad part of the package. You play this game to have a blast.Some of the objectives feel repetitive, a common point of recent critic reviews, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. There's nothing like ripping around a huge open world slaying man-scum. More on that later.Upgrading your vehicle feels good. The scrap system is simple, yet at the same time demands that you make choices about what equipment you really want to purchase. Speed? Buy that. Armor? Buy that! There's some complexity involved in some gear having weight, where you have to decide on whether a piece is worth its trade-off. It's a great upgrade mechanic that remains minimalistic without hurting the complexity involved.Related to upgrades: there is something called the ""Archangels"" system, which is somewhat like gear loadouts. Neutral towards it, as I didn't, personally, find it very useful after the first mission that required it. What you will find is that the game throws a lot of tools at you, and you are free to embrace or disregard a lot of them (such as the Archangel system). The game lets you play how you really want to play, without punishing you.Speaking of gameplay: it feels raw and powerful. In fact, stuff happens in this game - quite often - that makes you pause for a moment, regain footing in reality, and ask: did that just happen?For example, I engaged a convoy during a dust storm, and it was one of the most epic moments in recent memory for gaming. Cars got picked up and blown to pieces in a giant dust devil - while lighting was striking the ground rampantly all over the place - and, immediately after, the final cars were picked off by ramming them over a cliff, in which they exploded in a fiery blossom of pure carnage as I landed with a cool half-donut slide across the sand. This is something that occurs several times throughout your Mad Max experience.What further enhances the gameplay are the small details. The fact, for example, that you can pick up a gas can and place it in the back of your vehicle as a spare only enhances the immersive grip of the game. And there are small details like that everywhere. I'll hold back on spilling them here. They are much more enjoyable and respectable when witnessing them firsthand, for the first time.The graphics are superb. Some of the effects are jaw-dropping. There are some very neat smoke, particle and dust tricks that I just have to appreciate as a Unity hobbyist. The backdrops are some of the best I've ever seen. It can be very immersive if you let yourself get absorbed by the endlessness of the great sandy plains.The level design is out of this world. It was painstakingly handcrafted, and it's obvious that was the case. It's my personal favorite part of Mad Max, and I would argue it's some of the best level design for this generation of games (if not overall, at least in the category of open world). Dead ocean is the primary setting, and it's incredibly imaginative. The rolling dunes, cascading sheets of dead-ocean rock, mountainous crags and canyons, sulfur-spewing flats, rusty car graveyards and half-buried ruinous bandit strongholds--when you step back, pause a moment, and stare, you will find yourself silent. The world is amazing, engrossing; the world is truely barren and apocalyptic, yet beautiful in its own, twisted way.Just as the game world feels endless, the amount of stuff to do is also up there. Racing and collectibles are on that checklist of stuff to do once the main story and territory control begins to near completion. The collection system actually has gameplay-focused elements: you can drive captured bandit vehicles and the special, collectible hood ornaments actually have statistical value as car equipment. They are not big parts of the game, but it definitely beats the seemingly infinite amount of worthless collectible garbage that other companies forcefully shove into their products.The only negative tick on my list of Mad Max items is the repetitive missions. There are a few variants of outposts to capture, but the game would have been even better if there were more creative mechanics put into these, especially considering they take away from the (superior, I'd argue) car-based gameplay. That said, the level design is a spectacular solution on this front. The objectives feel the same, but the outposts definitely do not, and they boast some of the coolest realizations of beat-down apocalyptic shanty-fortresses that I've had the pleasure of visiting. A bandit fortress propped atop a decaying oil rig platform in the middle of a salt-covered, dune-laden, dead ocean floor? Count me in.Last but not least: the game runs AWESOME on PC! I'll refrain from any Batman references, heh. Look at the top reviews for those, they are pretty funny. I'm getting a solid 120 FPS at basically ""Max"" (hah!) everything on a GTX980/FX8350. Honestly, I don't think it's an overstatement: it's one of the best PC ports I've ever had the pleasure of playing.If you experience any FPS drops, my personal setup improved by reducing debris render distance and shadow quality just a tad.What are you waiting for? There's a lovely day of gaming waiting for you.			"

												Very under rated game.Most open world games lose my interest fast as they involve a lot of repeat content. All those side activities and missions end up feeling indentical after you have done a few.  I figured madmax would be the same. I was pleasantly surprised when I started noticing how each little side area and objective were not only hand crafted/designed to be different, but many had different mechanics from each other. No two warcamps are the same. Hell, even the balloon quick travel points are different and require a unique mechanic to complete (ie: one might require you to refuel the balloon, another has you driving your car around to remove the cables that are tieing it down).The game feels very mad max. The world is closer to feeling like the newer film than the older (which is fine, I love all of them). Driving is a lot of fun, and the batman like combat is also fun. I enjoy the combat in this better than in batman for a few reasons. 1. The rage system - It makes combat that much more interesting than in batman. 2. Unlike batman, there are times when you realistically just cant counter an attack, even if you see it coming. If you are in the middle of grabbing some guy and breaking his neck, its just not realistic to think that you can suddenly counter another attack. Dont worry though, you can still counter 9 out of 10 attacks if your timing is good, but there is a bit more realism with the system than there is in Batman (where you will go flying accorss the screen no matter what you were doing, to counter an attack).The amount of customization and upgrades in the game is pretty insane too. You have TONS of car options and upgrades, character upgrades, a skill/train system with upgrades, and a ""hideout"" upgrade system that lets you build things in your base of operations. The car upgrades are by far the most impressive. The sheer number of things you can add and customize is great.The voice acting is also top notch and very accurate with a Max film. The characters all have that no longer part of the reality we know behavior, much like the films. The visuals in the game look very appealing too. Sure, its not super 4k ultra mega Alpha X resolution textures and special FX, but it still looks darn good. Not only that, it runs VERY well. Smooth framerates 99.9% of the time, plenty of video options to adjust. No complaints here, and im VERY picky about graphics and graphical options.My ONLY 2 gripes about the game:1. Getting enemies OFF your car is just a pain. Even after you put spikes all over your car, people will still jump on it. If you are low on shotgun ammo (which you are most of the game), you dont have an easy way to remove them. Smashing into another car sometimes does the trick, but if you dont have another car to smash into, then the best option, believe it or not... is to stop your car... AND GET OUT. WTF?? Really? It really breaks the whole ""high speed action car chase"" if the best option is to stop and get out. Id like them to add some more ways to remove enemies. Especially if they are on the driver side. Let Max reach out and punch or pull them off the car. Maybe your hunchback can push them off? Maybe once you have spikes, it drains their life the longer they are on the car, until they die and fall off? Something more needs to be added. Its a minor gripe, but one that pops up every so often during car combat.2. Climbing up on things. Imagine this situation. 2 cargo storage containers. Both the same size. One has a yellow marked metal bar on top, signifying that you can jump up, grab it, and pull yourself up. The other doesnt. Er... why cant I climb the other one? Worse yet, there are things that are only 3-4 feet high that you cant grab and pull yourself up to. Thankfully, most of the game doesnt revovle around needing to get up on these things, but from an open world exploration, or even ""which path should i take"" aspect, it can be kinda annoying.Both of these things however dont take away from the games fun, or keep me from recommending it. The game is a blast to play and a visual feast for mad max fans. The one thing id like to see from a DLC, would be a co-op play via the net. Would be super fun to do all the racing and car combat with another person by your side. (doubt that will happen though)			"

Game is still pretty to look at, And gameplay does feel very open world.

												Let me start by saying this game is very immersive and addicting. The characters are wonderfully designed and the voice actors do a perfect job bringing them to life. It's well optimized, running at 1080p 60+fps at all times with completely maxed settings on my gtx 970Ti. The driving feels great once you spend a minutes getting into it, The sounds are amazing and the open world is very cool. At one point i was attacking a convoy at night, only to be forced to exit my car because it was damaged, and while I was being circled by cars that were taking turns trying to run me over, my little Chumbucket buddy is working frantically to get my car running again. Fist fighting is also very well done and i would say is a step above the Arkham games. Crafting the cars is cool to. And the graphics. And the story. And the game. Get it.			"

												I was really worried that this was gonna be a really bad port due to the recent events of Arkham Knight. But it is safe to say that this game is KICKS. SO. MUCH.♥♥♥♥♥ The game itself is extremely well optimized. I only have a gtx 750ti and can run the game on ultra.The combat feels somewhat familiar to the Arkham games, but done slightly worse.Alongside that, the game has a ton of depth to it as far as upgrading your car with new engines and all that jazz.My only complaint is that the controls feel somewhat clunky at first, and something that's also worth noting, THE FIRST CAR YOU DRIVE MAKES IT SEEM THE GAME HAS BAD DRIVING CONTROLS. This is then changed when you get your primary car. Also the game has a few very minor glitches like ""Hold A to kick down ladder"", when I'm actually picking scrap. Overall, the game is awesome, especially if you like the movie and I recommend it to people who like the Arkham games, but want a little bit of change in the gameplay.			"

												This game is amazing: If you don't like Mad Max, despise cars, dislike Post-Apocalyptic wasteland settings, and think the inclusion of road and Mirros Edge-esk interactable objects is ""Too Linear"" then stay out of this wasteland.A vast amount of people who played this game are already fans of Max or this kind of game/setting, the negative reviews i see are coming from:- those experiencing technical issues (That are few and far between) [This is one of the most stable AAA releases i've ever seen... and that's coming from a PC Port launch]- those who dislike certain SPECIFIC aspects of story/characters/settings to the point where it ruins their experience (""why can't i put the dog in every car instead of the one car with the actual dog house on its back?"")- and the biggest reason to dislike the game is the Mechanics that Repeat themselves. (Combat, Camp Dismantling ""liberating"")First things first, THIS GAME PLAYS IT SAFE, that means no ground braking gameplay, you have simplistic missions with a few unique twists. > Much like ""Shadow of Morridor,"" if you like the setting or series enough this isn't an issueI'm sorry to say but AAA games aren't known for new content, it's mostly reworking previously done mechanics and putting a fesh coat of pretty looking paint on it, and this game does a great job with its paint.The profesional game reviews giving this game a low score is mostly due to them being required to play it and review it as a game, rather than play it because they love mad max or Wasteland setting games (The target audience is actually very specific). It's a very common issue.Seccond, if you don't like the voice acting or plot i'm sorry, but that is more preference at this point because the writing is solid and the voice acting has no glaring faults, unless you don't like australian accents.Thirdly, I apologize if you're one of the few experiencing technical issues. This game has an amazingly succesful first day launch, as in there is little to no technical issues short of your PC is just too outdated or unsupported to play most games (this is a PC Port that works day 1 people). This game is so well optamized the minimum specs is actually surprisingly low. (the fact that the game not being broken day 1 is a notable PRO is dissapointing, but in light of other companies just phoning it in on the first day of release and using day 1,2,3 patches to fix a product they ultimatly released broken, this is comendable.)Summation time> If you like Mad Max, post-apocaliptic settings, great story & characters, then get this game.> If you don't, dont.> And if you have the most highest of expectations of anything you play, and your positive game experience is as fragile as a glass jaw, hinging on everything be just right or it shatters, then don't get most things			"

												In this game you'll really feel the life in the wasteland, feel the fight with enemies and dust in your hair.  Lack of food and wather and how to come up to them to survive, without comfort (how hotel and army industry) to have other games. Its not clue to pass the game but goal of the game is to live in it. Should look like extensions of fallout 1 and 2. Do not listen to the trolls and purchase it when he have a discount, you will not regret.			"

												Ratings and scores make no sense to me in accurately describing both the value and experience a game has to offer, so I will just say that this game is worth the buy, and here's why:+ Atmosphere: It looks, sounds, and feels like Mad Max should. It fits within the universe and doesn't ruin the character.+ Graphics: Impressive weather effects (especially the sand storms, which are epic), detailed and high quality textures and models (for an open world), the physics are the most impressive (how cars explode and how debris gets knocked around or breaks into pieces). No visual disturbances to speak of, a very good looking game.+ Sound: The engines, the punches, the shotgun and sniper, explosions, storms and hurricane-like winds are all fantastic. + Gameplay: Batman combat system (melee) meets twisted metal and burnout (vehicles) meets a standard open world Ubisoft game (collect loot and hidden items at locations around the map). It's nice to have a game where collecting loot actually matters, in the sense that you can upgrade Max's vehicles and abilities, and history artifacts give the universe some depth.- There isn't that much gameplay variety here; collecting loot, ransacking and liberating strongholds and bases, races, driving around, BUT at least the driving and vehicular combat is fun as hell, otherwise I wouldn't recommend this game.- This has been said on every review, and it's true, the story and characters are lacking. You won't find memorable or compelling characters here, even Max kind of falls short, but the experience of driving through the wasteland and blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up like in the movies is like none other. Still a fun game to play even if you aren't totally invested in it's plot.I usually wait for sales for games and I hardly ever preorder or buy day one release, but this game was worth every penny. I highly recommend it.			"

 The story of a broken man... Mad Max is a third person singleplayer action game which takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Australia - After humanity burnt through it's resources, such as water and oil, chaos enveloped the world and let to the downfall of society, passing the power to warlords who were able to force as many of the remaining resources under their control as possible.It's needless to say that this is a cruel and merciless society - And the game manages to convey the feeling of this pretty darn good! If this setting genereally intruiges you, you should check out the Mad Max movies which inspired this game - they are purchaseable on the steam page as well!Now to the game itself: Mad Max is a game which lays a strong focus on racing and car driving, as well as brutal melee combat. Personally I don't like racing games, but somehow this game managed to make the expection... Wether due to many costumization options or due to the general set up - I found the racing/driving to be very enjoyable. The quests were fun and varied enough for up to 30 hours but got repetetive after this point, mostly due to the large focus on the quicktimevent based combat for which I had to use the same pattern over and over again - this was fun for the first few hours and felt really forceful and good, but bored me after a while due to it's simplicity. The main quest is unique and interesting enough to keep you playing and there are plenty of rememberable characters aside of the main character Max - who is a broken man with almost nothing to live for. All characters are strongly influenced by this harsh and unforgiving universe, which made them more remarkable if you'd ask me.The graphics of the game were of a good quality and the game preformed really well on my computer, with no crashes and no framedrop throughout my entire playtime... The voiceacting was supherb and the soundtrack underlined the most stressful and important parts of the game well enough!All in all I would recommend Mad Max to anyone whos taken an interest in racing, hand to hand combat and post apocalyptic games... If you don't like cars or (partly repetetive missions/combat) but the whole setting intruiged you, you should check it out - If you don't enjoy it after playing for an hour you should probably get a refund...

												Mad Max is a great game to get lost into when you are tired of the multyplayer thing and just want to relax. Btw has anyone noticed that load of garbage review that ars technica put up? They actually have the first listing on google when you look up information about the game. It's as if they are paying to put down this game because it is a little minimalistic with your character but I'm pretty sure most people will find that the game is based around leveling up your car not necesarily your character... I mean hell most of mad max's fighting is on and in vehicles. So everyone that likes this game be sure to attack the moron on that site ars technica on his review :D			"

												I bought this game for 10 bucks in the steamshop. I have seen some twitch streams about the game, but I never paid too much attention to it. I expected the game to be very linear, storymode kinda game. It is not. It is an open word and it pretty much blew my mind by how much there's to do. You can follow the missions (and there are many) and do that linear straight-ahead mode, or you can just take a break from them and do things to please your allies (like clearing out minefields, the dog is an awesome addition), and also just build your car(s) and characters more. So far I have 26 hours in it and I am far from done. I still have to finish the main missions, still have some sidemissions to do and still have to clear out some bases and so on.Pro's: Open world Plethora of missions Awesome graphics DiversityCon's:  Some missions can be broken (had to google for a fix for 1)Overall its a great game, well made and brings a lot of variation.

												I don't have witty advice or deep reviews.  All I can say is it's 1 of 3 games I saw the credits on in 9 years.  So I suppose that says something doesn't it?I played the game casually and overall the feel when in car combat or driving across the world felt nice and gritty.  Sound and graphics are fantastic.  The boss fights (at least on the easiest setting) were always the same, so I didn't come here for the boss combat.  I came here to live in the world of Mad Max and awesome cars and I got exactly what I asked for.			"

 Mad Max Mad Max is loosely based on the world built up in the Mad Max: Fury Road movie. There is Scrotus (Immortan Joe's son) and his hordes. There are Buzzards and there is also the Roadkill faction. Each faction is uniquely identifiable by their garb and veichles of choice. This is one of the places the game falls flat though. Each faction whilst looking and sounding different are basically the same sorts of people you'll fight but reskins of each other. No faction has a unique fighting style. This lazy design choice also filters into the bosses, where every Top Dog mini boss has exactly the same fighting style despite ""intel"" saying they each have specific weaknesses and such. This is a let down because the mini bosses having their own unique fighting styles and designs would've improved immersion in the game. The game is also very easy, you can block your way through most fights and there's hardly any times you'll find yourself in trouble. Where the game excels though is exploring the land presented to you in the game. Despite it mostly being nothing but sand each area has its own style and helps makes the drives throughout this post apocolyptic wasteland less of a bore. Whether it's driving through sulfur pits, garbage mountains, decrepit motorways or canyons each location is fresh and encourages you to dive around. Each location typically has the same amount to do in it. So 2 minefields to clear, a few scarerows to rip down, snipers to remove and camps to raid. This sounds dull and can get tedious at time I do admit, but I was having a blast 90% of the time. Especially when sieging the camps, most of them are pretty different from each other in terms of aesthetics so it doesn't get boring to explore and it gives you incentive to fully scout out every crevice of the camps for scrap and insignia signs to destory.Each major non enemy leader who hands out missions will own a stronghold. Each stronghold will have projects for you to do (basically mini fetch quests). The projects at each stronghold give bonuses and change the aesthetic of the stronghold too. At first the stronghold will be run down but with each project you do, it'll not only give you a bonus such as refueling your car or rearming you with fresh ammo but it'll transform the look of the stronghold from rundown slum to a place which is relatively nice to live in. It's nice to see your actions having a profound effect on the people living there.The sound design for this game is excellent, with thumping engines, ear shattering explosions and cool australian accents. It almost never lets you down, they've really excelled here. My only complaint is the NPCs dotted around the map you can talk to, they sound as if they got someone off the street to do a fake accent and babble some rubbish. Only part of the audio that's a let down. These NPCs are visually a letdown too because they all look very similar so the developers obviously didn't put too much effort into them.The story isn't very compelling, but then again Mad Max isn't famous for excellent story telling. It's mediocre, except my main problem with it is that it ends too early. Just as the story missions start to get interesting the game ends abruptly. It took me 20-30 minutes to finish Act 5. Max can have his items and car upgraded and his skills unlocked via Scrap. You can find Scrap all over the world, on dead bodies, in forts and in scavenging locations. The upgrading system is very satisfying and you can definitely see yourself and your car progress in strength and capability. You can do up your car however you want, so you can have a fast but fragile car or a slow but tooled to the nines car and all inbetween. The choice is yours! In conclusion:+ Lots to do+ Lots of places to explore+ Art / Sound design is fantastic+ Car combat is fun + Upgrading your car is very satisfying- Very easy foot combat- Car combat can get tedious- Story ends abruptly- Mini bosses all have the same fighting patterns- Factions don't have unique combat movesIn conclusion Mad Max is a fun open world game with nice enviroments to explore. It will get repetitive at times, which can be dull for a lot of people. It's easy but don't let that put you off. This is a great game to buy.			"

												alright so MadMax when i first viewed the video's and other screenshots i thought i was going to be in the car's and trucks and so on the whole time which isn't my kind of game but once i decide to buy it i played for about two hours and loved ever second of it the graphic's are very smooth and not clunky i expected the graphics to consist of clunky graphics due to all the bits and peices flying through the air and all the effects but it was good the story was great it had a few funny moments and some crazy stunts i finished the main story and a few little side quest's in eighteen hours so you should get an easy twelve to fourteen hours of gameplay if your only really playing main story i did mess around alittle bit as i played but overall this game was lots of fun i do suggest you pick it up i would maybe wait for a sale due to it has a fairly high price as most games do now a days -_- btw this isnt exacly like the movie just so your awaremore info-pros- it wasn't rushed you could do what you wanted when you wanted ------you would be warned before entering a quest letting you know what to upgrade before you go------graphics were very nice and well detailed ------ enemys were fairly smart at times (at times othertimes very predictable)+(smart AI system)------ mechanics were really unique and neat cons will be an update to the post theres not really any that i would consider a concern only the odd floating bit of scrap way in sky			"

												It's a good game but this review is more a solution suggestion for keyboard users then it is a review:For keyboard users who want to be able to walk and adjust their walking speed, I have a work-around solution for you since the Mad Max devs are too port-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to figure it out for us: Get the WalkingTheWasteland[www.nexusmods.com] mod. Get my[1drv.ms] version of the script.  This version allows you to: Emulate X and Y axis for mouse cam rotation, versus just X axis. Pressing Alt once toggles jogging speed.  Pressing Alt again toggles running speed. Holding Alt  while moving with WASD makes Max walk. Max is set to start in jog mode by default when scrip is activated in FreePIE. Variable list configured for easy user re-bind, adjusting movement speeds and emulated mouse sensitivity. Do all the steps from the Walking mod, except, instead of using Andrew's py script, use MY version of Andrew's py script. Rebind in-game keyboard controls from default WASD to IJKL or anything not WASD (so it doesn't overwrite and over-power the emulated WASD default FreePIE controls, thus ignoring them) (Optional) Rebind and tweak script variables and controls as you see fit in case LeftAlt and WASD aren't for you! Endorse the mod on NexusMods for being badass enough to humble us with this much wanted feature for us neglected keyboard players!Note: Edit controls for Mad Max's ""On Ground"" control scheme to IJKL or something away from WASD.  Leave the vehicle controls to WASD!  Naturally, if you're changing FreePIE control scheme to something other then WASD, then adjust your understanding of these instructions accordingly.Note: The emulated mouse rotation of Max during WASD movement has a weird camera reset conflict with non-emulated mouse movement, which SOMETIMES occurs when changing Max movement directions and it is annoying I gotta say.  Haven't figured out how to fix it yet or if it is fixable.  If you think you figured it out, please tell me so I can credit you and update the script!  Thanks in advance!Note: If installing vJoy drivers proves a problem for you, contact me, I might have solutions for you.  I had troubles installing vJoy drivers and figured it out for myself.  I'm on win10 64-bit.Mad Max's ability to walk, jog, run and sprint on keyboard properly is clutch for immersive gameplay.  I, for one, refuse to play Mad Max without it.  The devs are so rediculously close to adding a keyboard bind equivalent of toggling this feature that it drives me insane.  This script proves HOW close they actually are and how lazy they are to add it in.			"

												Mad Max is a greatly optimized, open world game packed with perfect wasteland atmosphere, badass car combat, Arkham-style melee combat, great car-character customization, and tons of places to explore. Did I mention that it has a ""capture screenshot"" mode? While you are beating the crap outta your enemy, you can pause for a bit and take a picture of their heads flying around. The only letdown : short story, frustrating jump mechanic where you can't jump to most of higher places even though it is not that high, not much of a soundtrack causing you to get bored easily because you are doing mostly same thing over and over again. 8/10. Better than Arkham Knight.			"

												After watching some streams of the game and reading the reviews of the ""critics"", I was slightly skeptical of the game.I was wrong. Right from the start, the beautiful cinematics grab your attention and throw you straight into the story. There wasn't a whole lot of screwing around with the settings to be done, as it was already optimized for my PC. The controls are very easy to learn and use (as they are similar to most games). The combat so far has been fun and you feel so powerful when fighting. It's a whole lot of button mashing though and there isn't a whole ton of skill involved in the melee combat. The story line is quite linear, but I like it! It's easy to follow along with and stay on track- but at the same time you're in an open world. I don't like games where you get lost on what to do, or where to go, and this is definitely not one of those games.I feel like the post-apocalyptic look could use some more scenery rather than just boulders and desert (yes, I know this is how the movie is), because it feels bare and somewhat static at times. Although, this is the complete opposite at some points when it comes to the intense scenes with the storms and what not.My first two hours of the game have been pretty great. If it wasn't 4:30am already, I would play this game for hours.I would definitely recommend this game. It's a great way to pass the time in a single player environment.			"

												Violent. Interesting. Violent. Graphically beautiful. Graphically violent. Not easy. Violent.Hand to hand combat feels a lot like ""sleeping dogs"", in that if you don't get used to timing your parries, you're roadkill. Driving a bit like ""rage"", but with higher lethality.But all with a graphical sharpness better than the fallout 3 games.Been playin this for quite a few hours now ... that should say something :). Game is still pretty to look at, And gameplay does feel very open world. Upgrading car works very well - some upgrades come with disadvantages, so for example heavier armour makes the car more sluggish. So you wind up balancing to suit your tastes.And the harpoon weapon on the car is just funny.			"

												Let me start by saying this game is very immersive and addicting. The characters are wonderfully designed and the voice actors do a perfect job bringing them to life. It's well optimized, running at 1080p 60+fps at all times with completely maxed settings on my gtx 970Ti. The driving feels great once you spend a minutes getting into it, The sounds are amazing and the open world is very cool. At one point i was attacking a convoy at night, only to be forced to exit my car because it was damaged, and while I was being circled by cars that were taking turns trying to run me over, my little Chumbucket buddy is working frantically to get my car running again. Fist fighting is also very well done and i would say is a step above the Arkham games. Crafting the cars is cool to. And the graphics. And the story. And the game. Get it.			"

												This game is amazing: If you don't like Mad Max, despise cars, dislike Post-Apocalyptic wasteland settings, and think the inclusion of road and Mirros Edge-esk interactable objects is ""Too Linear"" then stay out of this wasteland.A vast amount of people who played this game are already fans of Max or this kind of game/setting, the negative reviews i see are coming from:- those experiencing technical issues (That are few and far between) [This is one of the most stable AAA releases i've ever seen... and that's coming from a PC Port launch]- those who dislike certain SPECIFIC aspects of story/characters/settings to the point where it ruins their experience (""why can't i put the dog in every car instead of the one car with the actual dog house on its back?"")- and the biggest reason to dislike the game is the Mechanics that Repeat themselves. (Combat, Camp Dismantling ""liberating"")First things first, THIS GAME PLAYS IT SAFE, that means no ground braking gameplay, you have simplistic missions with a few unique twists. > Much like ""Shadow of Morridor,"" if you like the setting or series enough this isn't an issueI'm sorry to say but AAA games aren't known for new content, it's mostly reworking previously done mechanics and putting a fesh coat of pretty looking paint on it, and this game does a great job with its paint.The profesional game reviews giving this game a low score is mostly due to them being required to play it and review it as a game, rather than play it because they love mad max or Wasteland setting games (The target audience is actually very specific). It's a very common issue.Seccond, if you don't like the voice acting or plot i'm sorry, but that is more preference at this point because the writing is solid and the voice acting has no glaring faults, unless you don't like australian accents.Thirdly, I apologize if you're one of the few experiencing technical issues. This game has an amazingly succesful first day launch, as in there is little to no technical issues short of your PC is just too outdated or unsupported to play most games (this is a PC Port that works day 1 people). This game is so well optamized the minimum specs is actually surprisingly low. (the fact that the game not being broken day 1 is a notable PRO is dissapointing, but in light of other companies just phoning it in on the first day of release and using day 1,2,3 patches to fix a product they ultimatly released broken, this is comendable.)Summation time> If you like Mad Max, post-apocaliptic settings, great story & characters, then get this game.> If you don't, dont.> And if you have the most highest of expectations of anything you play, and your positive game experience is as fragile as a glass jaw, hinging on everything be just right or it shatters, then don't get most things			"

												Very nice and decently sized story mode, but the most fun I had in the game was upgrading the Magnum Opus and fooling around in the world.  Graphics are great, and the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥easy to run.   I got this game during the winter sale in order to hold me off form playing Just Casue 3 until I upgraded my PC more to run it, and I absolutely love it.  Highly reccomend this game to fans of the Mad Max series or someone just looking for a great open world game.Pros: -Great Story mode, decently long-Weapon mechanics on cars-Wide variety of enemies-Driving is a breeze-Large map with different terrains suited for different vehicles-Beautiful graphics and surprisingly easy to run-Extremely large variety of customization for cars and Max-Camps require strategy to infiltrate and defeat-This game is heaven for those who like to hoard itemsCons--""Top Dogs"" and other bosses insanely easy to defeat-Random encounters with enemy drivers can get annoying if you're trying to traverse long distances-Fighting is a bit too mindless since you mainly use two buttons to attack and parry-F*CKING SANDSTORMSTHE VERDICT:I loved this game.  It runs flawlessly and there is no feeling of being drowned in DLC to get the most out of Mad Max.. very surprising seeing that this was made by the same company that made Arkham Knight for PC.  Overall I am very impressed.  This game has made me want to get into the Mad Max movies, considering I only watched Fury Road.  I rate this game a 95/100.			"

tl;dr: surprisingly fun and atmospheric game which does a lot of thing right because it doesn’t reinvent the wheel but gets repetitive in the mission and side-activity designfulll review here[chillingchua.wordpress.com] as it's too long ... againpro: you get thirsty just by driving in the wasteland NPCs are awesome and right up the Mad Max standard of nutjobs good voice acting in the english version (can’t tell for others) proven/familiar combat system (Assassin’s Creed/Batman) but with some improvements the car is the main character of the game no instant game over when your car is wrecked while driving fuel consumption system for cars quite a few different enemy car types in combat hood ornaments (i.e. a gutted teddy bear gives defence bonus) most camps have a second entry point to avoid ramming down the front door very limited ammo capacity, so no cover based gunfights some choices in the story were not as expected … feared even ;)neutral: fuel consumption system is not needed after a bit very few copy & paste models for side quests the main story is just the normal Hollywood effort, don’t expect too much overall viewing point system to get area map (at least they match the setting) controls need to get used to (wasted quite a few canteens as “refill” and “ignite” are position based on the same controller button)cons: Max is quite boring compared to the NPCs camera issues, especially during fights (car & hand to hand) need a specialized car with a dog for one specific task only the same races have to be completed with different cars to get all rewards repetitive mission design (drive there, kill this, collect this) Chumbuckets lines get repetitive after some time Stronghold rebuilding .. you guessed it: repetitive water is just another healing resource, no consumption over time even in the desert "

												It really is astounding to me, that the vehicle control in Mad Max can be so great, the melee combat respectable and Just cause 3 have terrible vehicles and basicaly no melee. This is a well executed game. The game is worth the price of admission just for the character of Chum Bucket alone. If you always wanted to craft and drive your own wasteland roadster, this is the way to do. HIghly recommended, especially for a bargain price.			"

												You probably know the drill by now; Arkham-style combat, Ubisoft-style open world, Mad Max trappings. Kinda sounds like a bad thing, but you know what? Mad Max is a ton of fun. Vehicular combat adds a unique twist to the formula, and the game looks and sounds fantastic. If you're in the market for some open-world action, you could do a whole lot worse.			"

												 Finished it last night. Not sure about the story. Can't say too much about it without spoiling it but it was either pretty good or just an excuse to make you drive to a place, talk to a person and kill some more guys. That said, I expect it was all intentional, it falls in line with the feeling of the movies and has some fun call-backs here and there. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table and the best way I can describe the whole thing is an enjoyable mix of the Batman games and the Just Cause games. The vehicle powerups are kind of an odd duck. The ones I thought were going to be useful were actually generally crap compared to the ones that I thought were going to make me a god. It sure doesn't suffer from the same ""issue"" that Shadow of Mordor did, where by the end of the game you're basically a demi-god traipsing around killing orcs like it's going out of sport. Even towards the end of the game I was finding it difficult to take on even 2 other vehicles at a time if they were sufficiently armoured. One mistake I think they made with the upgrades is either they're really minor and generally inconsequential or a total game-breaker. It's the difference between doing an extra 5% damage per hit with your car or tearing a wheel off for a one hit kill basically. The ground combat fared much better. It's basically the Batman combat. Block with one button, counter with the punch button. Get funky powerups along the way to unlock better combos and counters. You actually feel more powerful as the game progresses on the ground. I didn't get that with the car. Maybe it's because the car powerups have tradeoffs. Bigger armour and bumpers mean you're slower and have♥♥♥♥♥♥handling. No armour and bumper means you're zippy but have to rely on your powerup weapons rather than the car itself and will get rekt quick in a fight. You have to find a balance lest ye fall victim to crippling overspecialization.All in all I enjoyed the game, but I'm not sure if i'll keep playing to do all the side crap, it's mostly drive here, clear out a camp, do it again. Enjoyable in doses but tedious and irrelevant in the scheme of things.Recommended for everyone if you regularly drop 50 bucks or more on games. Recommended when it goes on sale for cheap people like me. 25 bucks or less would be a buy for me if I didn't have it already.			"

 Mad Max Mad Max is loosely based on the world built up in the Mad Max: Fury Road movie. There is Scrotus (Immortan Joe's son) and his hordes. There are Buzzards and there is also the Roadkill faction. Each faction is uniquely identifiable by their garb and veichles of choice. This is one of the places the game falls flat though. Each faction whilst looking and sounding different are basically the same sorts of people you'll fight but reskins of each other. No faction has a unique fighting style. This lazy design choice also filters into the bosses, where every Top Dog mini boss has exactly the same fighting style despite ""intel"" saying they each have specific weaknesses and such. This is a let down because the mini bosses having their own unique fighting styles and designs would've improved immersion in the game. The game is also very easy, you can block your way through most fights and there's hardly any times you'll find yourself in trouble. Where the game excels though is exploring the land presented to you in the game. Despite it mostly being nothing but sand each area has its own style and helps makes the drives throughout this post apocolyptic wasteland less of a bore. Whether it's driving through sulfur pits, garbage mountains, decrepit motorways or canyons each location is fresh and encourages you to dive around. Each location typically has the same amount to do in it. So 2 minefields to clear, a few scarerows to rip down, snipers to remove and camps to raid. This sounds dull and can get tedious at time I do admit, but I was having a blast 90% of the time. Especially when sieging the camps, most of them are pretty different from each other in terms of aesthetics so it doesn't get boring to explore and it gives you incentive to fully scout out every crevice of the camps for scrap and insignia signs to destory.Each major non enemy leader who hands out missions will own a stronghold. Each stronghold will have projects for you to do (basically mini fetch quests). The projects at each stronghold give bonuses and change the aesthetic of the stronghold too. At first the stronghold will be run down but with each project you do, it'll not only give you a bonus such as refueling your car or rearming you with fresh ammo but it'll transform the look of the stronghold from rundown slum to a place which is relatively nice to live in. It's nice to see your actions having a profound effect on the people living there.The sound design for this game is excellent, with thumping engines, ear shattering explosions and cool australian accents. It almost never lets you down, they've really excelled here. My only complaint is the NPCs dotted around the map you can talk to, they sound as if they got someone off the street to do a fake accent and babble some rubbish. Only part of the audio that's a let down. These NPCs are visually a letdown too because they all look very similar so the developers obviously didn't put too much effort into them.The story isn't very compelling, but then again Mad Max isn't famous for excellent story telling. It's mediocre, except my main problem with it is that it ends too early. Just as the story missions start to get interesting the game ends abruptly. It took me 20-30 minutes to finish Act 5. Max can have his items and car upgraded and his skills unlocked via Scrap. You can find Scrap all over the world, on dead bodies, in forts and in scavenging locations. The upgrading system is very satisfying and you can definitely see yourself and your car progress in strength and capability. You can do up your car however you want, so you can have a fast but fragile car or a slow but tooled to the nines car and all inbetween. The choice is yours! In conclusion:+ Lots to do+ Lots of places to explore+ Art / Sound design is fantastic+ Car combat is fun + Upgrading your car is very satisfying- Very easy foot combat- Car combat can get tedious- Story ends abruptly- Mini bosses all have the same fighting patterns- Factions don't have unique combat movesIn conclusion Mad Max is a fun open world game with nice enviroments to explore. It will get repetitive at times, which can be dull for a lot of people. It's easy but don't let that put you off. This is a great game to buy.			"

												Mad Max is a collection of great ideas poorly tied together and capably (but not perfectly) executed.  It's shallow gameplay is outstnding fun when taken in small doses.  Just don't plan on powering your way through this game in a few sittings; if you do, the lack of polish, disjointed story, and repetition (oh lord, the repetition!)  will kill your buzz all too soon.Mad Max has been compared and found wanting to Assassin's Creed and Batman: Arhkam games (and rightly so while on foot), but the best part of Mad Max takes place behind the wheel.  The car chases (enemies chasing you and vice versa) and convoy battles will stick with you and drive you to play even more  ...at least while they last.  Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of convoy missions (and no free-roam convoys), which is a shame since this seems to be every player's favorite activity.  There are still randomly spawning enemy vehicles roaming the wastes, but they seem fewer and fewer as the game progresses, and enemies flat out run away once your vehicle becomes moderately equipped.If you're looking for a good gap filler - a game to play when the latest MMO has become stale, but before another massive time-sync game - this is a great place to start.  Just don't be in a rush to finish.			"

												A great game with a simple concept. Get a car, smash things. Upgrade car, smash more things. All wrapped up into a beautiful post apocalyptic wasteland that has more charm in it's sandy wastes then No Man's Sky does in all of it's... Ok that one has been used too many times already. Just know this game is a blast, it suffers from ""Open World Sickness"" AKA ""Ubisoft Fever"" symptoms include: Collectathons, High Vantage points to recon the landscape. Quest Gated Upgrades, Fast Travel and fits of crafting madness.If you are not too burned out on Open World Games then this one will appeal for a long while. If not then grab this on sale and hop in for a bit and enjoy the great visuals which look even better when beefed up to 2k or 4k res.			"

												Wow, it's so rare these days in the age of crappy ports by mobile companies, Ubisoft, and console ports. Gimped and hampered performance by invisible effects in Nvidia Gameworks that can be done by an engine anyway...This game.... wow... It's very rare where I feel the need to review a game, but this is one of the best looking PC games since Crysis 3 and one of the best optimized PC games I've ever seen. With my R9 290x I see 64 fps constantly, with it completely maxed out at 1080p. This is also probably one of the best movie licensed games to be made recently.Get this game and Metal Gear Solid V... I'm sick of this ""one is better than the other, Mad Max sucks! Yeah well MGSV is locked at 60!"" Nobody cares, be happy to finally have some good PC games that aren't broken or poorly optimized.

Posted: September 6, 2015
												Mad Max has climbed up to my list of top favorite games. Considering that includes Super Metroid, Mass Effect 2 and Witcher 3, that has to mean something!I must preface this review: it's been years since I have personally had a game like Mad Max land on my doorstep. A game that is just pure fun, that is almost completely stress-free, yet at the same time is not stupid and mindless with mediocre gameplay. Oh no. This is a great game.So, let's begin (no spoilers).--Mad Max shares a lot of similarities to Far Cry 3 and 4. It's just a huge open world with a bunch of objectives to complete and places to explore. There's the story, but you kind of do it inbetween your open world rampage. That's definitely not the primary reason to get the game, but it's not a bad part of the package. You play this game to have a blast.Some of the objectives feel repetitive, a common point of recent critic reviews, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. There's nothing like ripping around a huge open world slaying man-scum. More on that later.Upgrading your vehicle feels good. The scrap system is simple, yet at the same time demands that you make choices about what equipment you really want to purchase. Speed? Buy that. Armor? Buy that! There's some complexity involved in some gear having weight, where you have to decide on whether a piece is worth its trade-off. It's a great upgrade mechanic that remains minimalistic without hurting the complexity involved.Related to upgrades: there is something called the ""Archangels"" system, which is somewhat like gear loadouts. Neutral towards it, as I didn't, personally, find it very useful after the first mission that required it. What you will find is that the game throws a lot of tools at you, and you are free to embrace or disregard a lot of them (such as the Archangel system). The game lets you play how you really want to play, without punishing you.Speaking of gameplay: it feels raw and powerful. In fact, stuff happens in this game - quite often - that makes you pause for a moment, regain footing in reality, and ask: did that just happen?For example, I engaged a convoy during a dust storm, and it was one of the most epic moments in recent memory for gaming. Cars got picked up and blown to pieces in a giant dust devil - while lighting was striking the ground rampantly all over the place - and, immediately after, the final cars were picked off by ramming them over a cliff, in which they exploded in a fiery blossom of pure carnage as I landed with a cool half-donut slide across the sand. This is something that occurs several times throughout your Mad Max experience.What further enhances the gameplay are the small details. The fact, for example, that you can pick up a gas can and place it in the back of your vehicle as a spare only enhances the immersive grip of the game. And there are small details like that everywhere. I'll hold back on spilling them here. They are much more enjoyable and respectable when witnessing them firsthand, for the first time.The graphics are superb. Some of the effects are jaw-dropping. There are some very neat smoke, particle and dust tricks that I just have to appreciate as a Unity hobbyist. The backdrops are some of the best I've ever seen. It can be very immersive if you let yourself get absorbed by the endlessness of the great sandy plains.The level design is out of this world. It was painstakingly handcrafted, and it's obvious that was the case. It's my personal favorite part of Mad Max, and I would argue it's some of the best level design for this generation of games (if not overall, at least in the category of open world). Dead ocean is the primary setting, and it's incredibly imaginative. The rolling dunes, cascading sheets of dead-ocean rock, mountainous crags and canyons, sulfur-spewing flats, rusty car graveyards and half-buried ruinous bandit strongholds--when you step back, pause a moment, and stare, you will find yourself silent. The world is amazing, engrossing; the world is truely barren and apocalyptic, yet beautiful in its own, twisted way.Just as the game world feels endless, the amount of stuff to do is also up there. Racing and collectibles are on that checklist of stuff to do once the main story and territory control begins to near completion. The collection system actually has gameplay-focused elements: you can drive captured bandit vehicles and the special, collectible hood ornaments actually have statistical value as car equipment. They are not big parts of the game, but it definitely beats the seemingly infinite amount of worthless collectible garbage that other companies forcefully shove into their products.The only negative tick on my list of Mad Max items is the repetitive missions. There are a few variants of outposts to capture, but the game would have been even better if there were more creative mechanics put into these, especially considering they take away from the (superior, I'd argue) car-based gameplay. That said, the level design is a spectacular solution on this front. The objectives feel the same, but the outposts definitely do not, and they boast some of the coolest realizations of beat-down apocalyptic shanty-fortresses that I've had the pleasure of visiting. A bandit fortress propped atop a decaying oil rig platform in the middle of a salt-covered, dune-laden, dead ocean floor? Count me in.Last but not least: the game runs AWESOME on PC! I'll refrain from any Batman references, heh. Look at the top reviews for those, they are pretty funny. I'm getting a solid 120 FPS at basically ""Max"" (hah!) everything on a GTX980/FX8350. Honestly, I don't think it's an overstatement: it's one of the best PC ports I've ever had the pleasure of playing.If you experience any FPS drops, my personal setup improved by reducing debris render distance and shadow quality just a tad.What are you waiting for? There's a lovely day of gaming waiting for you.			"

												After playing it for 5 hours,you get a good grip of what the game is all about and what it's going to be about for the remainder of your gameplay time. I will say this: this is so far the most fun i've had with a game since Max Payne 3 came through. The story is present,and it is quite decent,but it's main reason of being there is to guide you along the car carnage and mayhem,the ""juicy"" combat (best word to describe it) and the ridiculousness of the whole Mad Max universe. Every element of this game feels consistent and thematic with the rest,from drinking water and eating to regain your health to acquiring fuel,to adding spikes to your car against enemy boarders who might try to hop on your ride to get you. Besides the impressive and extensive car customization,you can customize the look of Max to enhance his stats and unlock new abilities. All this ensures you have plenty to do in the open world Avalanche Studious have created. Not needlessly cluttered with pointless stuff,but not barren like an actual wasteland itself,it isnt enough to make you stop at every kilometer,but it is enough to make you stop at every 3-5 kilometers,and that's for sure.While there are a few bugs i have encountered,those consist of mere funny ragdoll physics and....that's it. To be honest im surprised how WB managed to get it this well optimised. There are reports of people with 5 year old GPU's who are running this game silky smooth on ultra (or in this case MAX) settings,and the graphical settings are shockingly extensive for a console port,to the point where one might say it is the definite edition on PC.In the closing paragraphs i can only say this,if your on the fence about buying Mad Max,dont be. It is a very good game in all aspects. I got it from♥♥♥♥♥for only 20$,and i honestly feel ashamed i didnt pay more for it. At that price,the deal is a steal,probably literally too (lol). If i were a profesional reviewer i would give this game an 8/10,considering 6 is above average and 10 is a masterpiece.			"

												It is a solid game from what I have seen so far.  No major bugs or graphical issues yet, aside from the odd body getting stuck to my car and ragdolling along behind it.   Price seems a bit high though I would say its worth at the most 50 dollars from what I have seen of it.If you are a mad max fan maybe it is worth the price they are asking I just do not see the apeal of this game being differant from any other of this genre.

												Mad Max is a good game in some points but there is one big problem. Let me explain.This game is very addictive when you start it however after 10+ hours it become a little boring and repetitive - like a lot of games you can tell me -.Yep, after this 10 hours, you discover all of the activities in the game and you know them very well.Furthermore, there are only few quest, the dialogs are poor, the goal of the quest are not epic, not smart, only basics things...So, after this time all you need to do is the same boring thing.Nevertheless, the game is very good, you can find the same type of combat mod than other Warner Bros games, so it's cool, the cars are very nice, the game is beautiful, with no bug and the best work in that game is the sound ! Wonderful sound - Car's motor, combat, shot fire... -.If you want all the achievements, you can play easily 80+ hours - enough time, good point -.To conclude, this game is good, but it can be very better with a real story and quests.

												Mad Max, the game where if you live in America, your going to try and enter the car on the wrong side every single time.Really a great game, it worked with how they made the game separate from the movies timeline and instead just borrowing things like characters and locations from all the movies. Runs like a dream and gameplay was really solid, car mechanics were great and the upgrades and player progression were amazing. You really feel like your in the heart of George Millers desert wasteland! The only real problem was that Max Rockatansky wasn't in the game? Anyone who has seen the movies would know that max was the real strong silent type. Max was always a Neutral Good, he didn't have grudges against the scum that filled the wasteland (except the gang that killed his family), he just simply did what he had to to survive, but if someone truly needed help he would put himself aside and help whoever needed it, either for something in return or as a true act of heroism! This max although strong and silent, is not that. I never felt like I was roaming the wastelands as Max Rockatansky The Road Warrior! I felt like I was taking the backseat to this self centered prick. Really he was just this total f***ing a**hole. Yeah he did end up going back and attemping to ""save"" the damsel in distress but for all the wrong reasons, and in the end he ended up purposely killing chum bucket, this poor tortured soul who had helped you do everything mechanic related for you along your journey. Again great game, amazing story, awesome gameplay, ♥♥♥♥ing terrible protagonist!			"

												Thank you Avalanche for a great game!  Well made PC game that captures the essence of the vast wasteland.  Kill or be killed, bloody and gritty. Brutal combat thats easy to pick up with tons of customization.  The car combat is jarring and dirty, with fire, explosions, blood and broken parts flying all over.The story is not the best, but I love the characters, esp Chumbucket.  The guy has taken mechanics to a whole new level.. a religion for him.  His finest creation, the Magnum Opus, is your ticket out of the Wasteland.  Together you have to gather the parts, fuel and ammo for Max to escape to the Plains of Silence, presumably to find his family again.There is a vast wasteland to explore and scavenge with tons of sidemissions spread all over.  You never know what you might find over the next dune, a convoy?  A fuel depot?  A gang of vicious killers bent on taking your life and car?A blast to play, with tons of optimizations for optimal performance on PC.  8/10*EDIT*  Just finished the game at 51 hours playtime.  I have not completed all the acheviements or 100% complete the game.  I have done all the story missions and all the sidemissions.  All thats left is to gather all the loot and find the hidden thingys.  Well worth the money, and the most important thing is THE GAME IS FUN!			"

												Mad Max drops the player in the wasteland, and punishes risk-taking and adventure. Jumping off a cliff severely damages the car, driving into the distance uses hella fuel, and keep your finger off the trigger of your sweet shotgun, because ammo is sparse. Early in the game, the player should learn to collect scrap, to wait while the car gets repaired by Chumbucket, and to locate gas and water. I never thought I’d call a game about post-apocalyptic car battles realistic, but here I am.			"

												In the short time I have owned this game I have learned three things.1. Chumbucket is the best traveling compainion I have seen.2. Raming things with your car after some bumper (ramming prow) upgrades is absolutely fun to do.3. I very rarely use fast travel for some unknown reason.You will see that people mention a lot of grinding, well they are not lying.Best thing to do is enjoy the absolute slaughter fest that you cause in melee combat and act like a serial killer shark when you drive. Trust me, it will make the grinding much more enjoyable.You will spend quite a bit of the game going from warcamp to convoy, destorying everything that you don't like the look of. You decide wether or not that pitiful warboy in his little buggy gets to live or not, but most of the time it will be not.***WARNING SOME SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT***Now your two biggest limiting factors is going to be threat level and scrap. As such i suggest that at your first oppertunity you get a cleanup crew at each stronghold as that will allow you to do hit and runs on random scouts without stopping for the scrap they drop. This will also be useful when you take down convoys as they have quite a few vehicles in them (Which respawn if you don't kill the fuel truck).As for region threat level, try and enjoy the fun that is killing all the warboys in each camp. I suggest using whatever equipment you have to weaken the defenses at each one before going in (AKA kill that damn war crier before hand). If you find a warcamp a bit too hard go out, do random crap for griffa tokens, get better equipment from leveling, see Griffa for upgrades, and go murder some armies inside that camp.Last of all, THE CAR! That is your everything in the game, it will end up with harpoons, a sniper riffle, EXPLOSIVE harpoons, as well as better rams, armor, engines, wheels, anti-boarding spikes, wheel spikes, nitros, and some other interesting things to make it your own. Seriously, the armor and ram will affect the weight of the car meaning you will need a better engine and suspenstion for it to work, and you can work all that to your benifit. A long time back when this game came out someone I knew let me mess around and I constructed a car with no armor, best engine and suspenstion, and a MASSIVE RAM! Needless to say it could ram the scrap off a war-rig if they existed in-game.So before you get this game remember that you will be grinding and improving your stuff before you can progress. This game is LONG and you will have a lot of time in this game before you finish it. Even then you can spend more time getting the last few parts for your car and getting 100%. As such game at the risk of your already limited social life and say goodbye to your cousins and other family members that do not live within a mile of you if you do get this game.			"

With my R9 290x I see 64 fps constantly, with it completely maxed out at 1080p. This is also probably one of the best movie licensed games to be made recently.Get this game and Metal Gear Solid V...

It is afterall a open world game and many of them suffer from simmilar issues with doing the same thing over and over again.

												to Me this is almost exacly what i expected from a Mad Max game.fun car combat for the length of the game with the grapling hook and ramming an stuff and later on the Thunderpoon, only reall downside to this is that theres a large change your just gonne dance around the enemy cars insted of wrecking them XD.the on foot combat is pretty basic arkham style but a lil bit heavyer, which for someone who isnt really into those kind of fighting games is pretty good and easy to get a hold of.the story is a Mad Max story, not much of it but hey Max doesnt talk much and hes not a sillent character.at the start of the game your more likely to try an avoid contact because your car is just weak. which i find fine.love the Engineer.only thing i really don't like is that once you open up the top halve it feels like the story is trying to rush to the finishline which made me feel like i have to just grind for parts.Which could just be solved if they increased the scrap amount you get by even just 1 or 2.even after finishing the game i needed about 10k more scrap to get the last view achievements (with the exception of one) and that just didnt add up to me as i collected everything and the only thing to do was wait in or out of the game for strongholds to earn me scrap or grind out a view hunderd heavly armord cars an hope for storms.also while i played theres a bug that can turn your storm into a never ending one (till you die) or storms start in the middle of a time race which makes the race imposible to do properly.Performance wise it rocked.to sum up.i apsolutely loved my time with the game till my 50th hour it ruled.but it can feel like a grind sometimes as the story is pretty thin. which could be fixed it the amount of scrap per piece gets slightly increased.its a great 40-60h game if you this is the kind of thing you enjoy and want to try an collect everything.if you just want it for the story its alot shorter and i think alot less wurth it.PS: Achievement hunters be ware, keep an eye on the Legend tab and its challenges throughout the game some are almost imposible to do at the end, or just a really time taking grind be cause i lowerd the spawn rate to much. -theres an achievement tie'd to the non repeating once.

												Witness me review this game, what a game, what a lovely game, and other such idioms, blah blah blah...I've got nothing but praise for this Magnum Opus. The voice acting is perfectly casted, believable, and wonderful. The sound is in your face and high octane. The action and gameplay are gritty, visceral, and bloody wonderful. The world, scenery, cars, enemies, and characters are breathtakingly designed. The story is gutwrenchingly emotional and will leave you spent. My only issue is the amount of bugs, some intrusive, some not, which makes me think that this game was a little rushed. However, I consider it a definite must play, and I loved every moment.			"

												What a ride it was! The best game of 2015 for me. Smooth gameplay, total abscence of bugs and other usual annoyances. Huge world to explore. Story that makes you want to complete it. Fine combat as melee as gunned. Desert done totally awesome including time of the day change and all other little details of environment. Car becomes your lover over time. Especially after so much upgrades. The game engine is totally awesome, all materials, models and all make it seamless world in which i wanted to get lost. The atmosphere of the game made me want to return to this world again and again. Recommended for true desert walkers! :)p.s. 50 hours of gameplay, and i didn't explore everything yet. story is finished though.			"

												Thank you Avalanche for a great game!  Well made PC game that captures the essence of the vast wasteland.  Kill or be killed, bloody and gritty. Brutal combat thats easy to pick up with tons of customization.  The car combat is jarring and dirty, with fire, explosions, blood and broken parts flying all over.The story is not the best, but I love the characters, esp Chumbucket.  The guy has taken mechanics to a whole new level.. a religion for him.  His finest creation, the Magnum Opus, is your ticket out of the Wasteland.  Together you have to gather the parts, fuel and ammo for Max to escape to the Plains of Silence, presumably to find his family again.There is a vast wasteland to explore and scavenge with tons of sidemissions spread all over.  You never know what you might find over the next dune, a convoy?  A fuel depot?  A gang of vicious killers bent on taking your life and car?A blast to play, with tons of optimizations for optimal performance on PC.  8/10*EDIT*  Just finished the game at 51 hours playtime.  I have not completed all the acheviements or 100% complete the game.  I have done all the story missions and all the sidemissions.  All thats left is to gather all the loot and find the hidden thingys.  Well worth the money, and the most important thing is THE GAME IS FUN!			"

My name's Max...Fans of the old and new movies alike will instantly recognise the setting and (art)style, largely copied from the third movie (Fury Road). You play the protagonist Mad Rockatansky, or ""Mad Max"", in a post-apocalyptic wasteland at some former coast of Australia, looking for his homeland which he mysteriously calls ""the Plains of Silence"". Already at the start of the game, in the intro, he gets robbed of his V8 car ""Interceptor"" and posessions and over the coarse of the game he tries to get back his car (or build a new one as he soon discovers), avenge the man responsible (Scabrous Scrotus) to then continue his journey. On his way he encounters the many War Boys of Scabrous Scrotus, and a fellow war lord Stank Gum with his War Boys, and also some allies whos help he can use all too well.A beautiful desertThe graphics in this game are pretty well done and optimised. Although of course this game is not full of lush bushes, animals and other stuff that can burden your graphics card a lot, it still feels like a beautiful vast outstretching desert full of artifacts of a past history that runs really well and smooth. Scattered around the landscape you find, next to rock formations and tire tracks, the remnants of a lost world: rusty shipwrecks, former oil drill platforms, crumbled bridges, ruins of factory buildings, docksides, harbour cranes, so on and so forth, reminding of a life long gone where there was still plenty of water and food to go around. Collectibles scattered throughout the world will hint you to it and what might have happened.It's a fun driveSo how does it play? After meeting your first few characters you find yourself quickly driving around a LOT in your newly acquired ride looking for scrap, the main currency in the game. Scrap is used to upgrade your car, lovingly called the 'Magnum Opus' by Chumbucket whom you meet at the start of the game and likes to express everything in a religious but car related fashion, and scrap is used to unlock some abilities and gear on Max. By completing activities like achievements, do x times this or x times that, or races you will earn Griffa tokens. These can be spent when you visit Griffa to upgrade some perks. These perks will add extra scrap ontop of what you pick up, or makes you consume less fuel, et cetera.Of combat in this game are two kinds: on foot and in the car. That's right, car combat! Early in the game Chumbucket will fabricate a harpoon for you on the car that enables you to rip off doors, tires, bumpers or snatch the driver right from his seat! Despite the limited tools you get for the car to use, car combat in this game is the most fun. Chasing down Scrotus' convoys going high speed, picking off cars left and right watching them tumble and turn into big balls of fire (Michael Bay would approve!) feels exhilarating!On foot the combat is much the same like the Batman games, for those familiar with it. Max can pick up a few weapons but they always have a (very) limited lifespan. This can be elongated by the perks at Griffa, but you'll generally be fighting with your fists. Even the little shivs Max carries can only be used once for a finisher and not always be looted back from the corpses. Max also carries a shotgun, but the ammo is rather limited, even with all upgrades unlocked. All-in-all the combat in the beginning feels powerful, it feels as if more could have been done to make it more interesting and less repetitive in the long run. Every boss fight of the Top Dogs in the world is almost completely the same and requires no imagination. Once you figured out one, you know how to beat them all. Such a pity!Story wise this game is as dry as the world it plays in and as shallow as the water collectors. There is very little character development, of either Max or anyone he encounters. Then again, Max is a rather selfish man with little empathy for others. At least that's what he wants to make himself believe. Griffa, the fella Max visits to upgrade his perks every now and then, sometimes puts question marks at his deeds to make him rethink, but that's about all the hints Max (and the player) gets.TL;DRThe game is a good looker, runs very well, and fun to play if you like to drive an aweful lot through miles and miles of desert land in a world fueled by the atmosphere from Mad Max: Fury Road. Car combat is most fun, combat on foot is a little too familiar and not much depth. Story is very short and paper thin I'd say, compared to games like Witcher 3. If you like the car bit, it can be worth your money. If you seek something full of story and rich hand-to-hand combat, you will be disappointed.			"

												A fun yet repetitious complement to the latest Mad Max movie.  They did an awesome job capturing the aesthetics of the film, and building a beautiful game that feels like an extension.Absolutely loved leveling up and turning my ride into a badass war machine.  The vehicle combat was a blast, and was the only part of the game that didn't get old towards the end.Fist fighting combat was very satisfying (like Batman without gadgets), but lack of enemy variety made all the fights feel the same.  However, still a visceral and enjoyable experience when you beat down a group of 20+ guys.Great fun.8 / 10			"

												A documentary-based game showcasing the day to day lives of people in modern day Australia, Mad Max is an adventure of a lifetime.In Mad Max, we follow Max Rockatansky, a man travelling to the far corner of Western Australia to get some vegemite for his family. Unfortunately for him, some cheeky blokes steal his car and take it to their leader, who takes it apart because of the overtly low wages for outback miners like himself.Overtaken with mild annoyance, Max teams up with a cripple and decides to ♥♥♥♥ up all of the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and build a new car using some metal bits he finds in their settlements. He also helps out a hurt doggy which is cute.Oh yeah, he also eats maggots out of a rotting dead guy's body. What the ♥♥♥♥ Australia.Anyway, overall I give Mad Max a 8/10. I took away two points because it showed me exactly what kind of hell exists on this earth and scarred me for life.			"

												Picked this up when it was on sale, and probably wouldn't otherwise. It's an enjoyable romp, but it's not without its flaws.PROS:* Non-vehicle combat is pretty fun, even frustrating at times, for the right reasons.* Vehicle combat is similarly fun and occasionally frustrating. You'll find quick though that both of the above get kind of repetitive, and the difficulty spikes up and down for a lot of areas/missions/whatever.* There's usually something to do. You can spend time on side quests and exploration for quite a while before needing to progress, plus there's random(ish) events.* Strongly reminiscent of the Batman games, both in the way it's presented and how the ground combat is... well, basically identical to Batman, let's not kid ourselves there. But that's a good thing!* Everything's well animated. Everything feels crisp. Overall it's just a pretty game that's well-optimized and has plenty of customization. You will find yourself thinking ""that was pretty cool"" a lot.*Admittedly, the level design in the enemy forts is pretty solid. You might spend a while in one looking for everything after you've cleared it out. But that also brings up the first con...CONS:* Repetitive... stuff. You might find yourself bored at times just because, yeah, while there's a lot to do, this isn't exactly a scenic environment we're talking about here. In otherwords, the novelty wears off.* Characters aren't all that interesting. However, they have plenty of spoken dialogue, and the acting itself isn't bad, they're just all kinda one-sided.* The mine field side quests are annoying, especially because you *have* to bring your pupper, and you *have* to bring a certain vehicle to bring him. The range at which he detects mines just feels off, and it just seems more like a chore than a minigame.* The level-ups on Max himself... well, they feel like they don't really do much. They're so minor you kinda don't notice them.NEUTRAL:* The whole survival element is cool, but never very threatening. Food is just your health, water is pretty easy to come by, and fuel you can keep spare tanks of in your trunk (and they're plentiful). All in all, pretty fun game, might revisit since I never finished it.			"

												Mediocre story; shiny and chrome graphics! Just play this game for what it is and dont expect too much and you might enjoy it like I did. There are dull times in between glorious battles with cars and warboyz, where you gather scrap (for upgrades) and do stuff to lower threat levels, but nothing to tedious. Witnessing your lowly junk heap of a magnum opus evolve throughout the game into a chariot worthy of Valhalla is one of the most satisyfying things about Mad Max, more than the plot or gameplay itself. Go pick this up on a sale.			"

												Mad Max is an open world action game set in a post apocalyptic wasteland. It features a blend of various gameplay mechanics into what I think is a really solid experience and worth your time if you are into these sorts of games.The game has a lot of high points and a couple of low points. The best part of Mad Max is the vehicle portion of the game. The driving is fun with a great sense of speed and the vehicular combat is a blast. The rush of racing through the wasteland battling against a gang of vehicles in a car loaded with rockets, flamethrowers, nitro, harpoon gun, spiked rims, etc. is thrilling. The sense of speed and impact of your weapons makes every encounter a fun and engaging experience. My only criticism (and that goes for the rest of the game) is how easy it is once you upgrade your vehicle. Once I had my rockets maxed out the challenge was gone so I forced myself to mix up my weapon use in order to keep it fun.You can upgrade your vehicle the way you want. You can have a speed demon, slow but tank like vehicle, or a mix of both by adding/removing parts such as armor, bumpers, spikes, etc. There are aesthetic upgrades available as well but it's not as robust as I would like. You only have the choice of a few decals/paintjobs/body parts.While the hand to hand combat feels brutal it feels a little clunky. It's not as smooth as say the Arkham series or Shadow of Mordor. Maybe that's on purpose because it does feel a little 'heavier' and it could be due to design. But the problematic camera can be frustrating if you are in closed spaces. As you would have guessed from my Arkham comment the game uses a combat system similar to that game series. If you are not familiar with it it's based on pressing the attack/block/counter buttons at the right time in order to flow freely and rack up your hits. The longer your combo goes on the faster your 'fury' meter rises. Once it is filled you hit a lot harder than you normally do. The map itself is large and filled with a lot of activities. Unfortunately, the variety is scarce and it does feel old by the time you get near the end. The tasks are really simple; destroying an enemy camp, killing snipers, destroying scarecrows, talking to random NPC's, and finding loot locations. The loot locations allow you to find scrap, parts to expand your bases, and collectibles. Scrap is used to upgrade your character and vehicle but at a certain point you are going to have an incredible amount of it so you don't need to worry about saving up.The graphics are gorgeous and the game is very optimized. The developers did an incredible job with the PC version of the game and they should be commended. One thing you should know is people have reported heavy stuttering when playing the game on a HDD so I recommend installing it into a SSD drive. Ultrawide screens are supported and you can re-bind your keys as well. I really enjoyed my time with Mad Max. I really hope they make a second game and I cannot believe how underrated this game is. I believe it will be a cult classic and I for one am very glad to have experienced it.			"

												Mad Max is something every post-apocalyptic adventurer wants to explore. It's pretty fun and mildly entertaining for few hours. Although it has some minor imperfections it proves itself to be a quite good game. Personally I didn't get much out of the story, it was a little bit clingy and it had was just a typical video-game plot #192.The combat system of the game appears to be somewhat similiar to Batman and Shadow of Mordor. Very well animated intense combat with multiple enemies is fun and you can actually feel the power of Max's punches. Basic combat moves are easy to learn and easy to execute when the keys that you have to press are X and Y. One of the most important part of this game is driving. Building your own ""Magnum Opus"" so to speak. You can choose what body type you want to use and customize your car whilst you roam your way through the territories and cause havoc. Car handling is hard to learn and to master in the beginning of your journey but it'll get better when you actually evolve your car.The game has some minor imperfections as I mentioned earlier. The NPC behavior for example. The NPC cars may just drive at you out of nowhere, ram you twice when you are parked and looting and try to kill you by driving over you. Well, at that point you should rush to your car and battle with them, but, sometimes this occurs: The NPC's actually dissmiss you at the exact moment you step in to your car. Then they'll drive away and try to get as far as you as possible without even noticing your existence.Summa summarum+ Great graphics with magnificent framerate (60 stable @ Max settings)+ Enjoyable combat+ Size of the continent+ A lot to do (loot, scavenge, discover)+ Magnum Opus+ Strongholds- NPC behaviour from time to time- Enemies with big weapons might hit you when the animation isn't clearly even close to you- Car driving can get a little bit irritating when you have to do something carefully (watch out for bombs i.e.)- You can't really jumpIt's a nice game to lose twentysomething hours with, but I wouldn't pay the full price.7.5/10			"

												This game is probably the single largest surprise I've ever experienced through a lifetime of gaming.  Prior to release, all the gameplay footage I saw looked incredibly boring.  I hate Avalanche's other games (the Just Cause series) because they are incredibly boring, repetitive, and generally low quality with an incredible over-reliance on cheap gimmicks.  I can hardly stand to watch 5 minutes of the original Mad Max and thought Fury Road was an over-hyped over-indulgent action movie with lousy characters, a mediocre story, and little meaning, the kind I'd expect from Michael Bay (albiet with significantly more style.)Despite all these things, I found Mad Max very enjoyable - to the point where I put the time in to complete every achievement and was still enjoying it at the end.  Somehow Avalanche produced a game that doesn't feel like it relies entirely on a single gimmick, doesn't feel incredibly padded to fulfill some quota for the size of the game map, has a decent story with interesting characters (I was amazed at how well-written Max's mechanic's character is,) has solid gameplay, and also runs incredibly well.  I say this as a person who is very intolerant of games that feel repetitive and grindy.So to the gameplay: You play as Max, driving around in the post-apocalyptic wasteland in your muscle car (obviously.)  It takes the typical open world game route of scattering objectives around the map that you can complete at your leisure, along with fast travel locations that reveal nearby locations on the map and story missions.  There are only a couple types of locations but they vary significantly in size and structure which helps prevent the game from feeling repetitive, even though you're doing the same thing at each location.The game features both car and hand-to-hand combat.  The hand-to-hand combat is similar to the free-flow system found in other games like the Batman Arkham series and Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor.  While Mad Max uses a simplified system with only a couple enemy types and abilities, but it works well for the most part and is satisfying to engage in.  It's not without its problems though, with some moves (that you have no control over whether execute or not) prevent you from blocking attacks from other enemies, and being hit will interrupt the move.  The prompt timing for blocking attacks also feels a bit off, similar to Batman: Arkham Asylum before they got it straightened out in Arkham City (and then broke again in Arkham Origins.)Car combat though, is where the game really shines.  Your car is equipped with a harpoon to grab and pull pieces of other cars and hostile objects in the game world and you can upgrade your car with various equipment to make ramming more effective and add other ways to inflict damage or protect your car from damage.  Battling other cars is a lot of fun and flows very well, though fights can get quite hectic against multiple enemies and can end up devolving into jousting.The really brilliant part though is when you go up against convoys.  Convoys have set routes on the map, and are composed of one main vehicle along with a number of guard vehicles.  They continuously drive in a loop on the convoy route and you have to destroy the main vehicle to clear the convoy and get a reward.  The continual driving keeps the pace up and taking out the guard vehicles as they split off to deal with you while maintaining proximity to the convoy (the guards will respawn if you get too far away) is incredibly satisfying.  It was so much fun that I was really disappointed when I cleared the last one on the map and realized there weren't any more.The only real problems I see with the game besides the aforementioned hand-to-hand combat issue is that some of the map locations can feel pretty pointless.  Driving up to a pile of rubble just to pick up one pile of scrap on the ground?  What's the point?  Luckily those locations are in the minority and don't really pose much of an issue.And so I have to conclude that Mad Max is one of the best games released in 2015.  I never thought I'd ever say that.			"

												Beautifully-crafted world with rich background and immersive environment.All locations, including camps, environments and scavenging spots are unique with distinct features and often filled Historical Artifacts which provide some immersive backstories.Characters have the iconic Mad Max-isque vibe and have strong, interesting personalities, often providing much immersion and insight into the Mad Max world. The Angel of Combustion be praised!Ground combat is smooth and engaging, carefully timed counters and well-executed combos are very rewarding (much more so than Batman, for those who have played WB's Arkham series).Some downsides to note:1. Gameplay gets very repetitive in the end, especially if you focus on clearing sidequests and scrap locations.i) Other than hunting for scraps and hitting camp objectives, there are not much to do during exploration. While immersive, there are nothing interesting to interact with (always the same old water filter, scrap, Dinky-D's lying around etc) and requires the players' own imagination to fill in the gaps in the rich world left by the developers.ii) Car combat is kind of disappointing - enemy tactics are as follows: bang you till you die one way or another + some cars can drop mines + some cars can lit themselves up and attempt to blow you up. That's it. 90% of enemy cars (who can't drop mines or lit themselves up) will only use the same tactic over and over.iii) All camp bosses are just re-skinned versions of the same enemy - a heavy weapon-wielding brute the size of a half-giant, with identical HP, fighting style and weaknesses. One of the total let-downs of the game.2. The developers don't want you to feel that this is a racing game and they are doing a good job at it. Seriously - you are driving half of the time and they don't even throw in a speedometer for your cars. The only way any driving/racing or car combat sequence can be interesting is when it happens during one of the freak thunderstorms during the game.3. Some annoying issues such as not being able to keep your current car when Fast Travelling (always reverts to the Magnum Opus - this makes mine clearing missions with the weak buggy absolutely tedious); game not telling you which cars have what ability (spent a long time to figure out which buggy can spot mines); 4. Some serious FPS drops when walking around in camps and strongholds, even at low graphic settings with good PC.Tips to enjoy:1. Finish the main quests first to unlock all upgrades for your magnum opus.2. Don't try to clear all sidequests (incl. scrap locations, scarecrows, minefields etc) at one go, it will make the gameplay extremely tedious and kills the fun.3. The real fun happens when driving through thunderstorms - try actively hunting for them!4. This is not a RPG nor racing game, so don't expect them to be such.Currently on Steam for a low low price, recommended purchase.			"

												Mad Max is something every post-apocalyptic adventurer wants to explore. It's pretty fun and mildly entertaining for few hours. Although it has some minor imperfections it proves itself to be a quite good game. Personally I didn't get much out of the story, it was a little bit clingy and it had was just a typical video-game plot #192.The combat system of the game appears to be somewhat similiar to Batman and Shadow of Mordor. Very well animated intense combat with multiple enemies is fun and you can actually feel the power of Max's punches. Basic combat moves are easy to learn and easy to execute when the keys that you have to press are X and Y. One of the most important part of this game is driving. Building your own ""Magnum Opus"" so to speak. You can choose what body type you want to use and customize your car whilst you roam your way through the territories and cause havoc. Car handling is hard to learn and to master in the beginning of your journey but it'll get better when you actually evolve your car.The game has some minor imperfections as I mentioned earlier. The NPC behavior for example. The NPC cars may just drive at you out of nowhere, ram you twice when you are parked and looting and try to kill you by driving over you. Well, at that point you should rush to your car and battle with them, but, sometimes this occurs: The NPC's actually dissmiss you at the exact moment you step in to your car. Then they'll drive away and try to get as far as you as possible without even noticing your existence.Summa summarum+ Great graphics with magnificent framerate (60 stable @ Max settings)+ Enjoyable combat+ Size of the continent+ A lot to do (loot, scavenge, discover)+ Magnum Opus+ Strongholds- NPC behaviour from time to time- Enemies with big weapons might hit you when the animation isn't clearly even close to you- Car driving can get a little bit irritating when you have to do something carefully (watch out for bombs i.e.)- You can't really jumpIt's a nice game to lose twentysomething hours with, but I wouldn't pay the full price.7.5/10			"

												With Mad Max you can act out your road rage then get out of your car and deal out a whole lot of hurt.Mad Max is set in an apocalyptic world that stays true to the Mad Max universe.  You start out with very little but you can pull together a few bits of scrap and build your dream car, wrecking machine, speed demon.  Its an open world game, so you can wonder off and do whatever pleases you. Wether its searching for water, food or taking care of wasteland scum.I really enjoyed adding modifications to the car to make it faster, handle better or just adding weapons to elimate those war parties.

												I had an absolute blast playing this game and would recommend it for those that love a good open world collectathon. Despite some clunky moments and some uninspired voice acting, it is an overall well polished and fun sandbox to play in. Also, my god does it look gorgeous, especially during the day when you see an incoming storm. (oh yes, the storms are amazing)Here is a video that I cut together of some of my favorite moments of my playthrough, I tried to ensure there was no story spoilers, and just the action and fun stuff.

												I'd had a few shandies on the release date and bought the game after watching the trailers.  Mad max is awesome and I was a Fallout addict from a young age.  Oh yes, wasteland fun. Gotta be right up my street. After downloading the game that night I fired up steam the next day and wondered WTF I had bought this time.  Would I need to use the steam refund option?Hell no.  It's mad max.  I gave it a try... and I'm very glad I did.  I've heard this game referred to as the ""Hidden game of the year"" - and I think that's not a completely unjustified description. It runs so well at full settings. As a sandbox, it ticks all the boxes.  There's so much to do and explore.  Lots to upgrade and tinker with in general.  The combat in vehicles is as enjoyable as when on foot.  The characters are interesting and I feel fully immersed in the game. It's very hard to tear away from each session of gaming. Yet, I heard nothing about this game until its release. Jolly good show!			"

Graphics were pretty damn good and the optimization is on point. I got a solid 60fps on max settings on a GTX 960 2GB. Only problem is that the game lags out every time it autosaves...and that's a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of times.

												I was a little bit concerned that my machine might be under-specced for a game of this magnitude, being that I only have a GTX660, but I switched the GPU Tweak into its game-mode and the only performance issue I have noticed thus far is an ever-so-slight-so-as-to-almost-be-unnoticable jitter in some of the cut-scenes. When I checked the in-game settings, I was happy to see that the default High setting was in use, but - even more astoundingly - it was also running at 2560 x 1600!I've noticed a couple of bugs in the sound; Sometimes you get back into your car and race away, but the car noises are muted. They're there, but only at 10% volume. They come back eventually; Comments on missions play randomly even after the mission is complete; but overall, the sound is pretty great. The music moves with the action, without dominating. The car sounds are nicely done, with lots of variance for the different machinery. The voice acting for the main characters is well done, with ability seeming to coincide with the level of the characters' importance.The playability is slightly marred by two things: The camera, and the vehicle controls. The camera is controlled with the right thumb stick, but you also need to use your thumb for fighting moves. I've had a couple of bad experiences where I've been backed into a wall and the viewpoint hasn't allowed me to see what is going on. It's cost me a few crucial hits at times. The car controls share a bit of the camera grief too at times, although only at low speeds, but my main frustration is with the steering. It takes forever to re-center, let alone swinging to opposite lock to catch a slide. If you let go of a steering wheel irl, it will (read: should) automatically rotate to the direction of the car's travel, and quickly - it may, in fact, over-rotate, which is where over-correction and spins happen, but that is for another type of game engine. Max seems to work the steering at the same geologic time-scale whether moving at 10 or 210kph. Maybe that's something to do with the car's 'handling' stat, I don't know yet. I'm still rolling around in The Jack, so maybe time will tell.The rest of the game mechanics work very well, especially the fighting - both on foot and vehicular. I'm really enjoying wading into groups of warboys with the parrying and combo system used in the fist-fights, whilst regularly unlocking new moves and finishing combos as I progress. The vehicular mayhem presents just as many ways to convert cars to scrap, whether you go with the classic ram-them-until-they-become-a-screaming-fiery-mess approach, or a surgical mindset where the use of tools such as the shotgun and harpoon can quickly remove a threat, but leave the car intact if required. Or both. There are a lot of different enemies, and each needs a different approach, so your tactics will need to evolve constantly. It doesn't get boring or repetitive very quickly at all. And the storms - wait until you see the storms. The environment varies just as much as the enemies, and can be just as deadly. Even when you're in a semi-safe area, you still need to watch out for everything from twisters and tornadoes, to full-blown force-5 hurricanes - and even they come in all sorts of different forms too. I was a little bit disappointed that cars weren't more lootable - I mean, you've done away with the warboys and now you have their car at your disposal, but your only option is to drive it back to the stronghold to add it to your collection if you haven't already done so. It really needs the option to scrap the car, either on the spot for some quick scrap, or back at home for increased returns. You can't even syphon the guzzolene... fortunately, or oddly, there is quite a lot of it about, so not a big deal.There is a lot to get through in this game, and even with the small frustrations, I think I'll be playing it for a good while yet.

One thing is to make sure you nick as many cars as you can early on as they start to become harder to find as you clear a zone of its many nasty’s.			"

												I tried so hard to like this game. I keep seeing all the reviews that rant and rave but I just can't say that this game is worth it. Its basically a copy and paste of shadows of mordor which I really liked so I assumed I would like this, but its god aweful. The beginning of the game makes you think you have all these options to pick but you start off only unlocking things because you need them in the story so it doesnt really feel like you are in control of getting upgrades and modifying your car for a bit. This happens later though and makes the game more fun. However, EVERYTHING you do feels super grindy. Go here fight the same guys, pick stuff up, go here and talk to this person, rinse and repeat. Again, shadows of mordor was basically the same thing but for some reason I liked it much better compared to this game. Also, everything you do feels super drawn out and takes forever to do. Maybe its supposed to be that way but every thing from loading screens, to even the movement of max in how if you accidentally aimed wrong while walking toward something like a ladder and or pressed the action button too soon, you had to re-adjust and try again. Fighting in the car gets old quick as sometimes you can feel helpless in your attempts to outrun or fight off even 2 or 3 cars. Next is the upgrades; if youre like me, you try and collect things and get upgrades before doing all of the main quests. What bugs me is that you dont even get the big v8 engine until  theres only like 2 main quests left, which leaves me sad because once I get the engine, I have nothing left to do. Lastly, and for whatever reason I think Im one of the few people this has happened to; this game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥. My sound cuts out A LOT for different things. Whether its the engine or dialogue, or even general sound effects. And when this happens, my game stops loading the landscape so im left with weird piles of sand and ground that I can drive into and through. And sometimes the ground gives out and my car falls through the map. In addition, whenever this happens, I can't even fix it by going to the main menu or fast traveling because the game freezes when I try either of those options. So then I basically have to restart the game and watch the intro videos which arent that long but start to take forever once I have restarted the game like 4 times in 45 minutes of play. So like I said, I really tried to like this game. I REALLY did; but sadly, I ♥♥♥♥in hate it. However, I don't neccesarily think the game doesnt deserve praise. People should still play it as it is pretty fun.			"

												This is one of those games that will divide people. You'll like it or hate it. The game is loosely based on the recent Fury Road movie though the story and characters arent. (The Max in the game isnt modelled or voiced by Tom Hardy either). The game starts with Max being attacked by the warlord of Gastown, Scrotus, who steals Maxs Inteceptor and leaves him for dead. Max finds a hunchback mechanic called Chumbucket who helps Max to build a new car to get back at Scrotus. The Magnum Opus. Good points: -The Wasteland of the game and all the bizarre characters who inhabit it really capture the look and feel of the recent movie. The map is huge and your let loose to try and attack Scrotus' camps and structures to weaken his influence over the Wasteland.- The Magnum Opus can be customized with different weapons like flamethrowers or a ramming grill for example as well as improving things like wheels and engine. Which is great because the Magnum Opus feels more like your own vehicle than some generic vehicle. The vehicle combat in game is a lot of fun too.-The graphics in this game are great though you'll need a powerful rig to get them at their max. (No pun intended)Bad points: - This game has a lot of collectibles and you'll spend a lot of time gathering scrap to improve the Magnum Opus and Max.   This gets very repetitive and while i didnt mind it so much at first i was sick of it towards the end. Unfortunately since you need certain upgrades for some of the story missions it'sunavoidable to some extant.- The combat is similar to that of other WB games like the Arkham series and Shadow of Mordor. It does feel a bit too easy at times as it's just one button to attack and another to counter. There isnt much enemy variety either.The one thing i liked about the combat was how visceral and real it looks. Rather than fancy acrobatics or martial arts the fights look more like a pub brawl and just as brutal.While some might see the freedom to explore as you will with occasional story mission as a plus, i felt the game could have done with more structure as it would have helped it avoid becoming a repetitive experience. I have decided to recommend it because i did really enjoy the game for the first 15-20 hours and it still is a decent game overall. However if you cant stand loads of collectables and repetitive gameplay this might not be for you.			"

												Follow the story of our hero, Max, as he seeks revenge against the bandit clan leader who stole his life away.  Mad Max has a lot of entertaining and fun aspects, but also contains a lot of boring and repetitive actions.  The story is decent, the controls are good, the graphics are very beautiful, and the environment is very well done.  The gameplay is rather simple, and even without upgrading your character's abilities or gear you can do very well in a fight with minimal experience, but the true enjoyment of this game does not occur on foot, but in your car.  With your trusty mechanic and harpoon shooter in the back, you take the wheel and fight head to head against other drivers, often with tricks up their sleeves.  The car combat is very fun, and it's worth upgrading your ride to handle some of the difficult challenges that await you in the wasteland.  Overall I would recommend it if you can find it for less than $25, but I would not say that it is worth much more than that unless you enjoy exploring a vast and open wasteland picking up scrap metal for hours on end.  A scavenging location can yield anywhere from 2 pieces of scrap to 50, but you need thousands of scrap to get a few of the upgrades for your car, and that takes a lot of time to grind out.  TLDR: Overall, a good game, but be prepared for a lot of grinding if you want 100% completion on it.7.5/10			"

												First things first, this is a great game that's definitely worth a buy. Mad Max feels like a blend of Shadow of Mordor and Far Cry, and that's not a bad thing at all. The combat in Mad Max is the same as that of Mordor. You attack with the left mouse and block oncoming attacks with the right. You have battles in outposts (or camps) just like in Mordor. The game is also similar to Mordor and Far Cry in the way that you unlock what's in a region. You do this by climbing your way up to a ballon and assend and discover what's out there. The Graphics and Mad Max are very good, nothing amazing or groundbreaking but very good. They work well, actually the do look amazing when you get caught in a lightening storm, it's extremely immersive when that happens. The game is also very well optimised. I have everything on max and haven't experienced any lag, I'm getting a constant 60 FPS. The vehiculer combat is fun and very satisfying. You are able to ram cars to pieces at high speeds, you don't feel overpowered as you can easily be smashed to pieces as well. You have a few weapons you can use while driving to help you such as the harpoon, Max's trusty shotgun and thundersticks. The game makes you want to play it and collect scrap just to upgrage the Magnum Opus.			"

 Essential Purchase!	 Graphics	The graphics are just breathtaking. Every aspect of the graphics is perfectly done, and I could not ask for any better. The game runs flawlessly even on Ultra High settings. Every single detail is outstandingly created to fit the games storyline, and does the job. Overall, the graphics impressed me from the second I joined the game, and still continue to impress me as I am 10+ hours in. I have not yet found a single flaw about the graphics, and am positive it will stay that way. Graphics Rating - 10/10	 Gameplay / Storyline	The overall storyline/gameplay starts out as a bit confusing, but after just 10 minutes of playing the game, you WILL be completely hooked in. I am currently 12+ hours into the game, and I am not even close to being half way done yet, which is very impressive. The gameplay has tons of side missions, quests, extra levels, and such that you are able to complete while just forgetting about the main story line, which I do quite a bit. The cutscenes throughout this game are brilliant, extremely intriguing, and this game will keep you busy for 50+ hours. This is what I call well spent cash. Overall, I am loving this game.. go purchase it, right now. :) Gameplay/Storyline Rating - 9.3/10	 "

												It's kind of annoying that torque doesn't seem to be modeled properly.  Reverse gear is generally (always?) even lower than first, yet you can't tug heavy objects with the harpoon while backing up.  Unearthing a buried husk of a car is predictably slow, but the rear wheels aren't breaking traction and spinning hard--they're rotating very slowly as the motor doesn't rev up, yet succeeds in slowly pulling the chassis out of the ground.  I'm pretty sure that car doesn't have an ultra low crawler gear, or an engine capable of such low-end output.When these are the only complaints, you know you have a dope game on your hands.			"

												Absolutely brilliant. The gameplay is pristine, the game mechanics are great and the characters are astounding. I would highly recomend this game as i have had no faults with it whatsoever and ive now finished the game. The story line is compelling if not a little boring but the fighting definetely makes up for that. The combat is like something straight out of batman which would make sence. Even if you try to make a hard hit and someone is about to hit you, you wont be able to parry that attack and the wwe style moves are sooo good. There has been no lagging problems or glitches throughout the game. The upgrades are interesting and fun to use.			"

												Played it through, only things left are to get some cars I am missing from my collection and finish up some “death races” with full reward. This game is worth the coin as it gave me 50+ hours of game play easy. One thing is to make sure you nick as many cars as you can early on as they start to become harder to find as you clear a zone of its many nasty’s.			"

												Mad Max is an open world game with a near identical combat system to the Batman Arkham series.  IMO the seemingly ripped off combat isn't a bad thing because Arkham did it so well as does this game.The downside would have to be the repetitive quests and areas to attack.  While there is a visual difference in camps and areas, most missions come down to kill everybody in an area and loot something.  But there is still a slew of different missions to obtain.While the story itself isn't amazing, the mad max movies were never about story, just a man and his car, killing, and explosions, which this game has plenty of.There is a lot to keep you busy with tons of optional content as well as the ability to upgrade max and car stats and cosmetics for both as well as new abilities for max and the car.Overall the game seems like it is going to have tons of hours worth of content even if you don't go for a full clear making this well worth the 60 price and easily worth the sale price.2 hours or refund will be plenty of time to see if you like the game, and if you're a fan of Batman Arkham games or Mad Max you should enjoy this.

												After watching the movie, it made me appreciate the game even more. The details in the game are impressive especially the dynamic weather systems. The open sandbox environment is also spectacular and adds plenty of visual variety available in the world with little water. I love these kinds of quests where you would complete those scraps, insignia and stuff. I even completed the Mad Max trading cards as a bonus. Batman style combat also adds fun and those bone crunching effects makes me cringe. (all the time)I am pretty sure, they would release some DLC on this game as the map is too big and still has some areas where DLC can be squeezed in. (secret locations)On a downside, it gets repetitive on the scrap, sniper , camps, bomb disposal, and scarecrow missions. The price is a bit unforgiving too. I would suggest you purchase this off from the♥♥♥♥♥site for half the price. Or wait till steam offers a sale (50 - 80 % ) on this game.			"

												That was a damned fine game. No spoilers, but the story was fitting for the character and the end was suitably Max-ish, though not as challenging as I might have liked. The transition from console to PC is never an easy one, but this one was done quite well save for the vehicle steering mechanics, which you might have thought should have demanded more attention since so much time is spent driving. A few little language errors and a few too many non-Australian accents, but all in all a fine effort. 7/10			"

												I first played this on my friend's PS4, and I decided I had to buy it.My computer doesn't even meet minimum specifications for this game (AMD Phenom II X4 3.2 GHz, GeForce 560Ti), but it still ran at 60 FPS on default (high) settings until particle physics jumped into the game. I basically turned down particle physics and the game's running a solid 60 FPS again. Someone mentioned this is the same studio that made Just Cause, and JC2 ran at 60 FPS on a GT 430, so they must be doing something right.I really enjoy the vehicle customization aspect of the game, especially as it's basically an RPG progression. The combat feels pretty good, although sometimes you can't cancel your own moves to counter like in the Batman: Arkham series. Additionally, enemies will come at you much more quickly and you have to line up counters much faster than in Batman or Middle Earth series. It's much more challenging and I'm okay with this - it doesn't feel cheap like Sleeping Dogs feels from time to time.As far as things I don't care about, sometimes the pace of the fortresses/camps feels a little stilted - there'll be a lot of action, and then there'll be a lot of running around trying to find relics/scrap/symbols for 100% completion. I suppose if you're not a completionist this doesn't bother you.I really, really like the vehicular combat and I hope it gets more frenzied as I get into the later game. My car right now is decently equipped and it's still tough as hell - not to mention that the enemies do things I wouldn't really expect them to do which is cool.All in all, I highly recommend this game - if you love the Mad Max brand, buy this right now. If you like vehicular combat and levelling up your vehicle, buy it RIGHT NOW.EDIT AFTER MORE PLAY TIME:Gotten farther in the game, made it to Gas Town. Getting slightly annoyed at the V8 carrot being dangled in front of my face then yanked away repeatedly, but we'll get there... I can deal with the twin turbo V6 for now.Combat still holds up, though there are little ""dog-like"" enemies which have a nasty habit of attacking at a time when you cannot counter because you're already countering someone else.Action in the camps feels better after playing a bit more, and running around and figuring out where stuff's hidden gets a little easier as the game goes on. I also like the cast of this game a fair bit, except the drug addict you encounter later on - but I just met that character, so we'll see.A little disappointed in the way car combat goes occasionally, as recently I'm more or less ripping off rims. I do have a fair chunk of shotgun ammo but 9/10 times it's going into the tire. I'd like to see more bashing of the enemy cars.			"

												This is a fun game by Avalanche. It has all the aspects of an Avalance game: great optimization, fun gameplay, nonexistent laughable storyline, great graphics, intoxicated physics and LOOOOAAAADS of grind.Just like all their games, it does outstay it's welcome by constantly pushing you to be a competionist, whether it be to unlock upgrades that make certain missions less than insufferable, by constant reminders of everyone around you that you have to do these activities or just plain old UI pestering and game currency collection.While the brawling is good and has some amazing bone cracking sounds, the car combat is far from perfect. Your car - the Magnum Opus is incredibly squishy, regardless of whether you put armour on it or not (and armour makes the car nearly impossible to control well, so there is no reason to ever use it in my opinion) and while that would be fine under different circumstances, they decided it would be a great idea to add 2 more lifebars to enemy vehicles that block your harpoon attacks until you deplete them. Thing is: by the time you do deplete them 2 things happen: First their basic health is basically nothing, they will likely die in one hit or you can pull a wheel/driver off them.Second you will be dead bored by the time that happens (or just dead, if you ran out of rockets or physics sent you in a spin for no reason). In short: the best way to deal with enemies in vehciles is to stop the car and force them out into melee combat. That's not what you want for your car combat part.Otherwise it's a fun game and if you are a completionist who can endure the same tasks for many many hours to unlock everything, you will love this game, because it really REALLY wants you to do it and rewards you a lot for it. The question is: once you complete everything and there's nothing to do, what do you do with all these unlocked upgrades? I guess the devs didn't think about that.I recommend it based on production quality and mellee combat. The game does outstay it's welcome and I did rush the last 2 story missions without doing anything in-between because I couldn't be bothered (and not because of the story, please don't expect any good storyline from this game), but for the most part I enjoyed it's explosive ride across the prettiest of lifeless colourless, empty and monotonous deserts I have ever seen in a game to date.I also ate maggots from a corpse to replenish health. Just so you know: corpse fly maggots eat rotting flesh with bacteria happily festering inside. If you were to eat them, you'd most likely die within the next hour.			"

												This review is a bit biased as I'm a huge Mad Max fan.That said, this game is still amazing. Maybe you've read other reviews that say it's the most open world open world action adventure action adventure trope game. Yes, it's open world, yes, it's an action adventure game, but let me ask those reviewers one thing? How else would you have preferred a Mad Max game? The primary focus in Mad Max is vehicular combat across the vast open terrain of the wasteland. Yes, Max has free flow combat similar to other WB published games in the past few years, but he isn't Batman or the guy from Shadow of Mordor. Max is, to an extent, a regular ol' dude with some emotional issues pertaining to his past and the fact that he is a shell of his former self. Point is, Avalanche made the Mad Max game that Mad Max fans had always wanted; so f * * k the reviewers that say the game is repetitive or lacking. Have they even seen a Mad Max film? The stories aren't exactly as complex as Metal Gear Solid, which I think is another reason why Mad Max is being overlooked, the fact that MGSV came out the same day. The Mad Max stories are rather simple with an even simpler context, global economic crisises and nuclear warfare.Now that I got my little rant out of the way, I can actually talk about the game. Max is driving his beloved Interceptor through the Wasteland, trying to reach the Plains of Silence in hopes of finding a more civilized society. Unfortunately, Scaborous Scrotus, son of Immortan Joe, succeeds in vehicular combat with his mighty Land Mower and Max is forced to jump out, ending up fighting Scrotus himself. After apparently killing Scrotus, Max finds himself somewhere unknown and befriends Scrotus' dog. Together, they find Chumbucket, a hunchback mechanic. This is where the story really takes off as Chum and Max plot to build a Magnum Opus, a car better, stronger, and superior in each way to the Interceptor. Chum and Max travel throughout the Wasteland, assisting faction leaders and progressing throughout the story to upgrade car parts and Max's own gear. The story is actually more interesting than just that, but I don't wanna spoil it.Gameplay, as noted in my rant earlier, is similar to recent action adventure games. Besides comparing it to recent WB games, I could also compare it to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, as you invade camps (Forts) and complete a primary objective in order to take control of it where your allies will then be there. Also the strongholds where you meet various ""community"" leaders. You do favors for these leaders (i.e. side missions that actually have plot) and are then able to upgrade these strongholds by collecting project parts at various scavenging locations or camps scattered throughout the wasteland. These locations could be massive forts or hidden caves, or underground passages below a hatch. There is so much to do in this game, it can actually be overwhelming. Anyway, I wanna focus on the vehicular combat gameplay, I shouldn't have to explain what action adventure is. Vehicular combat is pretty rare in modern games, so having vehicle combat in Mad Max was astounding. You can use side burners, t-bone or rail cars head on, use a harpoon to rip off doors and tires and bumpers, or the thunderpoon to blow stuff up. And then the beloved shotgun, which can be used for a variety of things while driving. Not to mention that much of this will be occurring at high speeds. Basically, Avalanche did a splendid job with the vehicular combat.Graphics; jeez. I could tell you about how great and stunning the graphics are, because they are. But I won't bore you with that, instead, I just want to mention that this game is clearly set sometime after Thunderdome as there is sand practically everywhere. In the first two films, we got to see a side of Australia comparable to Arizona where there was a lot of small cacti life and dry ground. But man, Thunderdome really struck home field with the sand. And so does this game. The sand is awesome. Your tires leave imprints, as do your feet, whether driving or running along, on top of it. The vibrant skies are perfect. Graphics.Let me also just add that there are side quests in this game that are not just fetch quests. They might seem menial and menial side quests have become a modern thing to complain about since I guess The Witcher 3 perfected the side quest formula. But here, in Mad Max, the side quests actually lead to upgrades and are integral to the character's leveling system. You'll get more griffa points which can be used to upgrade Max's stats. Plus several of the side quests actually have stories to them, as you'll learn with Hope and Glory who later become a main point to the main story.Ending on that, Mad Max turned out to be a great great game that will be overlooked at the end of the year due to being shadowed by the release of MGSV and not being Mad Max: Furty Road The Game. It's just Mad Max, a game. It's its own thing, and works well as its own thing (although it does lead well into Fury Road except for a few minor details).9.1/10			"

												Short version: Excellent sandbox game that is faithful to the atmosphere of Mad Max Fury Road.  Interstate '76 + GTAV.Playtime: ~60 hours to finish the storyline (but I had done every side mission, every scavenge location, collected all the historical relics, lowered the threat to zero in every area, and had almost every achievement and probably 95% of the legend challenges done.  I was a level ~120 Road Warrior).  I'll likely play a bit more to unlock the last few achievements.I normally avoid movie tie-ins like the plague, but I took a chance based on great reviews and a love for this style of game.  It reminded me a lot of Interstate '76 - desert car wars, upgrading your car with better weapons and armor, scavenging for parts among the defeated enemies, and so on.  The basic premise is similar to all of the Mad Max movies.  Max loses his family or car and is forced to help out a bunch of people before he can continue on his journey alone.  After losing your Interceptor in the opening scene, you spend the game scrounging for scrap to build a new car with the help of a mechanic that rides along with you. This allows him to repair and upgrade on the fly, so dying is pretty easy to avoid.  If your car becomes too damaged, you have to exit the vehicle while the mechanic puts out the fires.  Since you usually have enemies in vehicles around you, it's a matter of dodging them, shooting out tires/gas tanks if you have some (scarce) ammo, or getting them to get out of their vehicles to fight hand to hand.The combat system is a page right out of the recent Batman games - punches and kicks paired with parry/counters.  You chain hits together to fill your Fury meter which allows you to hit harder.  As you progress, you can unlock new finishing moves that can be ground attacks, using your shotgun or a shiv to instant-kill, or using the environment to finish them off.In addition to being able to unlock new clothes (armor and melee power), shotgun upgrades, and your ammo belt capacity, you can also unlock upgrades to customize your appearance.  Similar upgrades and can be purchased and earned for your car - better armor, better tires, etc.Starting out, you'll find that food and water is pretty scarce, and they're the only way to replenish health.  For that reason, the early part of the game is a bit tough when find yourself outnumbered.  However, this is an open-world wasteland, so you can leave the storyline idle while you seek out various tasks to do that will allow you to complete objectives and tasks that will earn you both scrap metal (the in-game currency for all upgrades) as well as tokens that you use with a wandering mystic.  This mystic will allow you to upgrade your health bar, your ability to scavenge, your skill with melee and weapons, and more.  As you visit strongholds and complete improvement tasks for the leaders there, the game becomes exponentially easier.  You'll be able to set up food and water sources, create crews that pick up the scrap left behind when you destroy an enemy vehicle (so you don't have to stop), a crew that scouts all the scavenging locations in the area, a crew that gathers scrap while you're offline, and an armory that fills your ammo belt.  All of this plus the scrap you earn from dismantling enemy camps and populating them with allies makes your life a lot easier..  You can add cars to your collection by stealing them from enemies or by winning races in the numerous ""Death Run"" races scattered throughout the map and then driving them to a stronghold.This leads to the one drawback - because the game has so many things you can do, it is very easy to out-level the story.  For example, I was about 3/4ths of the way through the storyline and had to do a race.  The race leader turns me away saying I can't race in the heap I'm driving.  I'm given an objective to come back after I upgrade to make the car faster.  The problem was that I had already unlocked and purchased every upgrade available, so I ended up having to downgrade my car in order to compete. Later when I finally got the V8 Engine in the storyline, I had enough scrap to immediately buy every upgrade for it. Huge fights near the end of the game were much easier with every melee, armor, and ground combat ability unlocked.  They should have scaled the enemies with the player level.Customizing your car is something you'll do a lot - you can upgrade bumpers, armor, spikes (to keep people from jumping on your car), spiked wheels for grinding against other cars, suspension and lift kits, and so on.  Some have trade-offs (better armor makes you slower and have worse handling) and some tires are good on sand, others on asphalt, but the rest just get better with each upgrade.  The main reason they have all the variation is that you can select a ready-made builds called an Arch Angels.  Each requires certain types of each component, so as you progress through the game you'll be able to make more varieties of them.  There are in-game legend achievements to complete that are specific to some of the builds.Lastly, once the game ends you are back in the wasteland and basically have free play to do things you missed.  As I said, I had already cleared the camps, the scavenge locations, etc so I've got just a few achievements to get for racing in the Death Runs.			"

												After watching Mad Max: Fury Road for the first time, I left the theater with a great desire to play a Mad Max video game.  Unfortunately, this game wasn't out yet.  So I looked for substitutes, none of which scratched that itch completely.Fallout: New Vegas?  It certainly has the ""survive in a post-apocalyptic world"" element, but there are no vehicles to drive, plus the pace of the game certainly isn't frenetic like the Mad Max movies.Rage?  The game definitely has the ""drive powerful death machines through a desert wasteland"" feel, but it has none of the survival elements.  Plus the game is surprisingly short; you can beat it over one or two weekends, which I did years ago.So I was left with no game that could fulfill this need.Now that Mad Max is out, I have exactly what I was looking for.  Fast-paced vehicular carnage?  Check.  Brutal, hand-to-hand combat against desert-dwelling degenerates?  Check.  Playing a character that has to struggle to survive in a post-apocalyptic world while simultaneously struggling with his own sanity?  Sure, there's some of that, too.  Forgive me for stating the obvious, but nothing captures the feel of the Mad Max movies better than the Mad Max video game.  Who'da thunk it!?!?Perhaps my favorite thing about Mad Max is the amount of detail and respect the developers paid to the source material.  This game was clearly made by folks who understand and love the Mad Max world and mythos.  While playing this game, I'm reminded of Rocksteady's Batman: Arkham Asylum games, which were also chock full of details that fans of the source material should appreciate.TL;DR: If you like the Mad Max movies, it's highly likely that you'll like this game, too.

												This is one of the best mediocre games I have played in a long time. It really doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table in terms of game-play and mechanics. It has a lot of grind to it for completionists. It's just not that special.HOWEVER, it absolutely nails the mayhem and insanity of the universe portrayed by the Mad Max movies, especially (and obviously) Fury Road. Do you want to play a Mad Max movie? Do you want to explore that world a bit and see more of the wastelands? Do you want to crash, blow up, grind, and otherwise wreck a lot of cars? Then I think you'll enjoy the hell out of this game. It does all that and it is gorgeous while doing so. The game runs incredibly smooth, and though it almost feels like a console game meant for being played with a controller, I found I preferred playing it with keyboard and mouse (I feel the same way about the Arkham games). 8/10. Most mediocre games are just mediocre. This one is fun as hell. :)			"

Additionally, the graphics are fantastic and performance of the game is excellent on hardware that isn't the absolute latest and greatest.If you can get it on sale or as part of the current Humble Bundle monthly subscription then this is an absolute no-brainer.

PresentationReleased only a few months after the movie franchise reboot ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", Mad Max isn't just another one of those movie-adaptation video games to follow the same background and story, but instead it takes inspiration from the entire movie franchise to create a unique experience, as the game is more like prequel to Fury Road, introducing you to the world of Max Mad without the need for any prior knowledge about the series. Mad Max aims for a story about a pointless existence of murder and regret, which does have its moments in situations where your actions will end up messing up other people's lives as well as your own, but just like many other games of its kind the stories that will stay with you afterwards are the ones you make yourself on the road to the finale. The story follows Max, who is once again left with nothing after Scabrous Scrotus took his car, on his journey for revenge accompanied by Chumbucket, a lonely blackfinger whose only goal is to build to ultimate ride. Along this journey you will meet all different kinds of insane people, starting with the Stronghold leaders, which will give you different side quests to complete across the wasteland and ending with all the stranger encounters that will sometimes give you scrap as a token of their gratitude for your fight against Lord Scrotus or useful information to help you take over a camp, such as the location of a secret entrance or different weaknesses in the structure that you can take advantage of. The story missions are only a small part of what Mad Max has to offer, as there are plenty of things to distract you along the way and on that side of things, the game gives you plenty of things to do to spice up your adventures, with camps to take over, scavenging locations to complete and many more; the order in which you complete those is totally up to you and completing different activities along the way is what makes Mad Max an enjoyable experience, even when it does come with its flaws.Rating: 9GameplayIf you have played some of the major open world games released in the past year such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, you will most likely find similarities in Mad Max's gameplay mechanics. On foot, the main combat element is brawling, as you will use simple attack and counter attack movements to defeat various types of enemies along the way, as the only weapon in your arsenal while on foot is your loyal shotgun, which does have limited ammo, so using it carefully between punches to defeat a more dangerous enemy approaching you is key. Driving your Magnum Opus things change, as the ultimate goal is upgrading your car to make it the best ride across the wastelands, as you will unlock new car bodies, engines, suspensions and many more customizable elements; with that being said, your Magnum Opus is equipped with a Harpoon that can be used to drag and pull different objects or structures, as well as a Thunderpoon and Side Burners. In addition to the weapons that can be attached to the Magnum Opus, the car itself can be used as a weapon, as different upgrades such as Boarder Spikes, Armour or Boost will come in handy if you want to be more aggressive and slam into other vehicles. While the main missions will give you an idea of how harsh the world of Mad Max is and introduce you to different elements of the game, the best way to experience what Mad Max has to offer is by going out to explore the different events and locations on your own, as there are numerous races to complete, camps to take over and scavenging locations filled with scrap and upgrade parts for your projects in the Strongholds. As large in scale as it is, Mad Max feels really limited when it comes to movement freedom, as you will often head for a cliff that looks easy to reach only to find out that there is no way for you to get there, as the movement mechanic only allows you to climb marked locations. On top of that, the game does come with the occasional bugs and glitches, but those are minor enough not to influence your experience too much.Rating; 8GraphicsFor a deserted wasteland, the world of Mad Max is quite beautiful in its own gloomy way, with detailed locations and memorable places; contributing to that world are the insane characters you will meet along the way, each with its unique personality and level of madness. The weather effects have a significant impact on the world, as nights will make the desert look even more lonely and storms will reduce the visibility to a point where looking ahead of you will become your main objective. Animations can be a bit clunky at times and there are some texture popping issues, the number of them varying from one platform to another, but those are only minor issues that barely distract you from the massive world that lies ahead of you.Rating: 8AudioBren Foster is the voice of Max and does a great job narrating every dramatic moment of Max's adventures, accompanied by other noted actors such as Travis Willingham voicing Lord Scrotus and Jason Spisak providing the voice of Chumbucket. The sound effects are okay and even though they can feel a bit repetitive at times, there is enough variety in action to make sounds feel distinct and take you on an emotional ride from one dramatic moment to the next one and straight back into the chaotic action afterwards.Rating: 8.5ExtrasYou can probably finish the story within 15 hours if you go straight forward from one mission to the next one and complete only what is necessary, but with so many things around you that will probably not be the case, so with all the races, camps and locations to explore you can easily spend 50 hours with Mad Max, add even more if you're willing to complete every challenge.Rating: 9.5VerdictMad Max is an excellent open world adventure no matter if you're a fan of the movies or not, as the game does a great job introducing you to the world of the franchise and tell you an interesting story without sacrificing too much on the fun, chaotic gameplay that will keep you hooked for hours. If you want a game to keep you preoccupied for a long period of time, Mad Max is definitely a must try as it provides more than enough content and variety to entertaining you for a couple of days.Rating Overall: 8.6Check out the full review and a lot more about Mad Max at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=371 "

												Mad Max just as fury road took me by surprise, as I have just like many on the day of release picked up Metal Gear Solid 5; however, that was a grave mistake. Metal Gear Solid 5 is really something special but it does not outshine the diamond in the rough that is Mad Max. Mad Max is a game drive by two game play style first the weaker of the two is the hand to hand combat which is very similar to the Batman Arkham games, but lacking all the recent upgrades those games have gotten and resembling more of the first game. I find it simple fun and easy to play especially using the mouse and keyboard. Where this game shines more is the driving combat which start with the feel of driving. Driving in this game is very solid and has a vibe of ""Driver"" from the original PlayStation. The games driving has this heavy feeling to it, and you really feel the weight behind all the impact. The road rage combat is great and very creative in how many different ways you can take out your enemies while on 4 wheels.A lot of Mad Max roots seem to stem from other games from the past from its combat to exploration. This game has a very late 90's feeling from the sense of the collecta thon lists. This game is riddled with check boxes and areas to complete and collect 100% to clear these areas, so the OCD in any of us will be very happy. However, this does more than just feed the hunger of ones OCD, but encourages progression within the game. You are always rewarded and progress is constantly made. Performance is a big deal now of days with gaming, and I am happy to report that this games runs very very well on my gaming laptop and PC. While both my stations are on the high end spectrum I did notice that everything ran smooth and no bugs to report. The game launches with out any issues, updated, and performance was rock solid. The visual fidelity is great and reminded me again of another game which was RAGE by it. Rage was a very similar game sadly it focused more on the technology than the gameplay where this game does the opposite luckily. Sound is great the music and ambient noise suites the game just right, and the voice overs while disturbing were all a pleasure to listen to and hear more about this world.Overall this is very much a must play game; needless to say I am sure most of us have other things on the burner right now. However, see to make some time to visit the world of Mad Max and you will be rewarded for yoru time and patience with it. The game is a fun, simple, and can be picked up when ever you feel like it.

												I dont normally bother writing anything about a game but every review ive read in a magazine so far hated this game yet I absolutely loved it and couldnt put it down which doesnt happen often i actually liked it more than wb games previous game shadow of mordor which had a much higher rating. But like every wb game it felt very much like the last and the last felt very much like assassins creed ie batmanssains creed, lord of the rings orcssasins creed and now mad maxssasins creed except max cant climb at all.. the level design was the most barron ive ever seen in a game as you would probably expect seeing as its set on a dried up ocean floor yet the little pockets of civilization  built from wood crates, Downed aircraft, beached ships and old high ways and subways always were interesting and got the imagination going two fold which I loved and always took the time to look around and take it in before i got max to murder everyone in the general vacinity.. one massive down fall for mad max though is the general repetition when it comes to clearing areas "" which you dont have to do they're more of a side mission sort of deal but progression through the game is slightly haultered if you dont"""" especially clearing the mine feilds which felt tedious but the story and most of the side missions were really good and kept me interested and full of action unfortunately i had to stop playing mad max right near the end because fallout4 come along so madmax ""and my misses"" got kicked to the curb but i do plan going back to madmax ""not to the misses"". anyways i could go on for pages and pages about this game essentially its really cheap, great graphics,  action plus and most of the time interesting and a great button smasher 8/10			"

												A solid 9/10 for me. Delivered (almost) everything I wanted from a Mad Max game. Pros: -	Super pretty skyline and environment (even if it is a lot of… wasteland, they did a bang up job making it something worth looking at)-	Hand to hand Combat is solid (Arkham styled if you didn’t know already, but don’t fix what isn’t broken and that system is good to begin with)-	Car combat is intense, satisfying, and cinematic. I especially loved taking out convoys!-	Upgrading the toggling the Magnum Opus (Max’s car) offers lots of options to fit your needs-	Exploring the wasteland and what it had to offer was genuinely fun (to me), and collecting History Relics offers a glimpse into how things used to be prior to the world descending into madness, diving into the Mad Max lore and world-	Raiding camps felt awesome, particularly breaking in by destroying the camp’s defenses.-	Collecting things outside the car made the wasteland much more terrifying. This is something I see listed as a negative a lot, having to get out of the car and manually collect scraps and such things, but I appreciated it. It was a risk getting out of the car to collect that stuff, knowing a War Boy party could be just over the horizon-	The story makes for an excellent prequel to the 2015 film, even if they’re not officially (source needed?) linked by any means-	Chum Bucket-	The desert storms were legitimately terrifying, both in appearance (hard as hell to navigate do to SAND and lightning strikes) and in sound (roaring winds)-	LOTS of stuff to do. I dumped nearly 60 hours into the game clearing regions of threats and doing the main story. That doesn’t even include all the side stuff you can do. Cons:-	Water, food, and gasoline hardly matter much. Ideally, the theme of it being a harsh wasteland should be felt more strongly through the scarcity of such things, but they’re easy to come by even early on in the game and only become more common to the point of being irrelevant later-	Getting hit by a car or a boss? Pshaw. Bring it on. Getting punched by a War Boy? OW FUDGE THAT HURTS.-	Second to last final boss difficulty was insane. Final boss was way too easy (cool, but easy).-      Top Dog ""bosses"" could use more variety-	Thunderpoon makes car combat WAY too easy toward the end game.-	Searching for Insignias and Scrap piles within a location, camps in particular, could be one of the most obnoxious chores at times-	Crow Dazzle’s noise wagon-	Disarming Minefields was an overly tedious chore that required the use of Chum Bucket’s MEDIOCRE buggy and the dog’s (annoying) barking-	Auto aim of the sniper rifle. I could not for the life of me figure out how to turn it off. Granted I didn’t google it, so there might be a way. If there is, then ignore this.Overall for me, it’s a great game. Not GOTY material in my opinion, but an incredible game for those wanting to delve into the Wastelands of Max’s world and experience it for themselves or even a fan of sandbox style games. "

												When i saw the waving flames of the car i just destroyed as the sun was setting behind the wasteland dunes, something moved inside me. When i caught into a sandstorm, i knew it was love at first sight.If you want to play a game with a vast open world (do not expect many changes of scenery. Its a wasteland), car chasing, scavenging (yep, maggots are back on the menu boys), car upgrading and brutal fighting (batman fighting gameplay) this game is for you. Honestly, the way car reacts on the sand, the sound of the engines, everything is wonderful. The way the scenery changes inside a sandstorm, is something that you have never encountered before. In general what do you do in the game now (in case you wonder)1) you scavenge small camps and abandoned vehicles like ships (i guess there was a sea over there) and you also find relics of another time that reminds you how it was once, and they really add to the feeling2)Destroy larger camps with enemies. 3)Destroy big camps where you have to beat the local boss of the area4)participate in death races (while in open world, you can steal other cars in order to use them in these races)5)Help helpless people by giving them water, in exchange for information6) as you cross the wasteland, random gangs will attack you, or an enemy convoy will pass, that you could attack and destroy in order to gain materials and  parts.7) Game has soft borders. Means that there isn't any invinsible wall that will tell you ""its over"". Want to drive into nothingness? Go ahead. More wasteland for you. You might find something useful, or you can die there. And yes, you can find something useful outside of the map. Well done Avalanche!8)I almost forgot. Enemies in cars are not stupid. If they see they loose, they will run away. Its surviving afterl all is it not?Want to know the best part? I play this game for 7 hours and i haven't even unlock the half of the map. I am just inside a tiny part of it. Do you like the concept of Mad Max? Buy it.			"

												Mad Max is a completely competent open-world action game with a story that is  short and shallow, but very Mad Max.Mad Max ticks all the open-world action check boxes. You destroy towers (scarecrows) and take over forts to gain influence in each region. You fight against other factions in a Batman-light-style hand to hand combat and an excellent vehicle-combat that includes harpoons, thunderpoons, flame-throwers, depth-charges, ramming bars, boarding spikes, and wheel-shredders.In addition to playing through main missions (of which there are only a handful - really, by the time you realize there is a narrative, the story is in its last few missions), there are a lot of side missions that you will run for various demented characters throughout the wastelands.The game is beautiful. It also performs very well, showing what you can accomplish when you put effort into your platform optimization. On an i7-4790k with 16GB RAM and NVIDIA GTX 970 SLI system, we see consistent framerates in excess of 140fps at 1920x1080. Even with almost every setting maxed-out and while doing a live streaming session (usually disastrous for framerate on an SLI system due to the way streaming applications capture frames), we hit well-above 100fps.Other than a shallow and fairly short story, Mad Max doesn't suffer any great failures on any one aspect. Yet, it does not quite seem to be greater than the sum of its parts. It is very entertaining. It has a lot of thoroughly enjoyable aspects, of which vehicle combat is probably the best. But it is also wears out its welcome, by the end. You've eventually had enough sand, screaming crazies running at you, and flame-shooting cars side-ramming you. You've had enough scrap collecting and busy-work -- which this game is riddled with. It is competent; not groundbreaking.But this should not be a bad thing. And it also does help us to understand why the reviews have been all over the place for this title. It isn't mind-blowing, but it isn't bad. I bought this game for just over half price, just before launch. Due to the discounts we saw everywhere, I was certain they were trying to dump the game while they could and had low expectations. Instead, I found a thoroughly good game for which I have no quarrel having paid half price. At full AAA launch price? Well, I'm not sure it would quite have lived up to that . . . but I wouldn't be disgruntled over it. I would be interested in a sequel to this title, if they make one. They have a solid foundation, here.It is difficult for me to say that I do or do not recommend this game. I enjoyed it and feel it was worth what I paid for it. I would not be upset, but perhaps a little disappointed, if I'd paid full price. So, ultimately, I'd have to suggest that if you are a huge Mad Max fan and you can't stop playing open-world games, it may be worth full price. If you just love Mad Max or just love open-world games, then pick it up for half price and you'll probably be very satisfied and surprised.Below is the first of a nine part 31hr live-stream playthrough of Mad Max:

												Mad Max is one of my favorite film series, and this game really feels like Mad Max to me.  There is plenty of stuff to do although it gets really repetitive really fast.  You spend most of your time grinding for scrap for the numerous upgrades for your car as well as Max himself,  these come in the form of demolishing enemy camps, searching old wrecks and buildings, clearing minefields, etc.  The story is good but short and it forces you to complete a lot of these scrap grinds in order to upgrade enough to advance.  The melee combat feels a lot like the Batman games, and the whole game plays a lot like Shadow of Mordor.  The game is really repetitive with it's tasks but it is very satisfying driving around in your overloaded car getting into road battles and fist fights.  I would highly recommend it for fans of Mad Max but I could see how some people would get bored with it easily.			"

												It is quite ironic that the game which everyone was expecting to fail miserably, ends up being the ""Surprise of the Year."" Of all the WB games that were released on the PC this year, only Mad Max didn't crash and burn in terms of performance. The game's well-optimized state is a huge contrast to the Arkham Knight disaster. As a game, Mad Max succeeds in doing what the devs (Avalanche) and distributor (WB) set out to do, which is to recreate the Mad Max experience in a video game. And boy they did. The car combat in Mad Max is fantastic and the foot combat, while it looks like a cheap copy of the combat you see in the Batman: Arkham series manages to hold it's own well enough. Every time you see Max break someone's arm or German Suplex him into the sand, you can almost feel it. While there isn't much variety in terms of enemies and the gameplay does get rather repetitive after a while, you're still guaranteed to have one hell of a time.Surprisingly, Mad Max The Game does have a decent story. While it's pretty straightforward, you do find yourself caring for a few characters including the ever-spouting nonsense Chumbucket. Which makes the ending even worse. Most players aren't happy with Mad Max's ending and when you finally played till there, you'll know why. But I won't spoil it, it's something players have to experience for themselves but I can say it's very very typical of a Mad Max story.If there's anything I dislike about the game, it's that the open-world is way too bland. You'd be expecting something like the Fallout series, considering the post-apocalyptic setting but the world design is just vast and empty. You'll find a few tiny camps here and there, then there's the bigger camps where you carry out objectives and get more scrap, upgrades and blueprints to upgrade the strongholds of the allies you'll meet on Max's story. But, that's all. There's nothing really exciting to find in this world.Mad Max is a game to pick up if you're one for intense car combat and plenty of driving. If you're the type that complains about driving too much in a game like GTA for example, then this is not the game for you. If it's up your alley, try playing it in first-person mode. It's difficult but it makes for a very interesting experience as well. Mad Max is no GOTY contender but it's a solid game through and through.			"

												If I was to describe this game it would be like playing Shadow of Mordor but it was in a wasteland demolition derby starring Mad Max! The reason I say its like playing Shadow of Mordor is because both games were made by Warner Bros. games. You can see the similarities between the two mostly just by the type of game it is. What I mean by that is both games have a map divided into regions that you can conquer, the combat in both games are VERY similar and fluid (What I liked most from Shadow of Mordor), and its an open world to explore with alot of enemies. But that is where the similarities end. Mad Max is a COMPLETELY different game far and beyond.+The Map is VERY large in Mad Max and you can expect to finish the main questline in probably about 30+ hours of playing but it depends whether you clear regions out or do alot of side missions too+Combat on the ground is similar to Shadow of Mordor except instead of a sword you have FISTS! But you do also have other things like melee weapons you can pick up, your shotgun, Shivs, and the use of the enviornment which can be quite ""explosive""+Car Combat is extremely exciting and challenging especially when you haven't gotten all the high-end upgrades for the Magnum Opus yet+The Upgrades for both Max and especially the Magnum Opus are very satisfying and cool to put on+The story was very enjoyable and trilling as you moved deeper into the wastes+Very well optimized for PC+/-The amount of lootable areas in the game was a bit overwhelming to me especially since alot of places are minor and have 1 or 2 boxes in them which made it so it almost isn't worth the time to go and get them. However, no place is same so if achievement hunting or exploring is your thing it's not bad+/-I wasn't fond of the many death races you can do all over the map, compared to doing the story, side missions, or getting map control it never appealed to me. But it is an extra and its there. I know some people who would enjoy doing themI would highly recommend this game and I would gladly pay the asking price for this game. No regrets. I bought both fallout 4 and Mad Max at the same time and I beat Mad Max before I got very far in Fallout 4 so theres that.			"

												This game is fantastic.I never played 72 hours in a single player game. I enjoyed every little second what i spent  here.Does not matter you are a casual gamer , hardcore gamer or between two recommended to everyone ! FULLY WORTH IT !                                                                                                                                                    10/10(That was my one of the best 72 hours in my gamer life.)

												Mad Max is a completely competent open-world action game with a story that is  short and shallow, but very Mad Max.Mad Max ticks all the open-world action check boxes. You destroy towers (scarecrows) and take over forts to gain influence in each region. You fight against other factions in a Batman-light-style hand to hand combat and an excellent vehicle-combat that includes harpoons, thunderpoons, flame-throwers, depth-charges, ramming bars, boarding spikes, and wheel-shredders.In addition to playing through main missions (of which there are only a handful - really, by the time you realize there is a narrative, the story is in its last few missions), there are a lot of side missions that you will run for various demented characters throughout the wastelands.The game is beautiful. It also performs very well, showing what you can accomplish when you put effort into your platform optimization. On an i7-4790k with 16GB RAM and NVIDIA GTX 970 SLI system, we see consistent framerates in excess of 140fps at 1920x1080. Even with almost every setting maxed-out and while doing a live streaming session (usually disastrous for framerate on an SLI system due to the way streaming applications capture frames), we hit well-above 100fps.Other than a shallow and fairly short story, Mad Max doesn't suffer any great failures on any one aspect. Yet, it does not quite seem to be greater than the sum of its parts. It is very entertaining. It has a lot of thoroughly enjoyable aspects, of which vehicle combat is probably the best. But it is also wears out its welcome, by the end. You've eventually had enough sand, screaming crazies running at you, and flame-shooting cars side-ramming you. You've had enough scrap collecting and busy-work -- which this game is riddled with. It is competent; not groundbreaking.But this should not be a bad thing. And it also does help us to understand why the reviews have been all over the place for this title. It isn't mind-blowing, but it isn't bad. I bought this game for just over half price, just before launch. Due to the discounts we saw everywhere, I was certain they were trying to dump the game while they could and had low expectations. Instead, I found a thoroughly good game for which I have no quarrel having paid half price. At full AAA launch price? Well, I'm not sure it would quite have lived up to that . . . but I wouldn't be disgruntled over it. I would be interested in a sequel to this title, if they make one. They have a solid foundation, here.It is difficult for me to say that I do or do not recommend this game. I enjoyed it and feel it was worth what I paid for it. I would not be upset, but perhaps a little disappointed, if I'd paid full price. So, ultimately, I'd have to suggest that if you are a huge Mad Max fan and you can't stop playing open-world games, it may be worth full price. If you just love Mad Max or just love open-world games, then pick it up for half price and you'll probably be very satisfied and surprised.Below is the first of a nine part 31hr live-stream playthrough of Mad Max:

												I thought I wasn't going to be able to run it, but turns out it's very well optimized. What an amazing game! It can become a bit repetitive if you do all the side stuff, but it's a lot of fun. The story is great and the final boss is awesome.			"

												It is quite ironic that the game which everyone was expecting to fail miserably, ends up being the ""Surprise of the Year."" Of all the WB games that were released on the PC this year, only Mad Max didn't crash and burn in terms of performance. The game's well-optimized state is a huge contrast to the Arkham Knight disaster. As a game, Mad Max succeeds in doing what the devs (Avalanche) and distributor (WB) set out to do, which is to recreate the Mad Max experience in a video game. And boy they did. The car combat in Mad Max is fantastic and the foot combat, while it looks like a cheap copy of the combat you see in the Batman: Arkham series manages to hold it's own well enough. Every time you see Max break someone's arm or German Suplex him into the sand, you can almost feel it. While there isn't much variety in terms of enemies and the gameplay does get rather repetitive after a while, you're still guaranteed to have one hell of a time.Surprisingly, Mad Max The Game does have a decent story. While it's pretty straightforward, you do find yourself caring for a few characters including the ever-spouting nonsense Chumbucket. Which makes the ending even worse. Most players aren't happy with Mad Max's ending and when you finally played till there, you'll know why. But I won't spoil it, it's something players have to experience for themselves but I can say it's very very typical of a Mad Max story.If there's anything I dislike about the game, it's that the open-world is way too bland. You'd be expecting something like the Fallout series, considering the post-apocalyptic setting but the world design is just vast and empty. You'll find a few tiny camps here and there, then there's the bigger camps where you carry out objectives and get more scrap, upgrades and blueprints to upgrade the strongholds of the allies you'll meet on Max's story. But, that's all. There's nothing really exciting to find in this world.Mad Max is a game to pick up if you're one for intense car combat and plenty of driving. If you're the type that complains about driving too much in a game like GTA for example, then this is not the game for you. If it's up your alley, try playing it in first-person mode. It's difficult but it makes for a very interesting experience as well. Mad Max is no GOTY contender but it's a solid game through and through.			"

												Mad max is another massive open world game full of loads of different tasks to complete...So Firstly let me start this review off by saying that this game is VERY well optimised and for me personally it runs at 40fps on my over clocked 3 year old laptop. So Thank you whoever made this for not leaving us pc gamers out of the equation.The Story in Mad max is pretty bland as you might expect, if you are interested in what little one it is then here is a brief explanation for you- Max gets his Precious Car stolen by a Bad guy named Scrotus- You meet a guy called Chumbucket who makes cars and parts with scrap-You team up and over time build yourself up to get Revenge on Scrotus.Okay thats enough of the story... Go play it for yourself if you want to find out more :DThe graphics are outstanding on this game and it is easily one of the best looking games I have ever seen especially when the sandstorms come into play.The campaign will take on average around 15-20 hours to complete excluding the side missions and it was also very fun to play but others may say that it gets a bit repettive with all of the driving and fighting you have to do.The world like I said at the start of this review is full of things to see and do. The attention to detail on this game is unlike no other I have seen this year.My downsides would be that all of the boss battles are pretty much identical with the mehods you need to kill them which is pretty sad because I like a bit more variation with these things. When playing them it reminded me a hell of a lot like the Wolf boss battles in the Order 1886 which is not a good thing in my book.Another downside is the extremely bland fighting controls, All you have is punch, block and a couple other ""special moves"".My final downside would be to do with the extremely bland ending which I will not spoil here.Overall, Since this game is on sale it is a must buy!My rating is a 8/10UPDATE 1- Have a look at my Profile for some screenshots :DUPDATE 2- I recommend installing Windows 10 as it gave the game a 3fps boost for me :D			"

												Down right one of the most gorgeous games in existence today. Gameplay is a mix of Arkham Asylum with mostly Shadows of Mordor plus Twisted Metal/Burnout - all set in a Fallout esque open world that is true to whats portrayed in the films, especially the most recent one.. The vehicle combat is a blast, the hand to hand is visceral, the story is compelling if sometimes a bit schitck-y. It offers an interesting plunge into a contemporary story with the film Mad Max: Fury Road. If you love the movie, and love action rpg games, and love beautiful open worlds, you have to play this. It is an absolute steal when on sale. There are a few bugs, but sometimes its seriously the most beautiful game I've played. The visuals and art art style are unreal, and it keeps that abstract yet intense feeling from the  Fury Road. A must play for genere of film fans. About 60 hours start to finish completing 90% or so of all side content. 8.7/10			"

												With several hours in the wasteland I must said that I'm very happy with this game. I had low spectactions after the Warner/Batman fiasco but Avalanche did it's work in this title. Really smooth gameplay (I have lower than recommended specs and with everything maxed out I'm getting 60 FPS almost all the time).The game is similar to Just Cause Series on witch kind of thing we're able to do in this open-postapocalyptic-world, a lot of useful things to collect, plenty customization of Max, his weapons and his vehicles and a really polished hand-to-hand and vehicle combat.If you're a fan of Max's World or open world Just Cause style is a must-buy.

												Highly recommended!!I purchased the game six days ago, during the Steam Winter sale, having no expectations whatsoever. The game literally popped up on my main screen and I thought to myself ""Why the hell not"". Six days later I can only say that this is one of, if not - the best game purchases I've ever made!  The game mechanics and progression are really well made. It felt very natural to me - seamless and flowing. It might not be as charming for some people due to the kind of repetitive game style (doing the same things over and over) but for me this is the first game in a while that just made me sit down, let go off everything else and just finish it. Even more so, I felt compelled to complete as much of it as possible. After the first couple hours I liked it so much that I knew I had to go on the good ol' 'completionist' spree (still getting there though). I don't want to spoil the story, but I have to say that for the past few days I was able to build such a personal connection with the main character that the events in the last several missions made me shiver and tremble with hate and anger as I was driving through the wasteland with tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. You just don't see that in games nowadays or at least I haven't for quite some time.MAJOR PROPS to all the people involved in the creation of this game!**** EDIT ****I was so overwhelmed that I forgot to mention few other qualities. The game is mighty-well optimized. It runs smoothly and consistently. It is also beautifully made. Even though the majority of the environment is commonly reffered to as a 'wasteland', you will not get bored while wandering around. Each location has a very distinctive styling in my opinion and it helps a great deal to add up to its 'character'.  I was blown away by the areas which were primarily dark. They really do require the use of the flashlight in order to be able to see somewhat decently. The only 'con' I'd mention about this game is that I cannot magically forget the story and re-live the whole experience all over :)			"

 MAD MAX is one of the better games based on a movie franchise Title: MAD MAXGenre: Adventure, beat em up, blowe em up, RPG, driving.Developer: Avalanche studiosPublisher: WB games IS IT ANY GOOD? Yes it is good. What I mean by that is that it aint great but it aint bad either. still confused? Well let me explain to you why I said this.Im basing my review on how well it plays, how the story is, the driving  and fighting mechanics and ofcourse how the game handles in general ( performance, glitches and bugs) PROS Shooting other people out of their cars with a harpoon has never been so satisfyingEating dogfood once in a while is apparently good for your healthBatman arkham series inspired hand to hand combat which aint badRamming cars, harpooning cars, blowing cars up.Lots of explosions ( like a M.Bay movie)Big sandy world to exploresome intresting side objectives called wasteland missionsDecent voiceactingA lot of customization on max and the Magnum opusProgression system (griffa tokens)Ragdoll glitches are hilariousgame is optimized aswell which is rare these days THE CONS:  The short average storyNone of the characters were really that intrestingCollecting relics and such is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because there are around 200 locations to loot.Clearing camps, vantage outposts etc takes a while and you can say its pretty repetitive.The game gets a bit dull and repetitive at times Dont get me wrong. I do recommend this game. But there are some points on which Mad Max falls short. So we have to talk about that. I was really excited when they announced the game after seeing the movies. I got ready to have myself a great time. Did I have a great time? at times.. yes but..1: the wasteland you drive trough doesnt have a lot to offer in terms of eyecandy. Now I know that thats what they were probably going for but it made me personally fast travel to everything as much as I could.2: What I didnt  enjoy in this game is the fact that you have to clear all the vantage points, convoy routes, minefields and camps to unlock upgrades for certain items. As I said earlier. the Map is kinda big. there are a bunch of areas. but after clearing 2-3 areas the taking over of camps and clearling minefields becomes repetitive and boring at some points. Conclusion & Final verdict To sum it all up and keep it short(ish). The core of the game is great. the ramming the shooting and the fighting is very well executed. the voiceacting is good enough and the wasteland does have enough things to keep you busy. While some of them bore me you might enjoy yourself clearling camps and minefields all day but thats completely up to you ofcourse. Overall I did enjoy the game and the story was decent enough to make me go trough it entirely. The customization is well done and did I mention that the game is  DAMN WELL OPTIMIZED?! I salute the developers for bringing out a game that works from day one, Has great graphics and just the occasional bug to make you laugh (ragdoll glitches). It is rare these days that games actually work from day one. I appreciate that a lot. My final verdict for MAD MAX is a good 7.7/10 I recommend this to everyody who's a Mad Max fan and loves to blow stuff up.(If you get bored fast because things can get a bit repetitive I suggest you buy it on sale)You will have a good time regardless.  MAD MAX IN ONE SENTENCE:  Max is mad, things get blown up, my face shows a grin of satisfaction. Want more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

												Absolutely adore this game. It kinda suffers from that problem that a lot of open world games these days suffer from (mosdtly from Ubisoft) where it basically just gives you a laundry list of things to do. In concept, it doesn't sound fun, but in actual gameplay it is pulled off surprisingly well, considering how wonderful the mechanics of the game flow with oneanother. This game has a lot of really good design choices that are so discrete most people wouldn't notice them. Things such as when you're taking down an encampment, when you get to the end and finish it, they always make an easy way to get back to your Magnum Opus rather than making you backtrack through the entire area, I love that. Little details like that go a LONG way towards enjoyment. There are also a few very bad design choices, such as the boss fights which are very tedious and generally annoying. Luckily they're fairly far enough between that it doesn't get in the way often. The driving is perfect, not much to say there. The weapons feel powerful and have a very satisfying animation when they are used. Also not much to say about the on-foot combat, it's been done before, and better, but it's solid and I relish any opportunity I get to beat the heck out of some War Boys. Customization of your Magnum Opus and Max I also feel are a stroug point, because of how tangible the benefits of upgrading each are. With each upgrade there is a noticeable change in how the game plays. For example, changing out the tires od the Magnum Opus dramatically changes the way you approach driving. Some specialize in dricing on sand, off road, or on asphalt. The feeling of progression is wonderful. The story isn't all that great, but that's alright in my book considering the newest entry to the Mad Max thatrical series (Fury Road) was also lacking in story, but that seems like a strong point. There really isn't such a need for story in games like this because I would rather be ramming cars with my beautiful Magnum Opus or beating bad guys into the ground. And considering how solid the gameplay mechanics are, the lack of story is welcomed. PC performance was absolutely wonderful and I feel that this game should be a role model for other games releasing to follow as far as optimization. I tested the game with multiple setups, even one with an integrated GPU. The game ran beautifully on every setup (with the settings tweaked accordingly of course). I did notice a bit of stutter where the game would freeze for about 1/3 of a second every 15-20 minutes or so. Nothing game breaking, on fact, it was hardly noticeable, but something to keep in mind. It happened on every setup including my 980 with a 4790K. There's also a few performance issues in Gastown later in the game where the frame rate will drop to about 40fps even with my settings turned down on the high end system. Also not too noticeable,but can get annoying, especially considering that area is literally the worst. There's a whole lot more to talk about, but even after 70 hours of play time I still am itching to get back into the game.			"

												This story about a man and his car is still a better love story than Twilight.Surprised me how good a game it actually is, considering most movie-games are somewhat lacking. Pretty good open world, challenging combat, loads of upgrades and actual meaning involved on sidequests, since you have to do a few in order to get a specific exclusive upgrade.The only thing I find somewhat lacking is the story itself. But it's been a hell of a ride that kept me going for a lot longer than i had originally antecipated.Find my reviews at http://rubberchickengames.com/author/ricardo-mota/ "

												Work in Progress:It does indeed take some time getting used to the controls.. Both on foot, and in the car.. Im finding myself(now 13hrs in) still frustrated by the controls.. Im playing with a 360 controller, and the layout is just nonsensicle: FootRT to run, RB to evade, A(Hold) for EVERYthing, which screws you up alot.. (try to climb a ladder, or open a door, loot something, and it will drop your weapon)X to attack, ignite gas can for explosion, and fueling vehicles.. Try to Fuel something, and accidentally explode the tank..Shooting, is extremely annoying.. Hold LB to aim, and B to shoot..You are stationary, and clicking B has a full second or two delay, before firing! 2/3 times resulting in you being interupted by a melee attack.Car:RT gas, LT brake/Reverse, and again the stupid Hold LB to aim, and B to fire weapon, or other( I wont spoil) Y to enter/exit you can get out while in motion.. For whatever reason seats are on the right, instead of left.. But you can enter either side..You car feels slightly weak at first, but only against certain enemies..This gets complaints from others, but after an hour or two, I actually like it.. the cars feel very realistic, and the ONLy complaint that I have, is that the Right analog (Steering) isnt quite right.. It requires barely touching it for turning, but if you start to fishtail, its pretty much done, until you regain control.. It easily over turns, or over corrects, and it just feels off.. You do get used to it, and the cars handle nicely.. Especially once upgraded.. On the subject of upgrades.. For the car, they are noticeable, or moreover, each one has a new physical appearance for the car.. And there are plenty! Max upgrades were less noticeable, and the Tokens felt too powerful.. I went straight for gas, water, and ammo, and in no time at all, I had all available ones maxed, before the next tier would unlock.. Im now on tier 3..The game, is extremely easy, though I guess what majority of this open world game type is.... Just a few hours in, Ive got all tools, multiple upgrades for Max, and atleast rank 1 of all car upgrades..  10 hrs later, and I have a few car items rank 4, before Ive even unlocked rank 3.. The Spikes for example.. Theres no need to ever use rank two when it unlocks, now that I have 3! Hand to hand combat is easier than Assassins Creed, or Arkham, by a long shot.. After some more time with the game, and having to combat multiple types of enemies at once, I became more, and mroe annoyed with the control scheme.. But It can get used too.. What I cannot get used too, is the type of enemy that can only be dodged (Red Lines above the head) as they are already within a split second of you, by the time the indicator pops up, and Ive had a difficult time avoiding it.. Especially when fighting 6 or more enemies! Its very stale combat.. Its much easier BEFORE you unlock ""moves"", as trying to use RT to run and X to charge, X to punch, Hold X to power punch, A to shank, Hold A to pickup weapon, RB to dodge, LB to aim&B to shoot.. It becomes too much when youre in the heat of combat, and need to try and dodge.. It is atleast fun.. Cars sound awesome, and though I dont like the steering control, they react like a real automobile.. Jumping might as well not be in the game.. Its completely useless, as he only jumps as high as his ankle, and you have bright yellow ladders, and ledges to indicate where to Hold A to climb, open door, break, loot, etc.. I can see why some say it gets repetetive, as youll be doing alot of driving in bland environments, with nothing of note.. They really could have done SO much mroe with the vast world.. Im quite disappointed with ""Scrap"" everywhere, as it just feels lazy, and looks so out of place.. Guess much of the budget went into graphics, and map scale.. Still, I cannot complain.. I got it for under $7 on Steam sale, and am a little sorry I listened to soem of the negative feedback.. I likely wont play it a second time, but i can see myself playing it through fully once.. PS: the map, SCREAMS Ubisoft.. In EVERy conceivable way.. Radio Towers (Hot Air Ballon), Enemy Camps, Collectibles, Main missions, Side Missions, broken into multiple zones!  Straight out of Ubisoft play book.. No doubt!			"

												It's not really that good, but somehow I keep coming back and playing it.The story is♥♥♥♥♥♥ the gameplay is samey, and the open world doesn't contain anything of note except camps to fight in and places where you can loot miniscule amounts of the game's currency and almost nothing else, but on the whole it still manages to be just fun enough to keep me from shutting it off in disgust. In other words, this game is the very definition of mediocre. I'd say it's worth $20, which is what I got it for.			"

												Game Informer gave 'Mad Max' a 7.5 out of 10 and I'd say that's about right from what I've played so far and is pretty much what I was expecting. This is a solid action game that maybe follows the WB formula a little to cloesly. Anyone who's played one of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment's 'Batman' games or 'Shadows of Mordor' pretty much knows what to expect from the ground combat more or less. While this is in no way a bad thing 'Mad Max' was also developed by Avalanche Studios , whose biggest claim to fame is the 'Just Cause' series, and I would've liked to see a little less WB and a little more Avelanche in the game play. The biggest complaint I see on negative user reviews is the driving, which is a little funky and takes some getting used to; but it's servicable and far from a deal breaker. The 2 cars I've driven so far, Chumbuckets Buggy and the very early Magnum Opus, both handle pretty much the same but aren't quite as good as most games where driving is a big part of the experience. I'm hoping that as I unlock improvements for the Magnum Opus the car will start to become a little more responsive because right now the driving is a little sluggish. If not I'd hope that a patch comes out to address this. I will give an extra ""thumbs up"" to the vehicle combat; it's pretty spot on and so far I have no complaints. I'm barely a few hours into the game and so far I have to say that this game delivers and is about what I was expecting, maybe a little more, but definitely not what I was hoping for.*edit*This was written after my first play session. I completed the main story and can only say that the game starts ot good and gets better and better as you play it.			"

												Highly recommended!!I purchased the game six days ago, during the Steam Winter sale, having no expectations whatsoever. The game literally popped up on my main screen and I thought to myself ""Why the hell not"". Six days later I can only say that this is one of, if not - the best game purchases I've ever made!  The game mechanics and progression are really well made. It felt very natural to me - seamless and flowing. It might not be as charming for some people due to the kind of repetitive game style (doing the same things over and over) but for me this is the first game in a while that just made me sit down, let go off everything else and just finish it. Even more so, I felt compelled to complete as much of it as possible. After the first couple hours I liked it so much that I knew I had to go on the good ol' 'completionist' spree (still getting there though). I don't want to spoil the story, but I have to say that for the past few days I was able to build such a personal connection with the main character that the events in the last several missions made me shiver and tremble with hate and anger as I was driving through the wasteland with tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. You just don't see that in games nowadays or at least I haven't for quite some time.MAJOR PROPS to all the people involved in the creation of this game!**** EDIT ****I was so overwhelmed that I forgot to mention few other qualities. The game is mighty-well optimized. It runs smoothly and consistently. It is also beautifully made. Even though the majority of the environment is commonly reffered to as a 'wasteland', you will not get bored while wandering around. Each location has a very distinctive styling in my opinion and it helps a great deal to add up to its 'character'.  I was blown away by the areas which were primarily dark. They really do require the use of the flashlight in order to be able to see somewhat decently. The only 'con' I'd mention about this game is that I cannot magically forget the story and re-live the whole experience all over :)			"

 MAD MAX is one of the better games based on a movie franchise Title: MAD MAXGenre: Adventure, beat em up, blowe em up, RPG, driving.Developer: Avalanche studiosPublisher: WB games IS IT ANY GOOD? Yes it is good. What I mean by that is that it aint great but it aint bad either. still confused? Well let me explain to you why I said this.Im basing my review on how well it plays, how the story is, the driving  and fighting mechanics and ofcourse how the game handles in general ( performance, glitches and bugs) PROS Shooting other people out of their cars with a harpoon has never been so satisfyingEating dogfood once in a while is apparently good for your healthBatman arkham series inspired hand to hand combat which aint badRamming cars, harpooning cars, blowing cars up.Lots of explosions ( like a M.Bay movie)Big sandy world to exploresome intresting side objectives called wasteland missionsDecent voiceactingA lot of customization on max and the Magnum opusProgression system (griffa tokens)Ragdoll glitches are hilariousgame is optimized aswell which is rare these days THE CONS:  The short average storyNone of the characters were really that intrestingCollecting relics and such is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because there are around 200 locations to loot.Clearing camps, vantage outposts etc takes a while and you can say its pretty repetitive.The game gets a bit dull and repetitive at times Dont get me wrong. I do recommend this game. But there are some points on which Mad Max falls short. So we have to talk about that. I was really excited when they announced the game after seeing the movies. I got ready to have myself a great time. Did I have a great time? at times.. yes but..1: the wasteland you drive trough doesnt have a lot to offer in terms of eyecandy. Now I know that thats what they were probably going for but it made me personally fast travel to everything as much as I could.2: What I didnt  enjoy in this game is the fact that you have to clear all the vantage points, convoy routes, minefields and camps to unlock upgrades for certain items. As I said earlier. the Map is kinda big. there are a bunch of areas. but after clearing 2-3 areas the taking over of camps and clearling minefields becomes repetitive and boring at some points. Conclusion & Final verdict To sum it all up and keep it short(ish). The core of the game is great. the ramming the shooting and the fighting is very well executed. the voiceacting is good enough and the wasteland does have enough things to keep you busy. While some of them bore me you might enjoy yourself clearling camps and minefields all day but thats completely up to you ofcourse. Overall I did enjoy the game and the story was decent enough to make me go trough it entirely. The customization is well done and did I mention that the game is  DAMN WELL OPTIMIZED?! I salute the developers for bringing out a game that works from day one, Has great graphics and just the occasional bug to make you laugh (ragdoll glitches). It is rare these days that games actually work from day one. I appreciate that a lot. My final verdict for MAD MAX is a good 7.7/10 I recommend this to everyody who's a Mad Max fan and loves to blow stuff up.(If you get bored fast because things can get a bit repetitive I suggest you buy it on sale)You will have a good time regardless.  MAD MAX IN ONE SENTENCE:  Max is mad, things get blown up, my face shows a grin of satisfaction. Want more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

												With several hours in the wasteland I must said that I'm very happy with this game. I had low spectactions after the Warner/Batman fiasco but Avalanche did it's work in this title. Really smooth gameplay (I have lower than recommended specs and with everything maxed out I'm getting 60 FPS almost all the time).The game is similar to Just Cause Series on witch kind of thing we're able to do in this open-postapocalyptic-world, a lot of useful things to collect, plenty customization of Max, his weapons and his vehicles and a really polished hand-to-hand and vehicle combat.If you're a fan of Max's World or open world Just Cause style is a must-buy.

												Pros:* The open world in Mad Max is really really well done. It's dark. It's brutal. And it's all about survival.* Graphics are just superb and well optimized. Avalanche Studios has outdone itself.* Unique style of game. It's fresh, creative, and fun.* Melee combat* Upgrades for Max and his Magnum Opus are addictive to go after.* Car combat is really well done and fun. Hijacking convoys is very satisfying.Cons:* Story is not very appealing.* No attachment or affinity to any character in the game. Almost dull. * Glitches in the game at random times make it sometimes frustrating.* Strongholds, camps, and side missions can get very repetitive, if not boring.* Jumping in the game is so silly and useless. The interact button can leap over major obstacles, whereas the jump button can barely jump a foot high. Just straight silly.* While fun, melee combat is OP. In fact considering low ammo you often don't have a choice, which leads to repetition. * You only have a shotgun as personal weapon. Most weaponry is in your car, with limited ammo.* Smashing button for interactions in a game is so year 2000...Overall : 70/100. Worth a buy on huge Steam sale. "

												Absolutely adore this game. It kinda suffers from that problem that a lot of open world games these days suffer from (mosdtly from Ubisoft) where it basically just gives you a laundry list of things to do. In concept, it doesn't sound fun, but in actual gameplay it is pulled off surprisingly well, considering how wonderful the mechanics of the game flow with oneanother. This game has a lot of really good design choices that are so discrete most people wouldn't notice them. Things such as when you're taking down an encampment, when you get to the end and finish it, they always make an easy way to get back to your Magnum Opus rather than making you backtrack through the entire area, I love that. Little details like that go a LONG way towards enjoyment. There are also a few very bad design choices, such as the boss fights which are very tedious and generally annoying. Luckily they're fairly far enough between that it doesn't get in the way often. The driving is perfect, not much to say there. The weapons feel powerful and have a very satisfying animation when they are used. Also not much to say about the on-foot combat, it's been done before, and better, but it's solid and I relish any opportunity I get to beat the heck out of some War Boys. Customization of your Magnum Opus and Max I also feel are a stroug point, because of how tangible the benefits of upgrading each are. With each upgrade there is a noticeable change in how the game plays. For example, changing out the tires od the Magnum Opus dramatically changes the way you approach driving. Some specialize in dricing on sand, off road, or on asphalt. The feeling of progression is wonderful. The story isn't all that great, but that's alright in my book considering the newest entry to the Mad Max thatrical series (Fury Road) was also lacking in story, but that seems like a strong point. There really isn't such a need for story in games like this because I would rather be ramming cars with my beautiful Magnum Opus or beating bad guys into the ground. And considering how solid the gameplay mechanics are, the lack of story is welcomed. PC performance was absolutely wonderful and I feel that this game should be a role model for other games releasing to follow as far as optimization. I tested the game with multiple setups, even one with an integrated GPU. The game ran beautifully on every setup (with the settings tweaked accordingly of course). I did notice a bit of stutter where the game would freeze for about 1/3 of a second every 15-20 minutes or so. Nothing game breaking, on fact, it was hardly noticeable, but something to keep in mind. It happened on every setup including my 980 with a 4790K. There's also a few performance issues in Gastown later in the game where the frame rate will drop to about 40fps even with my settings turned down on the high end system. Also not too noticeable,but can get annoying, especially considering that area is literally the worst. There's a whole lot more to talk about, but even after 70 hours of play time I still am itching to get back into the game.			"

												2 hours in so far so good. OK looking graphics but runs very smoothly at 60fps with everything maxed. Xbox controller working well but I have not tried it with kb and mouse. The map is huge, with lots to do but this may get a bit repetative as far as I can tell. It feels a bit like Shadow of Mordor and Assassin Creed with similar combat to the Arkham series of games, but with slightly different controls. Combat and driving flows well using controller and is easy to pick up and master.Story is interesting so far with plenty of upgrades and stuff to earn through gameplay. It looks quite like Rage but it has more emphasis on hand to hand and car combat. I imagine it will be a game that is easy to 100% but rather time consuming. As I said I think the side missions and collectibles could be tedious but I am enjoying it all so far. I paid £20 and I am very happy with my purchase. Certainly worthy a punt.			"

												After watching Mad Max: Fury Road, I thought: Hey, a game in this setting would be pretty good. As with most movie based games go, I had no hopes for this one. I SAND corrected.

												★★★★★ - ""Do not miss this game"" PROS:- Huge content, there is just so much to do. Including Story Missions, Wasteland Missions, Death Run (Races), Scavenging (Looting), camps to build, camps to take down, mines to detect, objects to destroy and much more.- Combat, yes it follows the mould of the Arkham games and Shadow of Mordor but its even more satisfying in my eyes. Theres no gadgets, just your fists, a shiv or other enemy weapons. Its brutal, you feel every blow and it makes for many satisfying moments as you activate fury mode or improvise with your environment.- Magnum Opus, by far the best part of this game is the desire to grind look in the way of scrap to build up the ultimate battle machine. Ive never felt this in any racer or simulation I've ever played but here your car counts for everything and customisation is very detailed.- Racing, most of the games moments result in you trying to survive in your car as you pass patrols or take on the story/side missions. This is fast and frantic. At first its hard but once you build up your car you feel like a total badass.- The game is very clever at making the most of all its options as you must meet requirements to continue the story. Some people might not like this but it helped immersion for me as i can lose interest in these open world games.- Chumbucket, he's a delightful character who accompanies you, fixing your car and giving tips.- Optimisation, like many I put off this game due to WB recent messes but Avalanche have done a fine job and runs smooth as butter.- Beautiful environment, the wasteland is ugly but its vast and ultimately stunning as a result. An odd beauty.- Storms, these raid you game and unpredictable moments. They are intense.- Camera mode, this mode is  really detailed. It brings out the games beauty and the photographer in you.- Max himself has a pretty decent levelling system in two ways also.CONS:- So the story is okay, its pacing is strange. Its sudden and didn't feel very long, I preferred the wasteland missions to be honest.- Characters, another minor moan that the characters were pretty dense. They're bold but other than Max and Chumbucket they failed to provide any real solid moments.- My only major gripe is that some of the meetings with friendly wastelanders are totally pointless. They are meant to serve a few purposes, give you loot, give you intel on camps and to ask a favour in order to gain secret loot. Now the interactions are all very samey and feel like a total after thought. The characters all look the same and are poorly detailed. The voice actors are pretty much the same for each and there reasoning is daft. I would have preferred if they were left out!VERDICT? Mad Max is my game of 2015. Caught me by surprise. Its immensely satisfying and very immersive but above all its value for money. Im nearly 50 hours in at this point and still have side missions and camps I want to finish completing.			"

												This is a very tentative recommendation, but I did enjoy myself.Pros:- First time the Batman combat system has really felt solid (see notes)- Reasonably good driving- Reasonably good storyCons:- Tedious camps and other wasteland encounters- Uses the Batman combat system (again, see notes)- Story requires you to complete tedious side missions- Checkpoints are not placed wellNotes:Batman (Arkham) combat system: I loved Batman: Arkham Asylum, but it most *certainly* wasn't for the combat system.  To me, the combat system invented for Arkham Asylum felt like an afterthought, thrown together in an attempt to make Batman look badass while fighting without forcing an overwhelming amount of effort into the combat system of what was essentially a stealth game.  It worked very well for a stealth game.  In most action games, it still looks pretty cool ... but it's an overly simplified combat system that takes practically no effort to master.Mad Max expanded upon the system well enough to hold my attention most of the time.  That's impressive.  That doesn't mean, however, that it was an interesting combat system that engaged me particularly well - it felt pretty mediocre and required very little effort on my part.  Still, it felt more engaging than Arkham City or Shadow of Mordor.Wasteland Encounters: Generally, most of the encounters are fairly engaging through the first couple of areas, and some of them later expand upon previous ideas to keep things entertaining.  However ... the stupid mine fields ...In order to fully clear an area, you need to drive around that area until you drive past every mine field - you can't spot mine fields from the hot air balloons.  Then, once you've found a mine field, you need to go back to a stronghold and choose another vehicle (Chum's Buggy), which you *cannot* fast travel with.  Then, you need to drive back to the mine field and carefully drive around watching the direction your dog's nose is pointing to find out where the mines are; for each mine, you need to get out of your car, walk up to it, hit 'E', watch a cutscene, then go back to your car.Tedious.Checkpoints: Overall, the checkpoints are okay, but there are a number places where you get a checkpoint nearly a minute from a very difficult section of the game.  When it takes a good 10-15 seconds to load a checkpoint, then another *minute* to get back to the difficult area, it means the checkpoint was not placed correctly.Again, tedious.All that said: I enjoyed my time with Mad Max.  I've finished the story and a good number of side missions, and it's pretty rare for a game to hold my attention that well.  I don't have any plans to play out the rest of the game, but the main story and the wasteland encounters and side missions that I *did* finish were fun.			"

If you like mad max world and driving a V8 ;) car across the wasteland, this is definitely game for you.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: Game is fantastic. Don't saw any bugs yet. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The steam key can be bought for 19 bucks. So for this price its the best game for September. For my taste better than Batman. Super game to waiting for Fallout 4.Pros:- Nice graphics- Very good optimalization (GTX 970 2k resolution, max settings, 80+ fps) as opposed from Batman: Arkham Knight, so don't be affraid.- Mad Max world- Car battles and tuningCons:- Depth of field cant be turn off- A little bit repetitive content (as usual in modern games with open world)For the price 19 bucks the game deserves 8.5/10 :)I ordered too Metal Gear Solid 5, so today i will play these games together :) But already for now is the game much fun than MGS5: Ground Zeroes. Time will show.			"

												Wow! This game made me wanna watch the latest Mad Max movie. Totally amazing open world, beating the crap out of villains and lackeys. The gameplay is similar to that of Batman games, so if you liked those, you'll love this! Very customizable cars are also a plus!A word of warning: DON'T kill all convoys or bring the threat level to 0 in all areas if you wanna get 100% achievements. One of them requires a lot of special killing and grinding and it's close to impossible to do if you've completed the maps... trust me... I know... the hard way.			"

Driving mechanics.. just pure love and ""car combat"" very cool and seriously well made! Dinki-DI so good can food made for doges <3			"

												Absolutely fantastic game. +Fun driving +Great fist fights+Car customization is really cool +Optimization is great+Voice acting is solid+Story is actually pretty good (caution: Mad Max franchise fanboy)-Nobody has yelled ""WITNESS ME!!!"" and then exploded.All Mad Max fanboying aside, it's a really fun game. I've been taking my time and enjoying/exploring and I've logged 42 hours at the time of this review. Some people have complained the missions can be tedious (drive here, get this... drive there, fight this guy). If you enjoy driving games or Mad Max this is a great game. Even better if it's on sale.			"

												I would definately recommend this game. Best game I've played this year so far, it's a god dam kick♥♥♥♥♥game. But you're about to sit down for one negative point I had in this game. Everything else I was content with. Ladies and Gents, I'm not here to whine about the game itself, I just have a little issue with the plotline.*Note* Please don't read on if you haven't played the game*Note* Please don't read on if you haven't played the game.What♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me the F*** off is the bull**** ending you get left with. Rather than not allowing us a choice in his final actions, it goes on to show some pretty unexpected content. Whether it's to go on chasing scrotus and leaving Hope and Glory (just to end up dying) when he had the oppritunity to leave with a family or having to kill chumbucket (he was my main homie) I wouldn't have killed off Chum, rather, use your ♥♥♥♥ing brain Max and just fire a explosive harpoon than go through a trippy a** phase. I would have just been satisfied with leaving to a family than countinue going down this whole path he took. Like, for all the f****** effort why? and yea, killing off chum was more emotional than Hope and Glory, sorry lol (the torture scenes were sad though, I didn't want it to happen none the less) Not enough character development with the two girls. Just randomly started acting close on the first encounter, and from then on. But still, as I said I still would have settled for a choice with the family than go through that again. 10/10 would not play the ending again.I genuienly sat for 10 minutes hoping there was another way to the ending, but no. He decided to go for it and jump out of the truck leaving Chum on it. Like even that, I thought the way the story was going was that he would have went in the reckoning aswell (because of all the trippy voices and dialoge it had). Yea, some people might think this is stupid, but I was let down with the ending. But then again, its Mad Max, you can't really expect any good ending (and by that I mean ending it on something that makes us smile) rather than having a really bad cringe. CHUM WAS MY GOD DAM HOMIE, IF I HAD A CHOICE; NO.			"

In other words, this game is the very definition of mediocre. I'd say it's worth $20, which is what I got it for.			"

												Let me start this off by saying that I'm not a die-hard Mad Max fan. I've seen Mad Max: Fury Road and I enjoyed the film very much, but it wasn't anything worth ♥♥♥♥♥♥ing over.   Category Comments Score   Graphics Probably one of the most beautiful games I have played. It does a great job of capturing the feel of the Mad Max world with endless sandy wastelands, large explosions, and the scrappy, makeshift machines of death that were once someones commuter car.  10/10   Story The story is relatively short, and nothing to get too excited about. I feel like it does do a good job though of allowing the player to take a deeper look into Max's past and get a feel for who he is and why he does what he does. The story's end goal is to retreive the prized Big Chief (V8 Engine)  7/10   Performance By far the most optimized game that I have ever played. In fact, my framerate was so high at 1920 by 1080 on max settings that my GPU was producing a NASTY coil whine. After changing the resolution to 4K and keeping the settings on max, I was able to hold a constant 60-80FPS and the coil whine dissapeared. (I am using an OC'd i7-4790k and an OC'd 980Ti). These framerates are a first for me on any open world game. 10/10   Combat The combat in this game has two different forms. There's foot combat which is very similar to the combat in the Batman games or Shadow of Mordor, but still has some unique aspects to it. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a rip-off of the other games, but it certianly has it's similarities. Regardless, the foot combat is very fluid and my only complaint is that on rare occasions the camera clips behind a wall while you are fighting and makes it impossible to see anything. The other form of combat is vehicular combat. Mad Max has, hands down, the best vehicle combat of any game I have ever played. Its fluid, exciting, and doesn't have a huge learning curve to be able to use properly. Harpoons, explosives, shotguns, flamethrowers and more are all at your disposal to crush your opposition while you are cruising through the dunes at high speed. 9/10  Gameplay I enjoyed how the game is open world, so you are free to complete main missions, side missions, or scavange for scrap (to upgrade your vehicle) in any order you like. I also like how you are able to build your vehicle however you like depending on the situations you expect to be getting into. For example, you can build a heavily defended car that that can take quite a beating, but you'll suffer heavily on your speed. Or, you can build a car that can zip across the wasteland but has little to no protection from hostile vehicles. The biggest downside on this game, that many others have stated, is the grinding. Alot of this game, especially after you finish the main story, is just hunting for scrap so you can buy better parts for your vehicle. If grinding is your thing, then you'll love this game. Otherwise you may want to give it a second thought before purchasing. 7/10 "

												This is the only game in the last 5 years that I bought at full price that was actually worth paying for. If you're wondering if you should wait for a steam sale to get this game, don't. It really is worth sixty dollars.IS IT AWESOME?If you're a Mad Max fan, you've been waiting your entire life for this game. ♥♥♥♥ing everything is in it, down to the actual brand of dog food that they ate in the first Max movie.I'M NOT A MAD MAX FAN, IS THIS STILL COOL?Okay... So do you remember the best part of Borderlands 2? That one desert zone with the white trash clans, and the bandit trucks running around, and you could hijack convoys and steal loot chests from them? Imagine someone just took that zone, made it an entire game, and then filled that game full of hilarious toys for you to murder australian skinheads with.ALL THE CRITICS HATE IT.Yea, and Kojima's next sixty dollar movie about an old one eyed dude in a bandana is gonna get editor's choice and game of the year. The difference is someone is gonna pay those ♥♥♥♥s to like Metal Gear, nobody paid them to like Mad Max. Read all these reviews from people who bought it, the fan response to the game is unanimously positive.I'M A MAD MAX FANBOY, CAN I GET ALL THE ICONIC MAD MAX♥♥♥♥♥♥Yes. The game starts out like every Max movie ever- You're driving along minding your own business and then some dudes ♥♥♥♥ up your♥♥♥♥♥♥and wreck your car, and you're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because your car is badass. But it doesn't take long for you to get back all your original Max gear. You always have a shotgun, you can choose a Ford Falcon XB body to be your car, and you unlock the leather jacket pretty early.  Also, the reward for beating story mode is an unlock for the pristine V8 interceptor completely canon from the films.I'M NOT A MAD MAX FANBOY, WHY SHOULD I GIVE A ♥♥♥♥?Even if you're not a Max fanboy this game is just fun as ♥♥♥♥. It should be called NEED FOR SPEED: PSYCHOPATHS. It's an Australian murder car simulator. There are hotrod driving skinheads all over the desert and your job is to run them over with flamethrowers, harpoon guns, and spiked wheels. You can rip the doors off of cars and harpoon guys out of the driver seat and pull them through the windshield. You can ram the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything until it explodes. When guys jump on your car, you can just blow them into meat confetti with your shotgun. The people who made this game are truly sick. It's WONDERFUL.You will chase down and murder a dozen human beings and blow up their cars just for the sake of grabbing a can of dog food, some shotgun shells, and a hood ornament.WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥, NO MULTIPLAYER?This game should never have multiplayer. The amount of death and destruction one person in one car already causes in this game is beautifully horrendous. If they let us all into the world in our murder cars we'd all be harpooning each other and exploding. The devs at Avalanche would be arrested and put on trial for war crimes. "

												This is a tough one...Let me start with a few points:It is a great open world game!It is sort of repetetive and somewhat forces you to do the same things over and over (not as often to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off but to get you bored)takes around 20 hours to complete when you are not focusing on completing itNot comparable to the movie( I know they are not at all related but I want to make this point so people who expect it can rethink it)Ammo or fuel are laughably available after a few hours into the game(seriously it's ridiculous you can waste it however you like)about 65% on foot and 35% car time which could also be misinterpreted ( I for once thought of a 90% car ration when buying so I somewhat got disappointed)The game is not really challenging. The bosses are laughably repetetive and easy and because car combat is always the same you are more likely to just be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off than actually feel beatenStory did not really seem interesting(I have to point out that I don't care about story in any game but this one seemed very generic)There was no story mission that took longer than ~15 min. which makes them seem unimportantNow let me get to the point:It is a good open world gameIt is a mediocre car combat game but one of a kindIt has a lot of weaknesses mostly that it's repetetive. You can easiely compare this to Metal Gear Solid V. MGSV has almost always the same objective but offers many different approaches. Mad Max offers to slaughter everyone and everything either by blowing them up or beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them which makes somewhat boring.As I have stated I played 20.8h . If my playtime in this game grows by more than 5 hours I probably changed my mind but if not than I tell you this: After 20 hours I am done with the game. I unlocked pretty much everything and don't see a point in upgrading anything else since there is no challenge whatsoever in it anymore. Other than with Shadow of Mordor for example where it took me 24 hours to get to ~90% completion I am not really satisfied with the time I spent.Do I recommend it? Yes!Is it worth 50€/$ ? Not at all.I got it for 19€ and I think it is worth it but I would not recommend you buying it at 50€ for such a simple and repetetive game.Final Rating: Reluctant 7/10Feel free to ask questions in the comment section if you have any and feel free to discuss certain points with my if your opionion differs.Final Note: What mostly pisses me off is that it was said that ammo would be rare but since it is not fights get even easier and you mostly use ammo because you just want to get over with fights faster. I suppose they did it because fighting would end up in constantly bashing the same buttons and while driving you would have to constantly ram the opponent which is annoying and boring.			"

												Ejoyable so far. I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic games.PROS:+ Graphics.+ Optimization(seriously, it's sick. 60 FPS with everything on max, 1440p. GTX 970).+ Voice acting.+ Story(haven't got far at all yet, but I like what I've seen so far).+ Ground combat(I like this kind of combat system--aka Batman Arkham X combat style--, so if you don't this might be a con).+ Car combatCONS:- No real innovation(capturing/razing strongholds ala Ubisoft isn't anything new and is quite frankly rather boring. Same goes for flying up in the balloon to scout, although this gives quite the view which is great).- Car handlig(might be just me, but I don't like the slight delay between the pressing of the steering button and the actual steering of the car).- So far, no sniper rifle outside of the car(to use the sniper rifle, you gotta be in the back of the car. As I haven't finished the game yet, I might get a portable sniper rifle further in - although I suspect I won't).- Some potentially game breaking bugs(like having looted a place you need to loot later on in a quest, thus making looting that place again during questing impossible).If you enjoy the Mad Max franchise, post-apocalyptic games or open-world games, you might find this fun. Thus far, I'm going to give this game 7/10. I will probably update the review later on as I get further into the game, might add or remove some points or pros/cons.Thanks for reading.			"

Even still, I just put 9 hours straight into this game and it held my attention the whole time, along with running like hot butter on all max settings. Impressively optimized for sure. If you're looking for something new, wait for this to go on sale, but if you're a fan of Just Cause and Mordor, buy it now man.			"

												Well, there's been some discussion about wether or not this game is worth your time, and I think it's time to throw in my two cents.Let's start off with the most obvious part: the story. Not a great one for a large part of the game. At first (and probably for 75% of the story) your only objective is acquiring a V8 engine for your car. Yeah, not the most intense set-up you've ever heard. In order to get a V8 you have to look in Gas Town, a dangerous place, so before you can even go look for a V8 you need to acquire various upgrades from a few characters in the wasteland. For a long while the story doesn't really move forward and you're just kinda wanking about not really doing anything real. At the end though, once the V8 gets in reach, suddenly things shift into fifth gear and there's suddenly all these things going on. I won't spoil anything, but I actually started relating to Max and his journies for the last little bit of the story. There were some interesting characters in play all of a sudden, and Max had some motive I could understand. There was depth too, as you could see Mad Max struggle between doing what is right and doing what is best for him. That is actually a main point in the movies, too. But that doesn't last and just as you're having fun the story ends. Quite a shame since it shows so much potential at the end there. So, in total, I'd say the story is bare-boned and empty, with a glimpse of a proper story at the end.Off to the next big thing then: cars! This game has a metric ton of car upgrades, and unlocking new upgrades is probably the most rewarding thing in the game. The cars feel and handle well too, and there's actually quite a little room for different builds. Some linear upgrades are a little boring, there's for instance no reason not to take the best engine, exhaust and weapons (they have no downsides), but there's also stuff like armor and rams, which will offer more protection and damage but will also slow you down. Having the option to create either a slow, rusted, hulking heap of death or a shiny fast fragile little thing is pretty cool, though I kinda wish there was more thinking involved. For instance, it'd be more fun if you had to choose between a roaring fast engine or an economical one, the one meaning more performance in battles and the other meaning more time to drive around without stopping and having to murder 12 guys over 4 liters of fuel. Again, it seems like they could have made it more interesting, but it serves its purpose very well in this state. Building your own death machine is still a lot of fun.Now, in this game, most time will be spent doing side-objectives. This is a real completionist's heaven. The map is stuffed to the brim with objectives, small and big, to keep you busy. The main reason for doing these is of course the aforementioned car upgrades. They will only unlock when you clear a region of threats. Now to me, the objectives were certainly fun enough to keep me busy. My favourite are these convoy-routes, where you have to engage in car-battles and ram and tear a whole convoy of cars apart in order to recieve a shiny hood-ornament (doubles as an upgrade) for your car. Other objectives include beating up leukemia-camps (guessing they all have cancer) and tearing down statues. The fighting itself is a lot of fun by the way, you get to see Max bust out some really cool MMA/wrestling moves, and they do have a real punch to them. Though fighting is simple (block/attack), I can't help but enjoy every double-leg takedown or tombstone piledriver Max dishes out. Though again, I see squandered potential. The fighting system would be oh-so-much better when the awesome moves Max sometimes does were special combos, also unlockable through leveling. It'd make them feel more special. And another thing I would have done is give the hood ornaments special perks instead of increased speed/health/handling of your car. Have the hood ornaments give you special abilities and it'd be so much better. And also, there's not enough car-fights. This is an absolute problem I have, almost every quest is done on foot. This is Mad Max damnit, you can't venture through that desert on foot! Where are the car-chases, the car-battles, the car-escapes, the car-parkour, everything! I am truly dissapointed by the lack of car-stuff in a Mad Max game. And then my final gripe, there are these Boss-camps that give you paints for your car. You might have guessed that there's a boss in them. Now the first time I saw one I was pretty impressed, he had attack patterns and stuff and he had a weakness that I had to figure out, it took some doing to get him down. So after that I couldn't wait to see the next one. Then it turned out the next boss was exactly the same guy with a different color! EVERY BOSS IS THE SAME! Bosses could have been so amazing if they gave them a little more effort! Such a waste!But alas, the game is what it is, and even though I think there was a LOT of room for improvement, I still enjoy Mad Max. Everything in the game is decent, it is *very* well optimized, and the game is just fun to play. So my conclusion: not all that special, but a solid game nonetheless. If you have less money to burn than me, I'd wait until it drops to about 30 bucks and then give it a shot. It's fun, really, it is.			"

												I was very much a fan of the first two Mad Max movies, haven't gotten around to watching the third one and I very likely won't watch Fury Road outside of being really bored (even though this game is based off Fury Road I believe) this does an amazing job of putting you in the shoes of Max. The graphics are absolutely amazing despite me only playing on high settings across the board, I could probably get a little more out of it but I don't get greedy when it comes to these things, if it runs smooth as butter I don't really care if the textures look like a potato as long as the gameplay is smooth lol I'm running an Intel i7 at 3.6 GHz, nVida GTX 760 (4 gig) with 8 gigs of ram and it runs absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Mad Max series.			"

												One of the two games I like to call ""The titans of September 1st"". Mad Max is probably the best PC port of 2015. The developers knew what they were doing and they nailed it. It has flawless performance and way more than enough PC related options for maximum customization. The world of Mad Max might seem empty and bland but it's a joy to explore in your fully customizable Magnum Opus. Scavenge for scrap, food and water as you make your way trough a wasteland helping allies or poor souls you come across, or beating the crap out of Scrotus' hordes with the help of a well polished Arkham-like combat system. The only noticeable flaw only becomes known the more time you put into the game, that is repetitiveness. Whatever small flaws the game has otherwise are cleverly hidden behind the games' other features.WITNESS!			"

												If it was possible, this would not be given a positive or a negative review but would be a 'meh' review. I have done multiple negative reviews where I seriously say that I want to recommend the game but can't. This is sort of the opposite.. I really don't want to recommend this game because of multiple issues, but it is still fun enough that I was able to finish the main story and it does qualify as playable.So what's Mad Max, the game?Well, it's a free roam, mostly open world wasteland with a mix of hostile bases, lootables, mine fields, race coordinators and baloons which are used for scouting the areas. It has a plot, that starts Mad Max-like but by the middle of the plot, it's gone completely convoluted, trajic mess that I feel was the worst part of the game.It starts out very Mad Max like but the plot turns out more like a detour from Max's normal mundane life to be the driver of a super-car. It doesn't start that way, but with the help of his 'bud' for most the game, a mechanic called Chumbucket, it doesn't take long to become a rolling death machine. If I had to give one reason it's worth playing, it would be roaming around with the car in free-roam.			"

												I am very tempted to give this game a positive review. If there was a neutral option, I'd take it.My biggest problem with the game is that many of the tasks feel empty and hollow. Tearing down a scarecrow or a sniper's nest isn't really that much fun, but it's there to be done, and it stands between you and the upgrades you want.The on-foot combat is easy to pick up, but has very little room to raise your skill in. You basically smash the left mouse button until everyone is dead, and occassionally block or evade. Weapons you temporarily aquire just dumb the combat down even more, as you now just have to smash the left mouse button. Shadow of Mordor, a game published by the same company with similar combat system, offers so much more variety in terms of skill, that it baffles me how they could make this so similar, yet fail so hard.The vehicle combat is a lot better, but it has its own set of flaws - some of them critical. At first, it feels really satisfying to crash into enemies, pull them out of their car or shoot their tyres, but it gets somewhat boring soon. As soon as you aquire the Lv. 4 Harpoon, you just pull everyone's tyres off instantly, thus making you win every fight. Upgrades, on the other hand, seem to do very little in terms of combat. The improved ramming grills barely make you deal more damage, while the armor only seems to make your car go more sluggish, while offering no real incresed protection. After you get the thunderpoon upgraded, you can just one-shot every enemy you engage.The story feels non-existant until you reach gastown (which was the majority of the game for me), and then turns somewhat nonsensical. The next part will discuss some characters, so it'll naturally contain spoilers: Tenderloin's character feels completely wasted to the story. She just exists so Max doesn't have to kill Chumbucket after the race. Max' relation to Hope and Glory make no sense either. He doesn't want them to come with him, so he leaves them back to die, but gets extremely mad (no pun intended) when they die. All in all, this game might have done just as well without the story.As for the good parts, the game does offer a lot of content, even if the content itself is rather dull. If you are looking for a game into which you can sink 20-40 hours, then I would recommend it. If you're looking for ""the action version of New Vegas"", then this isn't it.			"

												So far.... Feels like exactly what it is. A batman reskin with some mad maxie flavor throughout. If you love the batman games and want a watered down version of the flow style combat this game may be for you. If you love the mad max universe and just cant wait to get a slightly shallow version of it to play around in there is some to enjoy here.  Its pretty middle of the road in every way. Graphics are pretty. Game is forgettible. Story is a nonstarter. Mildly fun while youre playing it but dont expect the experience to stick with you..Overall worth about 15 bucks.			"

												Alright. 48/49 achievements down. Full story beat. Play time isnt accurate to my steam account as a friend plays when I'm not. The above save (mine) sits at 99.3 hours total for anyone curious and the final achievement is... one that could take an hour or another ten heh.Fun game, open world. Vehicle use feels like RAGE or Far Cry 4 with a masterpiece combat system. Grappeling hooks, thunderpoon(rocket launcher), nitrous, fully upgradeable vehicles, over fifty vehicles ingame btw.On foot combat is melee focused, your only ranged weapon is your shotgun but ammunition limits plus overall use steers you towards melee combat which feels like any of the batman titles.The story itself feels set aside all the way until the last 15% of the story play at which point it goes knee deep and becomes more engaging. Sadly though it dosent answer some popular questions amongst this franchises fanbase such as a, where is fury road timeline wise with the original trilogy and b, is this the original mad max or someone else and c, is he married before the game or during the game only.Thankfully the story isnt the main focus of enjoyment. There are hundreds of places to explore/loot, vehicles to collect and upgrade, talent points, races, convoys to chase everywhere, strongholds to build, relics to collect, it rocks!I walk away from this game now (until some sort of dlc of course) satisfied that I got my money's worth out of it. I'd like dlc, I'd like more lore depth explored, more non hostile groups out there in the wastes to encounter, more exploration in to ruins of the old world, there's lots of potential here. I have no hope that this game will match fallout 4 when it arrives but there is ALOT that can be done to this game to put it on a level near F4 when it hits in november :)			"

												This game... GOD how much I've waited for such glorious post-apocalyptic carnage, for such brutality and overwhelming feeling of actually BELONGING to this desolate place called ""The Wasteland"". From the mayhem behind the steering wheel to snapping the vertebrae of numerous Wastelanders competing for survival under the scorching sun of this world, this game has it ALL! Avalanche Studios actually succeded in creating a beliveable world, set in the Mad Max universe, full of secrets and things to do. And we can all now safely conclude that the publisher ISN'T the one at fault (other than picking up the wrong date for release, which is entirely based on individual opinion of people - some may think that releasing Mad Max at the same date MGS5 is released was a huge mistake, others don't), since Avalanche did an outstanding job on the optimization of this game - it runs buttery smooth on 60 fps, 1080p resolution and everything ""MAD MAX""-ed out :)While arguably the game isn't for everyone (those that didn't like Just Cause 2 or don't enjoy an open world game done in this style, or that aren't in love with the post-apoc setting or Mad Max in general may not like or enjoy this game), it certainly raises the bar in terms of how a game, set in the post-nuclear universe, should look and feel; then there is the fantastic vehicular combat, and the outstanding performance of the actor portraying Chumbucket - his religious, almost fanatical fervor resonates with me in the same way as the Inquisitiors (from WH40k) make me all giddy and excited.All in all - another sleeper hit, which can be safely called that way since the game critics and gamers have split opinions on it, which is always good. Mad Max was never too mainstream, often considered a cult classic (until Fury Road - that movie is already raising an army of fans new to the universe, and for a reason), so it is only natural that some people will hate the game while the others will talk of it as if it was the Second Coming - I, obviously, belong to the latter, and consider myself lucky to have the opportunity to ride eternal on the Higway to Valhalla...WITNESS ME !!!

												UPDATE:  After a few months I decided to come back and try and play some more of the game.  I was greeted with an error ""Unable to connect to servers, please try again or contact support.""  It then had a link to paste in encoded data.  I should point out that it did this during install ALREADY, so this is a re-check at random time. How often will these checks happen?  Who knows?   In other words: *INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED AND SERVER CHECK DRM*  I no longer recommend this game and would have not purchased if I had known it required internet access to play a single player only game.-- Below is my original review, before the above. --If you like Batman/Shadows of Mordor style combat, mixed with car combat then you should enjoy this.  The survival aspect is not really there as water and food are very common.  The upgrade system is a bit weak and the ""player customization"" is really just upgrade to the best item as each has stats for both Max and his cars.  It can be a bit of repeat and grind so you must like the 1v5+ combat before you go into it.  Death races are so frustrating I just didn't do any of them.  And clearing minefields are tedious and boring.  But that said, the rest of the game makes up for it.  Story is not bad, voice acting was mostly good.  Cut scenes were great and the landscape was amazing.7.5/10 (Recommend getting on sale 40-50% off)+ good melee combat+ good car combat + great atmosphere+ convoy battle is awesome- death races are stupid- minefields are boring- can be repetitive - ui can be buggy			"

Good benchmark port for others to follow.Only stupid idea they had was releasing game after a bank holiday on a work day, would have loved to play this all weekend.  Why not the Friday before? not like any issues with running on PC like other released turds on day one.Looking forward to DLC as they will have more time on there hands making DLC than fixing PC issues, which is a relief.10/10			"

												I find it pretty boring. Too many scrap locations and not enough actual content. Max's main goal seems to be GET THE V8. Doesn't seem to care about Scrotus or anyone else. You storm strong holds, beat up goons then fight a TOP DOG if you're in the right strong hold. You gotta fight the same boss 8+ times though. Every topdog and big boss outside of story missions is just a copy paste. To beat the story you just need to fight one! Then you just needs to get that V8 then get guilt tripped into being an errand boy some more. I'd say it's worth picking up during a strong sale. Less than $15.			"

												I really want to like this game but it doesn't let me play it the way I want to. This is supposed to be MAD MAX but I'm forced to play the game in a stupid linear fashion reducing 'threat levels' and whatnot in order to unlock upgrades. Makes an otherwise crazy and chaotic game seem like grandmas trek down the linear hallway. Some games can only be good if they're broken, and this is one of them. Unfortunately, someone took all the fun away and locked it in a box. Reduce threat level in this arbitrary zone to level 2 in order to unlock.			"

												Um jogo muito gostoso de jogar, até pq sua jogabilidade é a mesma dos jogos do Batman. O maior problema é que não me senti em nenhum momento preso à história, tanto que jogava ouvindo alguma música ou podcast. Personagens genéricos, chefões genéricos e as batalhas idem. As missões são muito repetitivas.Não vale preço cheio mas em uma promoção vale a pena comprar.			"

												Great game and great Linux port. I love the original movies and also the modern remake, this game captures the aesthetics of those post apocalyptic locations which inspired so many artists.The vehicles combats thru the desert are hilarious and smashing faces with punches gives not less satisfaction.The cinematics are better than the movie and the character 'Chumbucket' is simply perfect.

												How you feel about this game is entirely based on what you consider to be ""entertaining"" content and how much of said content you are willing to consume in a single game. We'll start off with the pros:- Graphics are downright gorgeous in a lot of places, particularly when it comes to the cars and the Gas Town environments.- On foot combat system is cinematic and entertaining at the start (more on that later), with a lot of the animations remaining realistic and brutal in a lot of cases.- Car customization is pretty cool, although more bodies would have been nice considering three of them are very similar anyway.- Game is an amazing PC port with an extensive array of graphics options.- Optimization is pretty damn good with frame rates being far higher than what you would expect when considering how good the game looks, although there are some relatively significant frame rate dips in a lot of the later environments such as Gas Town. - A lot of interesting characters and well done voice acting, I'm impressed by how they managed to make Max the miserable git that he is supposed to be.And now for the cons, which may be more significant to some people than to others:- I would say roughly 85% of this game is just busy work. You spend the majority of your time looting tiny locations, pulling down scarecrows, collecting somewhat useless ""project"" parts with no real rewarads at the end. If you aren't doing any of these things then you are most likely doing smallish missions for group leaders, and althought these missions have some story to them, they almost always end up being a boring fetch quest like the project parts.- Bugger all reward for completing the tasks above, the most tangible reward I have seen is lowering the threat rating gets rid of a lot of those god damn annoying war boy patrols which get in your way of completing your fetch quests. The rewards from completing projects are almost pointless since it is hardly difficult to restore your health and ammunition anyway. - Gas tanks are far too large and the sheer amount of fuel laying around is just strange. The cars you are driving are supposed to be insanely powerful, over the top beasts of engineering, and yet they seem to chew through fuel slower than a Prius. You could probably finish the majority of the storyline on a single fuel tank, and even if you did need to refuel it's not like there isn't a thousand fuel cans in your general area. - No real survival mechanics in the game. Max goes on and on about survival, but for some reason he never needs to eat, drink or take care of wounds. All food and drink does is restore your health and give you an easy achievement. - The combat system is mundane and, in my opionion, far too streamlined. Although the animations look really cool the combat system itself is nothing more than a left-click rolling fest. There is no need to time your attacks properly, getting into a 10:1 fight doesn't matter since all you have to do is wait from a counter prompt, strong attacks are almost useless since they do bugger all damage and just leave you exposed, no real attack combinations to speak of. ""Fury"" mode is far too easy to activate, only requiring around 6 hits to activate while also restoring your health in the middle of combat.- Boss fights are just slighlt longer normal fights, again just waiting for the right prompts and spamming that left-click. - Vehicle combat had a lot of potential to be great when you consider all the upgrades you can do to your car to increase survivability. The number of things you can use to destroy the enemy is fairly solid, ranging from simply smahing into them, or by shooting them with rockets. However none of this matters when you discover that the harpoon can literally end a fight in about 3 seconds, especially when you start to get the later upgrades to it. Vehicle combat goes from something that had a lot of cool features to nothing more than a harpoon simulator. Obviously you can limit yourself on how much you use the harpoon, but that is just an example of poor game design forcing the player to gimp their own playstyle for the sake of making combat more interesting. - Story is your typical Mad Max type where from some reason the most important thing in the world is an engine, which is fine. The problem is that the story is held back by your typical RPG style events which make no sense and are nothing more than padding for what is a pretty short story. Why, for example, do I need have very specific car parts (which are worse than what I already own) simply to progress the story? The ""Archangel"" system seems so pointless and eventually became another obstacle for me to grind out. Conclusion:If you are a die hard fan of the Mad Max series I would be cautious about buying this game. Take a step back a minute and understand that sometimes it is better to skip a part of a series you like in order to preserve your opinion of it, Bioshock fans probably understand this quite well. While the core feeling of ""Mad Max"" is present, it is just plauged by so much boring nonsense that it made this game a chore to play, which as everyone knows is a terrible title for a game to be given. At no point during the game did I feel like any of this busy work meant anything, and it eventually got to the point where I said ♥♥♥♥ it and just tried to finish the game. Believe me I have not missed out on anything by making this decision.Some people out there are fans of busy work games, they like doing the same repetitive task over and over again, and for them this could possibly be the perfect game. However in my eyes this game just isn't fun, and the biggest part of gaming for me is the fun factor, everything else comes second.			"

												Bom, pra quem gosta da série cinematográfica, é um ""must have"". O jogo traz elemento de RPG (upando níveis do personagem em atributos, assim como no carro que você usa) somados a um sandbox. A história é bem simples. Gira em torno de vingança pura e simples. O jogo é extremamente bonito e bem feito se você jogá-lo no high/ultra. O estudio que produziu o jogo caprichou com louvor na qualidade do gráfico, efeitos e afins. Porem nem tudo é perfeito. O jogo peca em sua repetição. Há elementos repetitivos que te farão querer terminar o jogo logo, pois você não mais o aguentará. Eu, lootiando e fazendo todas as side quests, joguei por volta de 45 horas. Se você rushar o main mission, você reduz o game pra umas 8 horas. É um jogo que com certeza vale tê-lo, mas não pelo full price, porém numa promoção. 7/10.			"

												First things first: Thank you for reading! You're awesome!Movie-based games used to be bad. Well, you could say, its comic-based, but nevertheless, its amazing! For a change upgrades are vitally important. The upgrades you apply to the car are essential and you won't stop collecting and upgrading, believe me. Such a good idea, to be able to upgrade not only Max, but the car also. Upgrades are the best, if the progression is designed well. You'll buy the right thing at the right time and feel smart and accomplishing. That's good game design - the perfect illusion of choice. Now the looks:Everything you'd expect nowadays is here: depth of field, motion blur, volumetric lighting, ambient occlusion. But the sky steals the show. Its the most beautiful sky in a video game. A great achievement by the designers. Also the landscape, a huge, authentic wasteland without any loading screens. Wow!So, how is this game in ""relationship-terms""?-She looks amazing, performs well, if you know what i mean, she cooks, she irons and you'd gladly introduce her to your dad.Insta-favorite. Have fun!			"

												Mad Max. Damn, this game is stunning in every conceivable way. The combat is very fluid and responsive, graphics are amazing and highly detailed, and the optimization is to the MAX. Literally, the game so far, and I am about 90 minutes in and it has not disappointed me. The combat has that Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor feel and the movement is very smooth. The story so far is very intriguing especially if you are or are not a Mad Max fan. You will love it and feel as if you are Max himself in the Wasteland.I will continue to edit this as well as I am getting farther into the game.Rate 10 to the Max. 10/10.			"

												Much like the cars in it Mad Max looks good but is a bit creaky underneath. This review will probably contain SPOILERS, but only for like the first five minutes because the games a bit repetitive.First, the good:This game feels so much like the Batman games I originally thought it was the same developer. Which means the combat is pretty fluid and visceral, you feel like a total badass and it never feels far-fetched that Max is more than capable of taking down ten guys at once.The driving is nice, takes a little getting used to and the cars feel doughy sometimes but flying down the dusty tracks in your hand-built monster is a fun experience.The customisation is spot-on, I was eagerly anticipating having enough scrap for some of the personal or vehicle add-ons and they all make a noticeable difference.Now for the bad:Mad Max _feels_ like the Batman games but it doesn't look like the Batman games, mainly because the camera is so poor in close quarters that you can't see anything at all. This can lead to getting hit in fights you should be walking simply because the camera decided showing Max and the dude he's fighting is too much work so it points somewhere above their heads. Considering half the combat is in close confines this can get very annoying.Also the enemy design is lacking inspiration. For general mobs there's weak dude, melee weapon dude, fast dude with a knife and shield dude. OK, so there's the occasional suicide bomber and some weird ""ferals"" who come at you like dogs but mainly you will have a mix of the first four. Bosses are even worse, there is only one type: big, muscley dudes with melee weapons. Oh, one is weak to knives, one is weak to fire, the usual, but you end up beating them all the same way.The vehicle combat is ridiculous. Either you will get ganked super-fast by some dude rubbing up on you or you will be wasting the enemy in seconds. There is no in-between, no long, ongoing games of cat and mouse. If you are in front, no matter how fast your car is, you will be caught. But if your car catches on fire you can bail out and be as dangerous on foot as you were in your vehicle. It makes you wonder why Max needs a car in the first place.The in-game races are very strange, the other racers show little amibition to reach the finish line first, they would rather pick a fight with you. Just you, not each other and certainly not with the other cars you might meet on the road which will be drawn to you like you have a magnet as a hood ornament.There are a few more quibbles like Max using his shotgun to bust stuff when he has a crowbar right next to the holster but that's more of a logic flaw then an actual problem with the game itself. In short, the game is fun 80% of the time but the other 20% will have you throwing your gamepad at the wall.			"

Runs as smooth as butter fully maxed out on a decent rig and is flat out eye candy from start to finish.Massive open world with tons to do, just bear in mind its mainly based around fighting and driving, imaging Shadow of Mordor with a Mad Max re-skin and you wont be far off.At its' current price it's well worth picking up, with anywhere between 30-60 hours gameplay, and when on sale it's an absolute steal!IMHO one of the most underrated games of 2015!

												I really want to love this game, I really do. It has some amazing qualities which sets it apart from other post apocalyptic games. The graphics are sensational, each of the characters developments are done really well, the fine work in the detail (such as NPCs muttering to themselves) really aides to submerging the player, even the combat is fun. However there are things about this game that just destroy the experience. Little things that the devs could fix to make this game out-of-this-world.What little time used to teach the player on how to play the game is so fleeting it's almost nonexistent. One big issue is how non intuitive your character is. It is unbelievably frustrating to have your character run over a ladder and fall to his death instead of auto-engaging it. Problems like having to face an object in a perfect 45° cone in order to interact with it is made even more difficult with movement that 180s your character around with zero finesse.Play this game, it is great. Just be prepared to scream at your monitor when some senseless repetitive annoyance keeps pulling you out of the otherwise enjoyable experience.			"

												Great game, captures the thrill of the movie in some moments. Now, WB games have all the sameish combat system. Batman is the ""Ballet"" version of it, Shadow Of Mordor is the ""Slicey stabby"" version and Mad Max is the ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥his face is part of that wall and i just shot someone off a cliff"" version. *coughs*. Easy to say, i like Mad Max the best, I know i know. To me Batman always felt empty, don't get me wrong i love the Batman games and SOM. If Mad Max had the ""Nemisis System"" that SOM had, i would have paid all of my moneyz for it. War boys being promoted to higher up ranks seems more likely to happen than orcs.But they would have to make Max more of a threat to Scrotus than he actually is, *hes a pretty big one anyway* And scrotus could be putting out massive rewards to kill him, i dont know. But i hope to see it in a future WB game and or Mad Max 2.Get this game and DLC, runs absoloutly fine in 4K and ultra. So theres no need to worry there!			"

												This game has too many good reviews for its own good. I can't honestly recommend it. Have doubt about all the good reviews, as this game is sadly too much sandbox and too much about graphics, anything else didn't got the proper attention. The bad things are outweighing the good things.Good:+Graphics: Even rocks are looking good.+Cars: Yeah, yeah, it's Mad Max alright.+Fighting: Have Batman/SoM style of combat, with a Shotgun and Shivs!+Sandbox: Have the sandiest Sandbox you can imagine and give it Mad Max style, done.+Mad Max: Most of us know it, most of us love it.+Controls: Simple and easy, sadly.Neutral:~Sandbox: Yep, it keeps going to be sandy with Mad Max style.~Weapons: Yeah, nothing bad, nothing good.~Mad Max: They try to fit it into the Mad Max Universe with collecting History Relics.Bad:-Sandbox: At the end are you just tired of this, with Mad Max style! Feels like you are on a island.-Mad Max: They don't even try, sometimes you can tell, they are forcing to fit into the Mad Max Universe.-Fighting: Yes, it is good, and it is bad too.-Enemies: Copy-paste Enemies in different looks in different Factions. ""Top Dogs"" are literally all the same actually.-Cars: Why take other cars?-Unnecessary Challenges: Yeah, if you manage to use the game mechanics against your enemies, its going easy mode.-Territories: Reducing the threats to get all the Upgrades, not really fun after half the game. Especially the damn Minefields, that have actually no impact, but yet are a Threat, for whatever reasons. Even enemy patrols are caring for Minefields.-Stealth: There is no stealth, the Enemies know, you are there, even if they are behind a thick wall and you have your lights off in a dark tunnel, you being in complete darkness.-Enemy awareness: The enemy knows, that you are there, don't try to hide or going around them.-Enemy cars spawning: You can keep looking around and stare on your minimap, you don't see them coming until Chum tells, what kind of enemies are appearing and then they are magical there.-Simple controls: Yep, bad point there too. Because too much is bound to ONE button. That ONE button opens doors, loot the corpses, pick up weapons, putting Finishers on enemies and to climb marked stuff. Yep, best part, the actions overlap each other. Top Dog fight, you want to finish him and...loots the corpse instead, because Reasons!-No combos: Yes, there is a lack of combos.-Scraps: EVERYTHING UNLOCKABLE is brought with Scraps. Just take Scraps to get a better Jacket! Or Scraps to get better Tires! Oh, you found the best Tires? Still spent Scraps to install it! Seriously, they tried to put Grind into this Game and that Grind is actually just a joke.-Upgrades: You must earn Tokens to upgrade Max. Sounds good, but after half the game i already have a full buffed Max, taking away the actual difficulty of the camps.-Difficulty Spikes: Yep, even fully buffed and unlocked all the Upgrades of your Car, there are missions, you hate and are FORCED to play. Best Example, the Big Chief Race, you have to change your Car to be fast and agile, and yet does the game not tell you, that you have unlimited ammo, while you try to save ammo for Gum.-Nice Start and Terrible Ending: Sounds complicated? Well, you are forced to watch a little move at the Start, that gives you the Mad Max feeling, but it is a movie, you have to wait. Then finally, after the movie, you can start playing, the tutorial, which you can't skip it as it unlocks the stuff you need to be able to do. And the end finishes off with a movie too! But that ending...terrible.-Yellow Marked stuff: Want to climb and interact with the world? Look out for yellow marked stuff, because Max refuses to touch anything else!-Unnecessary stuff: Jumping, why is jumping in the game when Max doesn't want to jump? And the forced Jimmybar, which is actually a Crowbar, just feel unnecessary and forced. What were the Devs thinking?-Sound Bugs: Yep, this exists too in the game.-Story: Won't spoil it, but to be honest, go watch the Mad Max movies, they are better.-Literal Screenshot places: Yep, there are spots, where you are thinking: Best place to make screenshot with the graphics and the special option to do so. I don't even try to find them but the game is full of them, i started to think, that the Devs wanted a Mad Max Screenshot game instead of this.-No DLC: In SoM atleast had DLCs, one in particular which gave us wonderful content to play with. But this game, no DLC, no reason to keep playing it.I played it through, i got all the Upgrades and upgraded all the Strongholds. And this game gets mediocre after half the game, as you really have nothing to fear actually. All these good reviews must had their Honeymoon phase as this game just offers Mad Max, in a Car, in a Sandbox with Objectives. Sounds like a Mad Max Movie? Atleast the Movies are nice to watch and enjoyable.In all honesty, i'm dissapointed. The start feels good, really. But at the half of the game, are you starting to wonder, why there are so many stones in the way, not obstacles, because obstacles would be atleast challenging. With the stones, you are just forced to stumble over them. And the end, UGH, so dissapointing, so stupid, so foreseeable and no challenge at all.			"

												No apologies button masher (it even directly tells you at times to “mash button”).  Gameplay is long if you want to complete all the given tasks.  You can skip by a lot of things but you end up at more of a disadvantage as you go along.  Lots of grind to make the game seem long.You’ve got only a couple buttons to worry about in the button masher and that is incredibly frustrating at times.  Want to open a gate that the game tells you to kick open? Hold “E”.  Want to open a gate that the game tells you to use a pry bar on?  Hold “E” until it tell your to “mash button” then keep hammering “E”.  Want to pick up loot?  Guess what: hold “E”.  Want to pick up a weapon, hold “E”.  Want to drop the weapon?  You’d think it’s another button but… just… hold “E”!  Want to climb a ladder?  Hold “E”.  You can probably guess you’ll be dropping things sometimes when you want to climb while holding it.  It happens way more than you’d think to the point of annoyance.  Just really uninspired gameplay controls, shameful even.  Oh yeah, want to get in a vehicle?  Hold “F”.  (You thought I was going to say hold “E” right?)Fights go the way you think.  Just keep hitting that attack button (mouse1) till it tells you to either hold “E” for a special move or repeatedly hit “E” when it doesn’t explicitly say to hold.  When you want to block it’s the other mouse button, but be careful that button also starts the targeting cycle for the shotgun so if you hold it too long you’ll start the targeting cycle for the shotgun leaving yourself exposed for some other enemy to make a swing on and you’ll never block that once the target cycle starts.  Sometimes in fights you'll get into a fight animation with one enemy and another one will start an attack and you can't block because that action doesn't follow the animation you already triggered so you'll get hit.  Happens very frequently if you're on higher difficulty to the point that you'll get killed often by enemies with no way to stop it from happening.You get the point I hope.  Lots of repeated button mashing and holding like you’re some kind of lowly console user that can't handle more than 4 buttons...I'd have no problem with it if it allowed more buttons to be used for different tasks.  If ""drop weapon/item"" wasn't the same as ""climb"" and if he'd pick up the enemy-dropped items without a 3 second animation that'd be a great start.I know it's a console port, but dang.  Just so much time wasted in fluff that wouldn't need to be there in a ""great game"", so it's a ""meh"" game.			"

												Batman: Arkham Desert is the hottest game of 2015! In it you play a man known as ""The Saint"" (Saints Row easter egg or reference to the amazing Val Kilmer movie, you decide) driving around the Mojave wasteland in a car which possesses the magical ability to defy all laws of physics! You will be entertained for hours as you battle hordes of enemies who have the exact same models and skins as each other using your bare hands, Bruce Wayne's signature shotgun, and four whole melee weapons that are useful for MINUTES before they either break or aren't needed anymore.How about engine features?! They have you covered: any time you tab out of the game and then come back to it, your resolution will be reset to whatever your desktop is at... EVERY TIME! But oh wait there's more! The only way to change your resolution is to escape to the main menu. Is that not enough for you? It gets better.... there's no save function in the game aside from the unreliable autosaves!Some more of the exciting features in Mad Max: Beyond Playtesting are being able to decimate your vehicle upon clipping a wall yet surviving a 200 foot drop off of a mountain, combatting a handful of mini-bosses who are exactly the same save for a different colored skin (unique enemies confuse me so I'm grateful for this), and being able to capture vehicles from the enemy factions which you will use in the game AT LEAST ZERO TIMES!Oh and let's not forget the minefields! Throughout the game there are patches of minefields placed in fields of dirt that you would never in your wildest dreams need to drive through and the only way to get rid of them is to SELECT AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT VEHICLE WITH NO COMBAT CAPABILITIES AND THEN GET OUT AND DISARM THEM BY HAND! OVER AND OVER! TWO TIMES PER REGION! That is replayability, my friends!Don't hesitate, dear reader! Pick up a copy of Fallout: Sydney today and enjoy the kind of repetitive gameplay that can only be brought to you by the short sighted development and rushed production that we've come to expect from Warner Brothers!

												Super short summary: Mad max is far cry 3 on a desert with a ♥♥♥♥ing cliché storyline.That is the main game I will use to compare mad max with because they really share a lot. But mad max also borrowed tons of gameplay mechanics from other games, in fact the game doesn’t have a single ♥♥♥♥ing unique mechanic. The devs only included tried and tested mechanics from other games like Batman (melee combat) but without batman’s intensive amount of tools/gadgets making the combat very shallow. Ubisoft’s Assassins’ creed and far cry 3’s watchtower replaced by a hot air balloon to view legends on the map. Repetitive encounters in ubisoft open world games replaced with scavenging locations where most of them you only need to get 1-4 actions/scrap to finish which are pretty meaningless since you’ll be overflowing with scrap anyways. I don’t get why this game has such a high rating since everything was done in mediocrity and the map is only filled with repetitive tasks. Even the ♥♥♥♥ing bosses are not unique! They are all the same with very minimal changes on the terrain you are fighting with. The skill tree and upgrade tree for you and the car is very shallow, the archangels serves no purpose but to put prefabricated cars with specific parts which is most of the time weaker than your custom car (they didn’t even put a ♥♥♥♥ing bonus for using a prefabbed car). Only 3 modes in the races and they are so boring. It is such a ♥♥♥♥ing chore to finish with its hundreds of checklist to finish, I think out of the 54 hours I’ve played, the story is only 4 hours and 50 hours was spent doing all those chores to 100% the achievements and challenges. And the story line? Easily ♥♥♥♥ing forgettable, I won’t spoil but the side characters aren’t fleshed out to get the treatment that the game had given them.Now that I have finished my rant, let’s see some of the pluses on this game. Game is well optimized, most of the time 120fps on all settings on max @ 1080p on my 980ti, but I guess it’s easy to run this game since it’s empty (desert setting remember?). Cool♥♥♥♥♥♥camera filters for screenshot and in-built recording (I know I said mad max didn’t have a unique gameplay mechanic, this is a feature not a mechanic). Andd uhhh, that’s it I guess?This game could have been amazing, they could have put survival aspects where you need to eat and drink to survive making the game even longer, they could’ve added more cars and unique weaponry and♥♥♥♥♥♥ they could’ve make each boss unique and racing duels different. But no, devs have made a very safe decision to only put simplistic designs and gameplay to it.For this, I cannot recommend the game since this is easily forgettable. If you really want to get it, get it @ 75%, you probably can get it the next summer sale since it was already on Humble monthly for $12 "

												Fun gameplay and a satisfying upgrade system. The missions get a little repetitive but it's not bad enough to ruin the experience. I recommend this game for a big Mad Max fan but it's definitely not a must-play for everyone.			"

												It's boring.The game itself has some potencial but its just not used.For getting the upgrade parts you have to clear & farm camps/scavenge locations all the time over and over again. At first no issue for me but after some time it's just damn annoying.The combat system is more or less a bad copy of the Batman Series Freeflow System. It works but for it, just doesn't feel as fluent. The story? I can't tell exactly because I struggle with continueing it. Not because of its difficulty.. more because I don't see any purpose in keep playing it.Actually I don't wonder why this game have been in the Humblebundle that often.			"

												great game, best PC port ever made, optimization is great u can basicly run it on max settings with a toaster, hardly seen any bugs! :) car & melee combat system are prob the top features in this game they look and feel very satisfying! the open world itself feels great, captures the mood of the movies , but it can be a litle bit too empty sometimes.The Main issues i have with this game are: - mainly the difficulty level (its just wayyyyy to easy...) - character updates make it way to overpowered. ( i just avoided them after a wile but it was too late, i was already too overpowered therefore the game became way too easy)The game needs a modding scene too, it would fix/rebalance the dificulty settings in the game and add new content, i hope theres any mods in the future			"

												This game is the perfect example of ""Clearly the critics never finished the game."" The number one complaint most critics had is that the story was basically ""Pimp my ride."" That was the driving force of Max's actions yes, but there are always hints that something bigger is going on, and sure enough at the 75% mark those big things become very clear.The story, like many movie plots for Mad Max, are about him overcoming a major enemy. This is layered with plenty of heralds back to his past and his family from the original Mad Max movie. If you read a review that says ""The story is nothing more than upgrading your car"" then you can stop reading that review right there, because they clearly did not even get to the 75% mark in the story.... and these people get paid to play games and review. I'll take their job if they don't want to do it right.			"

												How can so many reviewers get a game so wrong?It's baffling. The closest I can get to understanding it is to think that the reviewers missed how much depth there is to this game that reveals itself when you're just driving. This isn't so much a cutscene fest as it is a game that turns your actual gameplay into a series of random action sequences worthy of cutscenes. It might not look like it during the first 5 minutes of gameplay. You might be fooled into thinking you're in a barren wasteland filled with no one but Max and Chumbucket, but when you least expect it, the action will take you by storm (heh) and you won't want to put the game down.

												Mad Max is one of the most fun 3rd person open world RPG's that I've played in a long time. It has a nearly perfect settings menu with almost any keybinding and graphics options you could want. The gameplay both in and out of the car is also handled extremely well due to Avalanche giving you a variety of tools, weapons and ways to kill enemies throughout the game. Even though the enviroment is just a desert, it is full of life, beauty and fun things to do in your spare time such as colecting scrap, destroying camps, using hot air balloons to scout the area around you and so much more. The story is a classic Mad Max one, revenge, I wont go into more detail than that becuase of spoilers, but it is done well with many oportunities to upgrade Max and your car if you run into an area you can't beat. The voice acting is done well for everyone except for Max who is a little lack luster and doesn't feel close to his film character even though the game strives to be like the film. Other than that Mad Max is a very fun and entertaining game that will drag you back for more every time you turn it off. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did			"

												This not so popular release is pretty dam awesome and really shines a light on the Mad Max movie franchise. The vechicular combat is fast paced and fun with random encounters around the massive open world. The main goal in the game is to build the magnum opus a car worthy of travelling across the lands to find a place only know as ""silence"" where Max will be at peace with his past. The melee combat is very diverse and quite similar to that of the batman games which games it pretty cool and protrays Max as an absolute badass when he can single handedly takedown a whole camp of angry attackers. The camps in the game are similar to that of far cry , they are found all around the map and are not part of the story but you can play them just to gain scrap or ammo for weapons. Scrap is found around the map in thousands of different places that include specific scavanging sites marked on the map where the player explores a unique building or wreckage also scrap can be found in the campaign , usually hidden in corners or buildings , but to be honest there are loads of ways to find scrap and this is it a guide. I have heard many people critise this game for how its only a desert and the landscape is boring however i believe that is complete crap, the map is a baron desert that sets the realistic tone of a true apocolypse enviroment and that fact that it is boring is absurd there are so many secret locations around the map for the player to explore and enjoy without having to stick to the campaign all the time. The campaign its self is unique and different to anything i have ever seen before and it really makes the player what to spend hours enjoying the fun it has to offer. Inconclusion I believe this game is a must buy and it is a shame it was released on the same day as MGSV which sort of killed Max's hype but still you could buy this game at anytime and enjoy it i think people will be buying this game for years to come as it is diffenatly and underdog of this years top games so finally i would give this game an 9/10 as it really does stick to the narative of the movie franchise and lets the player explore what the Mad Max world has to offer without being pushed into completing specific story lines. Note this review was written 9 hours into the game and i am sure there is a lot more to offer :P Thanks for reading, hope this helped youBlade			"

												This game has a bit of a slow start and takes a little while to find its feet. However once it does, Mad Max races off with its cool post apocolyptic setting, populated by deformed people riding crazy high speed cars that look like they have been made out of 20 other cars in someone's garage. The game far surpassed my expectations and I felt it captured the essence of the Mad Max films fairly well, but also whilst also feeling that it brought some new stuff to the table and further elborated on what was already there. You start out half naked and with no car. but as the game develops you gain your own sweet car that you can customise and greatly improve, whilst you become the proper Mad Max from legend. The story is a little lack luster and the sandly rusted metal look everything has can look a little samey after a while but the gameplay certainly makes up for these inadequacies and then some. So if you are looking for a fun, open world game where you are friends with a hunch back who fixes your car for you and a dog that functions as a mine detector, then sir, LOOK NO FURTHER!!			"

												An action packed game that gives vibes of AC Black Flag and BurnOut Paradise. The story is strait forward, but what makes this game great is the driving stuff. Which is done well, both 3rd and 1st person. Here is an example of a rather random encounter. The high octane moments in this game, truly are high octane!

												Mad max takes inspiration from Arkham, Shadow of Mordor, and even games like Far Cry 3, and fuses it with fast paced, brutal car combat and an addictive progression system that absolutely NAILS the Mad Max feel and kept me engaged from start to finish.Combat - This is nothing new, if you've played Arkham or Shadow of Mordor, you'll be right at home.  The combat here is less flashy than Batman, but much more brutal and intimate.  A variety of weapons, enemy types, and combos keeps it fun throughout the game.Open World - Make no mistake, this is an open world game (think Far Cry 3), with camps to liberate, 'watch towers' to unlock, etc.  But I think this may be my favorite iteration so far.  It is a huge map, but is quickly traversed in your vehicle.  Camps, outposts and more all give you currency to unlock upgrades for Max and his car, so there is always an incentive.  And the towers, in this case they're hot air ballons, aren't just ""scale once and forget"" like they are in Ubisoft games.  You actually have to navigate to them, get them up and running, and then ocne you ascend in one, you use your binoculars to survey the land and manually scout the area.  Much more immersive IMO.Vehicle - It is a BLAST to upgrade Max's car, the Magnum Opus, and engage in vehicular combat. The cars all look incredible and the combat has a surprising amount of variety and is really fine.  It is honestly the stand out feature of this game.It does get a bit repetitive (you're essentially constantly cycling through: liberate camp, collect scrap, upgrade Max/his Car, progress main story, repeat repeat).  HOWEVER, all the activities I found to be fun and engaging.  Even at it's absolute worst (tracking down a mine field, tediously clearing it to 100% a portion of the map), the game gives you incentive in the form of a huge car upgrade that makes it so satisfying.Overall, I'd give Mad Max an 8.5/10, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had with it.If you liked the Arkham games and Shadow of Mordor, you should definitely pick up Mad Max.

												Awesome game! Great, very solid, entertaining and polished (& plenty!) gameplay! Well done open world and sooo atmospheric, especially if you like the movie(s). Nice mix between RPG/driving/openworld and a good part of 3rd-persion-action game!*Aboth all great combat-systems i kind of enjoy in every encounter:-> on foot, the feetback of the hand to hand-combat is as good as the choreography is brutal and convincing, without being too brutal or too martial-arty. The wrestling-moves and the implementation of makeshift meele- and ranged-weapons are immersive, lore-firendly and well designed. Looking good.-> in the car - great explosions and the way how you get more and more options while proceeding in the story and in the upgrades and design of your car. Quiet balanced too and especially because of that also very entertaining and sometimes quiet challenging. Action-packed and a good variety from intense to entertaining, giving u a good feeling.<-> also there are a few things that combine ground combat with driving-combat like the ""mounted"" sniperrifle in the back, the harpoon and so on. Many ways and options to bring to a fight, on foot as well as in the car.* Exploring is very rewarding and getting stuff done like looting the locations to 100% is not always easy but its also not unfair or a pain in the ***. Good mixture between not to easy but also not that hard to get annoying if u want to get the ""maximum"" out.* Technically it feels quiet good developed, looking very nice on even lower settings and running well enough on older systems (w7, nvidia gtx460m, 3gbDDR3). Graphic-settings give you good (standard) options to configurate stuff.* Controls are also well done - on keyboard like on the controler, on foot and on the car.* Great sounds! The wasteland ambience, the car/engine-noises, the massive explosions and thundering shots sniper-rifle and shotgun...and so on. Soundtrack could be a little bit more present but this is complaining on a very high level.<- only downsides so far are for me:- the ""top-dog"" boss-enemies are quiet similar to each other- the character-perks of Max u can upgrade are maxed out quiet fast, and with that the cool meetings with the mysterious guy are done quiet soon (~after completing the bootom half of the (quiet big)map). At least if you play quiet thoroughly. ! On the other hand they are all quiet useful, what is in my opinion much more important.Payed like 7€ on the wintersale. Worth this price many many times!			"

												This game is not ""original"" from a mechanical standpoint, but from a setting it is one of the most original ""wasteland"" concepts I have ever played and captures the feel of the Mad Max universe as shown in The Road Warrior, Beyond Thunderdome, and Fury Road in the most complete way a game could.This game is not based on any of the movies, but is an original story using the concepts, characters, and settings from the Mad Max universe of films. It has been helped in ""authenticity"" by George Miller wirking with the developers and if you are seeking a game to play after watching any of the Mad Max movies this is the one.If you enjoy Just Cause 2, car combat, wasteland settings, brutal fighting, and an interesting world full of over the top characters, then you should play this game.As of writing this review, the game does have many minor bugs, but most of them are minor visual things and not game breaking as well as a couple minor audio bugs. They are annoying (as all bugs in a game are) but I have only had the game crash on me twice and I think that has more to do with my old PC than anything else.Graphically this game is beautiful. I play on ""high"" settings (it also has very high, ultra, and max... heh) and it looks like a modern game should look. You might think a game that is nothing but desert would be boring to look at but they have done a great job making each area unique, yet still giving it all a desert wasteland feel.The sound is great with the engines being the most important thing. Each engine upgrade changes the tone of your car and each car that is not your own sounds different as well. The punches have that classic Indiana Jones ""crunch"" to them to give a satisfying viseral feel to the combat as you fist fight your way through your foes. The music is atmospheric and haunting when things are peaceful and dynamically switches to a pumped up rock theme when combat begins.The driving is actually quite good, BUT each car handles very differently and your own Magnum Opus needs... NEEDS to be upgraded in order to handle well.My only complaint is the mid game is so difficult due to the events as they occur that the entire difficulty of the game feels off. It reaches a cliff, shoves you off, then you relax for the last half of the game. Not balanced, and more than a little frustrating, (especially considering how long the middle sequence of the story is) but overall the game is still fun and worth a little time investment.Play it. You won't regret it.			"

I didn't know what to really expect despite watching trailers, etc. I told myself I wouldn't buy because of the recent issues with WB Games, but hell, how can you pass up on a brand new game for $36?!?!Anyways, Mad Max is a bad♥♥♥♥♥game. If you don't know what Mad Max is then you should probably go and look it up. This game is pretty much what you'd expect from the Mad Max universe. The game runs flawless, the combat is smooth, and the driving works. It's not new in the gameplay aspects but it works for what it is.

												This is a Neutral Review. I don’t fully endorse the game, but I don’t feel it deserves a negative feedback.Mad Max is visually stunning. Such a beautiful game, with a beautiful scenario and a very rich world. But hey, forget everything and let’s make a grindy reskinned shadow of mordor game! At the first glance, you will give this game a 10/10. But for me, a player that really loves lore and RPG elements, I can’t give more than a 5/10. I will give a positive vote because the game is really beautiful… but the simplistic grindy gameplay and the lack of deepness on the lore and the world killed it. I feel that this game would be a 10/10 if it had the same deepness of lore and focus on gameplay as other recently AAA had.Pros:Visually Beautiful GameVery well optimized for pcCaptures pretty well the essence of MaxCons:Simplistic Fetch QuestsLack of Lore ContentGameplay IssuesShort Main HistoryGrindy and RepetitiveReskinned Batman/Shadow of Mordor "

												Awsome adaptation of one of my favorite and most influencial movie franchises. Everything about this game is solid, it runs like a dream, looks gorgeous, brutal and fun albeit simple melee combat, that reminded me that I was at one time a fan of melee brawlers and the open world post apocalyptic bad♥♥♥♥♥supercharged car combat Ive been waiting for far too long. Now you might see some of the well know critics give this game a bad score and say things like it isnt enough like ""Fury Road"" their is not enough strong female charaters like ""Fury Road"". But this game remembers (unlike the critics) that there were 3 other Mad Max movies before Fury Road, and they were classics that have had a resounding influence on everything from movies to TV to comics, books and oh yes video games. This game is true to Mad Max, true to The Roadwarrior, true to Beyond Thunderdome, and true to Fury Road. Only thing its missing is a true hardcore survival mode like Fallout New Vegas.			"

												Overall the game is pretty good. The combat is really similar to what you would feel in Batman Arkham City or Assassins creed. The game took me about 40 hours to beat but honestly since a good amount of it is busy work it can be beaten much faster. The graphics are really good, it felt well optimized, and the controls responded well. If you are interested, you can check out my full review of the game here.

												This game is so much fun. It's like Just Cause meets Fallout meets grand theft auto. The world is expansive and there's so much to do. I really do hope there is a sequel. The only big issue I have is that I wish all cars in the game were customizable and I would love to see even more customization for Max, cars, and strongholds. Well worth my money.			"

												It's basically Assassin's Creed IV but instead of a ship you have a car and instead of a Black, well mannered Helmsman you have the Hunchback of Notre Dame as your companion and mechanic.It's a fun open world game that is really pretty and runs amazingly on lower-end systems, and shines as a graphical marvel on powerful ones. Some minor niggles with repitition here and there, but nothing that ruins the game. If you like open world games, or anything that's post-apocalyptic, this is well worth getting.8.8/10			"

												I was hesitant about picking up Mad Max simply because it's one of my all time favorite movie series, well, except that POS Beyond Thunderdome. It's typically hit and miss when a Developer tries to adapt a movie franchise as a video game (anyone remember The Thing?) so I thought I'd wait for others to influence me on this one.What video I'd seen prior to purchase made it look beautiful (as beautiful as a wasteland can anyway) and fluid from a gameplay standpoint. Around this time a fellow Member at Band of Others picked up the game and was raving about it so I thought I'd give it a try. Not expecting much, I was  completely blown away by Mad Max. It's an exceptionally well done port, plays very fluidly, has great sounds, terrific environments and in oddly fun. Vehicle combat is very satisfying particularly when you're trying to take down trade routes and the Arkham style combat is done well. The game is a bit light on story but given the fact Max isn't exactly what you'd call a story driven franchise it doesn't seem to detract from the game much, if at all. The environments are absolutely amazing and surprisingly diverse as are the camps you'll need to infiltrate to complete objectives. The one area I'd like to address though is the critique toward the looting system. Reviewers have been a bit negative toward this citing that you don't get a lot of scrap for completing loot areas or destroying vehicles (for example). I just don't understand this critique as how much scrap do you think you can get off a destroyed vehicle, it's destroyed?Also, it's a post apocalyptic wasteland so can you really expect there to be scrap lying around everywhere? I feel those reviews completely miss the point about what this story is about so don't let it guide you into not playing the game. In fact, the game does a good job of helping you collect scrap once you build up certain projects within strong holds. I'd go as far as to say that at this point the scrap system goes too far because it becomes too easy to collect scrap. Of course one can also pick issues here and there such as the game having fetch quests and that some elements are repetitive. Personally I think this is also reaching a bit as it's the recipe most Open World Games use so it's little different in this regard. Honestly, this is a very well done game that is overall just a blast to play.			"

												Awesome game. I admit that I did not expect to be so good. I love the intro and begining of story with that black dog.Pros :- excelent and detailed graphics- captivating story- interesting characters and dialoguesCons :- mechanics - sometimes is frustraiting when you try to climb on containers or other low ground objects because you must always use the ladders and chains.- the use of gun is weird, I almost died trying to use pistol because the character always put his gun in holster after each gunshot.

												First things first, I love this game. It is one of my most favorite of all time. The game has some repetitive elements, but overall, the snappy combat, the beautiful scenery and visuals, the interesting characters, and the enjoyable explorationg of this extreme-attention-to-detail world made this game an absoulute blast to play. I usually dont enjoy game that contain repetitive mechanics, but this was an exception, a dang good one at that. I honestly feel so happy playing this game and it invigorates emotions of wonder, fear, respect, and love in a world so deprived of it. I'd write more, but I'm not one of those super long write-up dudes! Trust me, for the low price you can get this game at, it is more than worth it. I honestly still think it's worth $60, but hey, thats just my opinion. Get this game!!			"

												Okay I skimmed through the other reviews real quick and I have to clear this: this game IS repetititve. There is just no going around it. You do the same stuff all the time, with minor variations in enemy types and vehicles. And it is especially repetitive if you're completing every side objective, liberating every camp etc.. It's like a huge grind. Plus, it's very easy. Once you master the fighting, upgrade Max to the max (or even before that), upgrade the car etc., you just hop from one location to the other, feeling godlike with no real challenge and you just need to grind, grind, grind.. You can make the game harder by not doing or not equipping certain things on purpose, but that's not the point.Also, if you're thinking that this is a survival type game, don't even bother looking at it. It's anything but survival. If you're doing all the side tasks, you're never, ever going to find yourself starving, without water or precious guzzoline. The resources are scarce for everyone but Max, who is living like a king, eating canned dog foot, maggots and sipping fresh water from his cantine all the time like a bawss :D.However, I generally love all things Mad Max, and I was looking for a repetitive, casual game like this to play and relax with in my free time. I didn't have any expectations, I just saw a couple of gameplay videos, seemed like fun and I got it. So the game is honestly fun and enjoyable for me. It's even fun just driving around the wasteland with your bad♥♥♥♥♥car. The combat is satisfying no matter how many times you've done it. I've probably beaten thousands of war pups, destroyed hundreds of vehicles and I'd still do it all over again. The atmosphere and the graphics are amazing, the vehicle design is awesome, the story was fun (although felt a bit short), the characters are very interesting and unique.. So in short if you're looking for a great looking, fun, casual game to play, you're not gonna go wrong if you pick this one.I leave you with a short gameplay clip showcasing some vehicle and ground combat. (the occasional frame stutters are because of a buggy recording software, the actual game runs buttery-smooth).

												Now that I've hit the 12 hour mark, I feel like I can give a meaningful opinion. I echo the rest of the positivity in saying this game is absolutely amazing with the technical performance standing out amongst all the other great elements. While Avalanche Studios is known for quality, the abysmal state of PC versions of games have dismayed and caused many, including myself, to be cautious of any new PC release, especially those with WB as the publisher. There is nothing to worry about with this game. Mad Max runs flawlessly on a wide variety of hardware specifications with even middling and low tier setups able to achieve high settings and fps. I myself play at 1440p at max settings on a GTX 970 with solid 60fps. Due to that, the graphics really shine as the game is about as beautiful as they come. The gameplay is another high point for me personally. I will say that the degree of your enjoyment of this game could hinge on how much of a Mad Max fan you are. I wouldn't say you NEED to be a fan to appreciate it, but liking the franchise will increase your appreciation for how the various mechanics at play meld with one another and how the overall gameplay is presented. The setting is a post apocalyptic wasteland devoid of traditional towns and cities. While it sounds barren, the large map is dotted with enemy camps, strongholds, and ruined areas to explore. In true Mad Max fashion, you're tasked with scavenging for scrap--the currency of the game as well as the material needed to upgrade--fuel, ammo, and water. Everything save for water is relatively scarce in the beginning, but upgrades make fuel a non-issue and ammo, if used intelligently, can last for a good while as well. Ground combat is mostly hand-to-hand with the odd weapon thrown in every once in a while. It's the same as Arkham and Sleeping Dogs, but closer to Sleeping Dogs if we're being technical. It's true that it's one button to attack and one button to parry, but between perfect parries and the upgradable moveset, there's actually more than meets the eye to fighting. In the very early hours it's so simple it's repetitive, but as you upgrade Max's moveset, it begins to become varied and a lot more rewarding. Punches feel weighty, Max feels more like a brawler than a martial artist (as he should) and the overall fighting is gritty and visceral. It's never truly complex, but it more than suffices especially after upgrades. Speaking of upgrades, all the important things are upgradable in this game--Max and his car, the Magnum Opus. You can customize Max's look, his clothes which double as armor, and his moveset in combat. For the car, you can customize your Magnum Opus to drive and perform the way you want and you can even build from preset blueprints called Archangels that compose different playstyles. I will say the driving is absolute trash in the beginning, but that is only because your car is yet to be worked on. Once you begin adding parts and acquiring scrap to upgrade, the handling becomes much better. Car combat is the other star of the show here. Since Mad Max mostly revolves around vehicles, this is appropriate. Car combat is similar to the movies with high speed chases during convoys and all the ramming, grinding, and explosions one can handle. You have various weapons to take advantage of and you can even drive in first person view if you wish. Overall, Mad Max is an excellent game for fans of the series and an equally excellent action-adventure game for those who may not be familiar with everything. It can become a little repetitive, but so can any game. Try it out for yourself!			"

												I'm going to start this review off by saying that Mad Max is an extremely enjoyable game, while also an incredibly beautiful one.  This is also coming from somebody who played through the story on a GPU that looks like a potato in comparison to many modern cards (aka the Radeon 6950).  If you have any card that is at or higher than mine, you'll be able to run the game at a pretty consistent 30fps or higher on Normal Settings, with hiccups only occuring in areas with large amounts of clutter.  Now, lets get into the good and bad of Mad Max. THE GOOD - -Funny and interesting characters.-One of the best looking games I have played.-Vehicle Combat is addictive and has a lot of awesome mechanics.-Overall, a compelling story arch.-Climax is amazing, and one of the strong suits of this game in my oppinion.-Lots, and lots, and LOTS of explosions.-Australian Wasteland doesn't feel nearly as empty as I went into the game expecting it to.-Progression feels meaningful, something that other games I've played fail to hit on the head.-Customization is done well, with all of Max's equipment and around 3/4ths of the Magnum Opus' parts being tied to progression.-NO MICROTRANSACTIONS WOOOOOOT THE BAD -9 -(SPOILER)  The ending was cool, with Max driving off into the sunset in the Black-On-Black, but left a bitter taste in my mouth when Chum and the Magnum Opus came back from the dead. -The ending boss battle was balanced poorly, and felt excessively easy in comparison to other fights.-Game became much less compelling to play after the story ended.Overall Verdict - 8.5/10			"

												If you like open world games in the style of Shadow of Mordor, Batman and Far Cry, you'll love this game. It does feature most of the same mechanics as all those games (in addition to crazy vehicle combat), but improves on most of these systems. The world is expertly crafted, extremely large and features bases that individually have more flavor and design to them than any similar games. You'll probably never get the ""yet another outpost""-feeling that you could with the FC-series, because every outpost is truely unique.Make no mistake, this game will probably not appeal to people who are not fans of the genre or have grown tired of open world games (which can explain why the press were luke-warm in their reviews), but for people who like these style of games it is probably the best one out there.

												If you're into open world games with a lot of stuff to explore, and can tolerate being in a dystopian wasteland, this game will surely deliver. The combat is on point and very similar to the arkham games (which can still feel repitious mind you), and I was suprised to find that every single enemy base had a different design. However, the game definately has some glaring flaws. Collecting scrap (the currency) can be tedious at times and while the bases explored differ in design, there's a clear lack of different enemy designs and things to do in the bases. I found the story to be alright and what's expected from a Mad Max game, but the main drive to complete story missions was just to upgrade my car rather than care about different characters. Other than that, the game is a wonderful PC port and looked beautiful with settings maxed out. There were a few sound issues and a strange bug which skipped a few cutscenes, but other than that it was a really fun experience and much better than expected.			"

												A few months after the release, it's time for a late review about Mad Max. I've heard it said that the Mad Max films are less about Max as a conquering hero and more about a passive protagonist, someone who has no real control over his own fate, someone who events happen to. In that respect, at least, the videogame version of Mad Max captures the tone of the films perfectly.Mad Max is competent at everything that it does. It has all the elements you'd expect from a game based on the franchise — violent combat, intense vehicular chases and battles and a grim world where everything that can go wrong will. It checks all the boxes for a modern open-world game too, from a sprawling 30-hour campaign to a giant map littered with hundreds of sidequests and bonus objectives.Yet there's a feeling that pervaded my time with Mad Max, a sense of everything in the game being ... okay. The films that developer Avalanche Studios are ostensibly drawing from are driven by ambition. They build visions of a world shaped by off-the-wall absurdity and chaos. This Mad Max, by comparison, feels safe and, frankly, boring.Those inevitable wins felt empty, and that's really the biggest problem with Mad Max. The film franchise has always transcended the summer blockbuster genre, providing worlds and characters and scenarios that have stuck in my mind. Mad Max the game is the opposite; it's got chase scenes and big explosions and bloody fights, but nothing to remember it for. In spite of some annoying technical issues and questionable design, Mad Max is functional, but it's fluff, plain and simple.			"

												I'm going to start this review off by saying that Mad Max is an extremely enjoyable game, while also an incredibly beautiful one.  This is also coming from somebody who played through the story on a GPU that looks like a potato in comparison to many modern cards (aka the Radeon 6950).  If you have any card that is at or higher than mine, you'll be able to run the game at a pretty consistent 30fps or higher on Normal Settings, with hiccups only occuring in areas with large amounts of clutter.  Now, lets get into the good and bad of Mad Max. THE GOOD - -Funny and interesting characters.-One of the best looking games I have played.-Vehicle Combat is addictive and has a lot of awesome mechanics.-Overall, a compelling story arch.-Climax is amazing, and one of the strong suits of this game in my oppinion.-Lots, and lots, and LOTS of explosions.-Australian Wasteland doesn't feel nearly as empty as I went into the game expecting it to.-Progression feels meaningful, something that other games I've played fail to hit on the head.-Customization is done well, with all of Max's equipment and around 3/4ths of the Magnum Opus' parts being tied to progression.-NO MICROTRANSACTIONS WOOOOOOT THE BAD -9 -(SPOILER)  The ending was cool, with Max driving off into the sunset in the Black-On-Black, but left a bitter taste in my mouth when Chum and the Magnum Opus came back from the dead. -The ending boss battle was balanced poorly, and felt excessively easy in comparison to other fights.-Game became much less compelling to play after the story ended.Overall Verdict - 8.5/10			"

												Awesome game! Great, very solid, entertaining and polished (& plenty!) gameplay! Well done open world and sooo atmospheric, especially if you like the movie(s). Nice mix between RPG/driving/openworld and a good part of 3rd-persion-action game!*Aboth all great combat-systems i kind of enjoy in every encounter:-> on foot, the feetback of the hand to hand-combat is as good as the choreography is brutal and convincing, without being too brutal or too martial-arty. The wrestling-moves and the implementation of makeshift meele- and ranged-weapons are immersive, lore-firendly and well designed. Looking good.-> in the car - great explosions and the way how you get more and more options while proceeding in the story and in the upgrades and design of your car. Quiet balanced too and especially because of that also very entertaining and sometimes quiet challenging. Action-packed and a good variety from intense to entertaining, giving u a good feeling.<-> also there are a few things that combine ground combat with driving-combat like the ""mounted"" sniperrifle in the back, the harpoon and so on. Many ways and options to bring to a fight, on foot as well as in the car.* Exploring is very rewarding and getting stuff done like looting the locations to 100% is not always easy but its also not unfair or a pain in the ***. Good mixture between not to easy but also not that hard to get annoying if u want to get the ""maximum"" out.* Technically it feels quiet good developed, looking very nice on even lower settings and running well enough on older systems (w7, nvidia gtx460m, 3gbDDR3). Graphic-settings give you good (standard) options to configurate stuff.* Controls are also well done - on keyboard like on the controler, on foot and on the car.* Great sounds! The wasteland ambience, the car/engine-noises, the massive explosions and thundering shots sniper-rifle and shotgun...and so on. Soundtrack could be a little bit more present but this is complaining on a very high level.<- only downsides so far are for me:- the ""top-dog"" boss-enemies are quiet similar to each other- the character-perks of Max u can upgrade are maxed out quiet fast, and with that the cool meetings with the mysterious guy are done quiet soon (~after completing the bootom half of the (quiet big)map). At least if you play quiet thoroughly. ! On the other hand they are all quiet useful, what is in my opinion much more important.Payed like 7€ on the wintersale. Worth this price many many times!			"

												If you're into open world games with a lot of stuff to explore, and can tolerate being in a dystopian wasteland, this game will surely deliver. The combat is on point and very similar to the arkham games (which can still feel repitious mind you), and I was suprised to find that every single enemy base had a different design. However, the game definately has some glaring flaws. Collecting scrap (the currency) can be tedious at times and while the bases explored differ in design, there's a clear lack of different enemy designs and things to do in the bases. I found the story to be alright and what's expected from a Mad Max game, but the main drive to complete story missions was just to upgrade my car rather than care about different characters. Other than that, the game is a wonderful PC port and looked beautiful with settings maxed out. There were a few sound issues and a strange bug which skipped a few cutscenes, but other than that it was a really fun experience and much better than expected.			"

												Mad Max is a fun and enjoyable game either if you like to rush trough to the end or if you like to explore and spend a long time in the Wasteland. The highlight of the game is the car combat and some of the story missions. All of the different enemy camps also have different layouts and challenges.The drawbacks is that the storyline is in the beginning and spends to much time to get intereisting, it is also short, some more story and side missions would be great. Also tanking out the smaller loot locations gets tiresome and boring after awhile, the same goes for melee fighting.The graphics are good, and there is a large range of options, so the game can run smoothly on lower end computers as well. I enjoyed the game a lot, but if you are going for 100% completion it gets a bit tiresome, boring and repetetive towards the end.			"

												This has got to be one of the greatest games ever made. The fight scenes might be repetative, the driving might not be very realistic, the scrap and historic data may be just another item to pick up, but the story, the character play the language, the entire game wants you to play more. Great game, a truly great game. Oh! I cannot remember one time a swear word was used, well done on that. I am really fed up with games using swear words. We can all use them, but is it really necessary in a game for anything other than effect? Bad language is okay, but swearing over and over again (GTAV) is but a poor story line and only there for kids or less than mature gamers ill-educated entertainment.			"

												I went into this game expecting something horrible. Really, a game based on a movie franchise that was more than 30 years old. I'm a huge fan of the movies and the only reason I bought this game was because a friend of mine told me it ""wasn't bad"".Turns out, I'm very glad I did.The only con I have is the wonky controls that take getting used to, but work surprisingly well once you do.The pros are much higher in number.A huge open world to explore with hidden treasures all over the place. A large number of optional things to do.The characters and story feel accurate to the franchise in my opinion.If you pay attention and work to collect them, you get a massive amout of lore and history that has been lacking in the movies. I'm a lore geek, I love to know why and how things happened, and this definitely scratched that itch.If you are a fan of open world action rpg style games, you'll most likely enjoy this. If you are a fan of Mad Max, you will probably like this.If you are both, Like me, you will probably love it as I did. If you are neither, watch someone else play a little, then decide if it's worth the purchase.			"

												I like this game and yes I recommend it especially if you’re a Mad Max fan. I think the issue with some of the negative mainstream reviews is that we have non-Mad Max fans expecting the wrong things from a Mad Max game. Mad Max should be filled with brutal, fast paced action and that’s exactly what I’ve experienced so far. Sure it’s not perfect and it’s true that there’s nothing new or innovative here at all but that doesn’t mean the game is trash. The driving is decent (better than most), the gun combat is ok (par for the course) but the hand-to-hand combat is GREAT (above average for sure). So far the story is decent but again it’s not groundbreaking. The marks of a good game are how well the core mechanics function. If you have a great soundtrack, graphics and storyline but poor gameplay mechanics you’ve realistically paid $60 for some cool tunes with pretty pictures and some neat voice acting and that’s not the case here. The devs did a good job at nailing what makes Mad Max, Mad Max. For non-Mad Max fans I give this game a 6/10 (just a bit above average) and for Mad Max fans I give it a 7/10 (above average).			"

												First off, the game is still has a lot of bugs that will never get fixed. Even with the bugs its actually a pretty addicting game. You actually feel like your in Max's world when you have to keep an eye out for fuel and other supplies. Some of the mission progression is a little wierd but you get use to it. There are some reviews that complain the game is too grindy, well that's what it's like in this like in this world.The game has a small variety of missions, and it does have a decent plot. You actually fell like Max is growing through the game. The enviornments are fairly varied. There are a lot of side missions that aren't required but you're encouraged to do because they give you upgrades that make the main missions easier. Everything is well connected so that a mission on one side of the world affects what happens on the opposite side.Although it isn't a great game its a fun game that you can easily sink a few dozen hours into.

												Loved every minute of it! And the scenery is gorgeous if you can handle the graphics. The gameplay is sort of a Far Cry style where the territories are controlled by the tyrant, and you can free territories by capturing camps. Also gave me a Wind Waker-ish feel traveling across the sea of sand from place to place. You gain scrap and parts along the way to upgrade your car, the Magnum Opus; and yourself, Max. You can also use any other car you find in the game, but sadly no bikes or war rigs. This is only singleplayer, however you can compare race times with friends. On-foot gameplay is in third-person, but there is the (suicidal) option to use first-person while driving. Vehicle combat feels great! Fast-paced and intense like in a movie. and the on-foot combat looks and feels just as brutal and intense! There are a few bugs like occasionally having the cursor stick around after being in the menu which can be easily fixed by quickly opening and closing the menu; another is very rarely (twice in 92 hours for me) being stuck in the menu, where I would have to turn off the game. This wasn't a big problem though since the game frequently autosaves. I've heard complaints about the game feeling repetitive, which I guess just depends on the person because I never got tired of exploding cars, chases, shooting, looting, surviving storms, and just exploring. Plus a great bit of story if you're an interested Mad Max fan. Definitely worth the Steam price, though you can find it for much less on other sites like I did :) Would recommend anyday!			"

												The game is beautiful and it rewards exploration, the car and melee combat is brutal but still a lot of fun, the levelling up for Max and the car is well designed and the enemy camps are always unique and engaging, even if the Top Dogs all sound alike and attack in exactly the same way. But...after you've cleared first Jeet's then Gutgash's territories of threat, it starts to feel like a bit of a grind as you realise you've got two more territories to clear before you'll be heading to the finale at Gastown. I do love this game, and I usually don't mind a bit of a grind to reach a few of the higher hanging achievements, but more recent nights in front of this game have been starting to feel a bit like deja vu.

												If you've played and enjoyed the Arkham series and Shadow of Mordor, picking up Mad Max is pretty much a no brainer. It features the same close combat and upgrade system as the two other games.The world and the visuals are extremely well crafted and provide the perfect Mad Max atmosphere. The game is mechanically very sound, which is no surprise considering the games it borrows elements from.For actual criticism: the game gets very repetitive. If you're a completionist, you're going to spend dozens of hours looking for that last piece of scrap in a camp that bears an eerie similarity to another camp you visited ten minutes ago and beating basically the same 4-5 varieties of goons all over the place. There is SO MUCH to do in the game that I could easily see someone spending 100+ hours to loot every camp, finish all the races and so forth. Odds are though, unless you have superhuman persistence, you're gonna get burned out after completing half of the looting objectives and will just finish the story to be done with the game.The close combat is not quite as satisfying or tight as in Arkham or Mordor, as the special moves are more generic and limited to things that counter a certain enemy type, such as Melee Reversal or Shield Shatter. If nothing else, it does make the game a touch more gritty and realistic. The countering mechanic is not quite as responsive and it is harder to read enemies. Getting hit doesn't reset your combo counter in Mad Max, so missing a counter is not a huge deal, but it takes away that certain satisfaction of getting a 'perfect combo'.The story is great; however, it is sprinkled throughout the game rather unevenly. Of my 50+ hours of playtime, I'd estimate roughly 5 hours is actually advancing the story. It is mostly focused in the beginning and the end of the game, with only a few short missions placed here and there to keep you in the story and also gate your progress by tying up access to new zones and upgrades to beating the story mission. During the majority of the game the presence of the main villain is merely implied by the presence of his lackeys, and it was not until the last hour or so of the story that I felt reconnected to the events at the very beginning.In short:+It's as close to Mad Max as a video game can get+Good Batman-style combat system+Vehicle combat provides a nice change of pace+Lots to do+Excellent visuals that lend to a great atmosphere-Optional objectives are repetitive-Combat is not as responsive as in games it borrows from-Story gets a bit thin during the middle part of the game			"

												What's not to love about a game where your main course of action is putting fists through faces of some weird wasteland psychos, pumping lead from a makeshift shotgun through metal, flesh and bone alike and pulling guys out of moving vehicles with a friggin' harpoon at high speeds!?...Oh yeah. And blow stuff up, of course.  Big time. And just imagine you can do all this in the most beautiful wasteland! Yeah, I mean it. It really feels remote and empty, but incredibly detailed at the same time. And even when some content may get a bit repetitive: there's really lot's of stuff to discover in nicely placed locations in a vast open world.A game that idolizes, no, openly worships motor cars as true saviours in this harsh world. That makes fun of some roaring monster of a modified V6 engine, because it will forever be inferior to the most sacred V8 block. And the way, the vehicles are presented and used here, is so incredibly over the edge, that all those friggin ""don't try this, always wear your seatbelt"" need for speed warnings don't even DARE to show up anytime on the screen. If Max had a seatbelt, he would rather fasten someone else  behind  his Magnum-Opus.Car crashes have never been so aesthetic and satisfying. You can almost feel the flames! 11/10 Pyromaniacs AND skilled cameramen would recommend.Only downside for some people may be, that in spite of it's awesome post-apocalyptic setting, this really isn't some kind of survival game. Even though food is rather scarce, you do just fine with your water canteen most of the time which is only used like a refillable med kit. No dehydration / hunger / bleeding whatsoever. Just refuel your car and take a sip of water from time to time. Pros:  Easy combat and overall controls. Blowing stuff up in incredible detail (even on slow machines, like...V6 engines). Vehicular combat done right. Really nice driving physics and insane combat maneauvers at the same time. The cars really handle a lot different and you can feel the overall performance. AND: First Person driving. May be unwise in some combat situation, but the camera also does a decent job, when riding your wheels in third person. No speed limits, no guardrails, just some paths for faster travel, but always the ability to go fully offroad and discover stuff on the way. (There are even fast travel locations but...b****, please. Who need's them anyways?) Nice character upgrade system (which extents to your Magnum Opus Car, which is like a character itself and totally modifiable) Lot's of stuff to do that keeps you busy. Really catches the visual style of Fury Road. Cons  Combat is fun but not that varied like Sleeping Dogs' for example. Overall a bit too easy at the moment I write this. No difficulty settings. (22 hrs. of playing. You can boost Max' skills and his car quite fast, even though West Coast Customs wouldn't be proud of you. But why not tear through a fortress like a real man, without even a shirt on? Putin would be proud..) Not really a Con for me, for this game really is fun, the way it is, but stuff like a Survival or Sneaking system might have made the experience even more interesting at certain points, but this one sticks to the action and facing the wasteland head-on, Mad Max style.In my opinion, if you are not looking for a survival game but love postapocalyptic settings, fast and loud cars and a whole lot of explosions, this one is a must-have.. especially  when on discount like the moment I wrote this review.

												This game is nothing but amazing.  It is optimized very well, unlike most games released recently.  The gameplay and storyline are invigorating and intense.  It feels like a combination of the combat from the Batman Arkham series, Tomb Raider, and some Just Cause 2 elements.10/10, would recommend.I max it with dual GTX 580's at about 80 FPS on all maxiumu settings at 1080p.

												This is an amazing game. I've only played 16 hours so far, but I am planning on playing plenty more. The only downside is that this game can get very stale at some points, especially when you need certain parts and need to collect scrap. It all becomes the same thing over and over again. For these 16 hours I have played so far it is amazing. It has an amazing combat system in the game, as well as an amazing vehicle combat system. Another great thing is that this game is not based off Gun Combat. Its more based off of melee combat and vehicle combat. Is it worth the 50 bucks? In my opinion, not 50 bucks. Maybe 30-35 at most. Get it on sale! It is an amazing game to sit down and play for an extended period of time.8/10			"

												A SURPRISINGLY good, SERIOUSLY underrated, and FANTASTIC exploration and evolution of the beloved Mad Max universe that's BURSTING with content!The 3 elements that makes this game shine are world design, exploration, and combat. The wasteland is a vast environment alive with dangers and secrets waiting to be unlocked. The combat takes what made the Batman Arkham games work and adds a gruesome and brutal flavour to it. Top it all off with an OVERWHELMING amount of activities to do and collectables to get, and you'll be playing this for DOZENS of hours.But the game is not without its faults:The main story, while closely following the formula of the films that came before it, doesn't really add anything to the character of Max himself. Granted, it's always been the world that's the main focus with Max the role of the observer, but the interactions of other characters during exploration and side missions focus more on Max, especially with Griffa. However, the story really picks up in the last half of the game.It can get pretty repetitive at times, especially with little to no variation on taking down the Top Dogs in camps. With the amount of things to do in this game, the repetitiveness can really stand out, making this game better in short sessions as opposed to long sittings.I experienced a few crashes, but they were infrequent enough to not ruin the overall game.One BIG gripe I have is how you can't fast travel with any other vehicle other than your Magnum Opus. If you want to drive any other car, you need to drive all the way over to your destination, especially when you need to use your dog for disarming mines. It's a baffling design choice to say the least.All that said, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game. I liked this game WAAAY MORE than Shadow of Mordor, which I thought was a collosal dissapointment. With the amount of things to do in this game, the recently reduced $30 price tag is an absolute steal.If you enjoy the movies that came before this, you'd have to be absolutely mad to pass this underrated gem up.

The violence, the blood, the destruction, war, disregard to human life, lunacy,decaying infrastructures, chaos and anarchy. Pretty much the same thing, the only difference is that brazil has trees and the roads in Mad Max has less potholes. Otherwise, pretty much the same!On another note, this game is a masterpiece. How the character steps on the sand, and how it shifts under his/her feet, the sky and the moon. The brightness and heat haze, the cold during the night... Details like that make this game amazing.

												First off, the game is still has a lot of bugs that will never get fixed. Even with the bugs its actually a pretty addicting game. You actually feel like your in Max's world when you have to keep an eye out for fuel and other supplies. Some of the mission progression is a little wierd but you get use to it. There are some reviews that complain the game is too grindy, well that's what it's like in this like in this world.The game has a small variety of missions, and it does have a decent plot. You actually fell like Max is growing through the game. The enviornments are fairly varied. There are a lot of side missions that aren't required but you're encouraged to do because they give you upgrades that make the main missions easier. Everything is well connected so that a mission on one side of the world affects what happens on the opposite side.Although it isn't a great game its a fun game that you can easily sink a few dozen hours into.

												My review is a little biased, I grew up with the original movie trilogy and I'm a big fan. I also have high expectations, so, maybe it balances out.Tech :Game runs BEAUTIFULLY. So far, no bugs or stutters. FPS hasn't suffered in any of the sequences yet.  Textures / shaders seem to have gotten a lot of love, but at the cost complex geometry. I think the game looks great, and the choice works for the environment. After all, it's supposed to be desolate, not a stroll through Florence. So all in all, given the lack of optimization issues, I believe it was a good call.  Story :The intro sequence is a great lead in. The overall direction has taken on a more serious tone and stepped away from some of the comedic elements of the original trilogy. Yeah, the names are ridiculous still, and that's awesome, but it does regard itself like a 35 year old franchise rather than an indie upstart. It does employ a much larger group of people, so the level of polish is higher, but without taking as many risks. I think the voice actor that plays Max sounds better than Tom Hardy. The guy voicing Chumbucket is great though, like, Gollum / Serkis great in my opinion. The character was obviously a focus for the team and feels alive. I haven't customized my car much yet, but the vehicular combat aspect of the game feels like a survival game meets Rage so far. I'll add more as I play as I'm sure the game is just starting to open up. If you like open world Assassin Creed style games and want to be the reason that War Boy's head crossed the road, it's a safe bet you'll enjoy this.			"

												I will write about the following:- Introduction -- Gameplay -- Difficulty -- pros & cons ----Introduction---Mad Max is an open world game that gives the player complete freedom over what he/she wants to do.The game is basically somewhat of a racing game where your goal is to build a new racing vehicle build out of scrap and components found in the Wasteland. While you do this, you follow a storyline where you build your vehicle part by part, adding new contraptions and tools to your vehicle. The wasteland is a warzone and your vehicle is made to participate. There are various allied factions around the wasteland that you need to help in order to get access to services which you need to progress further into the game and thus build your vehicle. Each faction/stronghold is different and offers you quests and building projects, you basically help the stronghold advance and eventually rebuild. You will take the advantage of getting a free water source, free food source, oil source, fuel source and much more.Mad Max has the Far Cry, Shadow of Mordor and pretty much the main open world aspects applied.---Gameplay---You play as a driver, you build your vehicle. As you enter the wasteland you encounter various hostile camps that you need to sweep out and take over so your allies will take over and provide you frequently with supplies. There are also plenty of sidequests and interesting locations out in the wasteland. There are various enemies and aspects in the game, you can scout a camp out before you enter, think of a tactic and take a camp over with stealth, or you can go rambo in.The main goal is to follow the main storyline, to build your vehicle.What i did most of the time is chasing wastelanders, plundering and causing chaos. It's fun as the game plays in a rather fast way. You drive, ram, and fight. However it's not like any shooter at all. You don't fire any weapons actually, most fights are done by fist fighting, while you can use your shotgun for other objectives or to help you out. Ammo is scarce, and so is water and fuel. ---Difficulty---I noticed that the game is challenging at first, but after you clear camps, remove snipers, destroy convoy's and basically control the zones. The heat will go missing and you will happen to find yourself driving around doing nothing more than stunts and drifting. I am afraid there is not much replayability, unless you start a whole new game.I hope they will release DLC soon with new areas and perhaps new objectives. Once you finish your killing machine you basically have nothing left to kill.---pros & cons-----pros--- The game is quite relaxing.- The world is pretty big- Tons of sidequests & treasure locations- Proper system optimizations, smooth gameplay.- Keeps you busy- Gives you lots of goals to choose from.(at the start mainly)--cons--- The game is rather easy- Once you pass the main storyline, there isn't much left to do.- A few bugs here and there.- There are not enough enemies.

I gotta say 8/8 from me! Lot's of people talk about there being loads of bugs, but all I've found are maggots. (it's a joke) The only bug I have found though is that I can't get into chumbucket's hideout in gastown. I wanna make his repair skill faster but it won't let me put my harpoon on the weak door outside!			"

												I listened to the Fury Road soundtrack in the background while playing this. That makes almost 72 hours of non-stop Fury Road soundtrack. I don't actually know what the soundtrack for this game sounds like; maybe it's cool? Regardless, I enjoyed almost every moment of this game. The plot is awesome, too.And hey, if George Miller doesn't wind up filming more excellent Max movies (like the Furiosa one he discussed briefly) he could just turn the scripts over to these guys and let them make another excellent game! I'd play the hell out of a Furiosa-led sequel to this.Only downsides with this game? For one, they apparently took a few of Shadows of Mordor's systems (never played it) in the base capturing, but neglected to put in the groundbreaking Nemesis system. Damned shame, because having a Warboy or somesuch become your rival and gain power and stuff every time his war party defeated Max or scored a victory against you would have been crazy awesome. As-is, you the player are generally unaffected by the world.Second, but you get the V8 engine waaaay too late in the game. The plot runs out shortly thereafter and it's unfortunate because... V8!!The last thing is that you don't have big fights on vehicles like in the movies; you fight in a vehicle against other vehicles, but never on them. It would be brutally hard to implement, but fighting atop a War Rig or something would just be... ahh. So cool. Especially dovetailed into the Nemesis system. As-is, there's a bit too much disconnect between the fighting systems and driving systems; your only recourse while driving and being attacked is to shoot or bail out... Damned shame.Still, minor quibbles on an excellent run.			"

												Mad Max has its pros and cons, but it is a great game overall. For $20 or less, you are getting a game that will keep you busy for some time. The visuals in the game are great, even on a budget PC. The upgrading system always kept me grinding for scrap. The story doesn't go into a lot of detail if you skim through the game, but reading the bios of the characters can make it intriguing.If you enjoyed the button mashing of Shadow of Mordor's combat system, you'll enjoy this one.  It's the usual one button punch, another button parry and counter, etc., but it stays simple, and the executions can be satistfying, especially for the bosses.The game can be repetitive. The scavenging areas and camps seem very similar, with the same items here and there. The lip syncing could be better as well.Great game to grab on sale, and/or if you enjoyed Shadow of Mordor.			"

From start to end the game is pretty repetitive. 4 seemless large zones. And in each zone you pretty much do the same thing. Ill tell you. If you like cars, explosions and the sound of a shotgun.

												""Oh, what a lovely game! WHAT A LOVELY GAME!""First of all, let me say that the Mad Max franchise contains some of my favorite films to date. George Miller's imagination and filmmaking is some of the greatest out there. To see the magic from the films transform into a video game is quite incredible.My experience in the game so far has been phenomenal. I was very excited to see what the game had to offer, and it definitely lived up to the hype. It stayed true to the movies, as well as being it's own adventure. Visually, the game looks beautiful. I was very impressed by Avalanche Studios to create such an immersive world, where you play as the true Road Warrior. Speaking of the Road Warrior, Max's persona is not protrayed as Mel Gibson or Tom Hardy, but redifined as his own character. The gameplay is fluid, and it's enjoyable to both ride in your Magnum Opus and beat up War Boys. Finally, the mechanics, looting, & progression systems flow very well with the rest of the game.Overall, this is a terrific game. My favorite aspect of this title is the cars, including customization, personalization, & style. It captures the true spirit of Mad Max and the cars from the films. If you love Mad Max as much as I do, then I encourage you to pick up this game. A truley worthy buy.10/10			"

												Similar in feel Assassins Creed and Batman games with an open world and lots of collectibles and things to do and upgrade. Whilst this can become repetitive I am still finding it very enjoyable. I do have to agree with others though that the game has a fairly low challenge level but thats fine because rifling across sand dunes in the thundering magum opus more than makes up for that. Perhaps not great value at full price. I managed to get this during a sale for £15 and at that price its worth every penny. Really hoping they make a sequel.			"

												Lets start by saying that I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm pretty confident in saying I've played enough to see most of it. ""Repetitive"" is a word you'll see used in almost every review so let’s just get that out of the way first, yes it does get quite repetitive, moving along.StoryYou are Max, you're beaten up and left with nothing and through some Deus Ex Machina you are given another chance for revenge. The rest of the story involves you helping out stronghold leaders so they can get you closer to your goal. You see Max wants to drive far away with his big engine and find peace. He won't find peace however until you've taken control of Max and punched and exploded your way through lots of dudes, oh and looted lots of scrap, don't forget the scrap.Gameplay - CombatIt’s pretty simple, you mash your attack button until the guy falls over, or if you want to be really fancy you can roll out of the way or parry an incoming attack and follow up with a counter. The sound effects are pretty visceral and it feels pretty satisfying to punch the first 20 or so dudes into the dirt after which it’s kind of the same thing over and over. Oh and there is a couple of 'bigger' dudes with big club weapons that all have the same attacks so even though there's so few of them it’s surprising that Avalanche couldn’t be bothered to have them be different to each other, a wasted opportunity.Gameplay - Vehicles & Driving Your ""Magnum-Opus""  is Max's signature vehicle, this is the one you'll be upgrading and customizing as well as driving it 99% of the time. You can also steal and store enemy vehicles to use in races or drive around. I'll have to say that I can't help but to feel sorry for the artists who spent all that time creating all the 'other' available vehicles as honestly they are absolutely worthless. Your ""Magnum-Opus"" has all the equipment and then some to deal with anything while the majority of the enemy vehicles don't even have a nitro boost, a total missed opportunity to integrate all these cool cars into the game much better.The vehicle customization is 'meh' with an attempt at 'balancing' your stats. This means that you can't just install the biggest and shiniest bulbar without also increasing your car's weight and in turn make it handle worse. It’s very basic and unimpressive. I would have liked to mess around more with the car side of things. The visual customization is just as bland and there’s a lack of even choosing your own colors, you're relegated to the presets which have to be unlocked by punching a big guy in his big tower or oil rig or wherever big guys make their home.I'll put this in the vehicles section as it does sort of belong here, but there is a mechanic which involves using a buggy to scout out land mines. This buggy is apparently the ONLY car in the wasteland capable of having a dog in it so you have to use it to do these insipid landmine diffusal missions. The buggy is terrible and has nothing in terms of weapons or even nitro boost, its sole purpose is to haul the stupid dog around so it can bark when it sees a landmine. Luckily these activities optional and you can skip all of them but the mechanic has absolutely no value, the landmines don't block any path they are just in the middle of nowhere and you can just drive around them.There's a bit more in terms of vehicle combat than the on-foot combat with more weapons available at your disposal. Your ""Magnum Opus"" comes equipped with several deadly weapons to deal with enemy vehicles and other environmental targets like big scary towers and the snipers which live within. The handling of the vehicles is pretty much what you’d expect, they handle much more poorly on the 'road' as opposed to going off road but are surprisingly difficult to roll over as the game takes over your dumb♥♥♥♥♥trying to ramp off a cliff and corrects the orientation of your car.I'd personally prefer much rawer, difficult handling cars as opposed to the arcade feeling ones we are presented with but of course that's not for everyone.Gameplay - General FeelYou'll be mixing up the driving and the combat a lot, and when you're not driving usually you're punching a guy. Mostly the game consists of driving from place to place, punching guys and looting their camps, oh and lots of explosions. Avalanche has at least learned something from their previous endeavors with Just Cause 2 and that is making all the camps you need to punch dudes in be unique from one another. The problem is that the things you need to collect in each camp are still the same so while all the camp layouts are different you'll still find yourself looking for the same old insignia and scrap pile over and over.Graphics & Performance The game looks really good, from the particle detail to the sound effects to the near-flawless performance its all there for you to enjoy. I really do enjoy the massive draw distance and the feeling that you are ever closer inching your way to that goal you can see over the horizon. The enormous dust and lightning storms are really well done and the first time you hit one it can be genuinely terrifying.Nitpicking  The steering wheels don't turn, come on guys Engines aren't animated in any way, as a massive car nerd this ticks me off Can't turn off the DOF, this makes the in-car camera totally worthless. Enemy vehicles are worthless and can't be customized, also a lot of copy pasted vehicles with extra 'armor' Lack of bodies for the Magnum Opus, only six are available meanwhile there’s so many other bodies used on enemy vehiclesIs it a good game though? I'm giving it a positive review because I'm still playing it and I aim to finish it. Personally I quite like it if just for short bursts of time. I don't know if I have the patience to complete everything in the game 100% because it will get old really fast. I don't see this game having any replay value either, it really is a one and done.So yeah, those are my thoughts, pick the game up when its on sale and punch and drive over some dudes. "

												The game is simple:Build your carGather scrapImprove car with scrapGather more scrapImprove moreGather more...It's practically a giant collectathon for scrap.But the thing is, I'm okay with that. Even though the whole world is filled with the same camps and objectives to complete and the repetitiveness sometimes gets a bit much, the game is well crafted with some actual love for the Mad Max franchise behind it, which is more than I can say for other movie-based games.Everything in this game in the area of mechanics and gameplay has been done before, the game brings nothing new to the table but what it does bring is a refined formula, if a tad dated.I will say though that my largest gripes were with the music and the story:The music is practically nonexistent except for very particular moments, I just expected a lot more after coming off the back of Fury Road with all those drums (and I'll be adding that kick♥♥♥♥♥♥flame guitar to my wishlist for Santa) and with this I either didn't pay much attention to the soundtrack or my expectations were too high. Either way, I always enjoy hitting up a convoy with the Fury Road ost playing in the background, adds a hellava lotta umf to the game.Storywise, it was pretty bland for the most part. After the beginning Max just feels like a very average character when compared to the dialogue of everyone else. Maybe this was done on purpose to make him stand out, I don't know, but either way I didn't really care about the story or Max until the second last mission of the storyline, but boy did it feel like a proper Mad Max ending. Left a real bitter taste in my mouth it did.All in all, 7/10. A solid game even if its mechanics have been done before. Definetly one of the best movie-games to come out in the last few years.			"

 8.5/10 Now, the reason I did not rate this higher (it would've probably had a 9 or 9.5/10 in my opinion) was because some aspects of the game were quite glitchy. There were times where I would be running around defusing the minefields scattered around the map (you have a dog which can sniff out the bombs) and the mines sometimes wouldn't appear for me to defuse. Other times, enemies would seemingly disappear completely, and I'd have to reload my save in order to actually complete the mission. But, other than that, it was a very amazing game. Amazing Story, captivating characters, cool background, a lot of diversity in how you play (my car was pretty decked out by the end) and a surprisingly massive open world to explore. There are a few characters that are incredibly influential to the game: Max Chumbucket Jeet Gutgash Pink Eye Deep Friah Hope Scrotus Stank Gum GriffaAnd, last but not least, can't leave out the good old Dinky Di, your trusty dog.These are all pretty important characters, Scrotus and Stank Gum being the two main faction leaders of the game (  Scrotus being the main boss  ), Jeet, Deep Friah, Gutgash, and Pink Eye are all leaders of their own respective territories, and I have to say that Gutgash was the storyline I enjoyed the most, closely followed by Pink Eye. Griffa is another really crucial character. You meet him early on, and throughout your journey, you collect Griffa tokens, which give Max special abilities, like being able to gain extra scrap from looting. He teaches you that the  Plains of Silence are all in your head, and you will always be there Chumbucket is your loyal Black-fingers (Mechanic) that resides on the back of your car and will repair it when it is damaged, shoot the harpoon whenever you need it, and even transport your car to you if you find that you are away and can't get to it.  He's also a lousy excuse for a friend, valuing his ""magnum Opus"" over the lives of Hope, and Glory, Hopes' daughter. MAJOR end-game spoiler Below this is a massive end-game spoiler that basically tells you the ending to the game. I highly encourage you to play the actual game instead of reading what is below. It's an amazing game and deserves the credit.END-GAME SYNOPSIS: Chumbucket is scared for the car, and goes and hides out at his sanctum. What he doesn't know is that Stank Gum and Scrotus have followed him back to his hideout and forced him to tell them what he knows, thus jeopardizing the lives of Hope and Glory, who are ultimately killed. Chumbucket is scared for the car because Max intends to take the car and drive off with it, which is not part of Chumbuckets ""divine plan."" You ultimately end up chasing down Scrotus and his War Boys out of revenge, and you get to his convoy, take it down, and at which point your car and Scrotus' car are both heavily damaged, and you use the Magnum Opus to ram the car off the cliff, which ends up killing Chumbucket, as he was on the hood at the time that you rammed it. As Scrotus' car falls off the cliff, at the last second, Scrotus bursts through the back of his truck with your car from all the way back at the beginning of the game, the black on black, your V8 Interceptor. You eventually kill him, in a bloody, gory, amazing cinematic cutscene that ends with you sitting in your car, with the picture of your wife and kid, alone in the Plains of Silence.  "

												Fun, great graphics, good car mechanics and driving.but the story is pretty meh, the game is more an open world game of territorial control. you just take out enemy camps and kill enemy convoys, nothing particularly interesting, very little going on character development wise.Theres a bit of expansion on the mad max universe thats not really mentioned anywhere else and it puts the fury road movie into a kind of context i guess, but yeah, fun but it lost me in the middle as I got sick of grinding through hoards of endless clones, the ai all look prettymuch the same, have the same voice actors ect.Sure theres factions but... i think we all know, they all behave the same way generally.so yeah, found myself losing interest after grinding through way too many enemy encampments, even with the upgrades and rpg elements that reward the grind, in the end, it was far to heavy on the grind.Good game if you like open world conquest type games where the enemy cant take territory off you.fun to drive, shoot and fight. but lacking in story.

												INCREDIBLE. The only game ive ever played that left me in awe like this was the last of us. I played for a week or so just upgrading the magnum opus and then delved into the story. Going in I was expecting a generic driving game story which consisted of upgrading your car until you could take on the biggest boss and win,But this story is one aabout a broken man who battles his true self and contains his inner humanity in order to survive the wastes. He makes mistakes and decisions that he regrets. In the end this game makes you realize how perfect writing and gameplay can tell the stoy of how a mans past can haunt him. 10/10 recomend to anyone who recognizes a true masterpiece			"

												(story complete) Mad max is a great open world game that doesn't shine often enough to be perfect. The land is scattered with a various number of optional objectives that can keep you entertained but will become repetitive over time. The story missions and car upgrade elements are very good.

												I originally picked this up to play it for the day before MGS V: Phantom Pain came out, only to find the silly UK release dates meant it came out on the same day. So, it got left on the backburner for a while. About 6 months on the backburner in fact.Nevertheless, I finished this over the weekend with about 46 hours spent. My review is positive.The storyline is about as much as you'd want out of a Mad Max themed game, probably more so in fact.The driving is decent enough, although vehicle combat never really felt great to me until quite a few upgrades and extra weapons had been unlocked, then it became a lot more interesting and enjoyable.The hand-to-hand fighting. Ok, it's not Batman. I've personally got Arkham City as my 'this does fighting best' game, and judge everything against that. This does a fair stab, and is probably on par with Arkham Origins. There's some 'cheapness' with some of the tougher enemies, who will merrily ignore the fact you're in a canned animation doing a particular special move and hit you out of it, which led to quite the blue language at times. But aside from that, you do get some genuinely nice fights where Max really does feel like an unstoppable bad♥♥♥♥♥The open-worldy-ness. It's a bit dragged out at times. Some of the objectives to liberate areas (think Ubisoft / Just Cause style liberation) can drag on a bit. Running around a sprawling base with Max's only medium-fast sprint to find some secluded oil tanks to blow up can get quite repetitive after the first few.So compared to some other games. I enjoyed both Just Cause 3 and MGS 5 more than this overall, although MGS 5 did its level best to make me hate it later on. Max started ok and generally got better over time, never really standing out amongst the top of the class, but making a decent shout for itself. "

												Is Mad Max a perfect game? No. Is it a fun game? Most definitely. If you enjoy driving around the desert and blowing stuff up, you'll enjoy this game. It also has an Arkham-style ground combat but with stricter timing and spacing and absolutely brutal animations. Upgrading your car feels like natural progression and as a result is very satisfying. However, the game, like most open world games, has a lot of collectibles and checklists. If you don't enjoy that, it will hinder your enjoyment of the game. There is a bit of variety in the various activities, though, meaning you can extend your playing time. There's also a lot you can do while driving around, or you can simply ignore it. Finally, this game works like a charm on PC. Couldn't ask for a better port.Overall, I found this game to be quite enjoyable. If you like the idea of a post-apoctolyptic driving combat game, this is for you. If you hate open world games and collecting stuff, I'd stay away.			"

												Mostly a fun game but extremely easy.  Occasional bugs will cause it to freeze, black screen, or randomly cause your character to go flying in the air and get you killed.  The driving is pretty bad with sloppy controls and small objects (rocks, barrels, etc) making your car spin out and/or go flying random directions.  Enemy cars rubberbanding throughout the game is absolutely a thing which is unfortunate since you spend the whole game trying to make your car amazing.  The melee combat is similar to Shadows of Mordor and the Batman games but it's simpler and a bit less refined.The graphics are excellent and the bone-crunching combat sound effects are probably the best I've ever experienced.  Excellent voice acting by the guy who did Chumbucket too.  Overall I think the game does a pretty good job of capturing the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max.			"

Posted: September 17, 2015
												I bought this game on a whim. Although was expecting it and had seen pre-release material, I wasn't too hopeful, given movie tie-ins and was planning to wait reviews. After a weekend of a music-festival-turned-unplanned-Mad Max-cosplaying, I decided to buy the game, my face still covered in chrome spray. Just like Fury Road to original three Mad Max films, this game follows its own continuity of sorts (although the ending suggests it might actually be a prequel to Fury Road). First off, the game looks *amazing* and is incredibly well optimised to PC. This is a statement I had seen in reviews before I bought it and thought it was just people struggling to find compliments for a bad game (""Damned by Faint Praise"") but it really looks good and runs very smooth. The distances show very well, there is little to no flickering, I have not encountered any obvious glitches. I had only one spot where the framerate dropped significantly. Flames and thunderstorms in particular look sublime.Gameplay is fairly solid. Nothing too exciting if you have played AC or Batman, as elements of both are readily apparent. Controls are a bit off. Some of the default key mapping puts commands in odd places but you can re-map them. As a whole, the gameplay is fairly shallow. Most commands are reliant on holding the E button. Or mashing the E button. Or mashing the E button while mashing mouse keys if you're fighting. Controls are stable and it is fun to fistfight, use your gun, shiv or weapons. No real issues stick out.Car controls vary but overall tend to lack handling, though nowhere as badly as the cars in Watch_Dogs did and they depend on the car you pick too. Still, without dedicated handbrake buttons and the like (though the vehicle slam button can substitute as one in some situations) the vehicle mechanics feel fairly shallow. Nitro boosts, harpoons and other abilities on the Magnum Opus make this a bit more enjoyable, almost to the expense of other vehicles. I honestly fail to see why you should even step in any other vehicles if Magnum as around. Given the abundance of interesting vehicles around, this is bit of a shame.The pre-release material touted the game's survival element quite a bit. You would need to make sure you eat and drink to avoid starving/dehydrating and would be on the hunt for guzzoline like in the hunt for Mad Max: The Road Warrior. These never really come into play. You come across food (in the form of dog food cans with a reference to The Road Warrior, lizards and rats you can kill and eat or maggots on corpses) but they are all effectively static health pickups. There isn't a real hunger mechanic or picking up and hoarding food or spending hours in the wastes looking for it. Same with water. You can carry it in a canteen and it replenishes your health. Max will comment about thirst if canteen is empty but doesn't actually suffer for it. Most camps tend to have some gas canisters and locations where the gas is part of the objective they regenerate. Bullets are rarer and easier to run out and is effectively your only resource to keep an eye on. However if you fully upgrade allied camps, you will rarely be lacking resources. Both Max and the Magnum Opus can be upgraded and customised, using scraps as resources. Most of the customisations improve abilities but some are purely cosmetic. Throughout the game, you also come across a wastelander called Griffa who has some cryptic conversations with Max, which lead to additional upgrades for Max's abilities. This allows for a degree of customisation and especially on-foot sections will challenge you even if you are fully upgraded. On vehicle, most of the fighting is fairly balanced, if prolonged. Once thundersticks are unlocked, they become a cakewalk.Thoughout the game, there are many small camps/ as well as a number of bases belonging to Gastown. Most side missions involve taking these out for scraps, history relics, upgrades for friendly fortresses. Destroying Gastown bases also reduces the threat level in the region, reducing Gastown patrols and enabling you some of the upgrades. Taking all of these out can get a bit tedious and repetative. There are many camps that are just mooks + loot with nothing specific to flesh the world a bit more (other than some history relics). The more interesting places don't really appear until later in the game (especially in the Buzzard territories) and are still rare and in between. Most Gastown bases follow the same formula with no interesting sidequests (rescuing people for instance. There are many corpses in cages. Why can't some be alive to be rescued?) The %100 completion chase can sometimes kill any momentum, as the devs seem fond of showing how clever they are by putting things in really obscure spots. As a whole, this is the weakest part of the game and I enjoyed it a whole lot more once I got them out of the way. Outside these, there are the occasional wasteland encounters (mostly wastelanders with something to tell you and occasional questgivers with very simple quests) and a racing circuit that makes things a bit more interesting. The setting and locations are a bit more interesting. As stated before, you play around the Wasteland surrounding Gastown and despite it being a desert wasteland, the creators went to some effort to make things varied. Jeet and Gutlash's territories used to be the ocean and there are plenty of reminders as you drive into a cave and notice all the dried corals or take shelter in grounded ships, giving a clear idea how messed up the world is. Heading inwards, you see go through old highways and abandoned towns. Eastwards, there are dunes which look empty but have a whole city that was buried beneath. Finally, the area around Gastown is a polluted wreck. So, kudos to to making the different locations a bit more varied. The history relics you collect give a sense of how things became the way they did and probably go into more detail about the nature of the apocalypse than any other Mad Max production so far. After a while, they don't say anything you didn't already know and could be a bit more detailed but are still a nice touch. I initially didn't have much hopes of the story but it actually didn't turn too bad. As his is getting ready to travel to the Plains of Silence, Max is waylaid by Warlord Scarabus Scrotus (son of Immortan Joe, introduced in a Fury Road tie-in comic) and loses the Interceptor, gravely injuring the Warlord in the process. Max then comes across Chumbucket who is looking to create his own vehicle, the Magnum Opus. Believing Max to be a Saint of his strange religion, he enlists Max who only helps him looking after a new car. As they look to build it, they encounter settlements that have come under attack from the Warlord scouring the wasteland, gradually leading up to Gastown itself in pursuit of a V8 engine. The earlier parts of the story are fairly standard but as it develops, it goes more and more into Max's demons and his fears of attaching to people in fear of losing them just as he lost his Wife and child and these issues come pretty heavily later in the story. Between that and the optional encounters with Griffa, the game actually goes into a lot of detail regarding Max's solitude and survival guilt. Not going to spoil a lot more but there is a reason why I feel the game is a prequel leading up to Fury Road.You won't find the charm and crazy-fun of Fury Road here. I doubt even the film sequels will have that. The characters aren't as memetic or memorable either, although the makers clearly tried to and Chum, Crow Dazzle and the Outcrier shine among the rest.As a post-apocalypse game taking place in the Mad Max universe, this is a good, solid game that will keep you busy, so definitely buy it, though you may want to wait for a discount if you have doubts. I almost regretted a Day 1 purchase but it grew on me as I progressed, so I am glad I bought it then.			"

												What we have here is a classic open-world action game, at a reasonable price. If that's not the type of game you enjoy - with its collectibles and outposts and map clearing bonanza - then you will not enjoy this game.Despite the setting, there are no genuine survival elements; aspects like health and gasoline are included in the game simply because you expect them to be. Combat is fairly simple but fun, and once you start clearing the map and upgrading, you'll quickly become a wasteland god.The game looks great and plays great. It utilizes an autosave system that is triggered when you make certain actions, such as picking up scrap (your upgrade currency, in abundance). You can bypass this when you wish to exit the game by changing the autosave slot in the menu. This type of save system is not for everyone. Speaking of exiting the game, you will have to exit to the title menu and then to desktop I'm afraid.The map is large but easily crossed in your car, and driving will probably be where you get the most enjoyment out of this game. There's nothing quite like zooming off the top of a cliff, or mowing down some enemies.There are an awful lot of controls in the game, and whilst the game is very friendly to keymapping, if you're an arrow-key player like me, you might struggle to find a remap setup that's comfortable. Story wise, the game is disappointing. You're going on an unexplained journey to this unexplained place. It seems lazy and the ending is anticlimactic and frustrating. Nobody likes a game where your progress has been for naught, especially when it's in a 'oh wait, changed my mind' fashion.To conclude: decent price, probably 30-40 hours for completionists, weak story, definitely appeals to a certain type of gamer, a very Far Cry like map system (camps, towers, etc).

												Mad Max. What can I say? A fantastic game. Let’s go into a little more detail shall we.The game itself is fantastic. The environments are brilliant, the cars are fantastic, and the fights/car battles are what make this game. Your car, the Magnum Opus, starts off as little more than a frame, your suspension is little more than mattress springs and your tires are so bald you often wonder if you think you should offer them hair plugs. But as time goes on and you collect scrap (The in game currency) you start to slowly but surely upgrade it into a formidable opponent built to see the war boys tremble and drive away at top speed in fear. The world is great. You can go anywhere on the map and do anything you want. What's that? You just saw a bunch of War Boys cooking people on a BBQ? Go and beat them up. What's that? You just saw a partially damaged car with a War Boy trying to fix it? RAM IT IN THE FU*%ING SIDE AND BLOW THAT SH*T UP!As for the characters. They're fine, nothing ground breaking. Apart from Chumbucket, that guy makes the experience. Most of them are bland and boring, but the ones that aren't are the ones you speak to more often, so the publisher obviously put more effort into these.The campaign is good, but too short. But then it does come down to how much you want to upgrade Max, Max's skills, and the Magnum Opus. If you want as many hours as I have, and I’ve pretty much upgraded everything, you'll need to put a lot of time into destroying bases, looting areas, and blowing up cars for scrap. But the end result is well worth it. The levelling up system in the game unfortunately, is flawed. You have to go to this guy to assign yourself skill points that you unlock from levelling up, but by the time you remember to go to him, you have about 20 odd points to assign, and my Max was top level at about halfway through the game. It doesn't take away from the fun in any way, just a game mechanic that just didn't fit in I think.Is this game worth £35? No, I wouldn’t say that it is (I wouldn’t say many games are). But if you look around on the internet, you can find it much cheaper, or wait until it is in the sale. Other than that, I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did. Well done Avalanche, I shall be keeping an eye out for your games in the future.			"

												On the whole, not a bad game.Orginality is scant here, particularly if you have played any of the Batman Arkham series (not surprising as it is a WB game), although the world is much more open.The openess does come with a downside, as sometimes it can feel that the game has, as a victim of it's open world design, been forced (almost slavishly) to have the need to travel great distances to accomplish a task. I'd suggest getting a few of the fast travel points unlocked as you will benefit greatly from them, especially during the latter stages.The missions are engaging, but can be repetitive, and once you have upgraded Max to the...max....you will find it incredibly easy to beat even large numbers of enemy. A small tip is to bust as many camps as you can early on so that the scrap tribute will mount up quickly. Also, choose at least one stronghold to upgrade completely to help you out if you are low on fuel/ammo/health/water etc.Without wishing to give too much away, the ending is a little depressing. However I really would have much preferred to fight Scrotus hand to hand in the final battle.A small, but annoying (for me) part was when you fast travel, you always end up with the magnum opus. Don't fast travel with scrap cars from camps, or you will NOT get the scrap. This goes for archangels as well. You don't fast travel with an archangel, even if you were in it when you entered fast travel.On the whole, the game is good, and there is enough left after you finish the main story to keep you occupied for a while.

												Heyyo, BIG RECOMMENDATION for this game. It's definitely a surprise hit of 2015. I wasn't expecting too much from this game until I did more digging to find out that Avalanche Studios is behind it... the people who brought us Just Cause 2 and the decently fun original Just Cause. I decided to get it and I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely among the best Movie to Video Game adaptations.The open world is everything that should be a Mad Max game. It's violent, lots of scavenging (even for gross food types to refill your health) and lots to do. The areas aren't super unique minus changes in enemy vehicle appearances and combat characteristics which is plenty fine by me as you constantly evolve the Magnum Opus, the vehicle that Mad Max uses for most of the game sections.The vehicles are the best part of the game which is good since what kind of game would Mad Max be if the car combat sucked right? lol... but they definitely focused a lot on getting the vehicle handling and physics right combined with the combat and it makes it so enjoyable to wreck enemies... the only gripe I'd have? Late in the game? You get barely any scrap (tbh I think it's the same amount of scrap as the beginning of the game lol) for destroying enemy cars that I found it a little tedious instead of a good way to get more scrap to keep upgrading.On-foot combat is quite smooth and it varies between basic attack, weapon attacks, countering, dodging and fury mode which makes Max really strong and can make swarms of enemies a little more bearable without making it too easy which is good… my only gripe? Mini-bosses… they’re all just reskins. Some have their own Biography in the “Bio” menu… but the exact same attacks and all that…. Wish there was more variety other than just textures. Even the Buzzards have the same thing but a different NPC model.The Avalanche Engine used in this game btw? VERY well optimized. The game looks great at max settings and can do 60fps without issues and I don’t get any dropped frames. It might also be due to less things to render since it’s a barren wasteland, but no matter where I was it ran smooth with the game making good use of my i7 CPU and two-way SLI GTX 680 2GB setup. Oddly enough? There isn’t a graphical preset for maximum graphical settings so you’ll want to manually go through the settings to max the graphics out.There isn’t much for story much like the movies but what is here is still decent and it did want me to see how the game ended. Same goes for characters. There isn’t a large cast, but the cast that is here are all quite different from each other and the voice acting for all of them was pretty darn good overall.So for fans of open world action games? Definitely play Mad Max. It’s worth it. I had about 47 hours of playtime with doing the majority of side quests and beating the game so it's got good length to it too.			"

												This game really suprised me.  This is one of those games that would have been off of my radar completely had it not been part of a sale that I saw.  I've ended up with over 80 hours in the game up to this point to get 46/48 achievements and will continue to work on the last two.In short, if you're a fan of the Batman Arkham series of games, this is a lot like those, just in the Mad Max wasteland environment.  A lot of criticism comes from the hand-to-hand combat system, which is a watered down version of the combat in the Batman games because the primary focus of combat in Mad Max is the vehicle combat, which is quite a bit of fun.I tend to be on the fence about open world style games because I'm so goal oriented but this game has lots to do and lots of goals to drive those seeking achievements.  The gameplay can end up getting repetitive but for folks like me there is that constant drive to get to the next goal despite that repitition.  The game also looks amazing and I had almost zero technical problems with it, which is impressive in today's games that tend to ship and fix later.Did I get $60 worth of gameplay from it? Yes.  Would I have paid $60 for it, probably not even though I'm making a contradiction.  The primary story can be completed in short order and the bulk of my 80+ hours comes from going after every tiny little POI and achievement in the game, which for many can get tiresome.This game is part of the May 2016 Humble Monthly subscription and I can't recommend it enough for that.  Besides that, if you can get it on sale for $30 or so it's well worth it, or if you're a big fan of Mad Max then you'll probably feel like you got your $60 worth.			"

												I feel that the most important thing I can point out about this game is that not only does it run at 60 frames per second, but has a full list of graphics options like you'd expect from a modern AAA title, and as an added bonus, Mad Max also works on AMD hardware on day one. I've been getting a silky smooth 60 frames per second on an R9 290X with all the graphics settings (mad) maxed out, and graphically speaking, it looks really good. Gameplay wise, this game feels like a combination of Twisted Metal and Shadow of Mordor, with a hint of RPG elements thrown into the mix, and I've been having a blast tearing my death car across this desert wastland.

												The only thing that I have found to be inherently wrong with this game is the lack of character or story depth, the delivery of it just seems to fall flat. The fighting and driving gameplay is tried and true. The visuals are attractive and favorably optimized as well. The open world nature of this game just seems like a size 14 work boot being tried on by a pre-pubescent plot/story. Is it just me or are there a lot of open world games as of late that are released primarily as single player focused experiences but feel like they were somehow designed to be F2P/MMOs in early beta?

												Mad max is an open world game set in the Mad Max universe. Wander the limited open world, blow up cars and destroy things.... lots and lots of things. If you are a gamer used to and enjoys open world style games, then you may enjoy this title. But be warned the map is littered with a lot of quests and there is a wash rinse repeat element in the game. To some extent I did enjoy the game, and didn't... Would I recommend the game? Yes. But with some warnings. Want more details check out the video below!

												This is a Neutral Review. I don’t fully endorse the game, but I don’t feel it deserves a negative feedback.Mad Max is visually stunning. Such a beautiful game, with a beautiful scenario and a very rich world. But hey, forget everything and let’s make a grindy reskinned shadow of mordor game! At the first glance, you will give this game a 10/10. But for me, a player that really loves lore and RPG elements, I can’t give more than a 5/10. I will give a positive vote because the game is really beautiful… but the simplistic grindy gameplay and the lack of deepness on the lore and the world killed it. I feel that this game would be a 10/10 if it had the same deepness of lore and focus on gameplay as other recently AAA had.Pros:Visually Beautiful GameVery well optimized for pcCaptures pretty well the essence of MaxCons:Simplistic Fetch QuestsLack of Lore ContentGameplay IssuesShort Main HistoryGrindy and RepetitiveReskinned Batman/Shadow of Mordor "

												BRAVO!I regret not getting to this game sooner and highly recommend it to a fan of the movie series as this follows up immediately after Fury Road. I'm a longtime fan myself.65 hours to complete all Quests, Secondary missions, and some healthy exploration. I did not finish all racing challenges and missed a few combat challenges but that could easily add an additional 5-10 hours. Upgrades on your car are notificable and hand combat is brutally fluid. The game world is wonderfully detailed and has all the right feels to Max's struggle for survival in a world torn asunder. My only complaint is using the dog to detect land mines as it could have been implemented to be not as tedious as it is. Minor complaint aside  10/10			"

												This game is a ton of fun. The mechanics are amazing, the fighting is simple but very rewarding and the driving is just tons of fun. The game is very varied, not once did I feel like I had to do the same thing as last time.The story though, it's weird. It's not a happy, traditional story. It's a sad, scary cliffhanger. It's as if the story plays out in the mind of a mentally insane person. There is nothing, there is infinite emptiness around you. Unless you can't handle a sad story, you should absolutely buy this game. For the gameplay alone.			"

												What a game, flat out loud v6/8 madnessPro's- Runs like a dream on many systems, I know people playing the game on Med systems that are using graphic cards you would second guess using for a door stop!- The Sound and effects are just fantastic, from Max pounding some shiny fools face in, to the sound of a v8 sitting idle then arupting in butal sound like a demon crawling out of hell!- Graphics. it looks fantastic, the detail of the world and even the shadows and lighting.... nom nom nom- Game play is a blast! rolling to get to one place to have a snuffle around only to run into a pack of warboys yelling trying to jump on your car! from the story line. Chumbucket is just awsome! and cracks me up laughing quite often!Con's-Jumping and climbing is rather limted. man small ledges etc would be easy to get up, but poor old max struggles...-Story line issue, when you start one, you canot drive away from the mision.... kind detracts from the open world...- Sound... Not loud enough! - Bugs in the UI and menu, could be just my end as I run 3 screens tho- No muliplayer. man if it only did! this game with a mmo option like gta5 would have been epic! Overall guys fantastic game. dont listen to the crybabies on some of the big game review sites.Mad max is shiney and chrome! and make sure you witness it!(First review. sorry if its balls)			"

												Mad Max is an action packed video game sequel to the movie Mad Max: Fury Road. You, Max are stripped of your car and belongings by Lord Scrotus. (Immortan Joe's Son) You must seek revenge on this murderous warlord but on the way meet some interesting allie and characters.  ProsAmazing battles in car and on footInteresting and beautifully made wasteland and atmosphereUpgrading youself and car is rewarding and funNever seem to get bored of driving around battling insane Scrotus War Boys or red eyed Raven men at night.ConsA bit glitchy at timesDoesn't exactly get the mad maxian feelMain quests can get a little bit repetitive but all in all doesnt really effect muchThe hyper realism they tried to get in the game did not work. The game is not very logical or realistic at timesConclusionMad Max hardly ever gets boring in battles and its endless fun blasting warboys with shotguns, to ramming them off cliffs or just harpooning them in the face. ( For people who hate endless action and find it boring  am one of those people most of the time but I find this extremely fun with its unique road combat ) The wasteland is amazing to look at an never just empty dunes. The game does glitch sometimes from graphical errors to cars disapearing. If you are coming into it a fan of Mad Max think of it more as based of the movies. It doesn't really get the feel of Mad Max but if you think of it as a independant game more than complete mad max it is amazing.9/10			"

												Not gonna lie I had a ton of fun with this game and I definitely reccomend it for fans of the franchise,  open world, and car combat games. Ripping around the desert is a blast for awhile, but I can't help but feel like there was a lot of wasted potential here.The sad fact is that like most of the big name sandbox games, there really isn't much to do in this MASSIVE world. theres a plethora of different side activities, the most memorable and fun being taking over strongholds and territories, which in it's easiest examples early-game just means crashing a gate and beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a bunch of S&M bandits but progresses to multi-tiered attack strategies which include taking out snipers and lookouts ( either by your own telescoping 6 foot barrel sniper rifle, or evading their fire till you can get close enough to rame or launch a harpoon and rip their perch down with raw horsepower which is imo much more satisfying) however after awhile even these become tedious and boring. Outside the story missions, these are really the only activities besides collecting money to upgrade your car. It makes for a pretty fun and busy game that burns out too quickly and most likely won't hold your interest through to completion.NOTE: while you're free to upgrade your car as you see fit, some upgrades are locked until a prerequisite story mission is completed. This is usually before you can afford or want the particular upgrade anyway and mostly a non-issue. However you don't unlock the V8 engine until the end of the game. This problem is twofold.1. You're rampaging around the wastelands slaughtering bandits in an armored spike covered muscle car with exploding harpoons...and a V6? Wtf kinda gay♥♥♥♥♥♥is that?2. Half of the engine upgrades are for the V8. half of one aspect of your cars upgrades aren't available till the final mission, because story. ♥♥♥♥ that			"

												Mad Max is the first game inspired by the hit post-apocalyptic franchise of the same name.  An open-world, action, adventure, with some RPG elements, it really isn't that ""unique"" of a game to be completely honest.  There is no dialog trees, and no branching storyline.  The combat is very Batman: Arkham-like, but the saving grace, the identifying feature of the game, if you will, is the importance of the car.  If you know anything of the Mad Max universe, you know that Max drives an Interceptor, named the ""Black-on-Black.""Let's just say, in this game, you aren't driving that car for some reason, and instead you build your own machine from the scrap, up.  You can customize the color, engine, weapons, suspension, tires, boost, etc... to your liking, per your completion of some aspects of the game.  You can also customize Max himself.  Outfits, hair style, shotgun, gloves, fighting abilities, etc...The story itself, I think, does so well because it is not a copy of one of the already-told Mad Max universe stories, it makes a completely new story (as far as I'm aware).  The story isn't phenomenal, or ground-breaking, but it is good.  There are a few moments that genuinely squeezed some emotion from me as a player, which proves that the game is successful in getting you invested in the characters and the story if you try and let it (this will only work if this source material is your cup of tea).The gameplay is pretty good and refined (BTW devs, what's with never telling the player there is a damn JUMP BUTTON? on an Xbox controller it's LB).  The combat system is just as good as Batman: Arkham or the standard Assassin's Creed combat system.  The graphics are pretty good, nothing groundbreaking, but good.The world size is enourmous, one of the better parts of the game.  The map size essentially requires the use of the car you build, this is part of what makes the car so successful as such an integral part of the story.  There are plenty of locations to loot (too many, honestly), mini-bosses to defeat, locations to discover and expore and strongholds to upgrade.All-in-all, the game is good for those interested.  If you aren't into Post-apocalyptic settings, you won't like it.  If you aren't into that combat style, lots of driving, big worlds, linear stories, or any combination of those, then I can't guarantee you'll like the game, but otherwise, I would most certainly recommend the experience.

												An Immediate Classic for a franchise and game in it's own out shined by games of equal quality and different genres that were released during it's release and afterwards.Max Max is a fairly standard Car Combat game a little akin to Twisted Metal, but only to the extent of moving and fighting other vehicles, and with it's polish and focus on car combat, it's focus on speed and customization makes it it's own game and keeps it unique enough to be memorable while using a story and world that promotes all the idea and basis for it's car combat all the way while having a second portion where you leave you vehicle and enter into extremely brutal hand to hand combat and occasional melee combat.Hand to Hand: Since this is from the same Publisher as the Batman series it uses a lot of what they've learned from them about Character Action and use it in the game's on foot side to grand success, I personally don't enjoy Batman, the impact isn't really there for me, but in Mad Max the game and universe where death is harsh, slow, and fast all at the same time Max goes around kicking people while their down then stomping on their head until they stop moving adding the brutality and impact that batman misses out on since he's a non-lethal Hero, in addition, Max is a borderline feral-man whole uses everything he can to win and outsmart his opponents from Shanks you collect to skills you gain to disable, hard counter, hard hit, and overall ♥♥♥♥ people up real good in a way that actually scares the warboys of the land that you will be fighting throughout most of the game.Impact can go a long way and carries the hand to hand combat from the beginning in the cinematic where it shows you from the start violence is the lay of the land and to the end that violence is all Max knows and can use to get him out of almost anything, if your interested in a good Character Action game with a lot more impact than Batman this would be ideal since it spins the formula and methods of the Batman series to advance it for the better towards a direction that gives the player a lot more enjoyment from the absolute spectacle that is Max when he starts throwing fists, handling his shotgun that they make into a Utility with limited ammo, and just gives it his all and goes balls out.Gun Combat isn't a major thing in the game, but it's there used as a one shot kill with very limited ammo that you rarely gather from people you kill, but more likely pick up from stashes and at your outposts that you help build up throughout the game, it's good, it works, not much else to say, it's competent, but not the focus of the game on foot, it can be used in a lot of ideal situations and sometimes as a solution to an issue at hand which they will kindly offer a few shells nearby for said issue every time, but not enough to use to exploit the area.Car Combat: In a vehicle you get the feeling of being defenseless early on against the drivers of the land that will throw explosives, fire bombs, and other things at you to try and take you out early on, and even in the end game you don't truly make a tank that can take everything that the world has to throw at you, so you need to fight, you need to get better, you need to build your Magnum Opis with the help of a few friends along the way, driving will get you a long way, but they can keep up, but the game offers you the ability to side ram, front ram, but not back ram but you can maneuver easily enough to get behind others and get at them from behind, you get to use your shotgun on the inside of your Car with the same ammo you carry on foot keeping it a utility across both sides of the game, along the game you'll gather more information about where and how to make your car better and gain access to new weapons, almost all the weapons can be built from the starting point as well as upgrades, but at a certain point almost all upgrades need you to progress in the story where it weaves the access to them into the story and makes sense, you won't encounter guys throwing explosives, or other things from area one, but you will as you get deeper in and closer towards your goal rightfully set from the absolute beginning.The Car Combat works out really well using the open sands, created roads, and roads from before to vary up where you'll fight and find other drivers with different gear on each one that seems to be fairly randomized in addition with their vehicles, you hit hard, but they hit hard, so you need to move fast and be agile on the open roads staying safe and slamming into them when you can, the Slamming system is comparable to Burnout where you could manually ram a car at the sides sending them into the environment causing them to crash, this isn't in Mad Max, but you hurt them weakening their car, slamming is only a smaller part of the combat where your on board weapons that Max uses and finds from the story and world are used to their best ability from a grappling hook, to a car destroying explosive rod that you both aim while driving at the same time that the game helpfully adds a lock on, and free aim system to best aim while you focus on driving, you can either dwindle the car down over a short amount of time, and destroy it that way, or take out the driver and let it roll to a stop with a corpse inside, or pulled out depending on if you use your grappling hook.Now, I'm a person that respects a game with great combat and mechanics, but the game offers progression through collecting materials [IE Scraps]from the land at various stations, outposts, strongholds, and just by-gone buildings either empty, or inhabited most of them will carry something Max and yourself has an interest in seeing, taking, or knowing about, so there is a reason to explore the land beyond just to sight see, but now the sight seeing isn't much to see, but uses it to boost it's visual fidelity and design, since this is Mad Max your not entering the streets of a city blowing civilian cars out of the way in a Muscle car, your driving across dunes, across ruined highways, and rolling over the used to be cities beneath the sand that occasionally poke up and out of giving you something to see and most of the time go to and explore, the sand is beautiful, the effects on the sand work great, the smoke that billows out of the Engines from the cars creates a disgusting fog mixed in with dirt and sand kicking up from your driving and other drivers of the land makes it feel a lot more filthy and captivating to look at, it looks and feels like a desert from Max sweating during the day, and him drying off at nights, to the open clear skies to the sand storms that roll in off the ocean bed bringing with them scrap boxes from a used to be military that offer grand reward for those who risk themselves out into the violent and often explosive high winds of a sand storm.And the story is a Mad Max Story, it's harsh, dark, and doesn't pull any punches, Max is a hard lost man and he's in a world that fits him just fine, diving too deep into the story would spoil a lot that goes on with it, the story doesn't go out beyond what we've already seen from the universe so it's not terribly unique since it's also based off a series that is in the universe that was written before this game existed so it's solid, works out, and makes sense, nothing to complain about there, it's nice and enjoyable.Overall the game is great from the UI, visuals, customization on max and his car, and just the combat overall is great, I grabbed this game for about 15 dollars a year ago and I still treasure having it in my library, while replay ability isn't something it does well since it's the same story all over again it makes up for with a great once through experience, I beat the game and lingered about at the end for about 39 Hours, so it's a decently sized game on sale and even off sale if you catch yourself pining for a game like this, it offers a lot to fans, and just people who like good games with variety.

												Mad Max was a surprise, in the gaming world at least. I didn't know what to really expect despite watching trailers, etc. I told myself I wouldn't buy because of the recent issues with WB Games, but hell, how can you pass up on a brand new game for $36?!?!Anyways, Mad Max is a bad♥♥♥♥♥game. If you don't know what Mad Max is then you should probably go and look it up. This game is pretty much what you'd expect from the Mad Max universe. The game runs flawless, the combat is smooth, and the driving works. It's not new in the gameplay aspects but it works for what it is. Highly recommended if you like Mad Max, Batman games, Shadow of Mordor, post-apocalypse, etc.			"

												Overall a nice game. A little bit thrilling and fairly entertaining.The driving is good fun, the cars are kinda cool. But using a rocket launcher and a harpoon makes it too easy  to destroy enemies. The racing isnt really racing. There's no destruction derby arena style event. The online is just a scorboard thing to upload your best time, and doesnt reward anything.The ground combat is satisfying but simple and easy to master. Spam punch and counter at the right times or roll away. Batman was better.The missions and gameplay in general is a massive grind-fest. And worst of all it's almost required that you complete all the grindy bits if you want all the character/car upgrades.The world itself is beautiful if you care to notice. The dust and sand physics are phenominal (Yeah you heard... sand).TL;DR Would have been much better as a big sandbox survival style game. Would play again though. I had fun. Worth buying if you want to drop 100 hours into something.			"

												First let me start by saying that I saw Furry Road.  I imagined the game would be similar, such as speeding through deserts, battling masses of other vehicles and such.  Also imagined having a tank car, like with actual treads.  That all being said, it didn't meet my expectations, but I haven't stopped playing it yet.  The customization is good enough, the car battles are fun, and driving around the desert may be more a challenge then expected, but that is enjoyable as well.  The fights on foot are also really fun, and become really challenging.  It's a simple formula, but one that is used well.  All in all, this game is well worth having in a collection, especially if you love the idea of free roaming, no rules, and amassing enough power to become a total boss.  The rush off speeding down the road, spotting an enemy car heading in your direction, and just ramming him head on, tearing right through him in a huge explosion.  That alone was worth $10.  Beautiful.			"

												Rating 8.2/10Mad max is an excellent game with a lot going on. Every aspect of the game is enhanced by the dirty post-apocalyptic setting and the majority of missions and events to partake in are fun excursions.Upgrading Max and his car will keep you on the lookout for that next pile of scrap, and defeating Max’s opponents (and enemy bosses) feels rewarding. Join me as I take you through some of the basics of the game and one of several boss fights.

												Great game that runs great on PC.The driving is good & works fine with keyboard & mouse. You can customize your car in looks, and ability. Make something suited for speed, or make a tank. You have a buddy who can aim & shoot missiles, grappling hooks, and repair your car for you, giving you many more options when it comes to car combat than usual.You can customize Max as well, mostly in terms of linear upgrades & abilities, but these all add new cosmetic changes to Max along with being able to customize his beard & hair.The world has a great size, with lots of little things to do in it. Side quests, upgrades for you, your car, and civilian settlements, along with finding water & fuel to stay alive and stay driving. In terms of graphics, it all looks very nice. Heatwaves over the horizon, & explosions that look great.The on foot gameplay is good too. You can fist fight enemies very similar in style to the Batman Arkham games, & you can pick up weapons to do special moves and do more damage. You block, parry, and eventually get into 'fury mode' I think it's called, which lets you break through enemy blocking & do more damage along with special finisher moves. If you have the ammo, you can always just shoot your way out of a melee combat situation since you have your trusty shotgun at all times, along with some other gadgets.This game is pretty well done, & is a great representation of the Mad Max universe in game form. It's not perfect, & there are plenty of silly, weird, and unrealistic things in this game, but Mad Max was never known to be without all that. I definitely recommend.			"

												I went into Mad Max with absolutely no hype- I bought it on a whim 'cause GreenManGaming had a promo on which saved me $10ish off retail ( hurray $CDN :( )Anyway, the game's a lot of fun.  Driving the cars feels good, the fighting is a-la-arkham so you'll either love it or hate it (near the end, I chose to just shoot and stab everyone because a fully loaded shotgun + ammo belt makes Max a walking Guns-n-Shivs-r-Us.)It's a big open world that you can do whatever you like in- and progresses nicely with the story.  It truly is vast and for being out in a sandy desert is pretty varied.Ammo, Guzzaline, Water and Food are how you survive out in the wasteland-- and all of them are waaaaay too easy to find.  You can also upgrade strongholds to provide free top-ups of each.  Upgrading Max makes the game really easy- which makes the hand-to-hand combat tedious, and if you decide to thunderpoon every vehicle you see, the car fights are also boring.Sounds like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing more than praising-- sorry.  The game is PRETTY and has a camera mode which is fun to play with.  It's also optimized AMAZINGLY for PC-- kudos for Avalanche/WB for this, it's not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port.  I have a GTX 960 and was nearly at 60fps all day long on the highest setting, the only time it dips is when you're inside a small dark area and using the flashlight.The story's not bad and fills in what happens right before Fury Road (the movie.)I'll liken the game to Assassin's Creed II-- a bit more varied than AC1 for sure, but there is a lot of repetition.Also, the boss fights suck.But who cares, you can upgrade the Magnum Opus into a sexy dune basher and burn all over the desert-- as speedy or as tanky as you personally like.I didn't really understand the point of the Archangels at all-- by the time I could build one, I had gear better than what it provided.  Meh.I recommend Mad Max if you like open world, car driving, face bashing, apocalyptic kill-em-alls' and don't mind grinding to improve your car for the sake of posting sick screenshots of you setting♥♥♥♥♥♥on fire.Buy it when it goes on sale.

												Mad Max is casual beat em up mixed with destruction derby,bit of racing and all of that is spiced up with some soft rpg elements. I really enjoyed it, game runs well even on office computers, looks great, environments are suprisingly variable enought to keep your eyes entertained and most importantly its fun. Unfortunately game have its flaws as for some reason it gets quite boring and repetetive during longer gaming sesions, however if played in short doses(1-2 hours per day) as i did it its enjoyable and i was looking forward my evening game sesion every day since lunch time to become mad max for hour or two;-)If you like Mad Max movies and looking for casual entertainment for evenings then the game is pefect for you. However its not one of the games you can spent whole day with and still have fun. Shame there was not more sotory and wastelnad missions as they were giving whole game a purpose and all of them are well designed and i think i ll even remember some of them for a long time.Verdict: 7/10 ... however its glorious 7, shining in all its greatnes, not the average seven whitch is often given to not so great games and if you like Mad Max movies, then this game is a must as its a great expansion to the whole series.

												Bought this for £5 in a steam saleGet this if you like:- Driving, exploration and collectibles - The meaty sound of car with a V6 or a V8 as it smashes through the exploding husk of another car- A simple bit of carnage *PUN* - Simplified Batman Arkham series combat where you just beat people to death, simple yet satisfyingIts a good cheap buy and a great for little bursts of fun "

												I was hesitant to buy this game after the ficaso with Batman Arkham Knight. I am glad I did though because even if they share the same publisher, Avalanche have optimised this game more than the PC version of Arkham Knight! I have a FX 8350 and an R9 270, running it smooth 50-60fps, Ultra @ 1080p. The story is a bit lackluster though, as in my 9 hours of playing the game, all the campaign seems to be is ""find more upgrades for the car"".Pros:-Awesome vehicle combat-Customisation is brilliant-Beautiful-Optimised!Cons:-Story is a bit dull (so far)-On foot combat is just button smashing(Can't remember if you can update reviews, if you can I will update when I have completed the campaign)			"

												9/10 An absolute blast to play. Having a bad day? Load Mad Max and crash head on into a speeding car! Rip someones tire off then run them down when they get out of the car! Beat someone bloody and go into a blind rage curb stomping the holy heck out of them. The combat is polished and very well done. It actually gets me somewhat pumped taking on large groups. Anyone who has played the batman series will be somewhat familiar with the combat mechanics. Blood, explosions, high rpm cars running at top speed, it's only missing some sexy women in cute outfits to be absolutely crazy good.The one draw back I have is the storyline missions are somewhat unpolished. They feel like they lack some crucial information and leave you wondering, in certain parts, where you go or what you do next. All in all, though, I would very much reccomend this game. It's an absolute smashing good time.			"

												First things first, I love this game. It is one of my most favorite of all time. The game has some repetitive elements, but overall, the snappy combat, the beautiful scenery and visuals, the interesting characters, and the enjoyable explorationg of this extreme-attention-to-detail world made this game an absoulute blast to play. I usually dont enjoy game that contain repetitive mechanics, but this was an exception, a dang good one at that. I honestly feel so happy playing this game and it invigorates emotions of wonder, fear, respect, and love in a world so deprived of it. I'd write more, but I'm not one of those super long write-up dudes! Trust me, for the low price you can get this game at, it is more than worth it. I honestly still think it's worth $60, but hey, thats just my opinion. Get this game!!			"

												Awesome game. I admit that I did not expect to be so good. I love the intro and begining of story with that black dog.Pros :- excelent and detailed graphics- captivating story- interesting characters and dialoguesCons :- mechanics - sometimes is frustraiting when you try to climb on containers or other low ground objects because you must always use the ladders and chains.- the use of gun is weird, I almost died trying to use pistol because the character always put his gun in holster after each gunshot.

												What, a movie tie-in game that's actually really good at being Mad Max-y, and good at being a game?The good:-Manages to faithfully capture the atmosphere (and weirdness) of the Mad Max movies down to fine details while also being a fun game. It's like they watched the films and thought ""oh wow, that bit would be really fun to do, let's figure out a way to work that into our game"" - I imagine the convoy bits are one of those, as when I saw the films I always wanted to play something like that... chasing after a big dust cloud in the distance, closing in on it, taking out each car one by one as the situation allows (some of their cars are weak enough that you can yank off their tyres, or take out their doors then charge up and shotgun them in the face, or just ram them off the road at oppurtune moments) or just dashing up to the lead car to take it out while being bashed and honked at while guys with bizarre face paint leap onto your car, with the roar of about 10 V8s in the background. Glorious!-Oh, and the several other parts of the game which are basically all the bits of the film you'd want to do (hint: TWO MEN ENTER, ONE MAN LEAVES!). Half of the car upgrades are tied into side quests or challenges too, of which there are many, so there's plenty to do (though little variation, but i'll get to that).-The environments are surprisingly mixed for what's basically one big desert so it doesn't look samey after an hour or anything.-Car customisation is very good, and fun, with thousands of possible combinations. Mods for armour/defence add weight (so hurt speed, grip and handling) so it doesn't always make sense to just max out everything unless you're happy with a middling all-rounder (which looks badass though, so there's that).-As others say, it runs really well for a console port (sad that this has became something of an exception), my computer's showing its age but runs this on medium settings with no problem (apart from very rare 4-5 second freezes, oddly).The bad:-The story kiiind of meanders a bit and isn't much, but then none of the Mad Max films had deep stories, more of a... I don't know, a backstory that told itself (from the freakshows that are the characters, hints in dialogue, and the general scenery) while the events on screen played out? That's not to say they're shallow, all-action films (i'm sure it's about 30 minutes into Mad Max 1 before there's even any dialogue), just that if you're looking for a story to follow, you won't find much of one. It's not noticeably *bad* at all, just meanders a bit, but that's Mad Max (as a series, or ""franchise"" to use that dreaded word) for you.-Combat (hand to hand) is a bit... samey. Even if you're surrounded by bad guys it's easy as you just have to parry when you see the symbol and you can almost avoid getting hit entirely (unless there's tons of them, in which case it's hard work keeping up as 2-3 of those can be trying to hit you at once) - despite several enemy types with different strategies, it still mostly comes down to 'parry when you see the symbol, a couple light hits then a strong hit to finish'. You're invulnerable during finishing moves too. So yeah, fights are mostly an obstacle rather than a challenge, but not unenjoyable.-The missions are pretty repetitive - pretty much all you'll be doing is drive somewhere, blow something up, beat up some bad guys, job done. Sometimes there'll be a boss. Otherwise you'll just be pulling down sniper towers or scarecrows with a harpoon. (That aside, it's strangely addictive, ""i'll just clear out this enemy camp then go to bed..."" [5 hours later] ""...oops"")-Possibly a nitpick, but slightly awkward menu system that was clearly designed for consoles, PC-ised as an afterthought. The controls ingame reflect that too, so take a little getting used to, but not really a problem after you're familiar with them. Funnily enough there's controller support but you can't use both without third party software.-Oh, one last thing, really minor, but don't waste points upgrading fuel efficiency. You're blasting a V8 around full pelt in a heavy armoured car, yet a full tank lasts over an hour of abuse. And fuel is fairly plentiful despite the films making a point of it being a sought after commodity.That's about it really. I should stop since I've already written too much. Had to try hard to come up with bad points (they're mostly bit nitpicky, as admitted) so on balance, I really enjoy this game and have been recommending it to a few people. Have 31 hours in it currently and can see myself happily putting in another hundred, or however long, to 100% it.TL;DR - Yes.			"

												Mad Max: Fury Road was my introduction into the Mad Max Franchise and I have enjoyed all the movies (Thunderdome had it's moments too). I picked up this game because I wanted to be Mad Max and the thought of making my own car sounded very fun. Now, there are better reviewers and reviews out there, this is one of those ""just some random fan"" reviews. If you want to get a very thorough review with lots of brevity, go find one of them. Making the car just gave me all sorts of joy in my heart, each engine upgrade gave the purr that machine made another depth, like a lion as it grows older has it's roar deepen. I opted for speed and maneuverability over power and strength. I think the game did a really good job of balancing car combat with physical. If you liked the Arkham games combat, then you might like this game. Not really as many gadgets, but you can take on a group of guys and still make it out on top if you're on your game. Setting up ambushes with gas tanks was super fun. I enjoyed the acting and dialogue, some of the characters annoyed me to no end, but some people annoy me to no end. Like many games, it can get repetetive at times, take a break and come back! In a strange way, however, this is one of my complaints: there is no new game + option or any option to reset some forts, caravans, etc. THAT was what made this game for me. Chasing down a caravan with my souped up car was just ALL sorts of madness and mayhem with a little bit of bedlam mixed in. Clearing out forts was another of my favorite activities. Should I sneak in and go all secret agent style? Or ram open the gates and start unloading with bullets and explosions? Or make it all about my fists of fury?! I freely admit, I avoided one character: Griffa, so I had none of the health or water/food upgrades. That made fights a lot more about wits and smarts as opposed to health attrition. I enjoy games that make me work. So all in all, if you enjoyed Fury Road and you like the idea of beating war boys into a bloody pulp, or racing along the oil slicked roads and pulling tires off of cars or drivers out of the driver's seat at 150 klicks per hour, then buy this game. If it's on sale for $15 or cheaper and you haven't purchased it yet, then you must be mediocre.			"

												In truth I both recommend this game and don’t. You see for every good mechanic there is a negative, here are some examples: -	The game has a lot of side activities to keep you occupied, but these are repetitive with laughable variety.-	Extensive customisation of your magnum opus, but you can only achieve this be completing many aforementioned repetitive side quests.-	An okay story, but some missions are locked away until you complete some side quests and only the ending is really that memorable.-	The game is well optimised with impressive graphics, but the whole game is set in a desert and graphics shouldn’t be a defining feature of a game.-	The game features survival elements such as water, food, fuel and shotgun bullet, but food and water are only for health, fuel is plentiful and every one of these items can be immediately restocked at any upgraded base.-	You can enter and collect enemy’s cars for fun and to become disguised, but why use an obsolete car when yours can be upgraded on they fly, equipped with all weapons, be summoned from anywhere and is invincible.In conclusion and considering the low price I would have recommended it as there is nothing noteworthy but nothing disappointing, but upon my attempted 100% completion I ran into three separate glitches which prevent me from achieving such a thing:A outpost would auto last improve, a character won’t register in the bios and a quest won’t complete, because of this I cannot recommend.

												First let me start by saying that I saw Furry Road.  I imagined the game would be similar, such as speeding through deserts, battling masses of other vehicles and such.  Also imagined having a tank car, like with actual treads.  That all being said, it didn't meet my expectations, but I haven't stopped playing it yet.  The customization is good enough, the car battles are fun, and driving around the desert may be more a challenge then expected, but that is enjoyable as well.  The fights on foot are also really fun, and become really challenging.  It's a simple formula, but one that is used well.  All in all, this game is well worth having in a collection, especially if you love the idea of free roaming, no rules, and amassing enough power to become a total boss.  The rush off speeding down the road, spotting an enemy car heading in your direction, and just ramming him head on, tearing right through him in a huge explosion.  That alone was worth $10.  Beautiful.			"

												repetitive doesnt mean anything anymore.  Everything you do is satisfying and for a purpose, far far far more satisfying than assassins creed.  If you don't enjoy suping up a death mobile and killing skags to do so then dont buy this game.  If you do or just love Mad Max its totally worth it!!   This is a $40 game, if you pick it up for any less you got a deal.  Partical effects are FANTASTIC.  Sitting on the side of the road waiting for chum to fix my ride when an atomic storm washes over you is simply awe-inspiring, i havent experiences anything in a game like that EVER.  Real debris n lightning smashing into you and your car, awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Love the story, keeps true to old and new visions of franchise.  Hand combat is strangely satisfying even though I cut my teeth on this style in AC and Batman Arkham titles and Max is no batman or altair so missing a punch is all too real and can be devastating.  That being said timing a power punch as a baddie charges head first into your fist is glee inducing.  Im very happy with this title.  WITNESS ME!!			"

												Excellent Game! Picked this up on sale and was really surprised at it's quality. I didn't hear a lot of hype around this one, probably because it was associated with a movie. I too thought, ""Meh, movie games suck"", but figured it looked mindless and fun to drive around in.  As I played through, I kept saying 'Oh that's really neat', or 'wow, that was awesome'. There are a fair amount of polished mechanics, all playing together nicely in a beautiful little sandbox. I play on a medium rig and it played great, no crashes, only a few scenarios where I had any slowdown even. Graphics are top quality. I think the art team and level designers did an epic job of creating a living world out of a bleak wasteland. There are always amazing vistas and cool locations to find and explore. There are details scattered around everywhere bringing backstory, context, and a lived-in feeling to the world. Oh, and storms. Yeah storms are impressive, and dangerous. There is no gear or car you are going to get that'll make them less-so. It's a gamble staying out in one, but visually, it's pretty great. There are also loot crates blowing around in storms that you can hook with your car's harpoon gun for scrap metal. I put in some extra time doing objectives and exploring before really getting into the main story. All of the above are fun and while there is a little bit of grind, it's really not that noticeable if you're enjoying the basic activities of driving around and surviving. You'll run across all sorts of situations that provide resources and introduce you to the local political bodies. There are plenty of missions to run, factions to align with, and 'bad dudes' to bring the hammer down on. The major factions have fortress-like bases that can be upgraded for further functionality.  In terms of games, it feels like Just Cause 2, Borderlands 2, and GTA 5 had a really good looking baby. The sense of mobility is pretty high, especially once you upgrade your primary vehicle. The various tools and weapons you can use often invoke a 'Max Payne' style slow motion mechanic that allows you to pull off some pretty wild stunts and combat moves.  I can't really complain about too much. I'd have felt my money was well spent for 30$ and I spent way less than that, so I'm happy. Even the story was decent for what it was. There's enough of a characer arc to be engaged, but vauge enough to still just be Mr.MaxWhoever guy. He's emotionally struggling and busy surviving. The characters in the world are more defined and most are well played, animated, and scripted. The little 'black-finger' mechanic guy who rides around on your car fixing things is a great example. He's funny, a little unsettling sometimes, and actually usefull to the gameplay in a number of ways. The story is there, but not overplayed. You wont be spending hours in extended cutscenes. There are some, but they're short and in context. I'd really like to see a larger follow-up. The tech and the team produced solid work here, and it would be cool to see what they could do with another project. All said, I can fully give this one a thumbs up and say it's worth the purchase. Good for driving enthusiasts, desertified terrain specialists, makeshift weapon hobbyists, meteorologists, and gamers who like action games with a large world and lots of vehicles.  "

Fantasic Game!Ages ago when Mad Max came out I really wanted to play it, however I didn't have the power and grahics needed to play on a PC and was already disapointed. But luckily this year I have built my own with a 970GTX graphics card and i5 6b00k intel processor was just what I needed. So now since I got the game in the sales I was pretty happy with myself.So the game itself is a long and large world to do and take a bunch of scarp. I mainly aim towards my stronghold goals which I feel means progression and also having the function to get scrap whilst off the game is such a useful upgrade which you must get!I haven't got through the story alot other than access the second stronghold, But already I can tell through design, mechanics and the story of the game is something I will be looking forward to! I know this isn't enough advice but rest-asure that you must buy this game!			"

												Game is awesome. Graphics are amazing and my janky computer could easily run it on a smooth 60fps on (very)high settings. It's an open-world game which has cars, imagine Wreckfest on drugs. It has full controller support so my xbox wireless controller worked great. I'm yet to finish the game but I'm 8 hours in and my oh my the game has been great so far. I definitely recommend it.			"

												I'll give Mad Max a thumbs up, but the predominant sentiment that I take away from it is that it could have been so much better.There are moments of brilliance here padded by many hours of rote tedium. Mad Max's open world is filled with many things to do, but too many boil down to the same thing.  Past the half-way point, the game increasingly felt like it was populated more to meet some quota of ""things to do"" than to be an engaging game first and foremost. This wouldn't be too terrible if the side missions were largely avoidable, but the main storyline progression is fairly reliant on the resources and upgrades they provide.Beyond the lack of variety in the general gameplay, there are several little annoyances, such as unskippable mini-cutscenes that occur for basic tasks such as filling Max's canteen or eating (which is equivalent to picking up a medkit).  These are short, but even so, they will happen many dozens or even hundreds of times of the course of the game, and even the tenth time I saw Max go into the same exact mini-cutcscene of him scarfing down some dog food, it was already too many.The combat too, has problems.  It's ""Batman combat"", but unlike every other implementation of this combat I've seen, you can get hit while in the middle of an attack animation and counters are not an immediate interrupt.  This has the effect of making it somewhat more challenging, but in a way that feels cheap.  When every other game featuring this style of combat lets you break out of an animation for a counter, it feels broken when one game doesn't.  While I enjoy this style of combat, it is inherently repetitive, so the fights needs to be relatively quick to resolve and not too frequent.  Mad Max breaks both rules, you'll get into likely hundreds of fights over the course of the game and the enemies take quite a lot of hits, making them drag on too long.  This signiciantly contributes the game's feeling of tedium.So what's good about the game?  The car combat for one.  Your car is a bit fragile at first, but building it up into a viable combat machine is rewarding and taking down conveys was always my favorite part of the game.The game also does a great job of capturing the setting and making everything feel a bit unrealistically outlandish in a way that's quite intriguing, just like the films.The success of the setting is also helped by the excellent graphics, which can be maxed out on a GTX 970 at 1080p and still maintain a solid 60fps. (Feels like a while since I've played a major title where you can do that...)All said and done, I certainly don't regret the time I spent with the game, but I feel it would have worked better as a shorter, more focused experience.  Still, if you have any affinity for the Mad Max movies or its particular flavor of post-apocalypse, it's worth picking up on sale			"

												Great and very atmospheric game which gives the whole Mad Max-franchise a nice addition. Was a bit afraid at first that a wasteland dessert would be a boring theme to travel through the majority of the game, but instead it plays as you really are trying to survive all the madness which lies beyond. The combat is familiar but works great, amazing soundtrack and the level design is really well done. I'm struggling with a few cons such as the size of the map, which is in my opinion a bit too small. I'd like some more areas to explore or territories to conquer (or they might've gave the Dunes more use). And another minor struggle I encountered is that, even tho the scrap material to level up is scarce, you are pretty fast max leveled on your character (in my case it was half through the game). Next to that really a great game, glad I played it and really recommended!			"

												All around, this game was better than I expected it to be. I will admit, I saw the movie, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and fell in love with this series. So much so, I was really worried this game couldn't live up to the Mad Max legacy. I can and will honestly say, I readily stand corrected. Driving around the numerous vechicles, driving the customizable Magnum Opus, destroying Scrotus Camps, beating the living hell out of anyone who stands in your way, it all felt smooth and fun. The combat is rather close to that of the Arkam series and manages to add that ""Mad Max"" grit to it. I will say, the narrative is well a bit lack luster. However, the Mad Max movies and series has never been defined by their great story and plot development. Therefore, I think the story actually falls in line well with the theme of the movies; just be aware that you won't be getting LOTR quality story telling. Despite the lack luster story, the characters aren't half bad. You surprisingly grow attached to your hunchback mechanic, dog, Max, dude who blows sand in your face, and so on. To end this review, I will highly praise this game for the open world they built into this game. They managed to take a lifeless barren desert, and turn it into a lifeless barren desert with a lot to do. The desert is beautiful and has a good mix of gruesomeness to it. You can see the story of what was there before the water went away. This is a very well done open world map and will surely keep you busy and exploring. I would definetly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Mad Max. This game will easily give you a good amount of hours and good memories. One last detail I am adding in now, as I just found out about it myself, is that there is a photo capture mode. A very smooth and detailed system that allows for a lot of versatility in taking screenshots.			"

												The Best: Graphics / EnvironmentThe world is beautiful.  Everything from the environment, lighting, sandstorms, textures on the cars and rock faces are gorgeous.The Ok: StoryIt's nothing to write home about and it is nowhere near the level of George Miller quality but it's not a deal breaker.  The Worst: Gameplay. It feels like Assassin's Creed with cars.  By the 9th or 10th time of doing the same ""go to this area, access this balloon to see rest of map, kill / infiltrate this camp, do it all over again in new part of map"" it gets boring.  I found myself not wanting to go back because I knew the ""collectathon"" that I was about to endure.  Verdict: For $10 on sale, it wasn't a wasted purchase and fun for the initial trial but by the time you hit the ""main game"" it just felt like a waste of ""drive here, find this, do this, do it all over again 20 times.""

I feels like a console port or it was optimised for lesser computers. This could have spawned sequels if it had been more polished such as Witcher 3, it should have had various difficulty settings, NPCs should have been better written, the the in game textures could have been so much better, it should have been open to the modding community.All in all, this could have been SO MUCH BETTER.

												Mad Max, though made after a movie, is an excellent game, probably ranking one of the top of my lists. The only problem I have with it is the lack of end-game content. Perhaps if (and I mean when, I think we all know) Avalance releases some real expansions for this, it's gonna just be amazing. The feeling one gets when they are driving at such velocities, watching the terrain race by.. especially when one is chasing a convoy in a type-2 storm. Lightning everywhere, can't see worth crap, cars ramming you on all sides and you got that one jackass with the flamethrower out in the front... badass.			"

												17 hours in and I am loving this game!   I definitely recommend it, but only to a certain type of person..I am concious that I:  - Love Mad Max (since the original films)- Am a petrol head who enjoys the visceral grunt of a V8, lots of smoke and flames- Am not bored of Batman style fighting games - only dabbled in Arkham and didn't buy Mordor- Have enough OCD to feel compelled to collect stuff, but not every last little scrapIf you fit the above, then this game is amazing and you probably shouldn't worry too much about the negative stuff people are mentioning.  The driving, fighting, sound and graphics are all so gritty and heavy hitting that, for me, the endless ""busy work"" - go collect stuff here, is a good excuse to drive & batter my way through the environment - with the random encounters adding more happy carnage.  The cars are excellent, there are some very nice little details and if you're a purist, you can choose to look just like Max of old - with a clunky Interceptor and leather jacket.The design, artwork and audio assets are extremely good - as is the variety of the mini levels you complete on foot - at least for the most part.  Compromises - for me, so much HUD clutter does hold back from the immersion  .. as does the ability to fast travel, but being an old PC gamer, I'll hold on to hope that someone can mod this kind of thing in the future.  The other thing I'd like, if modding becomes an option, is less ammo, water, food etc.  I never really feel like I am scrabbling for precious resources like the game suggests you should be, but maybe this comes in later in the game.  The missions aren't too bad I thought, Mad Max the movie isn't exactly well known for it's intricate script, but the characters fit the bill with their simple crudeness etc and some of the banter is very Mad Max-esque and amusing.  There are a bunch of gamey unlocks with little narrative - eg.  Do this epic jump - why?  Just because you can.  Does it make me think badly of the game? - no.  If (IRL) I had a raging V8 practically immune to fall damage and a giant ramp in the middle of the desert - I'd jump it just because it was there too.Concerns - being only about 25% of the way through, my main concerns are - upgrades come pretty fast in what is already a fairly casual friendly game.  I'm no hardcore insta-kill fan, but the lack of difficulty and speed of upgrades is a worry.  Note that you can probably avoid taking skills & upgrades that speed up progress to increase difficulty, but it's not a particularly immersive solution.Performance - I had a GTX 650 and while it ran ok and looked nice, fights in detailed areas with storms going on would slow the action down to slo-mo.  It's not unplayable, by any means, actually rather cinematic, but I saved up enough scrap for a GTX 960 and it runs like a supercharged V8 on ice now (very very slick on maxed settings). "

												I'm not good at making a reviews but this one deserve a positive one, anyways...The game reminds me a lot on Shadow of Mordor, of course this one is a different universe at all, but what makes them similar is almost same open world (Mad Max one is bigger i believe) and alot of stuff to do outside of story mode (making sure u take control of some camps and similar stuff which still have more content to do than Shadow of Mordor).Even tho there are guns in Mad Max compared to Shadow of Mordor, you will rarely use it and use melee fights instead much more (or of course car fights if the missions allow you that, and both are pritty much fun to me).I didn't progress so far to review it, but based on price i paid for the game (5$) this is actually one of best buys i ever made for money mentioned.Extremly fun if you are a Mad Max fan, 8/10 from me due to lack of originality from other games.

												I absolutely love this game, it's easily one of my top ten games of all time. It't not really because of combat or the gameplay itself, I love the atmosphere and remnants and the way life used to be. Max himself pushes people away and doesn't do things unless it benefits him. This game nailed his personality perfectly. He is looking for peace while struggling with the world and his past. The fighting is a toned down batman type of combat, but the driving combat is really fun. Similar to twisted metal in a sense. All in All this game is a really well rounded game and deserves a chance to be played, especially since it's only 10 bucks at the time of this writing.

												I'm not good at making a reviews but this one deserve a positive one, anyways...The game reminds me a lot on Shadow of Mordor, of course this one is a different universe at all, but what makes them similar is almost same open world (Mad Max one is bigger i believe) and alot of stuff to do outside of story mode (making sure u take control of some camps and similar stuff which still have more content to do than Shadow of Mordor).Even tho there are guns in Mad Max compared to Shadow of Mordor, you will rarely use it and use melee fights instead much more (or of course car fights if the missions allow you that, and both are pritty much fun to me).I didn't progress so far to review it, but based on price i paid for the game (5$) this is actually one of best buys i ever made for money mentioned.Extremly fun if you are a Mad Max fan, 8/10 from me due to lack of originality from other games.

												If you're a fan of the franchise and the MM world, this game is a must get. Just like how Rocksteady made the perfect Batman experience with their games, Mad Max creates the perfect post-apocalyptic wasteland-drifter gasser-crazed western experience. Set in canon with Fury Road, you have a vast (and truly huge) wasteland to explore, hundreds of things to do, a wide array of customizations, and a world to discover which lives and breathes and feels real.If you like post-apocalyptic games, hot rods, the Batman Arkham series, Mad Max, sandbox games with a huge immersive world and plenty of things to do, this is the definite game for you.If you like story-oriented games with a tight plot but have little interest for the things mentioned above, you should skip. The game is lighter on story (just like Fury Road was) but is V8-pedal-to-the-metal-polished-in-chrome heavy in the details and the small touches (just like Fury Road was) that can make all the difference.What a game, what a lovely game.

												Decent enough for a movie tie-in (prequel to Fury Road).... but, it could have been so much better.....PROSBeautiful graphics, stable frameratesDecent voice acting, and some memorable charactersInteresting storyline,  the events lead up to Fury Roadworks better when using a controllernice, interesting terrrain, mostly open world sandboxConsRepetitive combat and farming missions, rinse and repeatvehicles other than Max's serve virtually no purpose, other than as collection/racing piecesvehicle control and combat is pretty sketchy (with KB), will tend to oversteer and miss many good opportunities for carnage.you will fight the game's camera control almost constantly, as it will reposition itself whenever it chooses (also force focuses on things IT deems noteworthy)H2H combat suffers from same as above.very little incentive to replay/contine game, one the main storyline is finished. (2nd run boring, 3rd a struggle, can't bring myself to complete a fourth)Tl:drgame is good enough, buy it when it's on sale.If you like the Mad Max world, It's worth it just to experience the storyline.If it wasn't set in the Road Warrior universe, with max as the character, it would be another generic car/combat sanbox game.

												I'm driving into the middle of the desert, I know a heavily armoured convoy is coming from some direction but not which. I place a single gas canister from the back of my Magnum Opus on the dirt road. I drive off, parking on a nearby cliff and switching places with Chum Bucket as I load my sniper rifle. I can see the convoy coming, the large dust clouds trailing six cars. I train my sniper on the center of the gas canister and BANG, just as two cars drive past they explode in a cloud of shrapnel seconds later. I switch players with Chum, the wheels turn tearing up dust behind me and I'm off. I cut across the desert planes and intercept the rest of the convoy, shooting my harpoon into once car as another drives straight through it hits the harpoon wire, flipping over and on its top. The last guard car spins out in a rolling dusty blaze of glory as my double-barrel shotgun removes its tire. With the guard gone the convoy car is easily destroyed with some old fashioned ramming and two shotgun blasts.			"

												Good game, would easily give 4 of 5 stars.The good:Much like the movie, it is unapologetically fast-paced action, vehicles smashing, vicious jaw-breaking punches and many things exploding. A good violent romp around the wasteland.Vehicle upgrades are fun, and the various characters that you encounter are quite cool.The less good:It reminded me a bit of Shadows of Mordor in a lot of ways- particularly in the sense that by the time I had a good few interesting upgrades, I was already most of the way through the game, so quite soon I was buying them just for the sake of it rather than to progress through the game, and overall the further I got into the game the less challenging it became- it should be the other way round in my opinion. Also, the Top Dogs (bosses) are all exactly the same, with the same bodies and faces, same weapons, and exactly the same tactics to defeat. (Wait....Dodge...Punch hard while he gets his balance.) This was disappointing. The camps get pretty boring too- snipe, fistfight, blow up transfer tanks, and repeat.On balance, well worth acquiring. "

												Very fun, I enjoy the driving and all the aspects of combat. It has a good challenge and level up system,  good customisation and a good story with lore and links to fury road. Chum Bucket is funny and alot of other characters are good ( better than max). The only real problem is the last mission of the main story where -SPOILER- you end up losing your car youve spent the whole game working for and you kill your main companion. Don't worry though, as they return along with all the other dead characters to allow you to complete the side missions and all you are given is a little text box. This seemed quite half arsed how they brought them back but apart from that its a great game.Also, the fuel loss from driving is basically non-existant, Ive driven across the whole map with less than a sliver of fuel lost, but that might be due to my car.

												Looking for life after Borderlands 2? Well Mad Max is very much like that, open world, quest lines, and secondary quests. Grapics are great, It is a great game to whittle away the hours, It is far from the best game in the world, but the game itself in a whole is good. Although the game does work on 3 screens (Nvidia multiscreen) some of the in game functions do not work. So i would highly recommend just the 1 screen (i am running 1920 x 1080) and it is still a beautiful game. Do i recommend this game?

												It lacks some vehicle custom options, but still is a fun wastelant adventure as Mad Max. The reason why vehicle customizing is not that good is because you just increase its performance and nothing more. You get a few options to change the paint job and vehicle shape, but that is it. Also other vehicles you can steal from enemies are pointless as far as I can see. They do not have all the robust options as your main ride does. You also can can't your vehicle while out in the waste and one vehicle is a must for completing the boring mine field clearing side missions. I don't see why they didn't just make the main vehicle cabable of detecting mines because switching to anything else is really pointless.Enemy AI is painful... in a good way. they try run you over if you are unlucky enough to get cought outside your car. If they get tired of trying to run you over they will park and start trying to fight you. I had taken out a lead cars wheel and caused to to pull over and its whole convoy pulled voer with it. They all got out of their cars and started to run at me. So encounters can varying depending on how you fight and wether or not the AI wants to pull over and punch your face in.			"

Although the story isn't the best and without an epic ending, it's still worth every penny for me because of epic effects and graphics. Free-roing around and blowing up multiple cars with one thunderstick just makes the game for me. :D10/10 would recommend!			"

Product received for free
 A great game for a great movie! Mad Max has been know for its plethora of movies, with Mad Max: Fury Road being successful, and now Avalanche Studios has brought more to us fans; producing a game that is much grittier and provides many players with a lot of gameplay.StoryMad Max takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, where people struggle for resources such as water and pride themselves in their vehicles that they use as a means of defense and transportation. You play as Max, a man with who wants to leave all the chaos behind and find the ""Plains of Silence""; unforunately you can't easily find this place and Max has to fight in order to achieve his goal, you must build the greatest the greatest combat-vehicle with the help of your partner in order to fight back.GameplayWith my playing this game, I've had lots of fun with it! The whole world itself is really beautiful, from the massive hills of sand to all the waste and other post-apocalyptic looking environment, Mad Max does it well. What really stood out to me the most was the combat system, being really similar to the Batman Arkham game (especially with the chance to upgrade your character), I enjoyed the combat a lot and had fun with it. Another thing that stood out was the car combat, at first you may find the controls for the car being a little bit clunky but you'll soon get used to it while you also get a chance to modify it. The world of Mad Max is vast and there's a lot to be seen. This game is greatly optimized, I run the game high with a GTX 750ti.OverallMad Max is a great game and although the story lacks (such as character development) it's made up for by great gameplay that has many people playing it for hours (I'm not even done yet)8/10 "

												Mad Max is one of those games your not sure you like or dislike.  First what I like about the game.  Graphics are nice and I like the cut scenes.  Action is both vehicular and on the ground bare knuckles fighting.  I like the variety.  What I don't like is there seems to be to many cut scenes and I feel channelled into a mission rather than doing my own thing.   If you dont like to make your own decisions and want to be led this game is for you.  It will still challenge you but I can only give this game a 6/10 for lack of roleplay elements in the game.			"

Hand to hand combat is engaging and responsive, leaves you want for more every time you kill the last enemy. Car battles are simply insane, i very much enjoying it. Strongholds expansions really improve the way you play i would advice focusing on all upgrades that give you scrap. All in all game is great, if you like assasins creed and carmageddon, thats both games in one. It's definetly worth a buy.			"

												Simple game, simple story, beautiful graphics, and wonderful sound.  Mad Max is not the most complex or difficult game on the market, it is just a fun game to play.  It is repetitive, sure.  When you drive from point to point, you get chased and/or attacked.  Welcome to the wasteland.  I'm told the fights are pretty easy. However since I don't normally get large amounts of free time, my play is usually spread out over months or years.  Keeping the keys simple makes it easy to pick this game up and jump back into the fray - without memorizing lots of combo's.Just a fun time - play for a while as a break.  Retake the wasteland.Still trying to earn my V8....Total recommendation!			"

												This game met and exceeeded my expectations. I am 17+ hours into the story and have enjoyed every minute of gameplay. Equal parts vehicular and hand to hand fighting make for plenty of action. Lots to do and explore without feeling repetitive. The reply value is very high right now, but not sure if that will continue once I complete story mode. I have definately gotten my monies worth on this purchase and have yet to see any DLC yet.  Looking forward to any additions and would support a sequal to this game.Most Fun?Customizing your Magnum Opus and character Max as you progress. The car and Max change as you add abilities and parts and they are immediately felt and seen as upgrades on both your toon and car. THe landscape is visually stunning and the sound of the engines are immaculate.Least Fun?Small quirky bugs are miniscule for me and does not affect the gameplay overall. Sound will cut out for a few seconds when resuming after a pause.  Sometimes I will have diffculty using the jump mechanism. Not all stronghold perks work as expected.  These are not game breaking or changing problems and havent hurt my enjoyment in the least.			"

Sztori még annyira nem indult be, bár másfél óra játék után gondolom még nem is fog nagyon, de nem baj az, mert a játékélmény eltereli róla a figyelmet.Mindenkinek ajánlom. :)Grat az Avalanche csapatának!!! \m/			"

												It's like Batman: Arkham Knight and Fallout had a baby, and it was immune from the bugs of its parents.  Oh, and it had a car.Amazing graphics, very optimized and smooth engine, visceral combat, open world, and a great story.  Seriously - Buy this game.  And the movie's good, too.			"

												The game takes elements from the game-winning recipe of Assassin's Creed and Batman AA, AC, and AK.  There is a lot to do in the game for the hardcore completionists so there will not be any lack of things to do.  Fortunately, even with the vast amount of unrequired exploration spots each one is unique unto itself.  The gameplay is great and if you played AC or Batman you'll pickup on the controls quickly.  The story is rich and very enjoyable and it is that which truly sets it apart from being just a copy on the standard recipe.  At least play it through for the story.  At most, enjoy the detailed richness of the grim environment, story, and darkness of a true post-apocalyptic world (that isn't based on zombies).			"

												This game is about a guy named Max and he is mad.  He has many emotional problems and deals with them by punching people to death.  His best friend is a hunch back that may be a little gay for Max.  (Which there is nothing wrong with)He drives a car/tank, that he constantly tries to getting into using the wrong door because he forgets that he is not an American.He can also carry thousands of pounds of scrap metal in his pockets.  I heard a story that he once jumped off the Empire State building and only sprained his ankle.  -Bill Braskey The game is solid, and looks amazing.  Highly recommend it.			"

Amazing work Avalanche studios, your game is pretty much flawless. 9.5/10 the main story could have been a bit longer.			"

												This is an amazing game. I've only played 16 hours so far, but I am planning on playing plenty more. The only downside is that this game can get very stale at some points, especially when you need certain parts and need to collect scrap. It all becomes the same thing over and over again. For these 16 hours I have played so far it is amazing. It has an amazing combat system in the game, as well as an amazing vehicle combat system. Another great thing is that this game is not based off Gun Combat. Its more based off of melee combat and vehicle combat. Is it worth the 50 bucks? In my opinion, not 50 bucks. Maybe 30-35 at most. Get it on sale! It is an amazing game to sit down and play for an extended period of time.8/10			"

												Mad Max, though made after a movie, is an excellent game, probably ranking one of the top of my lists. The only problem I have with it is the lack of end-game content. Perhaps if (and I mean when, I think we all know) Avalance releases some real expansions for this, it's gonna just be amazing. The feeling one gets when they are driving at such velocities, watching the terrain race by.. especially when one is chasing a convoy in a type-2 storm. Lightning everywhere, can't see worth crap, cars ramming you on all sides and you got that one jackass with the flamethrower out in the front... badass.			"

												A SURPRISINGLY good, SERIOUSLY underrated, and FANTASTIC exploration and evolution of the beloved Mad Max universe that's BURSTING with content!The 3 elements that makes this game shine are world design, exploration, and combat. The wasteland is a vast environment alive with dangers and secrets waiting to be unlocked. The combat takes what made the Batman Arkham games work and adds a gruesome and brutal flavour to it. Top it all off with an OVERWHELMING amount of activities to do and collectables to get, and you'll be playing this for DOZENS of hours.But the game is not without its faults:The main story, while closely following the formula of the films that came before it, doesn't really add anything to the character of Max himself. Granted, it's always been the world that's the main focus with Max the role of the observer, but the interactions of other characters during exploration and side missions focus more on Max, especially with Griffa. However, the story really picks up in the last half of the game.It can get pretty repetitive at times, especially with little to no variation on taking down the Top Dogs in camps. With the amount of things to do in this game, the repetitiveness can really stand out, making this game better in short sessions as opposed to long sittings.I experienced a few crashes, but they were infrequent enough to not ruin the overall game.One BIG gripe I have is how you can't fast travel with any other vehicle other than your Magnum Opus. If you want to drive any other car, you need to drive all the way over to your destination, especially when you need to use your dog for disarming mines. It's a baffling design choice to say the least.All that said, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game. I liked this game WAAAY MORE than Shadow of Mordor, which I thought was a collosal dissapointment. With the amount of things to do in this game, the recently reduced $30 price tag is an absolute steal.If you enjoy the movies that came before this, you'd have to be absolutely mad to pass this underrated gem up.

												Very fun, I enjoy the driving and all the aspects of combat. It has a good challenge and level up system,  good customisation and a good story with lore and links to fury road. Chum Bucket is funny and alot of other characters are good ( better than max). The only real problem is the last mission of the main story where -SPOILER- you end up losing your car youve spent the whole game working for and you kill your main companion. Don't worry though, as they return along with all the other dead characters to allow you to complete the side missions and all you are given is a little text box. This seemed quite half arsed how they brought them back but apart from that its a great game.Also, the fuel loss from driving is basically non-existant, Ive driven across the whole map with less than a sliver of fuel lost, but that might be due to my car.

												BRAVO!I regret not getting to this game sooner and highly recommend it to a fan of the movie series as this follows up immediately after Fury Road. I'm a longtime fan myself.65 hours to complete all Quests, Secondary missions, and some healthy exploration. I did not finish all racing challenges and missed a few combat challenges but that could easily add an additional 5-10 hours. Upgrades on your car are notificable and hand combat is brutally fluid. The game world is wonderfully detailed and has all the right feels to Max's struggle for survival in a world torn asunder. My only complaint is using the dog to detect land mines as it could have been implemented to be not as tedious as it is. Minor complaint aside  10/10			"

												Guys, this is one of the best games ever made. Here's why:Pros:1. The game world is enormous and full of interesting things to see. You know how Far Cry 3 / 4 tends to recycle a lot of content to pad the game? All of the small, relatively unimportant locales where one finds scrap and other things are uniquely designed. They are all different from one another.2. In Mad Max the side jobs are tied to the main quests and the weapon and vehicle unlocks.3. In Mad Max all collectibles are tracked, so it's easy to know where to find them, yet they are not simply dots on a map. You still have to search.4. The vehicle and character customisation are extensive and really give you an edge.5. All combat is interesting. The stronger Max becomes, the more enemies are thrown at you. There are loads of enemy classes with different patternst and behaviours. Try spamming the attack button many times, and see how many times you die. You have to think quickly and efficiently to fight proficiently. Also, you cannot heal during combat. :)6. The game has an amazing way of making you feel weird in certain areas. For instance, there is a slum-like shanty town where you can ""feel"" the sickness and squallor as you go through. I don't want to spoil so I won't go into too much detail.7. A surprise to me, but the story is fantastically well written and well paced. The characters are great as well.8. The storms are proper intimidating the first time you encounter them, and awesome.9. Well contextualised mechanics: food and water are used to heal Max, gas runs vehicles and generators.Cons (this is me knit-picking!):1. A few audio and UI bugs that break immerision a little, like when you don't see some HUD elements cause they vanished, or like when audio entirely disappears.2. Annoying fall damage and respawn system. You'll see how sometimes you'll slip off of a cliff to your death because of the on-foot locomotion being so meh. While this isn't too aggravating per se, it's terrible when you spawn country miles away from where you last were.3. Some vehicles you have to use in races are annoyingly poor in the handling department, which can cause you to have to restart said races multiple times.Conclusion:This is one of the best games I've ever played, and it's clear that most of the game reviewers gave a very superficial look at this game. Play it,			"

Genre: Open worldThis game is very easy to describe. It has really good and addicting combat, that is basically spamming attack button with occassional counter button. Driving is pretty fun. You can upgrade Max's abilities and cars too. Story is pretty boring and generic. Game consists of endless scrap collecting, and it's insanely repetitive. Basically you go to one location to kill some dudes and to collect scrap so you can upgrade and you need to repeat this process endlessly. It's not a bad game, but not good either. Fun to play, when you want to kill some time, and it can be pretty additictive, because of awesome combat.Pros:  -Awesome combat -Amazing portCons:-Extremly repetitive-Boring storyPersonal rating: 6.5/10 "

												I'm driving into the middle of the desert, I know a heavily armoured convoy is coming from some direction but not which. I place a single gas canister from the back of my Magnum Opus on the dirt road. I drive off, parking on a nearby cliff and switching places with Chum Bucket as I load my sniper rifle. I can see the convoy coming, the large dust clouds trailing six cars. I train my sniper on the center of the gas canister and BANG, just as two cars drive past they explode in a cloud of shrapnel seconds later. I switch players with Chum, the wheels turn tearing up dust behind me and I'm off. I cut across the desert planes and intercept the rest of the convoy, shooting my harpoon into once car as another drives straight through it hits the harpoon wire, flipping over and on its top. The last guard car spins out in a rolling dusty blaze of glory as my double-barrel shotgun removes its tire. With the guard gone the convoy car is easily destroyed with some old fashioned ramming and two shotgun blasts.			"

												Early verdict? It's a game about crazy people blowing crap up in the desert, made by the Just Cause studio, whom I think may feel religiously obligated to put grappling hooks in everything they touch.Max fights crazy wastelanders on foot. It's like Sleeping Dogs without the Kung Fu.Max fights crazy wastelanders in a car. It's like Burnout with a shotgun.Max fights crazy wastelander propeganda with his car and grappling hook. It's a little like Just Cause 2 and Red Faction: Guerrilla. TL:DR: They took bits of a bunch of good open world games, and made a good open world game about blowing stuff up in the desert. 5/5 stars, would waste limited commodity fossil fuel to blow up warboys again.﻿			"

												Overall the game is pretty good. The combat is really similar to what you would feel in Batman Arkham City or Assassins creed. The game took me about 40 hours to beat but honestly since a good amount of it is busy work it can be beaten much faster. The graphics are really good, it felt well optimized, and the controls responded well. If you are interested, you can check out my full review of the game here.

												Awsome adaptation of one of my favorite and most influencial movie franchises. Everything about this game is solid, it runs like a dream, looks gorgeous, brutal and fun albeit simple melee combat, that reminded me that I was at one time a fan of melee brawlers and the open world post apocalyptic bad♥♥♥♥♥supercharged car combat Ive been waiting for far too long. Now you might see some of the well know critics give this game a bad score and say things like it isnt enough like ""Fury Road"" their is not enough strong female charaters like ""Fury Road"". But this game remembers (unlike the critics) that there were 3 other Mad Max movies before Fury Road, and they were classics that have had a resounding influence on everything from movies to TV to comics, books and oh yes video games. This game is true to Mad Max, true to The Roadwarrior, true to Beyond Thunderdome, and true to Fury Road. Only thing its missing is a true hardcore survival mode like Fallout New Vegas.			"

												I dragged a guy with a harpoon for like 7 miles. Ran over cars, jumped off cliffs and went through a tar pit. Yup, I checked, guy is still dead.   But seriously, I have the Phantom Pain and Mad Max is truly open world where Phantom Pain in my♥♥♥♥♥is not. Also it has better control optimization for PC. I like my keyboard and mouse and dont want to be forced to use a controller or rediculous keybindings. All in all the game is one of the best I have played in years. Story was mildly engaging for me since I am a Mad Max fan.  I imagine most systems would not have any issues keeping up with this game. I have a good rig, 32Gb Ram, latest and greatest AMD board and processor and a 970 GTX. Can play it with my settings all as high as they can go at 60 fps.			"

												Good game, would easily give 4 of 5 stars.The good:Much like the movie, it is unapologetically fast-paced action, vehicles smashing, vicious jaw-breaking punches and many things exploding. A good violent romp around the wasteland.Vehicle upgrades are fun, and the various characters that you encounter are quite cool.The less good:It reminded me a bit of Shadows of Mordor in a lot of ways- particularly in the sense that by the time I had a good few interesting upgrades, I was already most of the way through the game, so quite soon I was buying them just for the sake of it rather than to progress through the game, and overall the further I got into the game the less challenging it became- it should be the other way round in my opinion. Also, the Top Dogs (bosses) are all exactly the same, with the same bodies and faces, same weapons, and exactly the same tactics to defeat. (Wait....Dodge...Punch hard while he gets his balance.) This was disappointing. The camps get pretty boring too- snipe, fistfight, blow up transfer tanks, and repeat.On balance, well worth acquiring. "

												Only complaint is the only Australian characters in the game is Max and a few idiots you talk to around the map. The accents are often hit and miss and sounds like the one of the only Aussie voice actors was Max himself. Right at the start of the game the fact Dinky -Di was miss pronounced pulled me right out of the expereience. All the main NPC's are American Architypes, The matriach, the preecher, the psychopath etc, Considering this is ment to be an Australin Story it seems more like you are driving around in Nevada rather than Australia or the United States Of Australia. The Story is very light but luckly for Avalanche and WB I found the car combat too fun. Kind of reminded me of interstate 76 but cooler. If Avalache and WB where a little more respectful of the Mad Max universe I would have enjoyed it more but instead Mad Max is becoming Americanised. It woudl have been nice to see some Aussie characters in the game instead of the tired old American ones we see plenty of in film and TV.			"

												Mad Max: The Video Game. I don't normally do reviews but on the occasion I play a game worthy of a review, I will.First thing to say about this game, do not be afraid of the minimum requirements!Straight after checking the graphical settings and finding them all to be set to high, I clicked the 'new game' button and began to worry as I thought my pc would struggle to play this game. Oh how I was wrong.It runs superbly on my pc (athlon x4 750k, gtx 760) with what i think is 40-60fps no matter what you are doing in the game or how intense the cutscenes are. My rig barely heats up more than what it is at idle, or that of playing something like csgo, which is very reassuring.The gameplay itself is very fun with war boys to kill and camps to destroy. the more you progress in the story and the more missions you complete, the more upgrades you can unlock and purchase with what I presume is the currency in Australia, scrap (joke!). Scrap is acquired from detroyed cars or found in camps or loot sites. The game itself is quite similar to Just Cause 2 (if you've played it) as allows you to carry on after you've finished the story and try to achieve 100%. The combat for both vehicles and hand to hand is very satisfying with very pretty explosions from wrecked cars and a combo-like system similar to the arkham games where you can continue fighting everyone around you by blocking their counter attacks and then unleashing fury mode which allows you to give much harder hits (again, very satisfying!).All in all, a very good game that respects the original films aswell as the new one. However, as a fan of the films, the abundance of 'guzzolene' in a land where i thought it was a rare occasion to find any at all, ruins the survivor aspect of the game. I assumed that finding fuel would be like christmas but there seems to be full jerry cans everywhere. Thats probably just me but overall a brilliant game with endless replay value.10/10 would mad max again			"

												I have thoroughly enjoyed Mad Max.  I am a perfectionist when it comes to an attainable goal, like 100% completion of this game, but I am stuck at 98% and can not figure out what ""Non-Repeating Task"" I have left to complete.  It took me hours just to find the last collectible item, and now I am 1 achievement away from 100%The only thing that really doesn't appease to me, is the fact I can not get all of the steam collectibles without purchasing something else.  That is a steam issue though, and not a Mad Max Issue.  Those should be collectible as you beat the game, not a pay to receive item.			"

												17 hours in and I am loving this game!   I definitely recommend it, but only to a certain type of person..I am concious that I:  - Love Mad Max (since the original films)- Am a petrol head who enjoys the visceral grunt of a V8, lots of smoke and flames- Am not bored of Batman style fighting games - only dabbled in Arkham and didn't buy Mordor- Have enough OCD to feel compelled to collect stuff, but not every last little scrapIf you fit the above, then this game is amazing and you probably shouldn't worry too much about the negative stuff people are mentioning.  The driving, fighting, sound and graphics are all so gritty and heavy hitting that, for me, the endless ""busy work"" - go collect stuff here, is a good excuse to drive & batter my way through the environment - with the random encounters adding more happy carnage.  The cars are excellent, there are some very nice little details and if you're a purist, you can choose to look just like Max of old - with a clunky Interceptor and leather jacket.The design, artwork and audio assets are extremely good - as is the variety of the mini levels you complete on foot - at least for the most part.  Compromises - for me, so much HUD clutter does hold back from the immersion  .. as does the ability to fast travel, but being an old PC gamer, I'll hold on to hope that someone can mod this kind of thing in the future.  The other thing I'd like, if modding becomes an option, is less ammo, water, food etc.  I never really feel like I am scrabbling for precious resources like the game suggests you should be, but maybe this comes in later in the game.  The missions aren't too bad I thought, Mad Max the movie isn't exactly well known for it's intricate script, but the characters fit the bill with their simple crudeness etc and some of the banter is very Mad Max-esque and amusing.  There are a bunch of gamey unlocks with little narrative - eg.  Do this epic jump - why?  Just because you can.  Does it make me think badly of the game? - no.  If (IRL) I had a raging V8 practically immune to fall damage and a giant ramp in the middle of the desert - I'd jump it just because it was there too.Concerns - being only about 25% of the way through, my main concerns are - upgrades come pretty fast in what is already a fairly casual friendly game.  I'm no hardcore insta-kill fan, but the lack of difficulty and speed of upgrades is a worry.  Note that you can probably avoid taking skills & upgrades that speed up progress to increase difficulty, but it's not a particularly immersive solution.Performance - I had a GTX 650 and while it ran ok and looked nice, fights in detailed areas with storms going on would slow the action down to slo-mo.  It's not unplayable, by any means, actually rather cinematic, but I saved up enough scrap for a GTX 960 and it runs like a supercharged V8 on ice now (very very slick on maxed settings). "

												This game has received overall mediocre reviews from ""professional"" game reviewers. I am about 12-15 hours into the game and I really am enjoying it. Graphically it is pretty good looking, gameplay is loads of fun. The vehicular combat is like nothing else in other games, but holds true to the Mad Max name. I estimate I'm about 30% through the story, and I know I have only visited 3 of the 8 (I think 8) areas in the game. It's pretty massive. There is no better feeling than defeating a conovy and collecting the hood ornament right before a massive sand-lightning storm blows in! Highly recommended!			"

												Mad Max is an action packed video game sequel to the movie Mad Max: Fury Road. You, Max are stripped of your car and belongings by Lord Scrotus. (Immortan Joe's Son) You must seek revenge on this murderous warlord but on the way meet some interesting allie and characters.  ProsAmazing battles in car and on footInteresting and beautifully made wasteland and atmosphereUpgrading youself and car is rewarding and funNever seem to get bored of driving around battling insane Scrotus War Boys or red eyed Raven men at night.ConsA bit glitchy at timesDoesn't exactly get the mad maxian feelMain quests can get a little bit repetitive but all in all doesnt really effect muchThe hyper realism they tried to get in the game did not work. The game is not very logical or realistic at timesConclusionMad Max hardly ever gets boring in battles and its endless fun blasting warboys with shotguns, to ramming them off cliffs or just harpooning them in the face. ( For people who hate endless action and find it boring  am one of those people most of the time but I find this extremely fun with its unique road combat ) The wasteland is amazing to look at an never just empty dunes. The game does glitch sometimes from graphical errors to cars disapearing. If you are coming into it a fan of Mad Max think of it more as based of the movies. It doesn't really get the feel of Mad Max but if you think of it as a independant game more than complete mad max it is amazing.9/10			"

It's as if the story plays out in the mind of a mentally insane person. There is nothing, there is infinite emptiness around you. Unless you can't handle a sad story, you should absolutely buy this game. For the gameplay alone.			"

												A nicely made sandbox set in the Mad Max universe. It features a vast but sadly, unvaried array of tasks packed into a landscape that captures very well the desolation of a post-apocalyptic scorched desert. Fans of the movies will find plenty to like in this tale of redemption for the franchise's namesake along with his eccentric sidekick and trusty canine companion. If you are looking for Fallout class scope in this game you will be disappointed. However, if you pick this title up without expectations of restoring humanity, you might just find some charm in cruising the wastes in a jury rigged, supercharged mongrelmobile.			"

												I didn't expect this to be as good as it is, usually very untrusting of movie adaptions but the devs actualy give sh*t about this game and it's not the usual blatant money grabbing from WB.After Batman (the new sh*tty one) where they actually had to take it off and repair the game, I thought this wouldn't be well optimised but it is, very well, I'm almost in disbelief. It runs on my fx-6300 and R9 270x (4gb) at around 70fps consistently on high settings. The game looks f*cking amazing as well, the environments are beautiful and the particle effects are great but the characters don't really share the same level. They look just a bit samey and kinda stand out from the environment for not looking as good. The driving is pretty good, it takes getting used to though and a controller might be better as it's not often you need to aim and even then it's in slo-mo (except sniper/shotgun). Vehicles to tend to feel a bit sluggish but the sense of speed is good. Car upgrades are pretty powerful, but in harder sections the more difficult cars need some serious gear to take down easily (upgrade the sh*t out of the harpoon).There's loads to do as well, multiple sectors of increasing difficulty to play with by destroying oil camps, legions, top brass or scarecrows. What's good is it doesn't feel that repetitive, not sure why but I actually feel like I want to go and 100% everything, never been like that before. Combat is mostly melee which works like batman or AC, parry and attack, dodge that, shoot them if need be. It's fun but not as fluid as batman and doesn't have as many moves. Still works great though, although there's a move I just learnt where you snap their arm, like fully it goes backwards, and they just get back up and are fine?? Doesn't really make sense, would be better if they just used other limbs instead or just stayed on the floor in pain. Health is replenished by water/food which is kinda easily found, same for ammo although you can hold like one shell to begin with... Also fuel is used up by driving which needs replenishing after a couple hours-ish. Again no big problem. The story is like most open world games in that it shows you being all badass, get f*cked up and have to rebuild. The end goal is to get to the plains of silence or something, basically just have peace. It's decent enough but don't expect Metal Gear level. Overall it's a great game. "

												80% of the game is boring and repetitive side quest, but the great progression system make you actully want to do them. When I finally got to see the ridiculous intake, and hear the amazing sound of the Ultimate V8, all the errands became a wonderful memory. Reminded me of the old BlackBox NFSs, but with less body kits XD.By the way, so sad that NFS 2015 PC version got delayed, hope they make it the definitive version, like Rockstar did with GTAV.			"

												This game has a bit of a slow start and takes a little while to find its feet. However once it does, Mad Max races off with its cool post apocolyptic setting, populated by deformed people riding crazy high speed cars that look like they have been made out of 20 other cars in someone's garage. The game far surpassed my expectations and I felt it captured the essence of the Mad Max films fairly well, but also whilst also feeling that it brought some new stuff to the table and further elborated on what was already there. You start out half naked and with no car. but as the game develops you gain your own sweet car that you can customise and greatly improve, whilst you become the proper Mad Max from legend. The story is a little lack luster and the sandly rusted metal look everything has can look a little samey after a while but the gameplay certainly makes up for these inadequacies and then some. So if you are looking for a fun, open world game where you are friends with a hunch back who fixes your car for you and a dog that functions as a mine detector, then sir, LOOK NO FURTHER!!			"

												Mad Max is the first game inspired by the hit post-apocalyptic franchise of the same name.  An open-world, action, adventure, with some RPG elements, it really isn't that ""unique"" of a game to be completely honest.  There is no dialog trees, and no branching storyline.  The combat is very Batman: Arkham-like, but the saving grace, the identifying feature of the game, if you will, is the importance of the car.  If you know anything of the Mad Max universe, you know that Max drives an Interceptor, named the ""Black-on-Black.""Let's just say, in this game, you aren't driving that car for some reason, and instead you build your own machine from the scrap, up.  You can customize the color, engine, weapons, suspension, tires, boost, etc... to your liking, per your completion of some aspects of the game.  You can also customize Max himself.  Outfits, hair style, shotgun, gloves, fighting abilities, etc...The story itself, I think, does so well because it is not a copy of one of the already-told Mad Max universe stories, it makes a completely new story (as far as I'm aware).  The story isn't phenomenal, or ground-breaking, but it is good.  There are a few moments that genuinely squeezed some emotion from me as a player, which proves that the game is successful in getting you invested in the characters and the story if you try and let it (this will only work if this source material is your cup of tea).The gameplay is pretty good and refined (BTW devs, what's with never telling the player there is a damn JUMP BUTTON? on an Xbox controller it's LB).  The combat system is just as good as Batman: Arkham or the standard Assassin's Creed combat system.  The graphics are pretty good, nothing groundbreaking, but good.The world size is enourmous, one of the better parts of the game.  The map size essentially requires the use of the car you build, this is part of what makes the car so successful as such an integral part of the story.  There are plenty of locations to loot (too many, honestly), mini-bosses to defeat, locations to discover and expore and strongholds to upgrade.All-in-all, the game is good for those interested.  If you aren't into Post-apocalyptic settings, you won't like it.  If you aren't into that combat style, lots of driving, big worlds, linear stories, or any combination of those, then I can't guarantee you'll like the game, but otherwise, I would most certainly recommend the experience.

												Finished all missions, cleared all areas, maxed out all strongholds, got all the archangels, got all the important cars... soooooooo bored...I can't be bothered to collect the remaining scrap locations since I have more than I could ever use by this point. Would like to get the rest of the photos and stuff, but it's soooo boooooring and has become soooooo easy...They really need to take some pointers from Bethesda and add in mod support. Because, seriously, the game just runs out of steam as soon as you complete the main story mission.But, do I think this is a bad game?  Oh hell no!  I had a blast up until the end of the story, the combat is simple but fun, the driving is a pleasure once you upgrade the car to something drivable, and the characters are very enjoyable.  It really just needs more stuff to do, something the mod community could pull off easily.  Take Fallout 3 for example, or Skyrim.  These are examnples of games that the developer encouraged mods for and they are still being played years later.  My Fallout 3 playthrough has outlived three computers, once it starts to get boring, I just install more quests from the mod community!  The same goes for Skyrim, start getting bored?  Install a ton of mods and explore all over again!Mad Max has so much potential, the engine is fine and the atmosphere is great.  The Big Nothing could be used as a ""mod friendly"" area where modders could expand the world without messing up the main game area.  There is so much that could be done to extend the life and diserability of Mad Max with very little effort or expense from WB, if only they would open it up.			"

												The only thing that I have found to be inherently wrong with this game is the lack of character or story depth, the delivery of it just seems to fall flat. The fighting and driving gameplay is tried and true. The visuals are attractive and favorably optimized as well. The open world nature of this game just seems like a size 14 work boot being tried on by a pre-pubescent plot/story. Is it just me or are there a lot of open world games as of late that are released primarily as single player focused experiences but feel like they were somehow designed to be F2P/MMOs in early beta? Maybe I'm just gettin' too old for this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Riggs.			"

												Mad Max has its pros and cons, but it is a great game overall. For $20 or less, you are getting a game that will keep you busy for some time. The visuals in the game are great, even on a budget PC. The upgrading system always kept me grinding for scrap. The story doesn't go into a lot of detail if you skim through the game, but reading the bios of the characters can make it intriguing.If you enjoyed the button mashing of Shadow of Mordor's combat system, you'll enjoy this one.  It's the usual one button punch, another button parry and counter, etc., but it stays simple, and the executions can be satistfying, especially for the bosses.The game can be repetitive. The scavenging areas and camps seem very similar, with the same items here and there. The lip syncing could be better as well.Great game to grab on sale, and/or if you enjoyed Shadow of Mordor.			"

												Mad max is an open world game set in the Mad Max universe. Wander the limited open world, blow up cars and destroy things.... lots and lots of things. If you are a gamer used to and enjoys open world style games, then you may enjoy this title. But be warned the map is littered with a lot of quests and there is a wash rinse repeat element in the game. To some extent I did enjoy the game, and didn't... Would I recommend the game? Yes. But with some warnings. Want more details check out the video below!

												I listened to the Fury Road soundtrack in the background while playing this. That makes almost 72 hours of non-stop Fury Road soundtrack. I don't actually know what the soundtrack for this game sounds like; maybe it's cool? Regardless, I enjoyed almost every moment of this game. The plot is awesome, too.And hey, if George Miller doesn't wind up filming more excellent Max movies (like the Furiosa one he discussed briefly) he could just turn the scripts over to these guys and let them make another excellent game! I'd play the hell out of a Furiosa-led sequel to this.Only downsides with this game? For one, they apparently took a few of Shadows of Mordor's systems (never played it) in the base capturing, but neglected to put in the groundbreaking Nemesis system. Damned shame, because having a Warboy or somesuch become your rival and gain power and stuff every time his war party defeated Max or scored a victory against you would have been crazy awesome. As-is, you the player are generally unaffected by the world.Second, but you get the V8 engine waaaay too late in the game. The plot runs out shortly thereafter and it's unfortunate because... V8!!The last thing is that you don't have big fights on vehicles like in the movies; you fight in a vehicle against other vehicles, but never on them. It would be brutally hard to implement, but fighting atop a War Rig or something would just be... ahh. So cool. Especially dovetailed into the Nemesis system. As-is, there's a bit too much disconnect between the fighting systems and driving systems; your only recourse while driving and being attacked is to shoot or bail out... Damned shame.Still, minor quibbles on an excellent run.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. It gets a little repetitive at some points but thats only when you're trying to loot. The combat feels sort of like Sleeping Dogs in which its mainly hand to ahnd combat. There's also vehicular combat which is pretty interesting but its not as often as the hand to hand combat. The story is pretty decent as well. Overall, this was definitely worth it.			"

												Mad Max is a third person (with and option for first person in car), open-world, single player game. Gameplay focuses on action and exploration, both on foot and in car.The biggest thing Mad Max has going for it is the world. Avalanche Studios have crafted a wasteland that feels seamless, alive, and genuine while still maintaining faithful to the source material of the movies. This game is in fact treated as a prequel to the movie ""Fury Road"". For all the violence and terrible things that happen in this place of squalor it is almost always shockingly beautiful to look at. The map is absolutely giant and filled with different things to do.With the help of your sidekick, Chum Bucket, your journey revolves around finding scrap to build your car, ""The Magnum Opus"" into the perfect road warrior machine. Chum Bucket is probably my favorite video game sidekick. He was always entertaining, particularly when he starts spouting lines about his crazy religion and praying to his angel of combustion. If you have an understanding of mechanics and car parts there is a lot to enjoy here and will enhance your experience. Your car, The Magnum Opus, feels like a character itself and the more you build it the more you will get attached to it. I'm not sure if that was intentional game design or not but I thought it was really cool that it happened to me because that's how most characters in the game world are. They worship all things mechanical and are attached to their rides.In addition to collecting scrap through exploration, combat is other core pillar of this title. Combat is split pretty evenly between on foot and in car. On foot, the game uses the Arkham Style fist fighting that you know and love. No complaints here. Its fun and rewarding. My favorite though is the car combat. I can't think of another title that delivers on this more. It's exciting, and at times even heart pounding. This is where you actually get to feel like Max from the movies. It's incredibly cinematic when you take on a convoy in first person view.The game also offers a photo mode that you can activate at almost any time. Its a great addition and I used it often, given how beautiful the game is. I wish every game had an option like this.The game isn't without it's shortfalls though. The main story is extremely short and underwhelming. I feel like you could complete it in under 8 hours. In contrast, if your're a completionist you can easily spend 50 hours in one play through. To me, that's a little unbalanced. Just like other reviewers have said all the filler here can become repetitive. For me though, it was more cathartic than anything. I was just so enraptured by the game world and loved exploring every nook and cranny to get my precious scrap.In my opinion, the biggest offense here are the missed opportunities. You never get to drive a huge war rig in anger. And there's never a giant chase scene that lives up to the ones in the movies. And most disappointingly, ""The Big Nothing"" (the maps boundary), never panned out the way the developers said it would. They said it would be a kind of procedurally generated area that would have high risk, high reward exploration that you could drive around in for hours. In an interview with GamingBolt, senior producer John Fuller said, ""There are no finite limits to the map… in other words, there is no ‘one side’. You can continue driving into The Big Nothing until you get bored or killed."" Sadly, none of this is the case. It's simply not in the game. If you enter The Big Nothing you will see an onscreen message that tells you to turn back. If you don't, you are killed and your last checkpoint is loaded. I couldn't find any developer comments online as to why this feature was dropped but it was something I was really excited about.All in all, Mad Max has been some of the most fun I've had this year in games. Ever since I saw ""The Road Warrior"" as a kid, I've been drawn to the Mad Max universe. This game let me become Max and live in the wasteland. It was an amazing experience for me.TL;DR: A must play for fans of the franchise and a safe bet for anyone else.			"

												Now that I've hit the 12 hour mark, I feel like I can give a meaningful opinion. I echo the rest of the positivity in saying this game is absolutely amazing with the technical performance standing out amongst all the other great elements. While Avalanche Studios is known for quality, the abysmal state of PC versions of games have dismayed and caused many, including myself, to be cautious of any new PC release, especially those with WB as the publisher. There is nothing to worry about with this game. Mad Max runs flawlessly on a wide variety of hardware specifications with even middling and low tier setups able to achieve high settings and fps. I myself play at 1440p at max settings on a GTX 970 with solid 60fps. Due to that, the graphics really shine as the game is about as beautiful as they come. The gameplay is another high point for me personally. I will say that the degree of your enjoyment of this game could hinge on how much of a Mad Max fan you are. I wouldn't say you NEED to be a fan to appreciate it, but liking the franchise will increase your appreciation for how the various mechanics at play meld with one another and how the overall gameplay is presented. The setting is a post apocalyptic wasteland devoid of traditional towns and cities. While it sounds barren, the large map is dotted with enemy camps, strongholds, and ruined areas to explore. In true Mad Max fashion, you're tasked with scavenging for scrap--the currency of the game as well as the material needed to upgrade--fuel, ammo, and water. Everything save for water is relatively scarce in the beginning, but upgrades make fuel a non-issue and ammo, if used intelligently, can last for a good while as well. Ground combat is mostly hand-to-hand with the odd weapon thrown in every once in a while. It's the same as Arkham and Sleeping Dogs, but closer to Sleeping Dogs if we're being technical. It's true that it's one button to attack and one button to parry, but between perfect parries and the upgradable moveset, there's actually more than meets the eye to fighting. In the very early hours it's so simple it's repetitive, but as you upgrade Max's moveset, it begins to become varied and a lot more rewarding. Punches feel weighty, Max feels more like a brawler than a martial artist (as he should) and the overall fighting is gritty and visceral. It's never truly complex, but it more than suffices especially after upgrades. Speaking of upgrades, all the important things are upgradable in this game--Max and his car, the Magnum Opus. You can customize Max's look, his clothes which double as armor, and his moveset in combat. For the car, you can customize your Magnum Opus to drive and perform the way you want and you can even build from preset blueprints called Archangels that compose different playstyles. I will say the driving is absolute trash in the beginning, but that is only because your car is yet to be worked on. Once you begin adding parts and acquiring scrap to upgrade, the handling becomes much better. Car combat is the other star of the show here. Since Mad Max mostly revolves around vehicles, this is appropriate. Car combat is similar to the movies with high speed chases during convoys and all the ramming, grinding, and explosions one can handle. You have various weapons to take advantage of and you can even drive in first person view if you wish. Overall, Mad Max is an excellent game for fans of the series and an equally excellent action-adventure game for those who may not be familiar with everything. It can become a little repetitive, but so can any game. Try it out for yourself!			"

												Mad Max is crazy fun. Something about driving a muscle car all geeked up through the wasteland and getting attacked by roving bands of maniacs. Shotgunning them from the hood of your car before they kick your face in...or slinging them off with radical stops...or my favorite so far...having my hunchback sidekick harpoon their cars...and either pull it to pieces or pull them out of the car. It's intense and fun. Fighting is fun. A bit easier then Batman but still fun. Cons would be it's definitely better suited for controller. First person driving is a fun..but not always preferable as some of the cars have limited sight. Great story so far. It's the prequel the film. My two cents plus one.			"

												When I found out there would be a videogame tie-in to Mad Max, I cringed. First of all, old-school strategy game Road War 2000 had been the ONLY game I'd ever played that came close to capturing the feel of the Mad Max universe. Second, every single movie adaptation in videogame form, in the history of all of time and space, has sucked*.Mad Max rocks. It borrows heavily from previous open-world games, but consider the imitation flattery - this dev team has taken pieces of other games and made them into something new and amazing. There's combat from Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor (which itself borrows much from the Arkham games), crafting as seen in the most recent of the Far Cry games, character development from (name your favorite RPG), and so on, all mesh in a post apocalyptic desert. Max might not look like one of the movie Maxes, but he acts, talks, and grunts like them. As in the films, there's more traffic in the Outback post-nuke than there ever was before; good thing there are so many gasoline refineries around because petroleum goes bad in storage - so if it wasn't still being made, all those goofy looking gas guzzlers would fizzle to a halt.Vehicle combat is a high point, and reminds me of games like the ancient Destruction Derby and the current Next Car Game: Wreckfest. Of course, you can upgrade your car as the game progresses, just as you can upgrade Max himself. Car upgrades drive much of the early plot of the game. Finally, there's value. At nearly 7 hours in, playing side missions to grind and main missions to progress, I'm still in the very early stages of the narrative. I haven't checked what average playtime is, but it has to be at least a couple dozen hours.All in all, great game so far. I'm hoping it stays exciting all the way through.*some rare exceptions have been noted			"

True to the ""Mad Max"" NameWelcome to the apocolypse! Mad Max follows the format of Fury Road in a sense by immediately opening up with action.  Max's famous car, the Interceptor, is taken from him just before he is about to begin a periless journey across The Big Nothing.  Max's immediate goal becomes to find find a vehicle that can carry him through that journey.  You play the role of the titular character Max, road warrior and man on the run from his past.  Accompanied with the black finger hunchback mechanic, Chumbucket, you ride through the wastes that has become Australia (I'm assuming).  The main focus of the game is building your vehicle, The Magnum Opus, into the pinnacle of war machines.  Venture through the wastes collecting scrap (the currency of Mad max), fighting caravans of enemies, all while meeting new & intriguing characters.  Many opportunities lie out there in the Wastes!You'll find this game to be well optimized to the point where it is shocking.  I never dropped below 60 FPS at any point in the game with maxed out settings.  Visual effects are impressive as well. Gameplay is well balanced.  While you will do a lotof driving, you will enjoy it.  Only thing I bothersome was having to grind scrap to upgrade the Magnum Opus.  If you're looking for a new adventure in a ruined world then Mad Max is right for you.  So get out there and be witnessed!			"

												Mad Max is a fun and enjoyable game either if you like to rush trough to the end or if you like to explore and spend a long time in the Wasteland. The highlight of the game is the car combat and some of the story missions. All of the different enemy camps also have different layouts and challenges.The drawbacks is that the storyline is in the beginning and spends to much time to get intereisting, it is also short, some more story and side missions would be great. Also tanking out the smaller loot locations gets tiresome and boring after awhile, the same goes for melee fighting.The graphics are good, and there is a large range of options, so the game can run smoothly on lower end computers as well. I enjoyed the game a lot, but if you are going for 100% completion it gets a bit tiresome, boring and repetetive towards the end.			"

												This has got to be one of the greatest games ever made. The fight scenes might be repetative, the driving might not be very realistic, the scrap and historic data may be just another item to pick up, but the story, the character play the language, the entire game wants you to play more. Great game, a truly great game. Oh! I cannot remember one time a swear word was used, well done on that. I am really fed up with games using swear words. We can all use them, but is it really necessary in a game for anything other than effect? Bad language is okay, but swearing over and over again (GTAV) is but a poor story line and only there for kids or less than mature gamers ill-educated entertainment.			"

												My name is Maximum Max. My world is high fps, and good graphics. Once, I expected this to be a very average game; a game releasing on the same day as The Phantom Pain, searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell for The Phantom Pain, each of us in our own way knew that Mad Max came out, but not many people cared. It was hard to know who was more crazy. Me... or everyone else.Here they come again. Talking only about The Phantom Pain and leaving this game to die. In the black matter of my brain. I told myself... they cannot touch me. They forgot about this game.I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead. Hunted by scavengers. Haunted by those I could not protect. So I exist in this Wasteland.

												Enjoyable gameplay with both great driving, vehicle combat and CQC. Got quite repetitive and grindy in the mid section of the game which was dissapointing, every boss at a camp were the same character model with the same animations/combat sequence... Could have been more story/cutscene elements to build Max's story a bit more and break up the repetition, could have been shorter and removed the grindy♥♥♥♥♥♥that no-one enjoys. The last couple missions were great. Although there are some drawbacks, I'd recommend it			"

												Lovely imagery and a decent Far Cry 3 meets Red Faction Gureilla with some fun gameplay but only IF you can get through the first three hours and scripted hand holding ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Get through that and the game finally takes the training wheels off so that you can do your own thing.The progression system is daft and I'm still annoyed to have religiously collected scrap only to have all the stuff I want locked away until I progress further in the story.Yes, it's good. Yes it looks good. Yes it's fun. Yes it has a big map but bloody hell, that initial grind is annoying.Just for the annoying hand holding and directed gameplay for the first three hours, it's only worth buying if it's in a sale.Edit to add: After 40 hours I've completed the storyline and the storyline is this game is simply one of the best I've played. I'm still miffed at the hand holding at the start and at how you're forced to do some things to progress the storyline but the story telling itself is incredibly well done.			"

												This game is pretty good to be honest. Visually it's very nice, combat is enjoyable, and the cars are fun to drive and battle in. The story is quite repetitive (go and find this person in this place and take out these people for them) and i've ony played 7 hours. So basically I stopped doing any missions and just went round killing people, it's mich more fun. It's exactly the same as I do on Shadow of Mordor. This game will run on systems below the minimum specs however and is very nicely optimised. Capped at 60 fps for me and is never drops below 59 and I have a pretty decent system. Plus at at fairly cheap price tag I would pick up this game again. Stick on some music and go and kill♥♥♥♥♥♥Pros:>Nice Looking>Good Combat>Good Driving Physics>Lots of customisationCons:>Repetitive Story "

												Surprisingly Good game. Pros:Excellent graphics and art style. The wasteland really comes to life. As in, there's not much life, as it's a dead wasteland ;)Runs butter-smooth and one of the best opimised games of 2015. A GTX970 will run this 60fps, 1080p with no frame drops at all max settings (Max/Ultra). Lots to do for an open world game. The story will take approximately 20 hours if you blaze through it, and over 50 to complete the extras. Vehicle combat is satisfying, and captures the movie combat perfectly, even the first peron view from the trailers is there!There are loads of details in the world of the game, and features, like the ability for a local friend to use an Xbox controller to control the camera in video capture mode to make your own fighting scenes. Huge map, similar in scale to Just Cause (same Devs).Cons:Can get repetitive with the same types of enemies and camps - the mini-bosses are just reskinned with a different weakness. Getting scrap in the mid game can be a grind, expecially to get parts for the car for certain missions. Car handling is frustrating at times, on keyboard (haven't tried controller yet, so may be different). The cars tend to spin out often if you take the slightest jump, and environmental damage seems to do more damage to the car than a head on collision with a Rammerhead truck!7/10 "

The game runs flawless, the combat is smooth, and the driving works. It's not new in the gameplay aspects but it works for what it is.

												This is a Neutral Review. I don’t fully endorse the game, but I don’t feel it deserves a negative feedback.Mad Max is visually stunning. Such a beautiful game, with a beautiful scenario and a very rich world. But hey, forget everything and let’s make a grindy reskinned shadow of mordor game! At the first glance, you will give this game a 10/10. But for me, a player that really loves lore and RPG elements, I can’t give more than a 5/10. I will give a positive vote because the game is really beautiful… but the simplistic grindy gameplay and the lack of deepness on the lore and the world killed it. I feel that this game would be a 10/10 if it had the same deepness of lore and focus on gameplay as other recently AAA had.Pros:Visually Beautiful GameVery well optimized for pcCaptures pretty well the essence of MaxCons:Simplistic Fetch QuestsLack of Lore ContentGameplay IssuesShort Main HistoryGrindy and RepetitiveReskinned Batman/Shadow of Mordor "

												If you're into open world games with a lot of stuff to explore, and can tolerate being in a dystopian wasteland, this game will surely deliver. The combat is on point and very similar to the arkham games (which can still feel repitious mind you), and I was suprised to find that every single enemy base had a different design. However, the game definately has some glaring flaws. Collecting scrap (the currency) can be tedious at times and while the bases explored differ in design, there's a clear lack of different enemy designs and things to do in the bases. I found the story to be alright and what's expected from a Mad Max game, but the main drive to complete story missions was just to upgrade my car rather than care about different characters. Other than that, the game is a wonderful PC port and looked beautiful with settings maxed out. There were a few sound issues and a strange bug which skipped a few cutscenes, but other than that it was a really fun experience and much better than expected.			"

Step Into the World of Mad MaxThis game has its ties to the movies, however this game isn't completely based on a particular Mad Max movie.In an open world environment, you play as Max completing various missions for different people with the rewards going towards upgrading your skills and abilties or the customisation of your car which you control. The graphics are quite nice, the game runs smoothly, the sound effects are good and there are hardly any bugs. This adds to the immersion of the game especially in particular events such as when you get caught in a sandstorm. The combat system works similar to that of the Batman: Arkham series. This is a simple control mechanic, but i think it fits well for Max's character since he was always a heavy hitter and not one to be doing flips and complex combos while in combat. This game will definitely bring some fun hours to the table if you decide to get it.			"

												I'm not done with the game my GPU broke in the middle of the playthrough, I had to buy another one. But this game is a blend between Batman Combat style( I personally think Mad Max is more punishing in terms of combat though and it's a lot harder to keep a high combo, and I say this from having completed all the batman games on the highest difficulty without taking damage), the open world is similar to far cry, where you have to find stuff and take down stuff to gain more territory. For the story I can't really say anything cause I RARELY watch cutscenes while playing.(Last game I watch the cutscenes was Uncharted 4 and Last of Us). But for me this game focus more on Gameplay, good combats and pretty good graphics. Overall it's a very solid game, no season pass because no SUPER DUPER expensive DLC's like a lot of games are doing nowadays.			"

What I don't like is there seems to be to many cut scenes and I feel channelled into a mission rather than doing my own thing.

												It lacks some vehicle custom options, but still is a fun wastelant adventure as Mad Max. The reason why vehicle customizing is not that good is because you just increase its performance and nothing more. You get a few options to change the paint job and vehicle shape, but that is it. Also other vehicles you can steal from enemies are pointless as far as I can see. They do not have all the robust options as your main ride does. You also can can't your vehicle while out in the waste and one vehicle is a must for completing the boring mine field clearing side missions. I don't see why they didn't just make the main vehicle cabable of detecting mines because switching to anything else is really pointless.Enemy AI is painful... in a good way. they try run you over if you are unlucky enough to get cought outside your car. If they get tired of trying to run you over they will park and start trying to fight you. I had taken out a lead cars wheel and caused to to pull over and its whole convoy pulled voer with it. They all got out of their cars and started to run at me. So encounters can varying depending on how you fight and wether or not the AI wants to pull over and punch your face in.			"

												I originally picked this up to play it for the day before MGS V: Phantom Pain came out, only to find the silly UK release dates meant it came out on the same day. So, it got left on the backburner for a while. About 6 months on the backburner in fact.Nevertheless, I finished this over the weekend with about 46 hours spent. My review is positive.The storyline is about as much as you'd want out of a Mad Max themed game, probably more so in fact.The driving is decent enough, although vehicle combat never really felt great to me until quite a few upgrades and extra weapons had been unlocked, then it became a lot more interesting and enjoyable.The hand-to-hand fighting. Ok, it's not Batman. I've personally got Arkham City as my 'this does fighting best' game, and judge everything against that. This does a fair stab, and is probably on par with Arkham Origins. There's some 'cheapness' with some of the tougher enemies, who will merrily ignore the fact you're in a canned animation doing a particular special move and hit you out of it, which led to quite the blue language at times. But aside from that, you do get some genuinely nice fights where Max really does feel like an unstoppable bad♥♥♥♥♥The open-worldy-ness. It's a bit dragged out at times. Some of the objectives to liberate areas (think Ubisoft / Just Cause style liberation) can drag on a bit. Running around a sprawling base with Max's only medium-fast sprint to find some secluded oil tanks to blow up can get quite repetitive after the first few.So compared to some other games. I enjoyed both Just Cause 3 and MGS 5 more than this overall, although MGS 5 did its level best to make me hate it later on. Max started ok and generally got better over time, never really standing out amongst the top of the class, but making a decent shout for itself. "

												Very Good gameplay, Story is so-so but not boring. A mix of the batman combat we all know and love and Burnout style car combat with loads of customization and upgrading. Graphics are fantastic as well with huge draw distances and fantastic fire and explosion effects. Buy it!			"

												Good game and a lot of fun to play, some of the sidequests can become quite repetitive (way too many minefields to clean..).  The upgrades especially those to the car and the finishers really change the way you can play the game. Overall I can do nothing but recommend this game.			"

												This game is truly a masterpiece. FIghting in this game is just as satisfying as eating a cookie dough poptart. The only negative thing about this game is that the main story is about 20 hours. I wish it was longer because I really enjoyed this gem of a game. In addition to the great gameplay, the guys at avalanche studios did a fantastic job regarding the pc port.			"

												Well written. Well written code. Well directed art team.The world this combination creates is one of post-post-apocalyptic survival, where fuel, water, food, and parts, are power. And it is seamless. The use of religious and cultural tools to at once control and motivate the people that inhabit the world is excellently thought out for a fictional future. The imperative which motlivates the protagonist is singular: survive--and if he can along the way, find and preserve his own humanity.The game, technically, is beautiful. You wouldn't think the sandy sea beds and underwater mountains would hold that much detail, but they do. It is also the contrast between the drifting dunes over old roads worn into the earth, next to ramshackle dwellings made from overturned sea vessels from long ago. The bright flames of Gas Town light up the Northern horizon, if you get up high enough. The weather shifts and blows the world about, with giant sand storms a looming threat while outside and exposed. Resources are rare, and each shot from your gun must be weighed against the certainty of desperately needing one more shot some time in the future--is this that time? Combat is fluid and fairly dynamic. No two engagements are entirely the same, and the options Max has as he unlocks memories and abilities during the normal course of the game, mean an ever expanding array of options for accomplishing objectives. The map is well thought out, and useful, which is unlike the execution for some other open world games. On the con side, I can't really think of too much. I can think of only one bug in the entire game, but that has several good work arounds out there (when you get to a certain fort, and the front gate doesn't open at any point, you are not alone). An easy one I haven't seen mentioned is simply waiting outside the gate when a storm hits; the lightning strikes can set off the pumps within, which was how I did it. Then there was one time, and one time only, after a particularly spectacular crash, that I bounced my flaming vehicle into a terrain feature that kept me pinned. It only necessitated restarting the last checkpoint, which wasn't a big deal. I probably could not recreat the incident. So, yeah. Not much to say on the con side. So, TL;DR version: really, it is a good game that gets more interesting as your abilities and the story unfold. I look forward to playing future interations of the series, if the same group makes them.OH! And this is a strange positive, but the image and video capturing capabilities of the game are very good. Filters, borders, effects, layers, etc. You could make some really great art with this, if you can set up the shot well.			"

												As far as i have seen many people say the game has no story, though the story i will admit is a bit flat, the game to me was very immersive and I fell in love with the characters, the game in my opinion was a bit repetitive but it was fun to play and the last few story quests brought a tear to my eye. I can't say this is the best game out there but it is definetly very fun to play.			"

												The bad: A bit slow at times. Kind of repetitive game play. Occasionally too dark to see anything and disorienting.The good: Good fight controls. I went the entire game almost without realizing you could upgrade Max's abilities. Explosions. Great story. The sand storms, albeit frustrating, were really well done, it was really cool how you could see them coming over the horizon. Good story, zany ""insane"" aspects of mad max really well portrayed.It wasn't the best game I've ever played, but I enjoyed it.			"

												One of the most overlooked games of 2015.  Good gameplay mechanics even though it borrows heavily from other AAA games such as the Arkham series and Assassin's Creed.  Graphics are amazing and it's one of the better PC ports you will find.  There is normally a heavy discount on this game somewhere and it's worth every penny.  8/10			"

												Mad Max is a fun and enjoyable game either if you like to rush trough to the end or if you like to explore and spend a long time in the Wasteland. The highlight of the game is the car combat and some of the story missions. All of the different enemy camps also have different layouts and challenges.The drawbacks is that the storyline is in the beginning and spends to much time to get intereisting, it is also short, some more story and side missions would be great. Also tanking out the smaller loot locations gets tiresome and boring after awhile, the same goes for melee fighting.The graphics are good, and there is a large range of options, so the game can run smoothly on lower end computers as well. I enjoyed the game a lot, but if you are going for 100% completion it gets a bit tiresome, boring and repetetive towards the end.			"
