												I want to recommend this, I really do.  I really loved the idea of this.  The sneak/hack genre is wonderful.  My problem is that I have completed the game in 48 minutes.  That includes some interruptions as well.  There is simply not enough content here to justify a game.  At the end, I wondered if I was just playing the demo.			"

												So, let me share my thoughts, especially seeing that many red ""Thumbs Down"".""Light"" is a tiny indie game made by just a few people according to the game credits. It's a sneak'n'hack game about an escaped test subject. Controls and gameplay are pretty simple. You sneak using WASD avoiding guards and cameras, can unlock the doors (E), hack (Q), kill guards and civilians (SPACE), hide their bodies (2) and change outfit (3). You will also find and read some documents to understand what happened to you. That's it if I don't miss anything. Gameplay, story, music and minimalistic cyberpunk'ish graphics style are pretty satisfying, I can definitely say I enjoyed them all as well as the game on the whole. Yes, the game is short and won't take much your time to be completed on 100%.Pros:+ Simple controls+ Nice-looking cyberpunk'ish graphics+ Story (despite it might seem typical)+ Soundtrack (special thanks to Gavin Harrison !)+ Short (yeah, it's a + as I don't need to put dozens of hours into a tiny game)+ Easy to beat for 100% (apparently, a + for anyone who isn't indifferent to achievements)Cons:- Short (I doubt anyone would complain if the game were longer)- Pricey- Low replay valueI'm literally forced to pay attention to the price. Yes, guys, I agree the game is pricey. I also understand some disappointment and comments and reviews saying ""lack of content"", ""too short"" and agree. Store page is a really promissing one and raises your expectations from the game. My thoughts were like ""Ouch, it's like a mix of my beloved Monaco (50+ hours played) and Frozen Synapse (well-known and highly acclaimed by critics and players), I should check in out"". That's why I've purchased and played ""Light"".However, I don't think the fact the game is pretty expensive (for the content it offers) gives the right to leave a ""Thumbs Down"". I enjoyed this tiny game (I'd especially highlight its music), got a +1 perfect game, learned several new English words (despite it has a Russian localization, I played it in English), didn't invest much time in it and I've also supported indie game developers. I don't regret doing all that and in general cannot say anything bad about ""Light"", that's why - my ""Thumbs Up""!Some notes/recommendations to developers:• Add more content and reduce the price. Seriously. Mentioned Monaco offers you a huge amount of multi-level missions, 8 characters, up to 4 players online co-op, story with its charm and humour as well as soundtrack by Austin Wintory[austinwintory.bandcamp.com], Steam-features like leaderboards, cloud, Workshop + level editor but is still priced less. Something is wrong here ...• Probably, add more achievements (to pass each level unspotted / under some defined or devs' time / to kill all guards on a level etc). At least it will increase players' playtime and will add some challenge. This point completely depends on your attitude to achievements and your fantasy/creativity :)• Probably, add Steam leaderboards (competition spirit, you know). I doubt it will be worth doing, but still, that's what comes to my mindP.S. You won't lose anything if you don't play this game, but you will likely enjoy it if you do. And Steam is not the place where you can complain about the price. Even just released games are offered literally tomorrow with a good discount (my example: bought Asteria that was released a bit more than a week ago with a -75% coupon received for badge crafting). Countless bundles popup almost every day. You're warned multiple times about the price and content mismatch, so you are free to buy the game when it's on sale or comes to a bundle. Then you'll be more prone to share some love with ""Light"".			"

Note: video review embedded below.It’s tough to review a game that’s only distinguishable by the pieces it borrows from its contemporaries. I don’t mean to simply say that Light brings nothing new to the table, but that it actively feels like a collage of other games stitched together in the hopes of success by association.Whether it’s aping Hotline Miami’s style, Monaco’s varied action stealth design, or Gunpoint hacking interface, I could barely make out what exactly Light itself was under the influx of familiarity. Perhaps I’d have been at least partially OK with that had Light managed to match the quality of its inspiration, but the distressing blankness and ineptitude it presents itself with makes it hard to accept it as even a rudimentary clone.What’s more, Light seems to have no idea itself what it wants to do, and consistently places bets into the areas it’s weakest. The skeleton of a plot attempting to give context to a collection of squares is played out and terribly structured, yet more often than not it’s placed at the forefront of the game and is usually your only sense of motivation within a level. Without it there’s no setting or continuity to anything you do, but with it you’re stuck with a mess of unexplained motives and hazy details on some elaborate corporate plot that apparently justifies you mass murdering its security personnel.Mechanically, Light is somehow in even greater disarray. In an era where stealth games are more impressive and dynamic than ever, Light is an embarrassment of shoddy AI and minimal depth. Though you need only avoid your enemies vision cones, audial awareness having missed the cut completely, Light still manages to become confusing and frustrating through the combination of horrendous controls and an unclear aesthetic.Your character controls as if he’s walking through an ice rink, sliding around clumsily and allowing little room for precise control or quick reflexes. If you screw up your path you’re almost certainly dead, unless you somehow can maneuver yourself next to an enemy and kill them first, a task sufficiently complicated by randomly clipping on the environment while hoping the controls don’t spazz out completely.Most times I was caught however were do to never having seen the enemy in my path at all. With the entire game rendered in shades of blue and different light sources being impossible to distinguish from each other, enemy view cones often snuck up on me having blended into the background or somehow glimpse me through a wall I didn’t realize was actually a window. Somehow for as simple as everything about Light is, it finds ways to fabricate difficulty spikes by making everything as dysfunctional as possible, yet always with a complete lack of self-awareness.Having run through the Light in under an hour, I’m rather surprised I’ve even managed to even write this much about a game that’s nothing if not hollow. For as great as the games Light heavily borrows from may be, its only unique contribution is a less sophisticated and functional amalgamation of their parts. As far as food analogies are concerned, Light is asking you to settle for spoiled lunch meat, as if you haven’t already seen the mountain of steak nearby.

												Played the game, and probably finished it around 20mins. Wasn't as fun as I thought it would be with the whole hacking, and stealth scenario. Even if you disguise yourself, the enemies can still kill you, regardless if you've commited an evil act or not. Definitely not worth the $12.99. Only reason I got the game was through the Humble Bundle. If you're the type of gamer who's all about speed running games, and becoming #1, then this might be the game for you, but other than that, it wasn't that great.			"

You can probably get more out of it if you're one who likes to set leaderboard records. Other than that, I really think that this game needs workshop in order to generate the amount of content that would make this a worthy title at the suggested price tag.I recommend that you get this game but only during a sale or a bundle (at least until workshop or user-generated levels are added in).3/5			"

												You have to go through 12 levels, so one hour should be enough to complete the stealth-and-hacking game and get 100% of the achievements. You can try to get the best score for each level (avoid guards, do not kill anybody, do it as quickly as possible, ...), so you might play more than one hour, but not that much. The story is fine, there are trading cards, but that's it : this ""game"" looks much more like a ""demo"", but not a full game.I can't help thinking that paying 12€ for a one-hour game is not something a lot of people would be willing to do. I got this game in a bundle, so that's fine, but I can't recommend people to buy it as long as the price is above 1€. This game is good, I would like to recommend it, but it is too expensive (at the moment) and it needs more content.			"

Light is a minimalistic, top down stealth game in which you play as a light blue square. The unfortunate square finds itself in a strange facility, suffering from a memory loss, and realizes it has to escape. Simple enough. On the way out, it hacks terminals to unlock door, disable security cameras and gain acess to information that would shed some light on its situation.I find the desing quite charming; simplistic but still rather pleasant to look at. The controls are equally simple, yet smooth and responsive. The difficulty is pretty casual, even a bit too easy in some levels, but I actually prefer easy games over the frustrating ones so that's a plus for me. The only real issue with Light is the game time: only one or two hours, depending on whether you take your time or breeze through it. At least it's over before it gets tiresome, which would be a good thing if the game didn't cost €11.99 (at the time of writing this review).Even though I picked the positive rating, I can't recommend the game for the full price.Wait for a massive discount or try to trade for it ;) "

												Very quick to play.It's not a pure stealth game either. The enemies don't move in wholly predictable patterns, they have a degree of randomness that makes the game more of a adventurous that you normally want from a stealth game.Stealth games normally let you plan things out, and let you duplicate your route if you die. This game prevents that sort of careful planning. Instead you're flying by the seat of your pants.Fun, but I wish some small issues would get touched up. "

												Small stealth game.You get 12 levels, a story of sorts; you get to sneak unseen or kill people and hide the bodies (but that'll put you on a two-minute timer to complete the mission). You see everything: basically, where all the guards and cameras are, and their field of view; however, you can't zoom out: the game annoys you by not giving you a complete overview, because otherwise it'd be too easy (which it arguably already is). And the game surprises you: sometimes you can hide behind a chair, sometimes that doesn't work, suddenly there are windows: there are a bunch of mechanics you have to die for at least once before you figure them out.In comparison, Third Eye Crime has much deeper mechanics that make it a challenge even with complete knowledge; and Of Guard and Thieves has a proper fog of war, lights, and it's multiplayer. Light just can't compete.If you caught this in a bundle, it's probably worth playing, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.			"

												Although the game is good, the content is lacking. The game can easily be completed in one sitting, no high doses of caffeine to stay awake needed. i managed to complete half the game in 0.3 hours before I grew slightly bored.The missions tend to be the same, sneak in, avoid people and cameras, silently kill and disguise yourself and then hacking terminals. Once all terminals are hacked, and items found, you can go to the exit. The game is very much a 2D hitman with lots of colour and less things to do - there are no special ways of disposing of the security other than just normal attacking or silent attacking. The idea is good, but so much more could have been added - such as trip mines then using a distract ability to get the security to run over the trip mine to get to a noise you made.I would recommend the game if it was cheap, but the current price is just asking too much for such a simple and quick to beat video game. It is very much something you would have seen on a Flash Game website.			"

""Stuck in wireframe offices""Ingenious but short topdown stealth game. The graphics are simplistic but nice. Wireframe offices and iconic guards and civilians. Mostly you have to deny the guard's viewfields, hack doors & cameras over a terminal hack, collect items, place intels and find the exit of a level. But you can also knockdown all guards and get 1-2 min timelimit to search the now harmless level until the reinformances arrive. I prefer the brute method to go faster.			"

Try actually reading the story instead of clicking through it.

 This game is Splinter Cell's or Watch Dog's map panel coming alive and playable. I played this game for the first time in February, an alpha version and it has come a long way. It's simple and clear, a stealth game, get to your targets as fast as possible without being noticed. The more you can stay unnoticed the more points you will get for completing each level. You will either love or hate the style, if you don't like minimalist aesthetics you clearly should not buy Light. I for one appreciate when things are done right and the minimalist graphics are great in Light. The only real complain I have is the lack of a ""soft"" introduction to what is going on. A short cinematic with voice over. Something that would go well with the game aesthetics. Instead you immediately start playing the game with the tutorial (where some of the story is explained). That and the lack of more levels. The game feels short for what you are paying, almost making me ""not recommend"" the game for now.Pros- aesthetics, love it or hate it, in it's own style it's very well done- there's no distractions or bull***t, you have a job in each mission that's what you should do- soundtrack, I loved it, goes very well with a stealth game- the field of view is very well doneCons- the game feels incredibly short. I am in hopes the development will bring more levels and updates- I would have liked a more soft introduction to the story like a short cinematic- your character opens the door just by getting close, in some situations I would have liked to be able to control that			"

												I wrote a new review. Old review is below it.This game sucks. It fails on most levels. The music is good to start with, but then you listen to the same cliche hacker music for the entirety of the game, and you'll hate it by the end.But don't worry, you'll only be listening to that game for 50-80 min, because the game is that short. If your terrible at it, like me, it can take 100 min, tops.And I'm not bad at stealth games, its the ♥♥♥♥ing abominable cover, line of sight, and mechanics.Here is a list of cons (with no pros to think of):short (could beat in 7ish minutes)bad coverbad line of sightno reason not to just kill everybodyboring (predictable) storybad (nonexistant) combatPointless things:relocking doorsswitching colors with a dead personplaying this game(in regards to the old review, I have no idea what I was thinking when I wrote the review, I really just didn't care enough to expand it to the length that I just have.""Review from a while back (Right after this game came out):""This is a great game...But is not worth $12.I wish I could recommend this. I really do. It's just that this isn't worth it.PROS:Very fun stealth mechanicsMore Detail to Line of sight than most AAA gamesInteresting StoryCONS:The entire game takes about 100 minutes if you are ok at playing (like me)There is no mode in here except storyThe replay value is moderateOverall:6.5/10But if the price is dropped, and the game adds new modes, like missions or multiplayer, then this game will be a 10/10""			"

												Light is a simplistic stealth game with an interesting story. Different from most other Stealth games I personally have played, Light drops you in the middle of a conspiracy where you wake up knowing nothing. Light reminds me of Monaco, but with some of the most useful abilities all rolled up into one character. Getting the hang of Light is pretty basic. WASD move you around, E causes you to interact with objects, while 2 and 3 have their own uses I will not get into, lest I spoil some of the fun. One minor difference from Monaco is that the guards in Light do not ever give up. Once you have been spotted, they come looking for you. Further, if you are detected, then you only have 2 minutes to complete the mission before reinforcements arrive. Honestly, this makes sense to me. Where as Monaco is slapstick silly with humor that just seems to be used to lighten the mood, Stealth has none. You are merely driven to complete the Story and find out what is going on. The music in Light was pretty entertaining and for once I didn't actually listen to anything else while playing it. I wish controls could be readjusted, however, joy2win can solve this problem for you. A nice feature called peek is introduced which allows you to point your mouse in a direction and right click giving you a peek of that area. You'll have to try it to understand.The graphics are very simplistic, but for what the game does, not much more is needed. Things that need some detail, are detailed. Those that do not, are not. Could more effort have been put into it? Absolutely, however, the game isn't designed that way on purpose. It features an interesting matrix of graphic features that make you worry about sight lines, and whether or not you can be seen. Personally I find this entertaining as it keeps you fairly focused. The biggest problem here is the price tag. At 12.99 this game is seriously overpriced. While the dev has promised additional content, nothing yet has been seen of which I am aware. Due to the pricing issue here, the game is being knocked a few overall points. I didn't notice the price tag when I started playing. Overall: 7.2/10 - Get it in a bundle or at a serious discount and you can add a point and a half. Don't pay $13 for this... currently not worth it and it feels like it's been abandoned by the dev.Edited for No Purpose other than Steam Awards: Hey there. Still wish I had more content.			"

												Played the prototype they had a couple of months ago, and playing the finished game is just great. Great minimalistic look, tight controls and nice hacking in the heat of the moment to open doors, acquire data, shut security cameras off so you can find the information you need and escape. the stealth mechanics are simple and great, as you see in the pictures it's all about the enemies field of vision and, you, and the objects between the two, don't be in their vision and use the surrounding objects to hide from them. One cool thing too is that you can knock anyone out and wear their cloths to disguise your self in front of security cameras (not enemies though) and hide their dead bodies in like a closet. The story is also nice where you have lost your memories and are set to acquire more information about yourself and the company that's out to capture you. Didn't finish the game, so i don't know how many levels there are, but so far I'm liking the game. Wouldn't mind seeing a level editor with Steam workshop to have a lot of community levels.Update: Just noticed you see all the levels in the begging, there are 13, and I'm half way through. Knowing how many levels there is (that get harder the further you progress), it isn't that many concidering i finished 7 of them in less than an hour. Although replaying them is a thing i would probably do. So all n all i like the game, but wether you think it's worth the 13$ (sale 9$) is up to you i guess. For me it's a ok purchase, and like how the game plays. Will definitly recommend buying it if there was an editor for players to make their own levels, then it would be high on my recommendation list. Update 2: Finished it, all good, but at the moment, a good 5 dollars is the good price for this game. Unless they add an editor. Update 2.5: They're adding an editor, no date for the update yet.			"

												Light is an interesting little game which puts emphasis on stealth-based gameplay. Looking at the pictures you would not think it has a story as the square-shaped characters all represent the employees of a multinational company with a sinister agenda. And while it is interesting to find out who you are and what the company is after just because there are intel files scattered across the dozen levels I would not call this a ""gripping narrative"". On almost every level you need to find the exit while avoiding the cone of vision the company guards have. Regularly, you need to hack a terminal or the door but the hacking is simply done with the press of a button without the inclusion of any minigames.The problem with Light is that the text the creators came up with that appears on the store page is misleading - it simply makes us believe that this is a more complex game than what it really is. This is not necessarily a problem - especially if a game has a great soundtrack such as Light - but Light's gripping tale suddenly ends after 12 levels. Half of which can be completed in a mere half an hour. Then you finish the game in another half an hour and you make up your mind whether or not to let the game idle for an additional 2-3 just to get all the missing trading cards.I did stay. Still, I do not recommend this game as I'm sure there are many others such as Light but either with more interesting story and more complex mechanics - things that make you stay longer.			"

												Overall this is an enjoyable game, but the stealth aspect means it can also get frustrating, and I kind of felt like the story wasn't fully explored/resolved after I reached the end.   So my opinion is a bit more neutral but certainly not negative, hence the ""yes"" recommendation.  Basically, you have to sneak your way past guards and security cameras, hacking computers as you go to open doors or turn off cameras, in order to clear a set of basic puzzle-like levels that involve gathering information and such to figure out why you're in the situation you are here.  The better you are at hiding and remaining unseen, and the faster you complete the levels, the higher your score.  You can see the cones of view of guards and cameras though, which helps in figuring out when and where to move.  Combat is an option though, and you can kill guards or bystanders and disguise yourself as them, though this typically decreases your score.  It also frequently triggers a 2-minute countdown until reinforcements arrive, meaning you'll likely be in more trouble if you can't finish the level before then.  The story was nice and the music was good, both of which helped keep my interest especially when I had trouble passing levels.  The graphics and game mechanics are simple, but those seem to work in the game's favor, making it easy to understand and play.However, the game is on the short side, as many reviews before have said.  As I write this, there are only 12 levels in the game and they didn't seem particularly large, but I've read that the develers do plan to add more content.  Once you figure out how to clear the levels, they're probably only a few minutes long each, at most.  It took me a bit over 3 hours to finish the game while trying to remain undetected and not killing people if I could avoid it.  I'm not sure how some people are finishing this in less than 1 hour -- maybe I'm just bad at stealth games and/or they're really good at them.  But for me, it was a decent length even if it did involve replaying the same few levels a bunch of times, and wasn't as frustrating as some stealth games can be for me.Also, there doesn't seem to be very much replay value here.  Sure, you can replay levels trying to improve your score, but that probably isn't much fun after a while.  Achievements aren't a big draw here either, as you'll get 12 out of 13 simply by clearing each level in the game.  I guess figuring out the last one is the trick.  But once you complete the game, there doesn't seem to be very much to encourage you to replay it.The price may be the biggest drawback here:  $13 is a lot to pay for a 12-level game with limited replay value that can be completed in a few hours if you're not a good player and less than 1 hour if you are.  It does come with the soundtrack (in .wav format though), which helps cover the price a bit, but it still seems like the $/hour value here isn't that great, especially if you're good at stealth games and end up breezing through this.  I got this in a recent Humble Bundle and at the effective price I paid there, I think it was worth it.  But given the length/duration/replay notes above, I wouldn't suggest paying full price for this -- watch and wait for a sale instead.  I think you'll enjoy this game a lot more, whether or not you're a fan of stealth games, if you can get it at a nice discount.			"

												This game will last you less than an hour. That wouldn't be a problem if the experience packed into that hour was socks-rockingly great. But it's not - it's aggressively mediocre in all aspects but soundtrack.The story is eye-rollingly unconvincing in the same way that kid at school whose dad totally worked for Nintendo was unconvincing. Worse, it's told clumsily (e.g. confidential project journal entries printed out and scattered in the company's lobby, to name one of the less stupid moments). The gameplay looks interesting, but in the absence of level design to hold it together ultimately boils down to ""run around, tap at yellow things, avoid red things"". The guard AI is dull and seems to have been rostered from extremely nearsighted personnel who all forgot to bring their contact lenses to work. The ""hacking"" looked cool in the trailer but does not actually lead to any interesting possibilities, instead acting as a red-key-blue-key-green-key series of hotspots.The soundtrack is pretty good, though.

												Updated review: I came back to see if I could change my recommendation to a buy but according to the forums all of the problems I had with the game(Level design and length of play- 45 mins) are still present. It's too bad. Still, I won't hesitate to buy the next game from this studio. They have tons of talent and now have very clear feedback on what they need to focus on next time. Seems like a guaranteed hit. Good luck! OLD REVIEW BELOWWow, great game! Why then am I saying don't buy it? Because it's an hour long. It's also not really challenging at all. I failed 3 levels and the rest I passed on my first try. What we have here are a team of great artist, composer, programer and project manager but completely lacking a dedicated or talented level designer(sorry to offend this person). The game just isn't long enough or challenging and without a massive community of mod makers this game is theft at $9. If you can get it for $5, go for it. I will definitely buy the inevitable multiplayer sequel.			"

												Light is a short and simple 2D stealth game.It's fairly easy, and gives you the option of completing most stages how you like. You can avoid killing completely or kill everyone. You can go sneak around undetected or make a run for it.In each of the 12 levels, you are tasked with completing 1-4 objectives before exiting the level. The only fail condition is that you get killed by one of the guards. The whole game, and all achievements, can be completed in about an hour.The graphics are sleek and simple, and if you don't like the effects, you can turn them off in the options menu. The music is enjoyable too, which is great, because the developers include the soundtrack for free.			"

												If I had to describe Light to anybody, it'd probably be ""Soliton Radar System: The Game.""  Those familiar with the Metal Gear Solid series will be familiar with the phrase and know what it means, but to the uninitiated, Light is a minimalist stealth game where your number one objective is to complete simple ""find the item, hack the consoles"" while staying out of the enemies' and cameras' cones of vision. There's really not that much more to the game. Avoid cones, access data, and engage in a simple hacking mechanic to open doors and shut off cameras.  Coming in at a very small twelve missions, it shouldn't take anyone who grasps the mechanics quickly enough that long to complete, and there's not really much else to engage with beyond getting better scores on each mission. Light makes for a pretty fun one or two hour experience, but the price tag may be just a tad high for how little content there is and how simple the mechanics are. Had the hacking and disguise systems been fleshed out just a tad more and the narrative been a bit more involved, I'd have considered it somewhere close to the level of Gunpoint. At its current price however, it's probably best to hold off for a sale or permanent price drop before committing.			"

												I love stealth games overall. Love hiding almost forever and waiting for right moment.Light has interesting and simple visuals, i am ok with it, there is a lot space left for players imagination and i like imaginate :).Light has very nice alectronic ambient soundtrack, i like it.Also Light is very short (no more 2-3 hours if you try to be really stealth and if you do not kill anyone, it is really hard in this case), but i am ok with it too.Light has very nice and interesting story.But stealth in Light, which is primarily stealth game, was a huge dissapointment for me. You can change your suit (aka disguise) for suit of killed civilian or guard. But no matter if you do or not, guards and cameras allways detect you as enemy.You can kill and hide everyone in cabinets, toilets etc., but every time you kill someone a message ""reinforcements arrive in 2:00 minutes"" will pop up, no matter if you kill someone in crowded room or in a lonely place.You can't go ""under"" cameras and stay undetected while staying in place, which is one of basic stealth mechanics.Guards are able see you (even walk!) through opened door if you hide behind them.This is how stealth really should not be done, imho. Someone wrote ""nice idea, terrible execution"" and unfortunately i must absolutely agree. Moreover there are a lot of games which primarily are not stealth, but they are much more enjoyable in stealth than this ""stealth"" game.More than complete game it seems to me like just proof of concept ... but this concept is very very unfinished in this case :(.Conclusion:Overall dissapointed, moreover because this is my first ""not reccomending"" review on Steam. Moreover because i am huge fan of stelath mechanics and stealth games.			"

												I did get this in a bundle and can't really say what I payed for it was too much. A few €/$ would be totally fine because what little gameplay is there is pretty good. It has a nice minimalistic artstyle and good soundtrack. But there is no way I could recommend it at full or even a reduced price in a Steam sale. There is just way to little gameplay (my gameplay time is pretty much all idle time to get the cards). I finished the game in about 40 - 50 minutes or something. And there is little reason to replay the levels unless you really enjoy speedrunning. Short games can be fine, but this is not Borthers or Gone Home. It does not tell a compelling story that makes up for limited gameplay, The mechanics are good enough but the game really needs 10 times the levels to really be worth what they are asking for it. If you get it really cheep, then by all means there are worse games to spend an hour on. But unless the game is at least 75% or you really don't care about game lenght, save your money.			"

												To begin with, this is a good game.  The gameplay is exactly as they show it, not much more, not any less.  The graphics are alright, as well as the sounds and music.  There's a story there, but it's not anything way over the top, and it's obviously not the focus of the game.  Therefore, if you like what you see in the trailers, than you might like the actual game.Where the issue comes in is the game's length compared to its cost.  At only 12 levels, all but two or three of which can be easily solved in under a minute or two, it's quite possible to see literally all this game has to offer in under a half an hour, even if you don't manage to rush your way through every map.There is obviously much more that could be done with this in terms of content (additional levels, level editor, diverging story paths), and mechanics (more hacking options outside of unlocking doors and disabling cameras, additional enemy types or obstacles) which people may come to expect from such a game, but the developers chose to keep it simple, and I don't feel misled.All in all, it's a good game, and it plays as expected, it's just far too short, especially considering the current price.

												I ONLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME if you have got it from a bundle or about 1£.Light is a very short but little fun game. A game you can easily play for a short time and walk away again. It can take between a half to 1 hour or more if you choose to only beat the game or to try to beat the levels perfectly.It is a simple ""stealth"" like game with a little bit of strategy and puzzle within.And also I haven't really played other games like this, so that also has to be taken in consideration when reading my review. :)Cons.- very, very short. NOT WORTH it with its the normal price.- Nearly all levels you can beat in like 2 minutes.(Which is both good or bad)- More difficult achievements could be fun, maybe some degree of difficulty(easy, hard and so on)- More levels would of course have been better, or larger maps :)Pro.- It is a good game if you want a game were you can beat a level in 2-5 minutes as a little break from studies, work or what ever.- I do like its design, simpel but pretty and it works smoothly - You can beat the levels in different way totally or semi stealthy or try to kill everyone(even though that gives you a low score, but can be fun)- Not the best plot in the world, but I think it was good enough for me to keep playing ^^- it is very good for achievement and cards hunters - Ignore what people says about that if you kill a guard and disguise yourself, it doesn't make any difference besides the countdown. It does make a difference! the guards and cameras viewfelt for discovering you becomes a lot smaller if you disguise as a guard :)- I do like that even though you can kill guards easily, then they can kill you easier. So yeah if you want a little game with a little bit of strategy and puzzle and it is a stealth like game, then this is for you when it is on sale or in a bundle ^^			"

												    Light is a top-down stealth game with a rather beautiful visual style. Despite its very simplistic graphics, and the representation of characters as squares, the game does a really good job with aestethics, pleasantly combining its blue-ish colour palette with nice shadow and lighting effects. The sound is equally minimalistic, with only a few sound effects being featured, while the music selection is ok and appropriate in the context, but after a while it can get quite irritating.    Over the course of around 12 missions, you will have to try and sneak around, avoiding patroling guards and security cameras while accomplishing your tasks per each map. These range from hacking a terminal to collecting intelligence, and often require getting to one specific computer, from which you can deactivate cameras and open locked doors, then backtrack or find the newely opened access point. Guards have a standard route they follow, and they don't deviate from it unless they spot you. This makes the game trial-and-error based, which can be quite fun an times, and frustrating at others. Wearing a disguise makes the guards' area of detection considerably smaller, so that it's much easier to navigate around the maps.     Killing guards is possible, but only from close range, and it's not recommended, since it will eventually alert other guards, and they will call for reinforcements. This will also considerably lower your score for each level, not that it matters in any way except for personal satisfaction. I played the whole game stealthily and avoiding detection, and it took me around 2 hours to complete the game 100%. If you don't attempt to do this, you might be able to finish it in under an hour. The plot is interesting, but sometimes confusing    In a nutshell, Light is a pleasant experience, and if you play it stealthily, it will boost both your satisfaction and your gametime (though not by much). However, considering its length, the 12 euro price is absolutely ridiculous. I got it in a Humble Bundle, so it's perfectly fine, but if I were to buy it individually, I would not spend more than 3 euros on it. My recommendation : wait for a 75% off sale.			"

												This game is as minimalist as it gets. It's quite short (you can finish it in uder an hour), the controls are simple, and the levels are rather small. Still, I recommend it; after all, a game doesn't have to be incredibly long, full of complex mechanics, or with huge levels to be captivating.The art style, for example, is beautiful, and so is the soundtrack. It really sets the tone for a stealth game in which you sneak around hacking systems while trying to recover your memory. As far as the stealth system goes, you must avoid getting spotted by security guards and cameras; civilians won't do anything if the spot you. You must be aware of their patrols, and their range of vision; you can peek around to see if the coast is clear, and you can also use disguises. Although, unlike other games with stealth and disguises involved, using a disguise doesn't make the security guards friendly, they just reduce their range of vision (which means they'll spot you only when you're close to them). You can kill the guards (and even the civilians) and hide their bodies, but it won't go unnoticed, as you'll have some time before they send in reinforcements.The hacking mechanic is also a simple one. You just need to approach the terminal you're willing to hack, and hold E until you hack it. After that, you can enter ""Hack mode"" even when you're away from the terminal, and, in this mode, you can disable security cameras and open locked doors.The story is the typical ""guy who lost his memory uncovers a conspiracy while trying to regain it"", but it's still interesting, as you find notes and hack into systems looking for info about it.In conclusion, it's a nice, albeit short, stealth game.

												Incredibly stylish visuals and a strong electronica soundtrack are the high points of a game that lasts roughly half an hour. Then the credits are rolling, you’ll have at least 12 of the 13 achievements and absolutely no reason to revisit this ever again. Light is essentially a top down stealth game, the only problem being that stealth is almost entirely unnecessary due to the ability to kill guards, simple level design and a general difficulty factor of “Non-existent.” Game mechanics such as being able to drag enemy bodies and hide them in lockers are quickly revealed to be utterly pointless, while hacking is little more than a delayed standard interaction. Even the threat of enemy reinforcements, a two-minute timer counting down from the moment you make your first kill, means very little - in the unlikely event that they manage to arrive before you beat the level, they’re just as easy to dispose of as regular enemies. There is no tension, no frantic escapes or desperate assaults, and consequently the game ends up feeling nothing like a stealth game and more like a 2D walking simulator. Which might not be so bad if the story was compelling. Told entirely in text boxes just a little too small (and with words that often miss out the letter L. Intentional or not, it’s distracting), it begins on the cliché of “waking with amnesia” and never really recovers. There’s no hook - vital to any game storyline, let alone a game of this length - and the little boxes of text soon become as pointless as the ability to disguise yourself in a guard’s clothes. Beyond that, the narrative simply doesn’t gel with a game world in which the people are, well, cubes. Minimalism and storytelling worked for Thomas Was Alone because of a fantastic voiceover and a solid few hours of gameplay. Both are missing here, and it’s impossible for me to imagine anyone walking away from the story feeling inspired, enlightened or otherwise impressed. The graphics and audio really are Light’s saving graces, then, and they work in almost perfect symphony. With a perspective that immediately invokes Hotline Miami, the distinct visuals allow Light to take on an identity of its own with striking environments that create a perfect blend of digital and reality. The music is similarly terrific, providing an atmospheric soundtrack with an air of the suspenseful and the ominous, without ever straying too close to downbeat. It’s mostly enjoyable on its own, too, which makes the soundtrack's inclusion with purchases of the game a nice touch. But in the end, there’s simply not enough content here, or content that plays well, to justify spending anything more than the cost of a (cheap) coffee. Even high score fanatics will be hard-pressed to stick with it for any longer than one or two hours. I don’t believe the developers - a team of five, according to the credits - set out to make a poor game, or to rip anyone off, but regardless, the game as it exists now functions as little more than a demonstration, a proof-of-concept, perhaps even the tutorial to what should have been a bigger title. It’s a shame, because Light’s not a bad game, not truly - it's just not enough of a game at all.			"

YouTube™ Video: 20 Minutes of Game - LIGHT 

			Views: 30		

			A mash-space-'em-up holding a sign saying ""I REALLY WANT TO BE A STEALTH GAME"" Game link - http://store.steampowered.com/app/271730/ All music is in-game music.		

Hmm.The game itself wasn't bad, it just felt unfinished and rushed in places.The graphics were quite nice other than the rather jerky shadow effects which felt like they were originally going to hide stuff behind, but they were just visual effects. Only 4 disguises was a bit too little, I would have liked to have seen a bit more variety.Story-wise, the game builds up and up and up and up and then stops. The climax never really comes, you just end up in a prison and escape. The rest of the story is boring and un-memorable.Gameplay. No. Not good. The game really tries to push the ""sneak - hack - steal"" gameplay, but overall rushing was the best and quickest tactic. Just running through mashing space and sometimes pressing E worked surprisingly well. Guards had Metal Gear syndrome, where they couldn't see anything UNLESS you were in the default clothing, in which case they were eagles. Also, having a guard disguise did nothing different to a civillian disguise. This really took me out of the ""stealth"" part of this game because just killing a civillian and switching costumes, then leaving the body there had the same effect as sneakily killing a guard, switching his costume, putting him in a cupboard and stealthily running away. 2 minutes until reinforcements and a disguise.Achievements were laughable, just complete the game to get all of them. The disguise achievement just kill someone  and mash ""3"" for a while and you'll get it.Levels - 12. Not enough. I played the game mostly stealthy and beat it in ~72 minutes. Speedrunning the game would take ~18 minutes, maybe less. Workshop support and a level editor would make the game long enough for the £10 they are charging. By my logic, a game should cost £1-£2 per hour. This game costs £10 an hour. Yay.Overall rating - 4/10 - Not worth your time. Go get monaco or Hotline Miami instead.			"

												Visually appealing, stealthly, and puzzle a game. The game play was very simple, got monotonous very quickly. Restarting over when a small thing wasn't right was frustrating. Over all I had some enjoyment but in the end I completed the game just to finish. Either more complex game play with more levels would make it better. Team 17 did a good job with the game, if only they could tone down the monotonous aspects of it.			"

												absolutely do not pay full price for this game, i rate it at between 7 cents and 25 cents in value. this would get a meh to ok'ish on a free flash game site.no saves, only checkpoints are the start of each levelonly 10 relatively short levels, i wouldn't be surprised if a speed runner could do the whole game in 10-15 minutes.most of your game time will be redoing levels trying to get the rythm of it.as long as you are not spotted, camera'ed, and don't kill anyone you have infinite time, otherwise a 2 min countdown starts after which guards with cheat sight are sent after you. this is a non-issue for many of the levels since they are less than 2 minutes if things go well.there is no real inventory except changing clothes if you find some or from a dead body, which cuts guard sight range in half, ie you can't look at a document other then when you pick it upin some places there can be trouble telling between wall and non-wall art, also when first starting it take a while to get used to wall v glass wall. level score doesn't affect anything so don't worry about it.the guards have something shotgun like but you will never wield a gun in game, just a near point blank melee kill.there is no hacking minigame, just walk up to a terminal, hold a button to hack, press another button to login, click the checklist of cameras and door locks, and logout. some doors and cameras are not linked to a computer and therefore are not hackable.no cutscenes or special ending, just level intro text, text when you pick up some evedence, and a very few npc dialogues.i'm writing this 2014/11/15, the game may change in the future.

												+ Short but sweet (< 1 hour)+ Minimalistic look+ Good soundtrack+/- Even though the story is told through text (very clear, mind you) it would've been nice to see an intro for each level, or at least some animations, to make it more immersive+/- The AI civilians sometimes get in the way. However, the levels are so short that it isn't really frustrating but it's still something I'd like to mention- Needs a better (proper?) ending- Still way too short (or we're simply paying too much for what we're actually getting)- I don't exactly know what it is that it's missing but it needs some kind of incentive to keep people (re)playing (like Leaderboards or Steam Workshop)[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Worth playing, but only at the right price. Light is a fun little stealth/action game, the stealth mechanics are fairly typical (disguises, hiding bodies etc.) but unless they are a specific mission requirement they're often not essential to make progress in the game. For me personally it just turned into a quick dash around the levels trying to kill the bad guys and get out, this was largely due to the fact that the stealth mechanics seemed fairly irrelevant (you can disguise yourself but enemies still spot and react to you in the same way). Overall Light doesn't quite deliver on its premise and it certainly isn't worth the full asking price but for a very low price or in a bundle it's definitley an entertaining diversion.http://jamesvssteam.blogspot.co.uk/ "

												My primary criterion for games these days is whether they run on Linux, which this does admirably.I found this game engaging, though frustrating at times, possibly because I obsessively avoided killing any guards.The difficulty curve mostly increases steadily, up until the last 6 missions, where it takes a leap for two of those, becomes easier at the airport, then the penultimate mission is reasonably challenging. However I can understand the curve being a bit of a sharp increase, given how few levels there are.I was left a bit nonplussed at the end, when it abruptly cut to credits without any closiure as to whether my actions saved the world after all.I would still recommend this game though as it was entertaining.

												A good example of how somthing simple can be entertaining with basic graphics, a sutable soundtrack and levels that follow an interesting storyline. Light is a great game design study, however it falls short with its extremely breif play time. It simply is not developed enough to be worth the sales price of $14. There is so much more that could be done with the game mechanics and story development. I recomend this as a game design study or if you can get it on sale for around $1. Otherwise you will be dissapointed with its pricy play time.			"

												If it were a mobile game, it would be fine, but as a full fledged PC title, it feels like a long demo.The trailer gave of a completely different air to the finished product - It gave the impression of a steadily paced stealth adventure with an intriguing story. What was delivered is a slightly too fast, hollow game with nice graphical design. Just a few points regarding gameplay: The complete lack of intelligence behind all the non-security NPCs is dissapointing - I don't know why they randomly wander about doing very little aside from sitting and pooping, and have no kind of reaction to external stimuli whatsoever. The unecessarily pumpy soundtrack would make more sense in an action game, and the overly fast movement makes any real feelings of fear of capture null and void. Why can nobody see over the tops of tables? The quick retry option, whilst nice for fast paced gameplay, makes it feel like there is no real penalty for death. And the achievements? One for passing each of the short levels, and kill a collection of random NPCs to change outft repeatedly - that's it. Nothing relating to getting through a level undetected, or locking a security guard in a room via hacking, or maybe even killing every guard in a level without hurting the civilians.All the features of this game (aside from the perspective and visual style) where polished to a mirror sheen in games like Gunpoint and Mark of the Ninja, with more interesting stories, whilst also providing more engaging gameplay. It had potential, with an interesting aesthetic and the opportunity to innovate, but it falls flat.			"

That's why the game ist totally overpriced and should only be purchased during a sale when it is 1€.Pros+ simple but cool neon style graphic+ simply mechanics+ easy achievementsCons- wearing a disguise doesnt do anything.

												I think this is an unfinished tech demo or something. It looks pretty and the idea is nice, but it just doesn't seem....finished. The basic gameplay is an obvious rip-off of the likes of Hotline Miami and Third Eye Crime...but there are some stupid flaws in the ""finished"" product.First of all, the game can be finished in about 45 minutes. £9.99 for that? That's ridiculous. I know that we shouldn't judge games based on their length, but surely this is pushing their luck...Secondly, there are some curious flaws in the guards motion. It's tricky to predict their movement because you watch one, and he turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left...so you follow him, and he turns right and shoots you. There is NO warning he's going to do that. In addition, it seems very hit-and-miss whether they can see through things like chairs (and yes, I know about the windows - that one was obvious)Thirdly, some of the gameplay features don't seem to make any sense. If you kill someone, the guards are alerted immediately, even if there's nobody else in the area. You can hide the body, but it doesn't make any difference at all to what happens next. You'd expect the guards to take longer to find you...or perhaps the timer doesn't start until someone finds the body? If you kill someone you're given the option to swap clothes, but again, it doesn't seem to do anything. Camera still detect you, guards still shoot you on sight....so why bother?There's a good game here...and I'll be interested when it's finished.			"

												While you can just play the game without the story and not lose much insight, it is not a bad idea to read along and try to get into the story a bit. I recommend this mainly because there is not too much to the game itself and if you are going to pay for it you would want to get your moneys worth. It was not a bad game and was challenging at times but did not emerse me very much and was very much like a flash game you would play online. If you are looking for a short game that you can easily get through in one sitting and can get it cheap then I would go for it.			"

												In 'Light', a small team of developers have produced something polished, clean and without any excess or waste. Both the gameplay and the visual style are trimmed down to the absolute minimum whilst still providing satisfying immersion and flow. Personally I liked the minimalist style, however I can imaine this will not be to everybody's taste...The gameplay is a fairly typical 'stealth-em-up', watching guard patterns, dodging cameras and hacking terminals to unlock doors and disable security... again, there is really not much else to say as this has been cut down to the absolute essentials. The objectives for each level are clearly marked in the upper right hand corner of the screen and the plot unfolds through on-screen text conversations and examined documents. Whilst this is a recommendation I would warn potential buyers that I completed the game in under and hour - I could imagine stretching the playtime a little by going back to 'stealth' the levels where I was spotted and forced to kill a guard... but that really wasn't too many. Those familiar with 'Monaco' or 'Hotline Miami' will glide through this fairly easily - I would like to have seen more challenge overall. Pros: - Minimalist Style- Smooth control and polished gameplay- Nice SoundtrackCons: - Very Short- Not overly Challenging- Low Replay Value			"

												For those who complain it is short, well yes; the game took me just an hour to complete with stealth and there isn't much replayability value... Yet, this game doubles as a melee only top down action game where you can literally speedrun the game in 15 minutes, or less by simply killing everything by repeadedly pressing space and suprising guards around corners. It even has the ""press R to restart"" I feel like I'm back in Hotline Miami. It's scoring system is meant to deter you from making the stealth game play like an action game, but scores don't matter! The real incentive is the amount of fun you have when taking out all the backup they throw at you when you've murdered every poor innocent square and guard there is on that level. I mean sure, you can actually do the objectives, they're super straightforward and easy, but the real enjoyment is in surviving waves upon waves of the backup. So I think all the people whom have given this game a thumbs down need to try playing this game again the right way.			"

												Honestly, it is actually a well-made game. But it effectively is a demo of a well-made game. The ideas are not fully realized at all. The can be so much more depth, but the devs were like ""OK, we've developed the idea 15%, let's ship this"". It's a good thing I knowingly bought the game that it was short, cause had I not known that, if the game ended right where it ended now, I would be seriously ENRAGED! It's not really just about the price. One part of it surely is that - 45 mins of gametime for $15 is ludicrous! But the bigger issue here is that the game is fundamentally and conceptually strong, but the execution of these concepts fall real short. It's like a sad thing more than an angry one. By all means, if you value money, don't get this for $15. There is no point whatsoever. Short on content, undeveloped ideas and a pretty easy game to be honest. Wishlist the game and get it when it goes on a deep discount ($5 or less preferably).			"

												This is a great game, with immersive music and a fantastic storyline, yet many people who bought it don't recommend it out of ""it's too short"". First of all, it is an indie game. Even though now any game not made by a huge company is defined as indie and some could compete with non-indie games, the ""indie"" tag should make you think that maybe it isn't a game with the longest playtime or the most fun missions. Not to say that this game doesn't have fun missions, I loved it. I did complete it in just over an hour, achievements included, but that doesn't mean it was bad, hell, in 3 sessions I finished it; that doesn't mean ""it was soo short, hated it"", on the contrary: I was so into the game that the only reasons I stopped playing it for a while was to eat. Now, how many games did you play until completion, interrupting only to eat or sleep? Not many. It was a really fun game to play, and I'm hoping that the developers realise that they could expand upon it so much, from a longer, more intriguing storyline to more fun missions, instead of just the level completion ones. Do I recommend this game? (as you probably figured by the thumbs up at the top of this post) Yes, yes I do. Should you expect a Tomb Raider-like, time consuming game? You shouldn't, but that's why this game is categorised as Indie and you haven't heard of it before.			"

												A short review for a very short game:Pro:- Stealth aspects- Action aspects- Game made with heart!Con:- Too short....in one hour you can get easily ALL Achievements.- Price (For less than a hour gameplay paying 12 Euro is just not okay!)- More than 10 months ago the dev promised more content. Nothing happened since then. Instead they started a new project. First talking about more levels, level editors and other stuff and now nothing. I'm disappointed! "

It captured the feelings I had the first time I played games like Metal Gear Solid, Hitman and Splinter Cell and wrapped it up in this beautiful minimalistic little bundle.I've read reviews say it's too short and to be honest if that's the only negative there is to say it highlights the strength of this game.Fantastic game!

												The aesthetics are fine -- the clean, stylized top-down view works well for this stealth game, the controls feel good. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end for me. The music was not bad, but nothing to write home about. The writing was rather contrived; it seemed like the story was quickly cobbled together to support a few levels of stealth gameplay and comes to an abrupt, unsatisfying end.The gameplay didn't have much depth to it either. Most guards are easily snuck past. Sometimes you'll want to kill one, as a guard outfit makes circumventing the cameras and other guards significantly easier, and the trade-off of having to deal with the reinforcements never comes into play because the levels are so short that you are done before the reinforcement timer runs out.The hacking portion has no depth to it at all. It's simply a matter of finding the computers and pushing all the buttons, which will open doors, turn off cameras, etc. There's no special gameplay or decision-making involved.All in all, the game falls incredibly short of the expectations set by the price point.PS: Some people are defending the game by pointing to the small size of the development team. Much bigger and better games have been done by smaller teams. Obviously every game's development history is different, and not every team can commit the same time and resources, but they chose to release what barely qualifies as a demo as a full game for 12 bucks -- I feel it's only fair for people to criticize the games flawed aspects and rate it accordingly.

YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Light Critique (Steam Review) 

			Views: 102		

			An in-depth critique by SwashbucklingSir of the stealth hacking game Light. Minimalistic, futuristic artstyle meets sneaking gameplay. Check it out!		

Light features a very stylish, minimalistic artstyle underlined by very fitting sound design. The gameplay is rather simplistic though, as the levels have rather predetermined pathways and not enough room to allow different approaches. Thus the game plays a lot like a puzzle game. While I enjoyed my time with Light, sneaking and avoiding cones of visions from guards and cameras, hacking terminals to unlock doors and the like, recommending the game is not incredibly easy. This has nothing to do with the simplistic hacking that neither challenges you (time is frozen, guards cannot detect you, the amount of things you hack has no influence) nor requires any more input than just clicking (unlike for example the hacking in Human Revolution). It also has nothing to do with the lacking need of hiding bodies as the reinforcement timer starts anyways as soon as you kill someone, whether you are detected or not. No, the reason it is hard to recommend this game at this current time point is the very short gametime. With barely an hour, Light currently does not offer enough for the asking price.I do give Light a thumbs-up anyways as I think either with a Steam Sale pricing or with future patches (the developer Just A Pixel announced that more content will be released, so stay tuned) the game is definitely worth your time.

												Unfortunately I cannot recommend Light. Although I like the stealth mechanics, the music and the style, the list of negative points is just too big - even if you ignore the price (as nowadays you can get nearly any game on a discount sooner or later; I got this game when it was 75% off, for example): The gameplay should be much more diverse. While I am not saying there should be lots of gimmicks for the player, I feel that not even the hacking mechanics was explored enough. As soon as a level is a bit bigger it becomes more confusing than interesting. Bigger levels are also bad for the hacking mechanics, as it zooms to other parts of the level and this can get annoying. The game has a lot of glitches. The guards can see through walls rarely but noticable. Even more annoying are the big leaps I got from time to time - from one moment to the other my character warped several meters forward, often landing in the visible cone of a camera or guard. The story began interesting even though a bit cliché-ridden. I can't even tell exactly how the story progressed, as it became boring pretty soon, unfortunately. The game is very short. This was mentioned a lot already, but generally I would not put that on a list of negatives. But I did play Light in a ""harder"" mode, where I tried not to get seen and not to kill anybody. This was somewhat satisfying and made the game longer than the usual 45 minutes (see my play time) - still the game was just too short, and the number of missions much too small. The second-to-last mission, which seems to be the game's climax, forces you to kill someone even if you took care not to use violence throughout the game. The developers promised more levels, but never delivered them, without any explanations.So while I enjoyed some parts of the game, I just cannot recommend it, as in it's current state is just wasted potential.

												A pretty but simplistic and bare-bones stealth game that can be completed in under an hour.Stealth consists of avoiding vision cones. You can only interact with the environment by killing guards when you are next to them, hiding guard bodies, putting on a disguise to reduce vision cone size, unlocking doors, and hacking terminals. The hacking is just holding a button until it's completed and all it lets you do is unlock doors and deactivate some of hte cameras. The level design is too simplistic to make  these gameplay elements any more interesting than they sound. The plot is the same amnesiac protagonist against an evil corporation plot you've heard a million times with no twists, variations, or details to raise it above every other time you've seen that plot.It was innofensively enjoyable for the 50 minutes that it lasted, but I've fnished it and, once the trading cards have dropped, I'm never going to play this again.

												completed it exactly at the 1hour mark, 100 % completion on achievments as well. There is no incentive to replay the levels except improving your scores, but to be honest, the mechanics can so easily be abused, it's just not worth the hassle in my opinion (not a speedrunner/highscore chaser at heart btw). It does feel like a good way of starting to get into this kind of genre, seeing as it's kinda easy, to get used to these kind of games (like me). But if you're a veteran in these games, I feel like there are 100's of better ones than this one right here.Overall I stil recommend it, seeing as I did have my fun out of it and when buying it at a 85% discount, it's in my opinion worth the money, but not full price!Btw, you will see a higher than 1hour playtime because I'm now going to start running the game in the background so I can get the three steam trading cards.

												My main gripe with Light is this: for a stealth-based strategy game (Sneak-Hack-Steal, it proclaims), there is very, very little encouragement to play that way.1. Killing guards go unpunished, and killing everyone you see is consistently easier than trying to remain undetected.2. You can hide bodies, but having one found has no immediate repercussions.3. You can assume disguises, but guards see through them either way.4. The graphics are designed with line of sight in mind, but details not in the player's line of sight remain visible either way.5. Movement controls are lacking and feel very delayedWant some top down neon stealth strategy arcade action? Go pick up [redacted] instead.			"

												This is a great proof of concept for a game... But it feels unfinished. Not just the length, but the gameplay. The body hiding and disguise features are essentially pointless and it's easier to just kill everyone then to actually try to be stealthy or play with the ""hacking"" which is just a fancy way of describing turning off cameras and opeing doors.  There are much better options out there if you are looking for a 2D stealth fix.			"

The stealth is shallow, the hacking is shallow, the plot is shallow, the graphics are bland, and the amount of bugs I encountered was significant for a game not in early access.The level design is generally obnoxious, due in large part to the game not having a checkpoint system. Having to repeatedly restart a level because you unknowingly walk into an unwinnable situation, or because of one mistake, or because of a bug is just terrible. I encountered one during a lengthy mission where the plot requires you to get caught at the end, but during my first playthrough of that level, getting caught registered a mission failure instead. And because the levels are all about waiting for an opening in the surveillance, it becomes all the more irritating. One particular level has you wait in the starting room for a solid 10 seconds before the AI pathing and security systems let you move on.The comments others made about it being a demo are right. There's not enough content in the game to earn the pricetag, let alone good content.			"

												I got this game as it was remembering me Frozen Synapse/gunpoint, games I enjoyed a lot, with stealth elements.I was really looking into it. I read some reviews which let me down at first but I jumped in to check for myself.Pros:-Art: I do like the blueprintish 2D view from above.-Controls: Controls respond well.-FPS: The game is running well without any problem on my Nvidia 580.-Stealth: Stealth is efficient, you need to stay out of the vision of the guardc and cctv.This is rather easy most of the time (if you get a guard outfit the vision of all the enemy gets reduced by 2, it is then very easy to get out of sight of everybody)-Punishment: If you get caught, depending where you are of course but there is a high probability that the guards will find you and one shoot you. This is good as its avoid the raise alarm run all over the place and everybody gets reset asap. As the level aren't that big it is ok to die.-Level design: The level aren't very big, which is good when you die and have to restart at the beginning.Cons:-Art: It takes time and trial to understand some of the object (like windows took me 10 run to see the difference and why that guard was seeing me despite being inside a room).-Doors: As soon as you get too close from a door it opens automaticaly, it is annoying if you want to peek inside and see the most of the room.-Kills: All the time, the only option is killing the guard and ""innocent people"" ? Despite the description of the game saying ""Stash unconscious guards in cupboards"", if I kill them, they will be dead and not unconscious.-Story: The story will be forgot as soon as you close the game, even the mission objectives lack excitment sometimes and it's a little all over the place.-Hacking: The prologue was not clear on one point. When you hack a terminal, you can access the item unlocked at anytime and you don't have to stay near the terminal you hacked.I quite enjoyed the game but it lacks on several points.Specialy when it comes to time. It took me an hour and a half to go through all the game, I have seen reviews which indicate they closed the game in under an hour)The story isn't memorable, I was reading it but just to be sure I wasn't missing anything. You won't play for the story (better for you to play gunpoint if you want something similar with a bit more of story and being able to choose your path in it).I do like to compare game to movie when it comes to price as this is, for me, interactive entertainements.For about a bit more than an hour I would expect the price of the game to be similar to a movie theatre ticket (around 7/8euros in France), I got the game on sale for 6euros which suits me well.I do recommend the game despite being so short. It was fun to play it.This game is probably for people who love stealth game and want a game that can be finish in the evening.Luuna.			"

												I would recommend this game but not at full price... I got it in a bundle so I probably paid 40-50p for it. I probably wouldn't pay anymore than £1 for it... mainly because I spent about 35 minutes on it and completed it. There are about 12 levels on it and they are fairly short levels, probably complete them in around 2 minutes. They aren't that challenging however it could probably be a little more challenging, if you were to stealth it all the way.However, the game doesn't really reward you for any of that, you may get a few extra points but they are essentially pointless as it offers no extra reward and gives you no incentive. Also because of this lack of extra reward or incentive, replayability is not really a thing...Also, there could've been much nicer stealth with the added mechanics such as disguise and hide body. Hide body allows you to hide your assasinated corpse into a cupboard so the guards don't spot it and alert the police. It seems that backup is called as soon as you kill someone, so it doesn't seem that helpful as whenever I had a body spotted, I didn't notice any extra guards/police spawn.Disguise also seems to be useless, the only useful thing is to get the achievement and to change your colour. Apart from that, security cameras still spot you and so do guards so to say it disguises you is something of a dirty lie... A dirty, dirty lie!The game is nice and simple though, basic graphics and simple gameplay. It was fun for that half an hour but I doubt I'll be replaying any time soon... Maybe leave it on to get the rest of the steam trading cards (the only incentive I can see for playing it longer than half an hour). I would only urge you to buy it if you like the game and it's not anymore expensive than £1.EDIT: I have just seen that they are incorporating level editor into it. This would definately change my review and most of the criticism I have for it and hope that it will be incorporated sooner rather than later!			"

												This game is probably the shortest game I have ever seen. It took me half an hour to complete it (100% game + 100% of achievements) but i skipped few flavour text here and there. Game is painfully easy if you are willing to kill guards (red squares). Even if you are going for no kill run this game will not provide any challange. Hacking and stealing? Ha you just click or hold on button. Click and forget. Stealh? Well i found myself way quicker than guards and most of the time there is soo much space to dodge them that I completly forgot about them.As it was mentioned in other ""reviews"" this seems like a demo or half finished game. I would not recommend this game for it's full price (12 euro!!!), however if you are into simple stealth game and grinding highscore is enough for you to keep playing I would see no harm in picking it up at 90% sale or as a part of some Humble Bundle.

LightThis review was last edited when I was on the lobby levelShort ReviewAn interesting 2D top down scroller, part adventure, action & stealth game with nice, stylised graphics that started well but soon became just too tedious to hold my interest.Long ReviewInitially you appear on the screen as a blue square and find out early on that you are ""6c 69 67 68 74 0d 0a"" and the idea is discover what has happened to you and why you are where you are.When you start there are some on screen prompts for the keys to use.The controls are a little tricky to get used to as they are spread out, WASD keys (or xBox controller) to move, arrow keys to interact, right mouse button to view away from where you are located. The screen display is a top down view largely displayed in monochrome. There is no fog of war, you can see a large section of the map on screen at any time and can use the right mouse button to scroll over to see more of the map.Items that can be interacted with are generally displayed in colour, orange for items that can interacted with by moving to be adjacent to them when the available interaction keys and their corresponding actions are displayed. Items in blue generally react automatically to your being adjacent to them without any need to manual interaction. Red items cannot currently be interacted with.There is a decent soundtrack playing in the background.The current objectives are displayed in the top RHS of the screen and that is the only information displayed other than the actual playing area so a very minimalist approach taken to interface design.At the end of each level a stats dialog is displayed showing how long it took you to complete along with points scored which is broken down into the various bonuses. You have to choice to continue to the next level or return to the main menu.On the Main menu you can select which level to enter with only unlocked levels available. Options is fairly limited but allows you to change the key bindings, but only the movement and interaction wheel key scan be rebound, as well as standard stuff like full screen/windowed, screen resolution and audio volume levels.At the start of levels there is a short textual summary of what you learnt in the previous level.ProsI liked the stylised graphicsMovement was smooth and controls, once grasped easy to useLevel loads were fastConsThe game just became tedious for meMarks Out Of 55) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away freePlatform Played OnIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse & Steelseries MERC keyboard.My best guess for a  PEGI Rating 3: I can't see any reason to raise it above this.

												I got the game as part of a bundle, and for that it was worth while because I didn't directly have to pay for the game. The game is fun, but beatable in about an hour - that includes all of the achievements because those are gotten just by beating the levels. It would take longer to beat the game if you wanted to be stealthy, but there's no reward for doing that except for a higher arbitrary score... So, yes I'm going to recommend it, but don't pay more than $2.59 for it, and I recommend not paying for it at all if you can get it part of a bundle.			"

												Unfortunately I cannot recommend Light. Although I like the stealth mechanics, the music and the style, the list of negative points is just too big - even if you ignore the price (as nowadays you can get nearly any game on a discount sooner or later; I got this game when it was 75% off, for example): The gameplay should be much more diverse. While I am not saying there should be lots of gimmicks for the player, I feel that not even the hacking mechanics was explored enough. As soon as a level is a bit bigger it becomes more confusing than interesting. Bigger levels are also bad for the hacking mechanics, as it zooms to other parts of the level and this can get annoying. The game has a lot of glitches. The guards can see through walls rarely but noticable. Even more annoying are the big leaps I got from time to time - from one moment to the other my character warped several meters forward, often landing in the visible cone of a camera or guard. The story began interesting even though a bit cliché-ridden. I can't even tell exactly how the story progressed, as it became boring pretty soon, unfortunately. The game is very short. This was mentioned a lot already, but generally I would not put that on a list of negatives. But I did play Light in a ""harder"" mode, where I tried not to get seen and not to kill anybody. This was somewhat satisfying and made the game longer than the usual 45 minutes (see my play time) - still the game was just too short, and the number of missions much too small. The second-to-last mission, which seems to be the game's climax, forces you to kill someone even if you took care not to use violence throughout the game. The developers promised more levels, but never delivered them, without any explanations.So while I enjoyed some parts of the game, I just cannot recommend it, as in it's current state is just wasted potential.

												A pretty but simplistic and bare-bones stealth game that can be completed in under an hour.Stealth consists of avoiding vision cones. You can only interact with the environment by killing guards when you are next to them, hiding guard bodies, putting on a disguise to reduce vision cone size, unlocking doors, and hacking terminals. The hacking is just holding a button until it's completed and all it lets you do is unlock doors and deactivate some of hte cameras. The level design is too simplistic to make  these gameplay elements any more interesting than they sound. The plot is the same amnesiac protagonist against an evil corporation plot you've heard a million times with no twists, variations, or details to raise it above every other time you've seen that plot.It was innofensively enjoyable for the 50 minutes that it lasted, but I've fnished it and, once the trading cards have dropped, I'm never going to play this again.

												Sweet and short... and quite short at that.The game, if played correctly can be completed in less than an hour, so if you can find it cheap, try it.The story is simply, you awaken without memories and as you play you bot remember who you are and who has been playing/experimenting with your brain and why.The game interface is simple and quite abstract, besides that is pretty in the colors and forms. It's a game quickly to learn, but to master it takes some patience, but its not actually hard. In itself, its is an interesting experiment with good narrative.			"

												+ Fun, dynamic, stealth/hacking game, with minimalistic (yet cool) design. The level editor for this thing would turn it into most fun house decorating tool.- There is no level editor, and the levels provided are over before a first card drops. The cards take twice the standard time to drop, but before they start doing so You are done with the game - both stealthy and hitman style.I did enjoy it. I would love it to be twice as long.			"

												The basic gameplay is solid, if a bit easy. Not groundbreaking, but simple and executed well enough. But the game can be 100% completed in under a half hour on your first try without much effort. And the game doesn't really introduce any new mechanics past the first level or two. Probably worth less than $2.There were also a few technical problems. I changed it to windowed and lowered the resolution and the game crashed, and the error message that popped up kept taking focus away from every other program, including task manager. Had to alt+f4 it. Worked fine after that point.			"

YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Light Critique (Steam Review) 

			Views: 102		

			An in-depth critique by SwashbucklingSir of the stealth hacking game Light. Minimalistic, futuristic artstyle meets sneaking gameplay. Check it out!		

Light features a very stylish, minimalistic artstyle underlined by very fitting sound design. The gameplay is rather simplistic though, as the levels have rather predetermined pathways and not enough room to allow different approaches. Thus the game plays a lot like a puzzle game. While I enjoyed my time with Light, sneaking and avoiding cones of visions from guards and cameras, hacking terminals to unlock doors and the like, recommending the game is not incredibly easy. This has nothing to do with the simplistic hacking that neither challenges you (time is frozen, guards cannot detect you, the amount of things you hack has no influence) nor requires any more input than just clicking (unlike for example the hacking in Human Revolution). It also has nothing to do with the lacking need of hiding bodies as the reinforcement timer starts anyways as soon as you kill someone, whether you are detected or not. No, the reason it is hard to recommend this game at this current time point is the very short gametime. With barely an hour, Light currently does not offer enough for the asking price.I do give Light a thumbs-up anyways as I think either with a Steam Sale pricing or with future patches (the developer Just A Pixel announced that more content will be released, so stay tuned) the game is definitely worth your time.

http://bosniannerd.blogspot.com/2014/12/light.htmlThis is one of those games where we need a neutral recommendation. It's not BAD, but it's far from good.Light is a... mini game with simple graphics, simple control and a nice soundtrack. You are an unknown person who has lost his memory and you are trying to escape an unknown compound while finding out what happened to you. Sounds like a story and it is. Actually, this whole game is all about the story, everything else comes in second.The game is super minimalistic: you are a blue block, neutral people are white block and hostiles are red. The world is made of lines, blocks, security cameras and lines of sight. What you need to do in each level is complete a few tasks, read little chunks of a story that unfolds as you progress and finally find an exit at each level and progress on to the next.To be honest, Light feels more like a demo of a bigger game or just a simple demo of a game engine. The controls are very simple (direction moves, attack, hack, use) and levels are very, very short. If you know your way around, you can complete most levels in under a minute and be done with the whole game in less than 20! On my first (and only) run, it took me 45 minutes to complete the whole game. I can't say I enjoyed it, I can't say I disliked it. It was just one of those games that you go through and forget about them after a good night sleep.Oh yes, the game  has 13 achievements and you will get them all as you play the game. 12 are for completing levels and 1 for using a disguise 15 times. The disguise one is as simple as using a single item 15 times on the very first level. They are that easy.Overall, the game is not worth its current price ($12/€12). I got it as a part of some bundle that had 10 games for $3 and that is probably fine. Probably.			"

												I would recommend this game but not at full price... I got it in a bundle so I probably paid 40-50p for it. I probably wouldn't pay anymore than £1 for it... mainly because I spent about 35 minutes on it and completed it. There are about 12 levels on it and they are fairly short levels, probably complete them in around 2 minutes. They aren't that challenging however it could probably be a little more challenging, if you were to stealth it all the way.However, the game doesn't really reward you for any of that, you may get a few extra points but they are essentially pointless as it offers no extra reward and gives you no incentive. Also because of this lack of extra reward or incentive, replayability is not really a thing...Also, there could've been much nicer stealth with the added mechanics such as disguise and hide body. Hide body allows you to hide your assasinated corpse into a cupboard so the guards don't spot it and alert the police. It seems that backup is called as soon as you kill someone, so it doesn't seem that helpful as whenever I had a body spotted, I didn't notice any extra guards/police spawn.Disguise also seems to be useless, the only useful thing is to get the achievement and to change your colour. Apart from that, security cameras still spot you and so do guards so to say it disguises you is something of a dirty lie... A dirty, dirty lie!The game is nice and simple though, basic graphics and simple gameplay. It was fun for that half an hour but I doubt I'll be replaying any time soon... Maybe leave it on to get the rest of the steam trading cards (the only incentive I can see for playing it longer than half an hour). I would only urge you to buy it if you like the game and it's not anymore expensive than £1.EDIT: I have just seen that they are incorporating level editor into it. This would definately change my review and most of the criticism I have for it and hope that it will be incorporated sooner rather than later!			"

												I got this game as it was remembering me Frozen Synapse/gunpoint, games I enjoyed a lot, with stealth elements.I was really looking into it. I read some reviews which let me down at first but I jumped in to check for myself.Pros:-Art: I do like the blueprintish 2D view from above.-Controls: Controls respond well.-FPS: The game is running well without any problem on my Nvidia 580.-Stealth: Stealth is efficient, you need to stay out of the vision of the guardc and cctv.This is rather easy most of the time (if you get a guard outfit the vision of all the enemy gets reduced by 2, it is then very easy to get out of sight of everybody)-Punishment: If you get caught, depending where you are of course but there is a high probability that the guards will find you and one shoot you. This is good as its avoid the raise alarm run all over the place and everybody gets reset asap. As the level aren't that big it is ok to die.-Level design: The level aren't very big, which is good when you die and have to restart at the beginning.Cons:-Art: It takes time and trial to understand some of the object (like windows took me 10 run to see the difference and why that guard was seeing me despite being inside a room).-Doors: As soon as you get too close from a door it opens automaticaly, it is annoying if you want to peek inside and see the most of the room.-Kills: All the time, the only option is killing the guard and ""innocent people"" ? Despite the description of the game saying ""Stash unconscious guards in cupboards"", if I kill them, they will be dead and not unconscious.-Story: The story will be forgot as soon as you close the game, even the mission objectives lack excitment sometimes and it's a little all over the place.-Hacking: The prologue was not clear on one point. When you hack a terminal, you can access the item unlocked at anytime and you don't have to stay near the terminal you hacked.I quite enjoyed the game but it lacks on several points.Specialy when it comes to time. It took me an hour and a half to go through all the game, I have seen reviews which indicate they closed the game in under an hour)The story isn't memorable, I was reading it but just to be sure I wasn't missing anything. You won't play for the story (better for you to play gunpoint if you want something similar with a bit more of story and being able to choose your path in it).I do like to compare game to movie when it comes to price as this is, for me, interactive entertainements.For about a bit more than an hour I would expect the price of the game to be similar to a movie theatre ticket (around 7/8euros in France), I got the game on sale for 6euros which suits me well.I do recommend the game despite being so short. It was fun to play it.This game is probably for people who love stealth game and want a game that can be finish in the evening.Luuna.			"

												If I were to sum up the game, I would say: ""It's short, but I like it. ...I like it, but it's *short*."" The minimalist approach to environments and characters lets you focus on the level mechanics without being distracted by extraneous details. It's always fun to stuff dead guards in a cabinet. And it's got a simple but effective story behind it. Gameplay is solid enough....BUT, on a value for time level it's way overpriced. This feels like one of those games where the developers give you a small number of example levels and then a level creator and let the community create content... but in this case there's no level editor, so the sparse existing content is all you get.At deep discount on sale, or as part of a bundle, though, it's definitely worth picking up.

												This game is probably the shortest game I have ever seen. It took me half an hour to complete it (100% game + 100% of achievements) but i skipped few flavour text here and there. Game is painfully easy if you are willing to kill guards (red squares). Even if you are going for no kill run this game will not provide any challange. Hacking and stealing? Ha you just click or hold on button. Click and forget. Stealh? Well i found myself way quicker than guards and most of the time there is soo much space to dodge them that I completly forgot about them.As it was mentioned in other ""reviews"" this seems like a demo or half finished game. I would not recommend this game for it's full price (12 euro!!!), however if you are into simple stealth game and grinding highscore is enough for you to keep playing I would see no harm in picking it up at 90% sale or as a part of some Humble Bundle.

												Light is a Indie, Strategy, Action Hacking game that is really short, and not really all that fun. Now, remember, this is my opion of this game.Light only has, like, 12 or so levels. and, most of them are easy. The game only takes like an hour and a half to beat, two hours at the most. The gameplay consists of you completing tasks, then getting to the end of the level. That's it. The game has a story line that, in my opion, makes no sense. Heck, I can't even remember what the game is even about, that's how non-sensical this games stroy line is. The 13 achievements that this game has to offer, you litteraly get for completing the levels. That's how bad this game is.Overall, this game isn't good. I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody, but if you like it, that's fine. i just think that this game is a waste of money and time.			"

												An hour (two if you're a manatee with a keyboard like me) of simple gameplay with brillian music. Spartan, yet tasteful visuals and clear mechanics make this little gem worth your while. The narrative is a bit brisk, and the ending is a tad lacking, but the cyberpunk Gheist is definitely there. Is it too short for your buck? Well, so is life in a future dystopia.			"
