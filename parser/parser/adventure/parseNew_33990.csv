												I cannot really recommend this game. Even thought I had whishlisted it for a long time and expected a lot.The beginning starts quite well. The base of the plot is well... not very original but one can feel it could get interesting.Also, the graphics isn't bad -- even though everything is 1024 capped with 4/3 aspect ratio, but I don't mind.But then you start to notice the very bad voice acting, the clumsy gameplay where you basically have to go back and forth in countless areas just to get an item that you couldn't pick earlier...Talk to this guy, go there, pick item, come back to the guy, new dialog is unlocked, etc.Alright that's like the basics of adventures games, but for this game this is really a waste of time.All of that is made to make the game longer. Really.The gameplay was so pointless that at the middle of the game I started to use a walkthrough just to PLAY the game instead of wandering aimlessly everywhere just to find a piece of paper or a piece of grass (yeah, true story) or whatnot. I just wanted the story to continue.Also, the closer you get towards the end of the game and the less detailed everythings gets.You cannot click on random stuff anymore and have your character comment on it, or having nice description of the surrounding. I believe even the music is gone too near the end. Even though it wasn't that great in the first chapters, it was still a little bit immersive.And, when the end of the game comes, we can saddly notice that everything has been rushed. The story falls appart and then comes dissapointement.However there are some dialogues and comments that are kinda funny.There is a little bit of humour in that game that will make you laugh for sure.But yeah... no I cannot recommend this game.

												""Wait... Really? That was it? WTF!"" That's pretty much the reaction you'll have at the end of the game. The story isn't very engaging and by the time you get any sort of meat to sink your teeth into, it ends. You get a few solid plot nuggets throughout the game which ultimately go unresolved leaving you unsatisfied and wondering what the point of it all was in the first place. Honestly, it feels as though they had unfinished 3 plot concepts squished them together and hoped for the best. Well, at least it was a challenge and fun to play right? Nope... It encapsulates one of the most reviled characteristics of the classic point and click adventure games. In order to progress through an obvious puzzle you first have to interact with something 10 screens away so that the option then becomes available. The constant backtracking, the inability to collect stuff without you'll obviously need before interacting with something unnecessary and the occasional pixel hunt make the game play nearly insufferable.The sad thing is, despite the game having a largely unfinished feel... Actually, I think it's safe to say it is unfinished. The art work is actually pretty good. Some of the sub plots are fairly dark and interesting, even though most of the story is just hinted at, and no real plot is there. This game could have really had potential but it is ultimately doomed by a clear disinterest in actually finishing it. "

												this is another example of the point and click adventure games' resurgence that has been happening lately.the best part of the game is undoubtedly its art style. backgrounds are nicely prerendered/drawn, locations do feel different, yet appropriate and both backgrounds and charactess have the same art style. animation of characters could be better at times but is definitely passable (or even surprisingly good for a budget game). 3d characters on prerendered/drawn backgrounds is a decidedly oldschool way of doing things and the developer has chosen to fully accept the limitations apparently without seriously considering mitigating these. it is not all bad as you might think, fixed resolution inherently means that the visuals do fit together incredibly well.a bit on the technical aspects - i want to say visuals are great in general but unfortunately these remain within the confines of the technical capabilities of the game (or the engine). resolution is limited to 1024x768 and aspect ratio setting only changes the ratio leaving resolution the same - the ar correction setting (that has been mostly misunderstood in forum conversations) is aimed at displays not able to preserve the aspect ratio by themselves. looking at the other settings - without antialiasing the characters are horribly aliased thanks to the low resolution but fortunately enabling it incurs only a very minor performance hit.story is about a near-future dystopia-ish society with a decidedly eastern- or middle-european take on the sci-fi genre. it is focused on the society and people with sci-fi technology remaining essentially just a backdrop. as customary for this, story does not wrap up too nicely and does not reveal all the details. story progression is slow and calm but not overly so.story follows richard, a man who in a world of  big corporations and oppressive state (more hinted than shown) gets fired from one of the all-powerful corporations of the future and whose future prospects with that go from bleak to worse. standard fare of resistance, conspiracies, family history etc. ensues.point and click works as well as expected from such a game today. there are not too many interactive objects and these can be hinted at to prevent pixelhunting. puzzles are very logical (but not always easy), the only annoyance is some degree of having to move over 4-5 screens and back for some puzzles. this is not critical though thanks to double-click acting like a quick-move (run to the object when double-clicking on one and practically immediately get to the next screen when clicked on screen transition).finishing the game took me around 5 hours. definitely recommended for an adventure game fan (who does not dislike sci-fi setting) - it contains several hours of very good fun.

												Alternativa is a sci-fi adventure that recreates a credible alternative future. Unfortunately many of its ideas are not properly developed and the final result is not as good as could have been.Remarkable adventure shows how the world could end after the next global war and its catching story lets you (most of time) forget about the obsolete visuals.

												I can only half-recommend this game. The story and the atmosphere are both good, although I have to agree with other reviewers that there are some elements that seem unfinished (pretty sure more was meant to happen with  the cat outside the apartment , for example). I liked the setting of a dystopian Prague, since I also know and like the city. The voice acting is decent. but as others have said,  the game's ending leaves many questions unanswered  and this is a slight disappointment. All in all, I'd recommend it for the atmosphere, decent graphics and decent voice acting. However, it's probably more something who really love adventure games and dystopian themes in particular.

												You just go back and forth back and forth. You see the item you have to take, it's obviously right there but you can't take it until you go to some arbitrary location and do one arbitrary thing then go back, only then, ONLY THEN, you are allowed to take the item. Everything must be done in order. It is absoulutely ridiculous. At some point I went into a building and tried to search the debris around and the game said nothing was there. Then I tried to open the locked door right NEXT TO the debris. You wanna know where the key is? Right in that ♥♥♥♥ing debris that I searched 2 seconds ago. But the game didn't give me the key because I didn't check the door first. ♥♥♥♥ you game.			"

												I was excited about this game. I thought the graphics were great. Dystopian society story, love it! Voice acting was annoying at times but not too terrible. The reason this game gets the thumbs down is the ending. The story is really interesting, the climax is exciting, and then the ending....just kills it. It feels as if the company ran out of budget and couldn't flesh out the story any more, because after you are really getting into the the story and uncovering lots of stuff, the ending basically tells you, ""well thats all we can do for now, we better disappear before the bad guys discover us."" Thats it. It screams sequel! Sadly, I don't think a sequel has been announced so this game is a gigantic cliffhanger. A promising beginning ends with disappointment.			"

												Dystopian point-and-click adventure game.Boring. Glitched out a couple of times.Ends abruptly and on a hugely unfulfilling cliffhanger note -- sequel never emerged, production derailed? You can see either the time or the budget allotted for the game ran out, because Alternativa gets increasingly 'barebones' through to the end of the game. Non-essential elements vanish, background music disappears, puzzles simplify. Feels decidedly unpolished and hurries you along.The game's story is straightforwardly linear and I have no idea what the game's Steam description means by ""composed of a number of shorter stories.""Can't recommend. Would want to read a postmortem from the developers to find out what the hell happened.			"

												Alternativa is fairly solid point-and-click adventure game set in a dystopian future.  I was a little disappointed initially when the game crashed after adjusting the graphic settings but fortunately the game relaunced with the settings correctly applied.  The game has a similar feel to other point-and-click adventures such as Still Life and the plot is intriguing enough to keep the player interested.  Unfortunately, while the Steam Overlay is supported the graphics themselves are limited to 1600x1200 resolutions, which although annoying, is typical of many adventure games in this genre.  I would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys a story driven game and creative puzzle solving, as it is definitely a compelling game.			"

												Unpolished, but not without potential to be good.  The voice acting is fairly atrocious most of the time and the localization from the original language to English is pretty horrendous.  I could probably write a thesis on the aspects of the game I dislike, but I don't want the concept of the story and what it could've been to be lost amongst that torrent of bile.  I don't see this as a finished product.  At best, it seems like a first rough draft of something that could be great if it went through another few steps of revision.  I'd give it a D- at best, because while it has the makings of a decent story, it quickly becomes too tedious to play and enjoy.  I finished the game more because I felt obligated to, than from any real desire.  I mean, I'd paid money for it...I needed to get my monies worth.  Spoiler:  I didn't.			"

												I doubted if I like this game or not. Story looks good to me, but seems to be incomplete. I like it anyway. Technically the game is very bad. You can't change screen resolution, only aspect ratio. Both 16:9 or 16:10 looks wrong anyway. Game glitched and crashed couple of times during playthrough. Also I can't delete old save files for some reason. I bought this one on sale, so i decided to recommend it. Otherwise think twice before purchase.			"

												Its a very mediocre game.  The voice acting is not atrociously bad, but its not great.The graphics are a bit dated, but the theme is done very well and its not a detraction from the game.I like the fact the game would kill me in certain situations, it made me jot down notes. Thats not something I normally do for adventure games, so it was very refreshing.There is sometimes a strict order in doing something, and sometimes you need to check or try something twice it seems. That has led me to wander around for a bit sometimes after trying the obvious....then finding out I did the correct thing....but I just needed to look at something first.  Which is a bit of a pain.The story is a bit meh, but the environment and cyberish punk theme kept me interested.  Towards the end the game kinda felt rushed, I was very disappointed.Its not worth 10 bucks, only grab this if you can get it on sale for 2 bucks or so.			"

												You can't imagine how glad I am, that I only paid 0,99 € for this.And even that is far too much.The whole game is based on stretching the time.Screen transition last from eight to 15 seconds and most tasks are solved by going back and forth from one end of a map to the other end of a DIFFERENT map.The few jokes in this game a very poor, which is kind of okay, if I look at the story behind it.The story itself is not bad, but sadly it stops abruptly with the whole game, before it can get really deep.A nice concept, a terrible execution.A waring:The games resolution is hard set at 1024x768. Though there are options to enable 16:9 or 16:10, the game stays in 4:3 and only the cutscene are in the richt format then.To activate 16:9 or 10 most users seem to have to do additional changes in their graphics driver software directly.Else, there can be various display issues.I know, there are people who put time and effort into AlternativA, but 1 out of 10 points is the absolute maximum iI can givefor this poor excuse of a game, sorry.

												Painfully unfinished, Alternativa may be the worst point and clink game Ive played in years. Firstly, the game crashes a lot. This can be remedied by running in as an admin, but the game will still however crash sometimes during cutscenes (which it did  during the bloody ending credts). Some puzzles are nonsensical (the very first for example) and  a lot of the time lacks any clear hints about what you need to do. This could be down to a poor translation, but some of the solutions are just down to bad game design. Does the story make up for this? No....Not even a little.Theres an interesting Distopian setting presented here, but its wasted on a plot that travels so fast, that the story itself isnt even fleshed out. There was a twist at one point, that Im guessing was supposed to be dramatic, but as a player you werent given enough background to actually care. As other reviewers have mentioned, the game end on an abrupt note, and feels very unfinished. If the plot was good, I would complain, but I was just happy it was over.Graphics and voice acting can always be forgiven, bad puzzles and narrative however, cannot.Avoid, and go play a game published by Wadget Eye instead			"

												Disclaimer: we did not finish.It's painful to see a world that's so intriguing wasted on a game like this. Name an Adventure Game Sin, this one has it: pixel hunting? Check. Gratuitous backtracking? Check. Blocking advancement until you've clicked just the right item? Check.Interactable objects are blended into the background, enforcing pixel hunting to even find them. Necessary objects are usually on the other side of a multiple screen map and often you won't even be able to pick them up until you've established that you need them. Sometimes you won't even be ABLE to interact with an item until the game says you can.The last straw came when we were essentially punished for being smarter than the main character and making a logical leap before the game said we could. After that, the game crashed. We took it as the game committing seppuku out of shame and moved on to better pastures.			"

Hard to recommend this game to anyone. It looks (and feels) unfinished and unpolished. Even if it was properly finished, it would probably still be average at most.

												Alternativa is a point-click puzzle adventure with a dark story tone and creative artstyle that sets gloomy mood . Be warned that this game feels unfinished and there are major consistency issues with quality of puzzles and story pace . Also there are glitches that can potentially force you to start over if you not doing objectives in a certain order .It could have been a great game but it just feels like they did not have the funds to do it right . I enjoyed it but you have to play it with very forgiving attitude . I am sure people were angry buying this game for $20 but if you get it under $4 its not that bad .The best part of this game is definitely visual design which is why I bought this game despite low user scrore . I like the fixed backgrounds which reminds me old Resident Evil games .For what it is the game does look above average considering that most point click games are limited to 2D and have no trailers . Unfortunatly the voice acting (translation) of main character is out of place and ruins the tension in atmosphere which hurts this game more than anything else .Its hard to appreciate dark tone of the game when main character's voice lacks emotional range . Although some of the other characters are voiced much better and I have enjoyed few moments .I have to say that overall interface and controls are pretty decent .  You may run into few instances where action detection is a bit off but for the most I have no problem with the way game plays . Puzzles are resonably enjoyable . There were a few really stupid solutions that didn't make sense but there are some creative choices as well that made me feel rewarded . However because game feels somewhat rushed I think it makes it harder to appreciate the story .Game also features dead ends where you can die by picking wrong text answers and if you want make it harder you can play on harder mode that limits your tries . Sometimes you may want to pick wrong answer just to see what happens ;)Overall I think game is decent (just not $10+ decent) . Most people will probably hate it but if you open minded gamer you might notice some inretesting and creative ideas .Score : 6/10 .

												This is a rather annoying game.  I got stuck rather early on and was unable to get past a certain point.  Now that I'm writing this, I just thought of a way to get past that point but I've already deleted the game.  Another annoyance is the sheer running back and forth across screens just to complete a puzzle.  I can understand that is the nature of adventure games sometimes, but this was just really annoying.Another annoyance is the fact the game is stuck at 1024x768 resolution and it doesn't allow you to change it.  Regardless, I honestly wouldn't recommend this game at all.			"

												I kind of regret having to say I can't qutie recommend AlternativA. Playing it I often had the feeling that the game could have been much more than what it eventually became.Technically, it isn't perfectly top notch, but solid. Character animations and voice acting are at times a little wooden, but that isn't a huge problem; the animations are about on par for an adventure, the English dubbed voice action leaves a bit to be desired, which is a bit of a missed chance.Artistically there is a huge plus in terms of the scenes. Even with very few characters the scenes come to life with detail. From derelict slums to high class modern facilities the artwork is convincing and draws one in. Unfortunately the writing of the story itself isn't on the same level, in my opinion: the story leaves very little room to actually explore the interesting world of AlternativA, the plot points sometimes feel a little bit forced (if not to say in some cases: random). Slight spoiler:  Also the ending leaves a lot of open questions and unresolved issues Gameplay-wise AlternativA unfortunately drops the ball. Some puzzles are logical and straight-forward, some a little tricky. Annoyingly, though, they quite often involve a lot of pixel-hunting. More than once I have been thinking of solutions to problems, which eventually came down to 'pick up the exact object you are looking for that happens to be lying on the floor with no satisfactory explanation'. Another gameplay problem is how one is often forced to traverse back and forth between the scenes. The scenes may be beautiful, but crossing through six screens just for a single line of dialogue before you go back six screens is just a nuisance.In conclusion AlternativA is not remarkable game set in a remarkable and original world. I can't recommend it due to its flaws, but it is worth looking at nonetheless.			"

												The game has really bad dialog, too much pixel-hunting and random counter-intuitive puzzles.  In other words, it's a typical example of the poorly done point-and-click games of the modern era.  It's really too bad, because the premise and setting are interesting, and the pre-rendered graphics are actually very nice, but ultimately the story is boring and the game not worth playing.			"

												The scenery and backgrounds are the only redeeming quality of this game.The voice acting is awkward at best, with audio editting that is subpar. During some points of the dialog, you can literally hear the actors beginnning to smack their lips in order to start the sentence. Similarily, the plot is virtually non-existent, and you spend the entire game searching for one specific piece of plot. There is no character development whatsoever, with all of the characters being static. Finally, the actual gameplay elements of this point-and-click ""adventure"" game are lacking. Specifically, there are specific actions that you cannot perform unless you examine a particular object before hand, causing you to backtrack in a very linear manner. Not to mention that the graphics look like they are from 2002 because of the limitations from the engine the game uses.The bottom line: view some of the screenshots people have posted in order to get a feel for the aesthetics, but don't buy the game.

												I'd give this game something like 55/100.Sorry to say this but this game feels very unfinished and it seems like the developers did not bother and released the product as if time was pressing on or something... Very often you get the feeling that there's some information missing. As if there was something more but it was cut out before the game got released. Also a lot of things do not make any sense at all.Some puzzles are solved within seconds/minutes, but you just don't get the point and finish it all the same. And then you wander, who the hell did design a puzzle that you solve by pure coincidence before you even begin to grasp the mechanism...Also it suffers from bad game design a lot. Like you cannot do a completely obvious thing before you do some other completely unrelated thing (like talking to somebody on a completely unrelated subject).The reason why I selected ""thumb up"" after all is the atmosphere of the game. That is the only thing that works as intended I guess...			"

												This was an interesting little game that suffered from rushed development.  The good:- I was intrigued by the story, the world, and the characters.  - I personally liked the art style and the locations, and was happy to see a game set in a non-standard city.- I enjoyed the music and the atmospheric touches.  - I appreciated the bits of humor that were thrown in to offset the tragic elements (like the brilliant Sam & Max reference).  - I liked that at one point you could choose to play as either Andy or Andrea.- I found the mouse interface and inventory to be easy to use.- You are able to double-click to speed up your character's movements.The bad:- You need to be overly fastidious in your exploration and clicking.  Often, you will not be able to interact with an item until you look at it first, or until you examine something else nearby, or until your character decides they now have a story-based reason to pick it up.  It makes sense from a realism perspective - normal people don't carry around extra junk just because it may come in handy later - but from a gameplay perspective it makes for a lot of pointless backtracking and frustration.  I almost couldn't get past the start of the game because I missed examining the right barrel.  If you are careful and attentive, though, you shouldn't have too much trouble.- One or two of the puzzle solutions make no sense, even in hindsight.  Just try everything in your inventory, and eventually something will work.- A few times during the game, your character does not have quite enough information to complete the task at hand, and you will need to resort to wasting time with trial and error until you get it right.  - At one point during a dream sequence, my game glitched and the screen went black for several minutes.  After trying a few things, I found that pressing ESC allowed me to jump past the glitch and continue on.- The subtitles are sometimes drastically different from what is being spoken by the characters.  Also, can we talk about the terrible Spanish?The ugly:- The ending feels rushed, contrived, and vacuous compared to the rest of the game.  You could tell there was so much more they wanted to do with the story, but they simply didn't have time to implement it.  The game really needed another chapter, or a sequel, to finish what they started.This game had a lot of potential, and I think it's a shame that they didn't take the time to playtest it a bit more, to fully develop the story's conclusion, and to have an editor give it a final once-over.  Honestly, with a bit more TLC, most of the problems could have easily been resolved, and I would have given it high marks across the board.  As is, I would have to give it an overall rating of 6.5/10.			"

												This is a bit of a mixed review.  The game is one that I got enjoyment out of sure enough, and the setting is okay.  A typically dystopian dark future in your typical Blade Runner/Cyberpunk type of world where everybody but an elite few seem to be up to their ears in crap, or are constantly living in fear.I played this game through to the end, and without revealing anything, the ending is unsatisfyling.  Also, some of the characterisation in the game seems a bit odd.  There's a female cop who seems semi sympathetic to your situation who I thought would end up playing a larger part.Graphics are competent, if not spectacular, sound is ok as is voice acting.  All in all I've played worse, but the main thing that bugs me is the amount of walking from place to place to do tasks.  It sounds like a mild complaint but it gets irritating when it constantly happens.Warning, unlike a lot of modern games you CAN die in this, though you're ressurected at a checkpoint of sorts.  It's just something that doesn't happen a lot nowadays.Would I recommend this?  It depends.  If you're fairly new to point and clicks, try to get something else like Longest Journey, Broken Sword, Runaway, or whatever.  If you've played most of these to death, pick it up, but I'd wait till it's reduced.  It's not worth the full price in my opinion but your mileage may vary.			"

												This is a boring adventure game where actions needed to progress through the dull story don't really make sense.Even though it is a nice attempt at creating a game around a dystopic universe reminiscent of Eastern Europe and the Iron Curtain era, I can't help but notice the slowness of the game and what a drag it is to preform the next action to make the story go on when half of the time it makes you go all the way back to the other side of the map just so you can listen to a few lines of dialogues (whose quality varies inconsistently)Another thing: not all adventure games need voice acting. This one would have been okay without it (if you don't mind making poorer something already quite poor) as the quality of voice acting is a disservice to the overall quality.I tried to finish it but gave up due to lack of interest, I couldn't even bring myself to watching a walkthrough to rocket through the game or even to know how it ends.Sorry but that's a 30/100 here			"

The puzzles are either too easy, or make no sense. At other times, much pixel hunting is involved. Without spoiling the ""end"", AlternativA's end cuts the plot in several too short scenes that doesn't really give an appropriate (or sensible) ending.

												My review is based on completing the game on a fairly high spec rig with a 29"" widescreen monitor.As a fan of this genre I'm sad to say this particular game is unremarkable and quickly forgettable.  It has soooo many bugs and flaws.  The game crashed a number of times.  On one occasion the character walked off into the distance and vanished into the backdrop!Anyway, here's a breakdown:Story.The tone of the story is quite dark and depressing as is much of the post apocalyptic setting.  The plot is heavy and a challenge to keep up with with precious few lighter moments.VisualsOverall not bad.  Locations nice and detailed.  Character animation isn't great and makes you wince when they move in an unnatural way.Generally, the game accurately filled the widescreen resolution.  However, despite playing with the inbuilt game settings the start menu didn't and I couldn't be sure if this was just by design.The cut sequences were glitchy.  A few times, the horizontal black bars that indicate you're leaving gameplay and entering a cut sequence actually got in the way of the video and also didn't fill the screen correctly.Gameplay.Items to interact with are kept limited to avoid pixel hunting which is appreciated.  However, the flow of the game is hindered by non linear decision making.  For example, if you know what the next move is and you attempt to do it the game will stop you until you've read your PDA entry that acknowdeges you REALLY REALLY know what the next move is........ very frustrating at first until you know that's how the game works.  On the flip side, at the end of the game you're given the challenge of choosing a search word in a database without the aid of your PDA which contains all your notes and personal database............... come on!  If like me you've played the game over several sessions, a memory aid would be appreciated.Voice acting.Mediocre....... but I've heard worse.  When, oh when, will developers realise that a game can stand or fall on the strength of its voice actors being in the same sound recording studio at the same time reading the same script together, reacting to each other's tone, body language, etc.  Otherwise, all you get is very disjointed monologuing (is that even a word??), as per this game.I'm sorry to put such a downer on this one.  I do try hard to reflect the positives but unfortunately there just isn't enough to get excited about here.			"

												There are a lot of good things about this game: the story, the atmosphere and many of the puzzles. Ultimately I can't recommend it. It is too frustrating walking slowly across one screen after another and too many of the puzzles are flawed, such as the following example. You work out that you need a certain piece of information to complete a quest. You go to the right place, see the thing you need to see, then go back to complete the quest, but it doesn't recognize that you know the thing you need to know.  Aha, you have to attempt the quest first without knowing it so that you fail. Then you hear the character say, ""I need to find out X"". Then when he goes to get the information he will say ""Now, I know X"". Then you can complete the quest. All this extra walking waste an awful lot of precious life. There are too many flaws like this to make it enjoyable. Otherwise it's not a bad game. I hope the devs will do something else and do it better.			"

												The game has a lot going for it.  Plenty of good voice acting, tons of excellent art, an interesting story, an immerssive world and characters you can relate to.  And I'd recommend this game to anyone who's willing to spend some time with a walkthrough, as the puzzles aren't very clear, and the solutions to them are often ridiculous - and this is coming from a fairly experience point-and-click gamer.So if you want an insane challenge with a great futuristic world, I'd grab this one :)!

												Tags : Adventure - P&C - Point and ClickTLDR : Robots are a thing, corporations bad, government bad, resistance good - errand this, errand that - empty world even at corp offices for no reason whatsoever, uncover ""secret"" behind ""plot"" - game`s brain overheats on having what could look like a vague idea of a story arc and gives you the ending credit rather than have to deal with it.A generic future dystopian world, inhabited by a half dozen characters and a bunch of robots, pretend to represent larger factions at each other`s throat. Stiff animations, sub-par voice acting, lack of plot cohesion, disjointed scenes and dialogue lines, all remove all credibility this game has­. It feels like a front, a facade, with absolutely nothing behind­. Game is impossible to beat without a walkthrough with puzzles involving entering login and passwords that are so obscure you would be hard pressed to figure them out. Even if you did, it would not be worth the time or effort. The pre-rendered 2.5D backgrounds are nice, but its as if after making those and having a very loose concept plot they ran out of funds or willpower and just tacked on a loosely defined ""game"" on them and started charging for it. I would say to give this one a pass. The game leads you from errand to errand, but fails to have anything interesting to say about the world and what is going on, if you soldier on and beat this game you will see how hollow and empty it all was as you see the atrocious ending that leaves you guessing if the developpers werent taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥ I will not hide this from the library but I am certainly not keeping the files pre-downloaded, and I would advise most of you to avoid this title.
