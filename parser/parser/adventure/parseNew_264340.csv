												Let's skip past the howdy-doos and the pretentious intros. I really like this game. It's unapogetically generic, addictive, and smartly-designed. Major Mayhem is a game that truly feels like it was focus-tested for maximum enjoyment. When it comes to games, you'll sometimes read descriptions like ""It's not for everyone"". This game, is for everyone. Whether you're the type that likes to unlock stuff and get cash, somebody who just wants to shoot and/or blow stuff up, or even a person who shoots for the high-scores, Major Mayhem is the game for you.Ehh...I feel dirty all of a sudden. These days Android/IOS can be regarded as a legitimate gaming platform, but I'm an old codger and can't grasp/don't like cell-phone games. So to recommend something as shameless as Major Mayhem, it really makes me pause, reflect upon my past, wander aimlessly through a desert, that sort of thing. So I'm going to break down what I like about this game.-Mission objectives are smartly-designed. There's always an incentive to change weapons, replay stages, and collect cash. This game knows exactly which elements of your brain to massage, so you're compelled to keep playing.-Different weapons have different scoring strategies. With a shotgun you'll want to aim for enemies that crowd together. Sniper rifles can pierce objects, and there are bonus points for killing enemies behind cover. If you want to unlock everything you're going to try each weapon, thus you'll devise your own personal best scoring weapon.-Enemy corpses can be shot for bonus points.-Mechanics are extremely solid. When it comes to gun games, there's nothing more frustrating than poor mechanics. When I aim at an enemy's forehead, I don't want the bullet to fly into their arm, and I want appropriate feedback. While the enemies in this game resemble toys more than human beings, they still react properly to every shot. The sound-direction and visual feedback is on-point as well. Altogether it's pretty satisfying.-Nice amount of depth to the scoring system. High scores aren't achieved just by shooting everyone. Everything from maintaining a combo, to using an item at the right moment, to getting those trick shot bonuses, are essential tactics. When a company name-drops Metal Slug and Time Crisis I get this ""Whoa...really?"" look on my face. I expect their game to deliver something of comparable quality. While I won't say Major Mayhem hits those highs, it gets so much right that I gotta give respect.Well worth my time and possibly yours. "

												Quick first impression: This game is a side-scrolling shooter but you don't even really need more than two buttons and a mouse (or a two button mouse) to play it.  You have a fire button, a jump button and you need to aim.  So the store page claims it's inspired by Time Crisis, but the only thing you have in common with Time Crisis is that when you shoot you are able to be hit, and when you stop shooting you duck behind some cover.  If this was a light gun game (if you could play light gun games on an LCD monitor) this would really come close to feeling like Time Crisis though.The graphics are decent but nothing special really.  Somehow the enemies all look like they came out of South Park with the way they move.  I tried bumping this up to 4K on my TV and the game lags BAD at 4K resolutions...actually, it lags bad with anything over 1080P resolution.  I have a GTX 1080 8GB graphics card and this game still lags at 1440p or higher. The game has tons of achievements, but most of them are milestone style (e.g. ""kill 500 enemies"", ""Play for 2 hours"").  There's also a bunch of little in-game objectives that are on the same level as these achievements... ""Jump 5 times"" was one.  Doing one of these objectives gets you closer to your next rank up, and by ranking up you get access to more weapons and levels and stuff.You get extra points for killing enemies in a streak, killing them quickly, doing an ""overkill"" (I guess that means doing more damage than necessary to kill them), shooting a hat off of an enemy, headshot streaks, deflecting an enemy projectile with your bullet, etc.  All of this translates into some in-game coins and a better score.  The coins are used to buy some powerups and continues.  For example, when the game is over, it offers you a chance to continue for 500 coins. You could also buy a powerup that makes you temporarily invincible (if you unlocked it), and some other nifty things.Oh and for extra bonus points, there are friendly hostages to rescue (by simply not shooting them while killing all the enemies on screen) and this can either give you some armor back if you lost it, or gives you a coin bonus.  BTW: these coins stick with you between games so you don't have to worry about using them or losing them.Anyway, it's decently fun but somehow it still seems like it's lacking something.  Things I liked:  It has a distinct light-gun type game feel (but unfortunately no light gun)  The controls are simple  The graphics are simple and yet pleasing enough to look at  There are other game modes if you get bored with the mission levels  There's potential for trick/skill shots for extra pointsThings I didn't care too much for:  The graphics, while simple, seemed to take up an awful lot of GPU power. If I could have easily run this at even 1440p without slowdown, I'd have liked it more.  The game doesn't seem to have a whole lot of charm or personality about it.  The main character is kind of a generic cartoon style army dude...it seems like they wanted it to be charismatic.  The enemies are also kind of bland.  Ninjas, Red Ninjas, FBI/CIA operatives, Generic Desert enemies (in desert style garb but not necessarily Arabs).  None of those things (other than the complaint about the game feeling laggy at 1440p and up) is too serious.  It just kinda holds the game back from feeling like a really great game.  I had originally bought this back in 2014 and I JUST got around to playing it tonight.  I'll Definitely go back and play it some more, but it's not gonna be a favorite. Just a little time waster.  Still it's worth playing.			"

												This is the game Rambo The Video Game should've been. A game with lovely graphics and solid and plenty of gameplay.Yes, it may be a port from the mobile phones but it definitely fits our system. You'll be able to shoot enemies with precision and that's what matters most in a game like this. The one thing that didn't impress me is the fact that you earn coins rather slowly. So you'll be replaying levels over and over just to be able to buy those new outfits and weapons. If you play on a platform where you have this sort of precision you want to keep players occupied as much as you can. Replaying levels is fun but not if it takes tens of times to earn the amount of coins you need. Thankfully, there are challenges that help speed things up but after about 50 challenges (of the 150) you start noticing that this also needs a lot of replaying already finished levels.In the end it's still twenty times better than Rambo, and even if that's not a fair comparison you still need to play this.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Best rail shooter for PC yet.This review is based mostly on my play time with the Shiny Loot (DRM-free + Steam key) version. So, my Steam stats don't reflect my actual play time with Major Mayhem.PROS:+ FUN!+ Easy to pick up, difficult to master.+ Tons of unlockables.+ Cheap at only $5 (USD). FREE for iOS, Android, Windows phones, and Kindle Fire.+ LOW hardware requirements.+ Cross-platform; Windows/Mac/Linux compatible.+ Fun graphics are easy on the eyes and not intimidating to casual players.CONS:- No online multiplayer, yet.- ""Hardcore"" gamers may be put off by Major Mayhem's 'accessibility'.

												Don't buy this game. If you get it in a bundle with actual games fine, but it's just a generic mobile game. They didn't even update the hints and icons, so it's still a finger and says tap or drag. Even without those issues the gameplay is tedious and repetitive.			"

												Terrible achievements.If your game is just worth playing a couple of hours , it's pointless to expend it to 40 hours by adding some boring achievements.Defeat 2000 enemies with each weapons and Defeat 50000 in total makes the experience even worse.Achievement is part of game and it's unnecessary to make it painful and boring to complete.

												One of the most fun mobile games besides Angry Birds. A shooter on the rails type of game. Good to play in short bursts with tons of objectives, and achievements to complete. You play as a Rambo type character who takes it to the bad guys in order to rescue your girlfriend. So many Weapons, Clothes, and supplies to outfit Major Mayhem with to aid you in your quest. Many different modes and level to play.			"

												Major Mayhem offers an Operation Wolf / Time Crisis hybrid cover-based, side scrolling shooting game. The president has kidnapped your ""hot"" girlfriend and you must fight through hordes of ninjas, terrorists, and zombies to get her back. There are a few gun unlocks and abilities to use along the way. It feels pretty boring at first, but once you get some of the better gun unlocks, you can really start causing some Major Mayhem.			"

												I wasn't expecting Major Mayhem to be anything good, since from all I know, it was a shooter designed for mobile devices with touch screen. Turns out I was wrong, Major Mayhem handles pretty great with your mouse, which you use to aim, shoot and activate several powerups.Overall Major Mayhem presents you with a pretty simple, if not poor, storyline and some really neat looking graphics. The game is pretty much a simple aim and shoot game and you ocasionally take cover. By killing enemies and getting higher combos you get more points and more coins, which you can then spend on clothes and unlock weapons. The soundtrack was actually pretty  great to listen to while playing. The enemy variety is rather lacking and the same goes for bosses.In the end Major Mayhem will end up being enough for some people and not enough for others, it certainly is nothing to be amazed by but it can provide you a few hours of fun with the various modes it has (Campaign, Arcade, Time Bomb and Survival).

												Casual doesn't even begin to describe this literal smartphone game, but it does have that quality that we both hate and love smartphone games for: Brainless gameplay. The Major's adventures won't be putting your brain or even your reflexes to much of a test, but sometimes that's the only sort of game you have the time or energy for. For those occasions, Major Mayhem fits in quite nicely. And with lots of game modes and tons of stuff to collect, it has the potential to fill that niche for quite some time.			"

On PC the gameplay just seems dull, extremely repetitive, and terribly slow.  It's not a bad game, it just doesn't seem like this was meant for PC at all.			"

												I was going to recommend this in a heartbeat. I really was. It's a very simple game, quite entertaining and the ability to allow me to play with one hand and eat an ice-cream at the same time is always great!BUT!The game screwed up in last chapter (3 in total). It was unfair, buggy and the difficulty scaling was way off!For those who don't know, this is a ""Third-Person-ish"" rail-shooter that was definately ported from mobile devices (it even has the damn facebook and twitter page links. The buttons and overall UI layout also looks VERY mobile device influenced which means, of course... ""obvious mobile port"").Anyways, so... first chapter! The woods, full rambo style fun while shooting ninjas (yes, ninjas...). It's quite fun and responsive. Animations are fluid and nothing feels cheap. No difficulty spikes. Pretty much perfect.Then, metropolis! In the city, you fight Mr. Smith and it's clones alongisde the riot-shielders from Call of Duty. Nothing bad at all. Everything feels fair and square. No difficulty spikes, no problems. Game's responsive as usual.Final chapter: Arab Desert. You will fight waves and more waves of... (yeah you guessed it) AND ALSO! Mummies! ""Huh?"" Yep... and guess what? It's not ♥♥♥♥ing fair! After reaching the last chapter I got the bazooka! And it takes over 6 mother♥♥♥♥ing shots to kill a single mummy! ""Well, doesn't sound too bad...""Wait... it doesn't? Oh right I forgot! They throw 2-3 at the same ♥♥♥♥ing time! And also a couple of dudes in the background throwing shurikens, swords or plain shooting their guns at me! Did I forget to mention that the mummies can shoot green lasers out of their ♥♥♥♥ing eyes?! Yeah...But I survived ""most of it"". I died a lot! The use of super powers (which you need to go back to the menu to buy with coins that you earn VERY slowly) is imperative beyond belief!And after restarting some♥♥♥♥♥♥poorly designed sections what happens? Rub some salt on the wound because ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;! The game starts bugging out! Enemies don't appear at all, so you wait.And wait...And wait...And you restart. And they appear. And out of nowhere you just die...I hope this is exclusively my issue. And if it is... fine. But I can't let it slide on my behalf for obvious reasons.So the campaign was out of the window! Are there more modes?Yep. 3 to be exact. All repeat the same thing but with minor changes. Time attack, survival, blah blah blah.All play exactly the same. In the same levels. Level with the same layout as the campaign. Same scripted sections as well! No variation. The game becomes boring rather fast even though the achievements and the in-game level-up system DEMAND lots of time and effort to get maximum rank and 100% the achievements.It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It really is.At least you get cards :PAnyways, I won't deny the fact that, while playing the first 2 chapters, I had lots of fun, even though it started to wear off on me after a while due to it's repetitiveness in both gameplay, enemy variety, levels and level layout.The game's 4,99€ as well so... not much is being asked. Sadly... for 4,99€ there's SO much better stuff to buy that this is just one of those games to buy when you have absolutely nothing to do or are in a break from studying or working. A 30 min session and after that you're probably dying of boredom.After the issues I encountered I can say Major Mayhem doesn't deserve a blind recommendation from me, not at all. Only thanks to it's good 2 first chapters should you consider purchasing this. The 3rd is just a great mix of bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, difficulty spikes and frustration.5/10 If only steam has a yellow ""Meh"" option instead of the ""yes/no"". Get it on a sale if you really want it, and even then, you have better stuff to buy under 3€...			"

												What is a.... Major Mayhem?It's a rail-shooter, where you play a Major Mayhem (he is more like a Rambo) . Remember House of the Dead series? You don't have much of the control of the game apart from aiming , shooting and jumping in specific moments.#####iOS PORT#####This is an iOS port, this means game was DESIGNED for smartphones.As you know, porting games is poor due to Developers choice, you can see a good example of it: Deus Ex  The Fall.This game is far from it but still, as much as I like cartoony graphic... I wish I could simply disable tutorials and achievements.I never played this game on my smartphone, because I use my smartphone for other stuff.#####Gameplay#####Game gets quickly boring due to repetitive-similar looking levels. After 30 minutes, you'll realize that this game is just boring (at least I do, I'm a big boy).After 5 levels you'll realize how slow the progression is, you'll need to grind a lot to get a good stuff (iOS offered in-app purchases, blame that)You can quickly unlock other modes or other locations by spending Gold Coins (you earn them by doing Objectives). That's soooooo boring.#####Music#####Throw the music away and play your own. Not good.#####CONS#####I'm not a fan of smartphone games. I've got a chance to play few and I disliked them by these few simple reasons:1. Forced Tutorial2. Tons of crappy objectives/achievements (Jump 5 times / Kill 1 opponent / Grab Armor...etc)3. Lack of options to disable ""Features""4. Grinding and grinding.5. Game is GLITCHY6. Not optimized to PC players (ex: escape does not resume your game)Not worth to buy UNLESS you have Kids who don't have anything to play.Not worth full price.			"

												Major Mayhem is a rail shooter with a story and a lot of customization options but is it a rail shooter you will want to play ? In Major Mayhem you play as the major. Hes assing to kill some terrorist that kidnapped his girlfriend and thats all there is to the story. But how is this game ? Its actually quite fun. All you do in this game is go to cover from cover and fight bad guys there are the some boss fights that are really fun. The game acts on a three hit system. Three hits and youre dead. Its also a very easy and short game. It has a lot of bonus objectives that you need to complete to get new guns and more money for power ups and outfits for youre charecter. Like every game it also has its problems. The hit detection isnt always the best sometimes when you shoot somebody it doesnt really hit them and sometimes enemies can shoot you through walls which is annoying. The scoring system works when it wants to. Overall a really good game and a fun little title to pick. Its cheap fun i give Major Mayhem an 8/10			"

												Major Mayhem is a simple but nonetheless entertaining casual shooter.  The intricate pretext: The world is in total mayhem and they got your girl. This sidesrolling railshooter combines simplistic gameplay with some weapon progression and tongue in cheek character customization. Lots of references and recognizable outfits, a fun setting and a clean style.Obivously this was made for mobile devices so it has some of those made for touchscreen elements like the huge onscreen pause button. When advancing in level your character can spin the reward wheel and unlocks gear and stuff in the armory. Some of these have certain level requirements so it keeps you going til u get that new shotgun or whatever.Absolute no brainer, cute style and low price... count me in!			"

												The gameplay in Major Mayhem involves your character running to cover and then you use the mouse to shoot enemies with a variety of weapons when they pop up. It's a simple premise, but a great game to play when you've got a few minutes here and there. It's a mobile port, but unlike many ports I've played the interface and controls work great.The game is a little short, but still long enough to be worth the $5 it costs, and it has a few other game modes and a ton of achievements (that involve a lot of grinding) to keep you coming back.Finally, I noticed a couple of typos while playing last night and sent a message to the Major Mayhem Facebook page. I received a response before I woke up this morning saying they'll be fixing those in the next update. Great customer service!I managed to get a copy of the game in a bundle for less than the $5 asked here, but I enjoyed it enough that I bought an extra copy at full price to give away to a friend. You should probably check this game out!			"

												This indie arcade third person shooter is a blast to play.The game has over 5,000,000+ downloads on the Google Play Store and having a rating of 4.8 and with that many downloads tells you this game is worth a serious look...I have it on Android for my phone and tablet, it's one of my favorites, so buying it to play on my PC and laptop was an easy decision to make.If you have an Android phone or tablet try this game out on the Google Play Store and see it for yourself (it's free), then imagine using a mouse to target all the bad guys. Your mouse is the Aim, button 1 is shoot, button 2 is jump and #1 thru #4 are the extra weapons. You can also change the control configuration to what you like. The resolution is adjustable to your monitors resolution, it will full screen or window mode too.With my experience with this game on Android, using a mouse for the aim made the game a whole lot more enjoyable on the PC and less frustrating in heavy combat fighting.It's on sell right now for $1 off 20% - $3.99, but the regular price of $4.99 is a bargin for the amount of replay value this little game offers. There's 100 achievements to obtain in the game with 45 levels, so you're not going to play it just once.You earn coins in the game by killing enemies and completing tasks, you use the coins to buy Supplies, missles, armour, slow time, super bullets and unlock levels. You can also buy various outfits for the Major to wear in the game. Different weapons (guns) are earned by ranking up through game play. So you're going to be playing this game quite a few times to earn enough coins to be able to purchase all the items in the game.It's a great time killer when you don't have the time to get involved in regular size games, jump right in and play a few missions till it's time to do what you're waiting to do. We all need a game to kill time with and this is one of the best I've ever played to kill time with. Although it is hard to stop playing once you've started because it is that good.Don't miss out on Major Mayhem it's a great little shooter with alot of replay value and it's a great bargin for what you get, 45 levels of nonstop third person shooter fun with 100 achievements...

												Classic shooting-gallery gameplay, bright and colourful graphics, and a good sense of humour make this an all-around riot to play.Gameplay is tight and accurate, and the environments feel fresh; each themed stage has its own personality, and unique elements.There are lots of unlockables and missions to keep you occupied, tons of in-game achievements, and leaderboards if you're a competitive type.Definitely check it out.

												The arcade-style rail shooting and art style look really appealing on the surface, but unfortunately it's very clear this game was designed with touch controls in mind. The port is minimal, acceptable, but minimal. Some things like shooting down incoming red shots just feel too difficult with a mouse, and I get the feeling if I was playing this on an iPad I'd be having a lot more fun. Don't buy it for full price, but on sale or in a bundle it may be worth your time if the concept appeals to you.			"

												This is one of those much-maligned mobile ports, but in this case I think PC gamers got the better deal.  This plays so well with a mouse that the thought of playing it with a touchscreen baffles me.  It does, however, suffer from some of the usual port problems and occasional bugs, though I am happy to forgive those here.  It also chooses not to explain what its various game modes are and how they work, for some reason.In terms of gameplay, this is enormous fun and surprisingly clever.  It just feels so satisfying to play; it's addictive and has plenty of levels to replay and achievements to unlock.  I really like the way that most enemy projectiles don't hurt, and those that do give you just enough warning for quick and clever dodges.  You can even deflect them if you're quick!  It all makes you feel like you're in a dumb action movie, in the best way possible.Thematically this falls square into the category of the traditional 'hur hur 'murica' joke, complete with cigar-chomping commando and 'ironic' racism.  I think that's a little tired now, and probably doesn't stand up to deeper scrutiny, but to be fair it does mix it up a bit in later levels.  I'd like the game better if it had a different theme, maybe, but it's hard not to love it anyway!			"

												Wax on... Wax off... Kill d Ninjas!!This is a fun arcade type game.  It's a point and click shooter.  Side scrolling with a bit of platforming.  I believe it originally was meant for tablets and phones but it's just as good on PC.  Arcade style shooter.  I would compare it a bit to duck hunter for the NES but of course duck hunter 30 years later with some pretty fun and addictive game play.In the game you kill the ninjas.  You start out with a pistol but as you rank up you can get get all sorts of armaments in the armorary.  You can also customize your Mayhem's character -- I bought the pink camo helmet just because I'm cool like that.The levels are fast which makes this game great if you just have a little bit of time and want to have some fun ... but be warned, it's one of those addictive, ""just one more..."" games.It's a simple enough concept executed amazingly.  I have no problems recommending this game.			"

												I think it's pretty casual fun. A whole pile of 30-60 second levels of mindless point and click rail-shooting is paced well and doesn't feel tired. A large number of weapon and costume unlocks give a use for the many tons of gold spewed gratuitously. This is a port of a free-to-play mobile game with all the purchases and restrictions stripped away. It feels and looks like you'd expect, and doesn't really change the formula in any sense.The game has its own unique art style and represents itself well, with bright colors and excessively large explosions at every opportune moment. Pink camo costumes and tiger fur helmets add nothing to the gameplay, but neither did gold paint in COD. I didn't feel like this really pushed any boundaries or did incredible new things, but it's a solid port of a casual mobile game following a very typical and casual formula, like pop music.

Posted: October 10, 2014
												   Major Mayhem is an arcade rail-shooter, with which I have very little experience (the only one I can sort of put in a similar bag is Rescue Shot on the PSX, actually).   Despite coming from mobile, it looked enjoyable, and so I decided to give it a go.    I'll say this right away: if a rail-shooter is exactly what you're looking to play, then it's probably safe to get this. If you're looking for interesting games or examples of great game design, look elsewhere. This is not to say that the game is bad, but it's very generic and ""by the book"". There isn't much in here to make it stand out (aside from being a rail-shooter, a rare genre today, it seems).   Here are my indepth thoughts, starting with  Presentation   As I said, it came right from mobile, and it's very noticeable. Big buttons on the menus, lack of options, missions, etc. etc. It was a free game with microtransactions, but, on Steam, you pay 5$, and then don't have them in the game. I'm not sure how much of a grind it was with MT, but progression is still pretty slow. But you can certainly get every useful item without the game feeling stale. Visually, it's simple, but it looks good, in my opinion. Doesn't do much to stand out either, but it's clean and colourful, with 3 different areas (each with 2 different enemy types -- the same 2, but reskinned). It does the job.   On the game's favor, it does a good job of telling you when you hit someone, for the most part, or when enemies shoot you. It only pales when you're using explosive, or high rate of fire weapons, since your bullet effects can obscure the screen a bit too much.   On the Audio side, it actually surprised me. The music is very bland, and gets repetitive, so I turned it off very early and just put something I wanted to listen to. The weapon sound effects, though, were great! Most of the weapons had a distinctive sound, and it really packed a punch when you shot the enemies' heads, or did some power shots.    So yeah, while it suffers on the music, the sound effects were very good, and a great indicator of your damage!   Now, how's the game Structured? Well, as I said, there are 3 areas. Each one has 15 levels, including a Boss Fight on the 15th. Unfortunately, the level design is almost inexistent. Most of the levels play out very similarly (well, just point and shoot). The fact that there are only 2 (common) enemies doesn't help at all... but more on that later.   There are campaign, arcade, timebomb, and survival modes.    -In Campaign, you just play the levels one by one, and are scored at the end (up to 3 medals). Probably the mode you should play first.   -In Arcade, you play the missions randomly and just play until you want to stop. If you lose all the 3 lives, you can just use/buy a continue and you'll keep going with the same score.   -In Survival, you have to try to play an area in one sitting, without dying. There are no continues. But other than that, just beat 15 levels at once.   -Finally, in TimeBomb, you're given 1 minute to just try to maximize your score (like a mini-level in a semi-random area).   The game has a decent number of weapons (and half of them play out very differently -- while the other half are mostly side-grades of previous ones). And each has their own use in different situations (especially when you're going for highscores). While they're distinct, they're mostly very generic as well, when there was a chance to make crazy weapons to make the game more fun. You get Snipers, Rifles, Shotguns, Grenade Launchers, etc. etc.   You get these weapons by Ranking up. You do this by completing Missions. These are like mini-achievements that you're given. There are 150 in total, but you only have 3 active at a time -- and you do the ones you're given, no freedom there. There is a big problem with this. While these missions can improve variety and make the player go for different weapons and strategies, there's a major flaw: they're desynchronized with the actual ranks and weapon progression. I don't know how they screwed it up, but it just doesn't follow it... It would have been easy to get a mission for a specific weapon when you ranked up enough to get it. But nah, these missions are all over the place, often making you play a style that you've played before.   This is a big reason for the game's slow progression. Having 5 mission at a time would have been a good alterantive, perhaps. Or just give the player a chance to change them around (or queue them).    What else is there to talk about?   So far, the game seems very limited from what I said. And for the most part, it is. The the various modes, achievements and missions may prolong its lifespan, if this is what you're looking for. Since I wanted to try out every weapon, I kept playing, trying out the different modes, getting higher scores, and went as far as playing the whole game without dying (with 3 survival missions in a row).    It's very monotonous if you're not into rail shooter. However, for what it is, I don't think it's all that bad.   A game that's just about pointing and shooting... that doesn't sound very good. Well, there's a bit more depth to it, when you're going for highscores.   You have Combo and Damage meters.   The enemies shoot lots of fake bullets at you (to increase the adrenaline, I guess), but their real shots are very clear. You can shoot these bullets (if you're precise and fast enough), and you'll up your combo meter with these. Killing enemies before shooting will also increase your combo. Not getting hit as well.   The damage combo, you get from killing enemies, and shooting them while they're dead and on the ground as well. So you'll be constantly shooting something for the highscores, not just trying to survive (which is a bit too easy).   And to top it, the game is just very smooth. It feels pretty good to play, despite its simplicity in concept and execution. The enemies are all physics driven, after dying, so you can also screw around with that. Overall, it's a pretty well put together game. Good controls are surprising for a mobile port, but they certainly give the game a much better chance.   Other than that, there's typical mobile stuff. 5 power-ups (invincibility, super bullets, and air strike and bullet time), which you sometimes get with drops, or can buy with in-game currency. And lots of skins. Head-wear and Body-wear. These are simply cosmetical, and you also get with in-game currency. It keeps the character from looking the same for the whole game, nothing wrong with it.    I think I'll finish the review here.   It's very, VERY light on game design. The only noteworthy aspect would the high-score system, I'd say. Very limited enemy and level variety, uninteresting weapons, ... It doesn't sound very good.   But it simply plays very well! The weapons, while generic, feel different, there are several different approaches to your playstyle, and rail-shooters aren't exactly something we're drowning in.   So yes. IF you're looking for something like this, you'll probably be entertained with Major Mayhem for a while. If not, go find some other game, since this one isn't special in any way. Just not bad.			"

Major Mayhem is a fantastic “on the rails” arcade shooter, with its clean cut paper-craft aesthetic that sets it apart from similar titles and offers a huge amount of fun to be had. It’s ridiculous and quite frankly hysterical narrative simply oozes charm, so don’t expect anything in the way of a serious story line, as it basically involves “rescuing your girlfriend from the forces of evil”...Watch the video review above for more information, if you are curious if Major Mayhem is for you!

												If you haven't yet played 'Major Mayhem' on your favorite portable entertainment square, you've been missing out on one of the most enjoyable run & gun, twitchy arcade shooters around.  Wave after wave of stereotypes descend on you as you pick them off with one of multitude of firearms ranging from pistols, to sniper rifles, to bazookas.  It's a very simple game on the surface, but it mixes things up enough between each wave to keep it prepetually entertaining.The touch screen controls of this mobile port have translated quite well to a mouse cursor interface.  Additonally, there's been a transition from the entirely optional in-app-purchases on mobile to a tiered unlock as you progress.We don't see a lot of well-done arcade action like this nowadays.  Can't recommend this one enough.			"

Your guy, Major, runs vertically and stops whenever enemies start jumping behind rocks and huts etc. You are typically behind a cover and lose the cover while shooting. That's when you take hits. Damage. Ouch. Then you move on to a helicopter and get a rating of one star because you didn't shoot all of the enemies hats. I recommend this on phones if that was unclear.			"

												Epic storyline, intense strategy, and mind-numbing puzzles. Things that Major Mayhem isn't about. But that's okay! Because you need a game to just play to relax. Major Mayhem is simple. It fulfills a necessary place in my brain. Sometimes, I just want to play a game that doesn't force me to think too much. I just want to have fun. Like Time Crisis or Virtua Cop or any other first-person light gun game, you are a person on rails who shoots first, ask questions while shooting, and then shoot some more. This game was built for the mobile device. But it's still a fantastic PC game.			"

												Fun, quirky arcade-style shooter. It's a fun game.A little repetative, but after you hit your stride, you'll see that repeating levels is not so bad. Lots of weapons, lots of challenges, lots of weird clothing options....Excellent time killer since you can pick any stage that you want once you beat it.Get it if you:- Like twitchy games- Like old school arcade shooters- Like to see Colonel Sanders with a chicken for a hat using a bazooka that shoots out chickens at tanks.

												Major Mayhem is a mobile game,keep this in mind if you are even thinking about buying it,But this is a mobile game that had care put into its pc verison at least a bit because this pc port has none of the micro payments that could of ruined the moblie version for somepeople. Instead its a onetime payment of 5 dollers and then you can gain all the Outfits and guns the game has to offer. As you level up you unlock guns and as you play you gain coins,you can guns one by one as you level up but you can buy what ever outfits you want with the money you earn they are all avalible from the word go,just some are alot more money then others. This game is a railshooter in the style of time crysis you are in cover untill you shoot then you can get hit by red bullets,but luckly in this game you can shoot those out of the sky.The games story is almost not there,you are major mayhem and have a mission of saving the free world and saving your girlfriend. It has 3 zones that have around 4 enemy types across them all. The game can take a few hours to beat but would take alot longer to unlock all the guns and outfits the game has to offer.It might be a rail shooter but at only 5 dollers its not that bad of a deal,with rambo the video game being one of the only other railshooters you can choose from this might be one of the only choices people on steam have when it comes to rail shooters. Its no time crysis or house of the dead but its not bad.			"

												To put simply, ""Major Mayhem"" essentially is ""Time Crisis""-lite without time crisis, gameplay-wise and sans ""story"".I believe the ""auto-fire""-feature simply has allowed to keep my play this game game this long already (I.E. You're not forced to click mouse buttons for every single shot, a phenomenon which simply has been infected far too many games nowadays for the sake of ""immersion"").Worth giving it a try, especially if you're willing to enjoy some simplicity.

												The game is strangely addictive as there is a bit of strategy to playing it. You can't just spam if you want good points and getting all the weapons is a bit of a challenge. I spent 8 hrs with it and didn't even get near to a perfect game with all 3 stars on the levels and all challenges complete.			"

												What a great little on rails shooter! Once you start blasting those baddies it's damn hard to put down! It's just a lot of fun getting coins for upgrades and acquiring the new armour, weapons and outfits! The graphics  and sound are pretty good and suit the gameplay. Also, the achievements are pretty diffciult but been fun to obtain so far. And if you tire of the Classic game mode, there are plenty of variety in the Timed, Arcade and Survuval modes! My only gripe is it would seem the game could be a bit of a grind due to the amount of things to buy and the rate you obtain them at. That aside, it's great fun and I can see myself putting in a lot of hours on this one. Deffo wortha look.			"

												This is a fun shooter, that doesn't take it's self seriously at all. It has a similar ""Story"" as something you would expect from an 80's game. Evil Ninjas have captured your girlfriend and it's up to you to shoot your way through and rescue her....while changing clothes along the way, cause you have to be FABULOUS!The game is a bargain at just 5 bucks, however if that is out of your price range, you can play it freelu on your mobile device. Google Play has it free, as do most app stores I imagine. However in my opinion, it's much more fulfilling to play on PC.Def worth checking out....Especially if you see it on sale!			"

												A really well made Time Crisis-esque arcade shooter. Lots of content, very polished graphics and presentation, quite addictive, even for someone who's not a big fan of the genre. If you're interested in side scrolling shooters, this is a pretty worthwhile purchase for sure. Lacks a bit of depth and challenge though, in my personal opinion. Major Mayhem is definitely more for people looking to get into the genre, or just anyone who wants a casual pick up and play game.7/10			"

Also great for achievement hunters, with a ton of achievements (including internal achievements). A great buy on that price!			"

												Major Mayhem could be a good game if it was a mobile one or available for free. Yeah, Duck Hunt was fun at the time, but this modern version of it is just boring. I completed it in less than two hours, gameplay is tedious. It's just a graphically appealing game with no guts at all. As I said earlier, for a mobile game Major Mayhem could be a good one, but not for Steam.			"
