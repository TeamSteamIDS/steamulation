												10 reasons why you should buy Oddworld: Abe's Exodus1. Best FMV cutscenes, or for that matter, any kind of cutscenes, in video games (except maybe the other Oddworld cutscenes)2. GameSpeak allows you to talk to your Mudokon buddies, making for some ingenious puzzles3. The platforming is great4. You can possess the enemies and wreck their s**t5. It's funny as s**t6. The oddness is immense and just great7. The story is great8. The GameSpeak was expanded from the 1st game to the creatures you can possess, allowing for even more puzzles9. It's only $2.5010. YOU CAN POSSESS YOUR OWN F**KING FARTS!So buy this game.			"

												Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is a landmark game, and worthy sequel to the original Abe's Oddysee.Even in its now-limited screen resolution, the strong visual design of Abe's Exoddus shines through. Don't expect to run this game at your native resolution (unless you never upgraded beyond 800x600 - in which case, you're in luck!), but do expect the following: some fantastic and challenging platforming gameplay; a vast number of gorgeous levels interwoven with an interesting, dark and downright odd narrative; some brilliant music which changes dynamically depending on the events taking place; and finally, some fiendish puzzles which make use of Abe's talent for posession and the use of GameSpeak - a system by which you can instruct other characters to whatever ends you desire, be it salvation or something more nefarious.If you've played it before, there's no better time to return to the original Oddworld titles before enjoying the delights of the HD Remake, New N' Tasty, which recreates the events of the original game in a modern game engine and is ""coming soon"". If you're new to the series, don't be put off by the age or initial difficulty curve. Exoddus has a quick save system, so you'll never lose progress as long as you're diligent. A must-play!			"

												Unlike Abe’s Oddysee, I have no childhood nostalgia with this game. So it comes hard for me to admit that Abe’s Exoddus is a much better game in terms of structure. Like most second entries in a video game series, Exoddus heavily improves upon the original’s platformer-puzzle formula by adding new mechanics and obstacles for you to overcome. The added quick save and “All of ya!” command are easily the best new features, with the different Mudukon types and possessable creatures being a close second. A great example of a good sequel, Abe’s Exoddus does a fantastic job at continuing the series while still offering unique elements that keep it distinct from the rest.			"

												This game is essentially the same as the first Oddworld game, but with a few improvements. It has a better tutorial, new enemy type, able to save whenever (which lets you create your own checkpoints). That said, the controls still feel clunky and delayed, which causes many frustrating deaths. Otherwise the atmosphere and characters are still as great as I remember when playing this game for the first time as a kid!

You will die a lot especially when you are trying to save mudokons.The art is amazing, really pleasing and gorgeous, reminds me of donkey kong and 2.5d art combined. The story is also really good, I won't say it though.Humour: Absolutely hilarious, it has very good jokes.Characters: Really odd(pun intended) There's Abe, glukkons, paramites, scrabs and fleeches.

												In my opinion: best of the oddworld series.It doesn't only improve on abe's oddysse (able to make multiple mudokon follow, quicksave, better voice, ect.), but also features more variety in gameplay.If you've never heard of the series and are curious about jumping into one of these games, I recommend that you start here. That or you can wait and see how the remake turns outs, in which case you should just start from the first one instead.The game itself is a highly pre-rendered puzzple platformer which takes place in a strange world with weird creatures. You're basically trying to save as many modokons (green aliens) as possible, in various ways. There's 300 mudokons to rescue, you don't have to rescue all of them in order to complete the game, since many of them are hidden in all sorts of sercrets. You have the ability to possess creatures and take control of them, also each of them have their own set of lines which can be used to interact with others, it has a unique approach to a dialogue system which is a bit messy at times, but it wont get in your way too much.9/10 - ps1 nostalgiaIf you get stuck at some escape levels, don't forget that the X key makes you instantly roll while you're running, also F5 is a shortcut for quicksave and F6 for quickload.

												One of the best platformers ever made, Abe's Exooddus is a direct sequel of Abe's Oddysee and features even more levels than it's predecessor, while also bringing the most requested features of the last game, namely the ability to quicksave, restart levels where you messed up and all-talk.The game features plenty of mechanics and contains sections of stealth, logic, agility and sometimes observance.To name one of the mechanics that makes this particular game stand out, you have the ability to posses enemies and use them in your advantage to either destroy their own kind or free your path. Every single type of enemy has different types of abilities and limitations and it's up to you to figure them out. Some levels even prevent you from using your powers so you will have to use your brain to find a way around.The game also throws a challenge at you. Fellow enslaved people of your race are scattered around levels and it's up to you to talk to and lead them to portals that bring them to their freedom. You can either succeed or get them killed in the process, or even ignore them altogether and continue in your journey. You can command them using the talk system, unless they're mad or depressed, where you'll have to console them first, or smack the crap out of those affected by laughing gas.I personally think that's a very unique mechanic. Sometimes you'll have to clear a whole level then come back to the very beginning and escort your pals. Blind ones are also present and telling them to stop in their path is mandatory for their survival.You'll be rewarded for saving many of your kind but punished for refusing to or saving too few.The atmosphere of this game, like the first, is amazing. The story elements, the setting, the soundtrack and the characters make it up for one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever experienced. The graphics and the cutscenes are pre-rendered 3D sequences and they look just great for a game that came two decades ago. I should probably also mention that this game, unlike other titles on Steam that originally came during the 90's, fully works on both modern and old systems.I don't really have negative feedback about this game. It's one of the things that made up my childhood and replaying it was a lot of joy. I guess that there were a few annoying levels that felt a bit repetitive(the ones that feature fleeches for instance), but other than that, everything is godlike. I highly recommend this game to anyone.Fart in a platformer today!			"

												Nominated for the “test of time” award. This was my absolute favourite game when I was a kid and I still love it to this day.It may be partly because I only owned about 3 games at the time but I must've sunk more hours into this game than any other.The atmosphere and world are great, a dark story with just the right amount of humour. Abe is the last hope to free his enslaved people, who are forced to work in dangerous conditions by greedy slave traders who care only about profit, but if you get bored of all that you can press a button to make Abe fart, which causes all Mudokons next to him to take step back, and those further away to giggle. Gameplaywise Abe’s Exoddus is a puzzle-platformer with the emphasis on the platforming over the puzzling. Most of the puzzles are easy to figure out, but actually completing them is another thing. It manages to fall into that elusive sweet spot of “challenging but fair”. You will die a lot but the game rarely resorts to fake-difficult instant-death traps. I remember playing some of these levels for the first time, I almost smashed my keyboard in frustration and yet every time I screwed up I knew it was my own fault. Each failure leaves you even more determined to finally beat this damn level.This game seems to be less popular than its predecessor, Abe’s Oddysee, (although that may just be my group of friends) but I definitely prefer this one. Partly because I actually played this sequel before the original but also in large part because of the addition of quicksave. There is nothing more frustrating than completing a particularly difficult section and then dying 3 steps from a checkpoint and the quicksave handily eliminates that frustration.The graphics are somewhat dated but it still looks pretty good for its age, besides it’s only $3 - or even less if you wait for a sale - what more could you want? Highly recommended, especially for any fans of old-school platformers.			"

												I absolutely love this game. I love it so much, I spent a month only playing this game and saved all the Mudokans. I didn't grow up with the Oddworld games, but earlier this year I picked up the first on PS1. I honestly didn't have much fun. The game is good, but I would rather play it on an emulator where I can save anytime I wanted. So when I heard Abe's Exoddus had the ability to save and quicksave where ever and when ever I wanted (and needed) to, I got excited. And to be perfectly honest, I perfer the keyboard controls over the controller. I feel it's better for this kind of game, where you have to execute a quick set of movemens in a quick succession (like when you have to run and then roll into a hole. I didn't like how my movements felt pretty clunky on the PS1 version of Abe's Oddysee.Some Pros:The story is great (play the game to find out)The Mudokans are the most adorable things I've ever seen (I don't think the blind guys are scary)The controls can be changed to make movement fluidYou can possess almost everything (even your own farts after you drink some SoulStorm)The cutscenes are great(This is just a little thing, but I love how some Mudokans' voices can be really high or really low)(Another small thing, but I like Abe's new voice)Some Cons:The game is old, so the steam overlay and screenshot functions don't workSometimes alt-tabbing out would crash the game, and saving on one screen completely crashed everything (I'm guessing somewhere in Necrum)The graphics are pretty low-res, and the cutscenes are pretty blurry(but I still love the cutscenes)TL,DRBuy this game and you will be happy if you're fine with quicksaving a lot			"

It took me 20 hours to complete this game, so that's £1 per 10 hours.The game itself is a classic, growing on what made Abe's Oddysee so great, and while I think Exoddus lacks the atmosphere that made the original so enjoyable, the gameplay itself is much more varied (though I still prefer Oddysee). The cutscenes are better, the music is more complex (if not a tad generic), there are more places and environments to see, and there are more types of puzzles based on the emotion system with the Mudokons. They can be angry, depressed, wired (in other words happy), sick, and blind. This means a lot more is explored as to how the Mudokons interact with you, and especially trying to handle the wired Mudokons running about with enemies, bombs and motion sensors around can get very tense.You can also autosave, another improvement from Oddysee that makes the game much less frustrating.I have 2 complaints, however; the first being there are a few ridiculous chase sections that force you to duck and react quickly with a movement system not internded for fast-paced action, rather slow-moving stealth. The game also overstays it's welcome a bit, getting dragged out for a few more hours than it really needed to last.Speaking of stealth, once again every single enemy can make your palms sweat all over your controller, especially if you have some blind Mudokons you have to escort.One more thing; the graphics, for 1998, are amazing. I found myself stopping and gazing at some of the fantastically detailed backdrops of places like Necrum and the Soulstorm Brewery. It's dark and beautifully rendered.Anyway, get the game now. It's bloody great.			"

												This game stands the test of time beautifully! the mechanics are smooth, fun, and the devs really polished all those little niggling annoyances after Abe's Oddysee. Currently doing a playthough on my Youtube channel. The first episode here outlines the basic mechanics and shows you just how fun this is to play. :) check it out to get a feel for the game!

												Fantastic sequel to Abe's Oddysee!This game adds more than what Oddysee had. More characters to mind control, more Game Speak commands, variety of environments and colors, new obstacles, and of course, you can lead every Mudokens in the same area with the press of a key instead of having to talk to them individually.Pros:+Beautifuly rendered environments for the time+Humorous cutscenes+Tight Controls+Chilling atmosphere+Memorable sound effects and voice clips+Quicksave++YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR OWN FARTSCons:-Some ledges/platforms are blending in the background which makes them hard to see (or maybe I'm just blind)-A lot of trial on error (could be considered a nitpick)-Delay when pressing certain keys-Game Speak feels clunky sometimes-Expect a lot of wall hittingOverall, I can't think of any major negatives; the good stuff outshines the bad stuff. I've personally never owned a PS1, but playing it for the first time on Steam after many years of its release, it still feels fresh. Worth replaying to rescue all Mudokens!			"

												I played this on my PlayStation back when it came out. It is my ultimate favorite game and I have played it so many times. I although it isn't working on my PC, but I think it's my fault because it works perfectly on my friend's PC. But I also have it on PSN so no biggy.As for the game, if you ever played cinematic platformers such as Another World or Flashback (The original, not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ remake), you should know that this is the best of that genre. Amazing atmosphere, awesome level design, creative and disturbing story and lore, and the gameplay mechanics are so ahead of their time. From talking to your fellow Mudokins, to possessing enemy sligs, this game has it all. Puzzle, platforming, and chase sequences. Whatever I say won't give this game enough credit, so I suggest you go to YouTube and watch Caddicarus' review of it. He is the best man for the job.			"

												MY game of the year... every year.Absolute personal favorite of mine. Played it on PS1 and bought it again after seeing it here on Steam because that's just how much I loved this game. I finished the game multiple times while rescuing all Mudokons, with and without cheats, and even somehow got 3 extra Mudokons without the use of cheats or intentional glitches if I did any at all.To me it is one of the best examples of a game where timing is absolutely essential for avoiding things that can kill you or your buddies while keeping you focused on how to proceed. The whole game got a lot easier though with the new QUIKSAVE feature but its essential duty for that however was to replace the old checkpoint system in the previous game thus leading to much fewer frustrations if you die/fail.

												Abe's Exoddus is a really good platformer, which requires a lot of thinking to overcome obstacles, especially when saving mudokons. There are many secrets in the game which are essential to getting the good ending for the game - there's even one on the first screen of the game (areas where there are secrets are usually signalled by empty SoulStorm Brews in the scenery).The only bad thing about this game is that it's a ♥♥♥♥♥ (at least for me) to get running on a modern PC. I think it's to do with my laptop (the Fn keys cause the game to not display the image, but you can hear sound and interact with menus fine).This is a good game, and it's not expensive either.			"

												In Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, you play as Abraham the shriveled blue prune and it is your main duty to slaughter as many of your mudokon friends as possible. You get bonus points for killing the blind ones and get even MORE points for slapping the depressed ones until they fall over and ♥♥♥♥ing die.

While both Oddysee and Exoddus are on here, I have to admit that Exoddus puts Oddysee to shame. In fact, playing the first game after the second makes you feel like you are playing a beta.So much to possess, so many mudokons to free, so many beasties to avoid... What are you waiting for?			"

												Having written a review for Abe`s Oddysee, I won't underline the same things as I did there. An amazing sequel, bringing new gameplay elements thus making the puzzles even more complicated and unique.I felt that Exoddus was a bit easier, but maybe I just got used to the style of the game, nonetheless the puzzles are still challenging and tiring. I still had to take a break after 1 hour of playing it.It took me 17 hours to finish it and I didn't waste so much on certain sections of the game as I did in the previous one that I finished in 12 hours. At some point towards the end of the game, I found it a bit monotonous, I really wanted to end already but the game kept throwing puzzles that seemed not so relevant and a bit annoying, with the single purpose of making the game longer.

												This is such a wonderful game. I remember seeing it on the PlayStation shelves when I was a kid and wondered if it was as funny as the previous Abe's Oddiysee. I can now confirm that it is and it includes major facilities for bad players: sweet quick save.As regards the gameplay style, you can either be a vicious psycho or a commited savior to your mudokon mates. For one purpose or another, you have new abilities to exploit. Grenades have grown old-fashioned, now it is time for explosive farts.Needless to say, do I recommend this game? Yes. Am I looking forward to seeing the (announced to come) Soulstorm? You bet it.			"

												Well first things first, This game is amazing and you should buy it.I had this game and the original on the Playstation way back, so this game is apart of my childhood and i replay it every now and again and honestly it just doesn't get old, i mean possessing and then destroying your enemies with your farts speaks for itself and you can just decide to kill all the mudokons in spectacular ways instead because well why not.Lorne Lanning & Oddworld Inhabitants were out to show us at the time that 2D gaming can still reign supreme as this game came out in the wake of 3D. this was when everybody was trying there hand at it. Nintendo released Super Mario 64 in 1996 which was revolutionary and proved once again that Shigeru Miyamoto is a boss but on the flip side one year later Eidetic released Busby 3D which was one of the worst 3D games ever seen by man or mudokon and left me with scars, In the midst of all these 3D titles, Oddworld Inhabitants took a step back and give us two Masterpieces Oddysee & Exoddus.If you do decide to buy this or have already bought it, I recommend Downloading DXGL as this allows the game to run at your desktop resolution and also fixes the Steam Overlay and I also suggest playing with a PS4 controller if you have one as i have created a controller profile within steam so that it plays like the PS1 version and i added a few extras like the ability to quicksave & load on the rightside of the touchpad like New N' Tasty, it works like a charm.

												A beautiful classic game, its really is incredible although the controls are a bit potato, but theyre easy to get used to. If you're looking for hours upon hours of great gameplay that doesn't get old, and fart jokes, then this game is for you. I'm pretty sure it has at least 2 days of gameplay not including sleep and if you had a good knowledge of how to play the game, so for an inexperienced bloke it would give you a lot of great gameplay. Not to mention the remake that is in development I think. Anyway, its a sick game mate, gotta play it.			"

Abe's exoddus's overhauls over abe's oddyseepros:+improved level design.+actually very clever and funny writing.+all of the mechanics have been improved in some shape or form. (even the ones that weren't used on abe's oddysee but were there for no reason and or were re-maps of others now have actual porpuses to be there)+arguably more colorfull and detailed backgrounds (abe's oddysee had great alien like landscapes that felt sacred,wild,ominous and or dangerous. abe's exoddus feels more like what happens after a big company starts to forage and destroy said landscapes, now entoxicated and more rotten than what it already used to be, but still manages to add more colors and lights to make something enjoyable to stare at)+great cgi animations (i don't think they were improved but i had to bring it up anyways)+quicksaves are a thing now.Abe's exoddus's flawscons:-delayed controls, cinematic platformers have always been somewhat clunky and this one is no exception.-repeated trends for level design. I swear, there were at least 3 ideas that I saw getting repeated throughout the game.- no quickloads, meaning that if you don't save after a quicksave you might have to repeat what you just did assuming you screwed up.Personal experiencethe game was super fun to play through, not only was it beautiful to look at, it also happened to be an incredible thrill ride filled satisfying puzzles, funny cutscenes and unique locales to explore.the game is surprisingly long for its time and genre, ocationally the game can even be pretty spooky which is actually aplaudable for how it plays around with its sound design and ♥♥♥♥ed up imagery to mess with you, its dirty cheap and a literal steal during steam sales so please do yourself a favor and get this game.

												So, this is one of my childhood games. Played it to a point where the disc simply broke... With that said. There is only one thing that prevents me from giving this the all thumbs up, and it is a major one... You can't play this with a controller. And that kicks alot of the fun out the window. Learning and remebering the keys is just awful. Untill it supports a controller... I just can't get the feel for the game. Sorry. This is just me tho, if you can cope with the somewhat wonky keysystem, then by god buy this game. You won't regret it.			"

												This was one of my favorite childhood games and once I had came across it on steam I knew I had to but it. I had purchased it and installed it and I was so estatic. I launched the game and I came about error message after error message. So with much regret I had to uninstall this game because it was not built to run on the computers we own today D:			"

												By far the best Oddworld game. My only criticism would be the small scale of some of the levels (for example, if you possess a slig, you can only move a little distance before you realise you're stuck, since the slig can't climb ladders, enter doors, etc) Overall though, this is a fantastic action/puzzle game. The 'Quiksave' function is fantastic and makes the game a lot more forgiving when you die (and you will, a lot!).			"

												 Greetings fellow gamers, If your looking for a sequal that tops everything that the first one accomplished well look no further than Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. Save anywhere anytime, better voice commands, multiple Mudokens follow you at once, and even more mind bending puzzles than ever before and an awesome story to boot. Oddworld Inhabitants have really outdone themselves with this beautiful, fun and challenging nostalgic gem which will having you laughing from start to finish. You will be challenged by this game and I am saying this now that you will get your moneys worth trying to save all 300 of your fellow mudokens (through alot of trial and error). So follow Abe in his next big adventure in the follow up to the awesome Abe's Oddysee... So don't be shy grab a soulstorm brew and dive into the wonderful and crazy world of Oddworld.			"

												When my friends ask me what a slig is, I will say oh it's one of the bad guys from the Abe series. About 20% of them wil say: ""oh those old games from the 90's"" but the rest will go ""what's abe"" then i'll have to say, look it up on steam. Abe was te very first game i ever played on my original playstation, back then though i could barely hold a contoller without dropping it, and i could still recognise this games fun potential. I believe just because a game is old and wasn't to popular when it first came out, isn't a  valid reason for a great puzzle platformer to fly under the radar. Abes Exodus, and Abes Odysee have an excellent backstory and lore, which come hand in hand with great, oldschool gameplay that gamers young and old can enjoy.-The Angry Slig			"

												A stroke of genius put into a game. Seriously. This game is huge for the small price. Totally worth the money. The games also doesn't make use of the mouse at all so its easy to play if you're stuck with a touchpad. It's a puzzle/action game. An interesting story, while also very dark. Gave me nightmares as a kid. I will conquer it now that I am a man hurr hurr *flexes muscles*The graphics have aged well and the game was extremely great for its time. It's difficult to find this game on other platforms nowadays so the Steam version is a great save.			"

												ALL OF THE NOSTALGIA!!! From the very first sounds of the opening sequence and game menu, I was instantly transported back to late 1990's, sitting in my older brother's bedroom, playing this on classic playstation and a tiny, heat-warped telly that we had to use a bit of blue-tac and a screw to keep the switch on AV (occassionally the screw would come loose and we'd suddenly be plunged into static mid-game!). My brother and I would take turns playing, switching every time we got Abe killed (which, on my part, was normally almost instantly), jumping out of our skins at the scarier parts (this game had the best graphics we'd ever seen at the time) and laughing our arses off at all the fart jokes. We had played through Oddysee pretty quickly, so we were excited to have a much longer game this time (TWO whole discs!), with slightly better graphics, and OH THAT REALLY AWESOME QUICKSAVE FUNCTION! Our mum even got in on the action, and played this with us on more than one occassion, helping us out with the more ""puzzle-solving"" sections that we couldn't work out (plus she is an x-files fanatic and loves everything to do with Aliens and weird♥♥♥♥♥♥like that). So for me, this game is totally worth playing, even though it definitely wasn't designed to be played with a keyboard, nor on a 27"" HD screen. It brings back so many fond memories of the rare moments that my brother and I were working together to keep Abe alive and rescue all of the Mudokons, instead of at each others throats trying to kill each other. I still love the quirky nature of this game/universe - the artwork and landscapes are mind-blowing to me even now that the graphics are incredibly below-par. The characters and creatures of Oddword are so unique and terrifying. I love the 2D platform gameplay - I wish there were more games like this. Some of the levels are pretty easy, and some of them are infuriatingly difficult (for me anyway), which just makes completing them all the more rewarding :) Just don't be a dunce like me and forget that you've only been Quicksaving for the last 3 hours, decide to exit after completing a particularly difficult level and forget to do a proper Save... That♥♥♥♥♥♥is devistating.So yeah, if you loved playing this game when it first came out, you won't regret playing it again :) It's everything I remember and more. If you've never played it before, give it a go! It was ahead of it's time when it came out like 15 years ago, and it's still a unique gaming experience in a lot of ways. If nothing else, the story is fantastic. The implications and irony of the story is something you just don't get in many popular games. We sympathize with the Mudokons and their hero, Abe. But most of us, if we took a hard look at ourselves, probably fall into the Glukkon or Slig category... or the kind of Muddokon that just watches it all happen and does nothing.HD re-make coming soon???

												Very slightly more light-hearted than Oddysee, but still retains the dark settings and characters which Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath lack. If you fancy a challenge, I would actually recommend this sequel over the original, as I found it a bit easier to get to grips with. Also, the controls have been tweaked slightly since the last game making Abe's ""chant"" move easier to access on the keyboard.There are times when you'll have cracked a puzzle or found a hidden door that leave you quite pleased with yourself - this is the kind of feeling you play it for! That sense of reward, being one step closer to saving all your Mudukon chums. (And yes, I do mean ALL of them. Honestly, play the game the way it's meant to be played)Also, I noticed a number of negative reviews referring to cutscene and freezing glitches - Guys, GET ODDPATCH! It's a nifty little .exe that runs in the background and fixes all the bugs. Just use a search engine and you'll find it.Get the Oddboxx while it's still on sale, you won't regret it! Great value!

												I can honestly say that this is my absolute favourite game ever, and I am happy that it's on Steam since my PS1 broke down. I really believe that this game gets heavily overlooked when it comes to naming the top games of its generation. Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee gets mentioned quite a bit, but this one... not so much. Which is a damn shame, and I'll explain why in a minute.The only downside to this was getting it playable was a little difficult. Resolution issues are the first big problem, though that was easy to fix with a quick download of a program. Now the only minor annoyance is that because its natural resolution was 800x600, stretching that to my 1920x1080 caused it to because a little more pixelated and blurry. You can still see everything perfectly fine, its mostly just distant objects or background things during the cutscenes that may be difficult to make out.Controller compatibility isn't labelled, but it is there, to a degree. I was prepared to use my Xbox 360 controller, but the default mapped controls for it were a mess (chanting was the 'Back' button of all buttons). Honestly, it's easier and probably better to just stick with the keyboard. Any remapping you deem necessary is much less stressful.As for the gameplay... If you've played Abe's Oddysee, then everything you saw there was improved on here, and for the better. Extra voice commands, emotions of the Mudokons to deal with, often in hilarious ways (particularly with the laughing gas). Possession of enemies ranges further than sligs (who also now have a flying variation). The wider range of enemies, the much more intimidating puzzles, the fact that the major bad guys are actually a within bits and pieces of the game and become a mechanic themselves rather than just be seen and death with via cutscenes... and at its worst, some areas just require careful timing. The game is incredibly simple for the things you can do.The backgrounds for the environments are spectacular, the music... isn't the stuff of legends, but I have found myself humming or whistling a couple of the tunes here and there. But otherwise the only other major factor is the story, and it's just as weird and twisted as the original. It kicks off right where Oddysee ended (poor Abe doesn't even get time to rest).And here's a fun fact. Back in the late 90's when this game originally came out, most of this games cutscenes were turned into a short film. A short film that was nominated for an Oscar. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Academy Award! Technically speaking, the first and (I could be wrong with this one) only game to have achieved that.Besides the questionable performance issues in getting the game going, majority of which easily fixed, I recommend this game and recommend it hard. While I'm at it, I also recommend Abe's Oddysee (or its HD remake 'New n' Tasty'). While it may be a childhood love of mine, it's been 17 years and I can still call it my favourite.I'm at a point where I can play at least 30% of it with sound alone, and I'm still not sick of this game. It's just that kind of game that I can pick up and play any day of the year.TL;DR - If you liked Oddysee, you'll like Exoddus better. If you haven't played it, PLAY IT! "

												I never got to play this Oddworld game on my PS, but to play it now makes me feel a lot better. It's almost the same as Abe's Oddysee, but with way more humor, some new additions, and a few game mechanics tweaks. I don't see anything to complain about: there's only one way to complete each level, and if you can't do it, you need to observe the level better and try again. If you can do that, you'll realize that this game is extremely simple, and awesome, too.			"

												I remember playing this on the PS1 and it was just awesome. Worst thing of all is I never knew it was available for PC! I've been playing this for a while now and all the memories came rushing back to me. Good times...This is one of my favourite games of all time. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good old retro platformer puzzle game.10/10, would say ""Hello"" again.			"

												Just as good as Abe's Oddyssey! An amazing franchise that helps you relive the good old days. (and the old school graphics just make it even better.) If you like a brain picking strategy game, totally worth a buy and it's criminally cheap for what it's worth!			"

												Very slightly more light-hearted than Oddysee, but still retains the dark settings and characters which Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath lack. If you fancy a challenge, I would actually recommend this sequel over the original, as I found it a bit easier to get to grips with. Also, the controls have been tweaked slightly since the last game making Abe's ""chant"" move easier to access on the keyboard.There are times when you'll have cracked a puzzle or found a hidden door that leave you quite pleased with yourself - this is the kind of feeling you play it for! That sense of reward, being one step closer to saving all your Mudukon chums. (And yes, I do mean ALL of them. Honestly, play the game the way it's meant to be played)Also, I noticed a number of negative reviews referring to cutscene and freezing glitches - Guys, GET ODDPATCH! It's a nifty little .exe that runs in the background and fixes all the bugs. Just use a search engine and you'll find it.Get the Oddboxx while it's still on sale, you won't regret it! Great value!

												I really like Abe’s Oddysee, so I was looking forward to try Abe’s Exoddus. My expectations were met. Precise platforming with some logic puzzles was fundamental part of first Abe’s installment. Exoddus follows this tradition, adding new gameplay elements (new kinds of enemies, traps, etc.), but keeping the core mechanics the same. Peculiar humor and funny cutscenes are all over the place, just like in Oddysee. I can definitely recommend this game and its predecessor.			"

												While Abe's Oddysee certainly deserves a lot of credit, it is not without fault. The excellent level design, short-but-sweet story, and grand scope of it was hampered predominantly by its checkpoint system. Each portion of a stage would throw three or four challenges at you between each checkpoint, not counting any hidden mudokons. As a result, there were many cases when several parts of a particular stage were easy but fairly slow and time consuming, while later parts were significantly more difficult and led to multiple deaths. Having to replay the earlier, easier parts quickly became very tedious very fast. In some games, this sort of thing doesn't hurt the game, but here, where the gameplay is built around trial and error, and often demands a great deal of patience, it killed the pacing at several points towards the beginning and middle of the game.I'm mentioning this because Abe's Exoddus included a quicksave feature which circumvented this problem, and for that reason alone could be considered a better game. That's not the only feather in Abe's Exoddus' cap though. The inclusion of such a feature as quicksave can fundamentally change a game like this, and Oddworld Inhabitants clearly kept this in mind. The level design is more challenging than Abe's Oddysee, but more fair. Secrets, previously pretty cryptic and very easy to overlook without the help of a guide, are now found by some out-of-the-box thinking and creative use of the game's mechanics. The core gameplay and overall design have been tweaked to remove tedium. The mechanics have been greatly expanded upon in order to provide much more variety and complexity. The voice acted cutscenes lend the world much more character, and add a great deal of levity to a game that could very easily become quite depressing.No matter how you look at it, Abe's Exoddus is the better of the two side scrolling games (as of writing this, New 'n' Tasty is still PS4 exclusive, so I can't comment on it yet). It manages to correct the flaws of it's predecessor while also expanding upon everything that was good. It really is what every sequel should strive to be. More of the good, plenty that's new, none of the bad.			"

Steampunk designed levels, primal caves,  where you need to pass the challenges, ability to control enemies and command friend gruops, those secret rooms with semi-doomed mudakons you need to save and all that things mixed in easy controlled but hard game, harder than most of games.Just perfect!

Abe´s Exoddus introduces us certain elements that improves the gameplay like the emotional state of mudokons, the explosive farts that you will need to use in order to advance later in the game, and most importantly, the introduction of Quicksave that substitutes the ""annoying"" checkpoints that existed in Abe´s Oddysee. Story-wise it feels like the first game only with a different twist, this time involving the glukkons using the mudokon´s bones and tears to produce an addictive drink leading to an amazing journey in one wonderful journey of epic 2-D that marked a generation, helping Abe saving his fellow mudokons from slavery, and also saving himself!

It never gets old, it's tons of fun, it's very humorous, and if you haven't played it, then what are you waiting for?			"

												I remeber when I was still a kid & walking the shopping centre with my dad & he discided to into a store where they had DVDs & games on sale & comng past Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is the first game I spotted for the playstation 1.  The reason why I wanted it, because I have the Demo1 disc of the first game & I final got the full copy of the game while sometime in high school when stores like GAME stopped putting them old PS1 games instore.I do have the copy of this game on PS1, but never expranice the full game, because the game froze when Abe jumped in the well the Scrab temple, but Paramites temple was pretty aswsome, then I never really bothered with cheat code books that my uncle from England sent over to me years before with a copy of Crash Bandicoot 3.  I did complete the game a few years later by using the the level cheat code.Now that I am 19 going on 20 & have a laptop that runs windows 8 that can play some games like Five nights at freddy's.  Seeing British youtuber Caddicarus doing a retrospective of the first three games & saying at the end of part 3 that the games are on steam.  Well I downloaded the demo of this one & worked fine, then I bought it.Story: Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus takes place straight after the first when Abe saved all the mudokons from Repture Farms.  After having a fall & getting knocked out that laid him to having a vision of three ghosts telling him that the Glukkons are digging up there bones.  So Abe & five friends set off across the dessert to Necrum to put an end to it.Along the way Abe finds out what why the Gulkkon digging up Mudokon bones for a drink called Soul Strom Brew that is made from there bones, whitch takes Abe to another journy to the burial vaults of Necrum and temples of Scrabs, Paramites & Fleeches to get the ablity to cure sick mudokons. Whats new:With the character in game & in cutscenes sounds different from the first with, but with a deeper voice & then goes high when changes from saying ""Hello"" to ""Hi"" when using game speak as you progressing more into the game.  Some of the cast of characters from the last game are back including the gun crazy Sligs that can now fly & shoot granades & ones without pants & the Glukkons, Scrabs, Paramites & slogs return also.  There are some new characters like the blined mudokons, Fleeches, worm-like creatures that live in the Oddworld underworld that will take a few shots to eat Abe in one whole & Slurgs when stepped on will wake up the Feeches when sleeping.     What I liked:I like that I was able to us my PS4 controller to play the game like I did on the PS1 without having to use my keyboard on my laptop.  Getting to possess Glukkons, Scrabs & Paramites for the first time & using there very own game speak which is neat.The game runs really well & has a faster loading time & at a good low price.  You can run this game on any PC.What I hated:I got nothing besides the D-pad not doing anything. Final Thought:Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus has a great  sence of humor, good voice acting & level design, including amazing art that shows in the games background & in cutscenes. Is this worth your time?  Yes.   Its still a great game to this day.  I still do enjoy this game when ever I go back to play it after a long time.			"

												What to say about this game? I spent endless hours of my childhood playing through this again and again on the PS1 trying to find all 300 Mudokens and never quite doing it. It's a challenge that still daunts me to this day. Each playthrough will take countless hours (it came on 2 discs on the PS1). One of the best senses of humour in videogaming, and a solid puzzling system with core mechanics that get gradually added to as the game progresses, I can not recommend this enough.			"

												Loved the game on the PS1, still love the game now. If you wanna re-live this classic, buy the game. That being said, I do have a problem with this port. The  resolution  is fine as this was made for small monitors at the time, but the controls are slow to respond and that's problematic  for when the goose chases occur,  which I feel it hurts this game. I'll leave this as a positive because of the memories and feels, but if there was a fix with the controls, it'll be a lot better. Cheers for reading!  "

												I love this game franchise, and Oddworld Inhabitants is my favourite game developer. This game may be frustrating and the in-game graphics may look dated today, but Abe's Exoddus is still a fantastic game. Munch's Oddysee and New 'N' Tasty may be my favourites, but Exoddus comes close. I liked the cutscenes, as they still hold up, and the characters are memorable, especially Abe. But what I didn't like was how hard it could be at times. Still, it's a game well worth playing. WORK HARDER ON SOULSTORM, but not too hard, as we all know how Sonic Xtreme got cancelled. Just saying.			"

												How to do a sequel right! This game takes what was already amazing in Oddworld Inhabitants' first amazing game, ""Oddworld: Abes Oddysee"" and improved upon them threefold, such as being able to chant creatures other than sligs, like Scrabs, Paramites and Glukkons. Words cannot explain how great the puzzle solving in this game is. Every single screen in this game is memorable, just as the first game, and is an amazing platformer. Not just out of nostalgia, but at a critical game-making point of view, I give this game a 10/10.			"

Sure I can't run it without black borders, and the controls are tiled, but looking at New 'n' Tasty, This game is fantastic. The controls, levels, AI and generally the way the game works is fluid and simple. If you screw up, you can always go back (For example you wake up a slig, and instead of having to reload or kill yourself, you can simply leave the area and he will be asleep again. The simplicity of this just makes this game very enjoyable.The only con I have at the moment is that I can't use my controller, but I'm happy to use keyboard anyway.			"

												This Game. Just, this game.If you're planning on getting this game at the moment, don't let anything put you off. When I was a lot younger, owning this game on the PS3 [Yes, I am still one of those little turds who still attend school], I didn't like it. But now? It's one of the best games I've played in a while.  So if you're new to this series, here's a review for you to settle you in. Well, as best as I can.The PlotSo the plot is simple: Abe, the Mudokon who was formerly a floor-waxer for Rupture Farms before blowing it up, finds out of a despicable plan by the Glukkons through a group of dead spirits named The Three Weirdos. The burial ground of Necrum had been stolen from; bones were being mined by blinded Mudokons, as they were a required ingredient or the well-known beverage Soulstorm Brew. Upon finding this out, Abe sets out to Destroy the brewery and stop this new industrialist scheme. An okay plot, if I say so myself, despite being along similar lines as Oddysee. Controls: Movement, Gamespeak & PosessionThe gameplay is quite something. So let's get this out the way. Abe's normal controls, walking, running, rolling, jumping and all sorts are really smooth in a sense. They're responsive and flow well with the pace of the game, whether it be slow platforming or heart-pounding chases, and trust me, there are going to be lots of those. You're probably going to spend a lot of the time either walking, rolling or sneaking, as running is mainly essential for chases with Sligs, Scrabs and Paramites, which do crop up at just the right times. Jumping is precise and easy to do, y'just press the space button and you'll leap about two to three spaces forwards, which you learn and can pretty much master right off the bat. In fact, most movement CAN be learnt that quickly. And sneaking is just walking, 'cept Sligs can't hear you. Dead simple, and with a noise I can't get out of my head for some reason.Gamespeak. This nifty mechanic allows Abe to talk to his enslaved race and lead them to bird portals. A lot are simple: Hello, follow me, all of ya', wait, all that stuff. However, replacing the whistling from the last game, there are now options to slap, say sorry, tell people to stop. This was because in this game, the Mudokons have several emotions to work around, going from sad and angry, the blind Mudokons who will follow the sound of your voice but not you, or sick Mudokons who you have to heal with ring powers. There isn't much else to say here. Nifty.Posession is something that got a direct upgrade adding even MORE experimentation. Unlike last game where you could only posess Sligs, the gun-toting cyborg henchmen of the Magog Cartel, you can posess EVERYTHING here. Well, except for slogs. Scrabs? Check. Paramites? Check. The Glukkons who you can use to order around Sligs to do your bidding? Checkedy Checkedy Check. These all have their own curveballs, own Gamespeak, and own uses. Even though there aren't too many times you can posess Glukkons, and Phleg... Oh god, that part in Bonewerkz. Music and pictures This is where the game gets sublime. And by sublime, I mean some of the best atmosphere, music and art direction you're going to see. The score matches your enviroment perfectly. A few I can list off the top of my head are Necrum, the Mines, the Mudanchee & Mudumo Vaults, and then FeeCo Depot. Be it tribal instruments clashing and meshing to get the feel of a sacred area, or the mechanical and almost oppresive sounds of industrial areas like Necrum Mines or Soulstorm Brewery. All these tracks accompany the backgrounds perfectly. The amount of detail put into these images, the sheer blood and sweat clearly poored into this was worth the time, creating truly stunning pieces of art, such as all the areas involving the vaults or Necrum, which capture the sacred yet barren forest which has long been forgotten. This doesn't have to be the background either. Character animations, like the floor-wiping Mudokon slaves or even the mere act of climbing ledges or entering doors, are animated as smoothly and realistic as they possibly could be.  My Verdict: Well, what do I think of the game? It is timeless. A truly gorgeous blast from the past which will continue to amaze for quite some time, even if the newer games like Oddworld: Soulstorm flop! [Which I best will be nowhere near happening] If you're thinking about getting this game, go ahead. Only 1.99 pound, or at least for us English, and well worth the small amount of money you take out of your pockets to pay. a 10/10 from yours not so truly, Mr. Fanmemerofl. Stupid name, I know.			"

												This game is amazing puzzle and platformer but the difficulty does not hold up.			"

												One of the most perfect games I've ever played. It inspired me and my artistic endeavours throughout the years more than any other game out there. And what's even better is that I can still come back to it, and enjoy it without being horrified by ugly graphics. It still holds up in every aspect, just install windowed mode so that it doesn't stretch. I still kinda wish they updated all the sounds, sprites and backgrounds to higher resolution. :P Though I don't think it's possible.			"

												It's still just as difficult as it was back then, but at least now you don't loose disc 2! 11/10 would rage quit again.			"

												This is it. This is Abe. This is how storytelling is done, this is how a dark, dystopian atmosphere is created.Yoyoyo yoyo yoyo yoyo yoyo yoyo yoyo			"

												Honestly a pretty good game, considering pixels and old-timey cutscenes, but who needs to worry about such a thing when you got a game like this? Splendid in my opinion, played it since I was young.			"

												This is a flawless port of the original, which in my opinion is one of the best games ever made.  10/10  Strange as it sounds, this is the only platformer I prefer to play using a keyboard over a controller.			"

												This is a great game!Even better than the previous one, and yes it is possible to take this one up since you get the story from the last one :)Write a PM to me if you want any specific detailsBut I can say that I used approx 15 hours to complete, but I rescured almost every mudokun ;) - Not a hunt, just a princip of helping everyone out of there ;)			"

												Continuing where Abe left off the next game in the franchise adds more content than previously done and to think it was all done in a short amount of time is amazing. Enjoy the new abilities to quick save and fully interact with everyone you encounter all contained within satisfying puzzles and a story with lore to cover it all.			"

												Abe: If Brew's made by Glukkons, it's probably bad for ya. *Moments later drinks 15 bottles to progress the game*My GOODNESS! This game is just Out of this world! (Literally) Out standing Oddworld Inhabitants, bloody brilliant!Increadbly long game filled with many tricky and brain twisting platforms through out the game. Introducing old and new game mechanics to the mix like the Flying Sligs, chanting to Scrabs and Paramites and much much more! The story was great and sticks to what Abe's well known for. The diffculty gets right hard at the beginning but easy enough for beginners to understand. Secret areas are challenging and there are Loads of Mudokins to be saved (Or slain). And a great improvment from the previous game with all it's Bugs and Errors fixed!11/10 GJ! You broke the rating scale!			"
