												The game doesn't look that bad for a point-and-click adventure. The movies were also nice especially since that meant I didn't have to curse over the useless GUI. The voice acting and music is quite enjoyable throughout the whole game. Unfortunately, there is no real sense of progress as you make it through the investigations. One of the puzzles is plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with no obvious reasoning, even in walkthroughs. Movement is extremely clunky which is a pain when you need to sneak or solve a timed puzzle. The set of final questions - which are optional - were just guesswork due to the extreme lack of coherency throughout the rest of the game. There is just too little coherency for this game to work as entertainment.			"

												Sherlock Holmes: The Silver Earring was overall a very enjoyable puzzle adventure game. The game begins with the death of a wealthy businessman and leaves you to investigate the scene. The game will then take you to multiple connected locations as you attempts to piece together the murder and uncover the assassin and the motive for the murder. The game is set over 5 days of investigations and each day will have you visit a location and search it for clues and solve one or two puzzles with ranging difficulties (some puzzles were quite hard and confusing), at the end of each day you will summarise your findings in a quiz, which for me was probably the hardest part of the game. I found the story to be quite engaging and interesting overall with a good range of characters and locations and was well suited to a Sherlock story. Overall 'Sherlock Holmes: The Silver Earring' was a good solid adventure game which presented a well written story and some good puzzles, taking around 9 - 10 hours to complete and with a very conclusive ending I would highly recommend it for adventure game enthusiasts. 8.5/10			"

												 Unfortunately not worth the money.The price is a little exagerated for an old game as this that is not well put together in the first place. The story, music, voice acting is great - in particular the russian version brought back Vasilii Borisovich Livanov himself from the famous TV series as the main actor.Problems are simply related to how completable the game is and how enjoyable the puzzles are arranged. It's way too convoluted and unrealistic to complete without a walkthrough (then why start anyway?). There is no logic involved, just about every gameplay aspect is clunky. The inventory is a complete mess with dozens of items at times available at hand - impossible to deal with it without spending hours of trial and error. Avoid at the moment.The production value however of the voice acting, story and music must be utilized towards completing a remake in the future. Technology just destroyed this title, rendering it completely unaccessible. Games like these do need remakes.			"

												I've read little of the original stories from Conan Doyle but this game does get the feel of them. Less puzzle loaded and more clues and plot oriented, the game helps you keep track of the case by reviewing the main topics discovered at the end of each day. Also, the backgrounds are imensely developed, and so are the voice acting and speech of the characters. What a change from the shabby Mystery of the Mummy.			"

												Can I say this game is good? Perhaps, but with certain conditions.Firstly, it's FAR better than ""Holmes & the Mystery of the Mummy"" and ""Holmes & the Hound of Baskerville"", in terms of quality, character and logical conclusion.Secondly, it does challenge players usings its puzzles and quizzes. Now, challenge is good for these types of games, but sometimes, the answers don't quite make sense. Maybe it's just me being daft? Yeah, probably.But the game isn't particularly long, in terms of quantity of puzzles, but they are certainly sharp enough to be considered adequate. So, graphics are better then previous games. But the cut scenes and navigation can still be stuttery.Like, whenever you want to talk to people, you have to approach them from a certain angle, and rotate yourself awkwardly. And if you want to walk somewhere, sometimes layering can be strange, and you walk through chairs and all.But, that's not the point of a puzzle game, I suppose.Navigation is once again an odd concern. The game must be played in third person. Not only that, you have to click somewhere to make Holmes walk there, and double click to make him run (you can only run when outside or nobody is around). Particularly painful, especially in the forest part of the game.But still, a puzzle in itself perhaps.Along with puzzles are the quizzes.Basically, at the end of each in-game day, you get quizzed on everything you've collected in the day, from the clues you find, to the dialogue of people you talk to.Mind you that answers are not exclusively restricted to that day's resources but can actually include information as far back as the first day. This means you'll need to remember what all evidence contains, and link it with any new evidence found. Painful, especially if you can't remember things in pristine detail, like me.At least there's a walkthrough on GameBoomers.There are various characters that are involved, some providing more information than others.Lestrade seems particularly friendly toward Holmes though. Interface isn't too bad, seeing as you can read your notes and do a puzzle simultaneously.Very useful, and the best part is that the puzzle saves your progress, unlike ""Holmes & the Mystery of the Mummy"", so you can go and find more clues, come back and finish the fight.I find that the explanation at the end is quite complicated, and twist-inducing. Would've been better if it didn't break my computer every few minutes. Like, literally. I'd finish the credits or walk into a room, and I'd just get a black screen. Maybe a hardware fault regarding specs, but it ran fine for most of the game.But otherwise, it was alright for a game of its state.I'll hand this one a respective 7/10. Not the best, but certainly not the worst.It turns out Frogwares actually changes the character models for Holmes and Watson in the later games, so at least Holmes looks like he's had enough sleep.

Sherlock Holmes And The Secret of the Silver Earring		* 7/10This is my second Sherlock Holmes Game From Frogware and I must say that compared to the very first game this is a huge jump forward: real 3d graphics, an improved interface, we see and control also our good old chap Dr. Watson, and we have many dialogue lines with all the characters. Now I really do appreciate the voice acting although sometimes a couple characters are too exaggerated.This chapter starts faster than light. Invited to a reception by Sir Bromsby, Sherlock And Dr. Watson directly assist, together with the other guests, to his murder. They both will have to investigate his death assisted by inspector Lestrade as well. I must admit that the plot is quite complicated as well as some puzzles but it wouldn't be a Sherlock Holmes' adventure if they were different.+++PROs+++ DIALOGUES.  Now this is the serious innovation in the game since in the previous chapter we never find anyone to talk to. Now we get to talk to a lot of people, with different options, something I believe is very important for a point & click adventure, especially a Sherlock Holmes adventure. GRAPHIC. Compared to the previous chapter it really is a joy to play this chapter. Mind you, it's not the Cry Engine but still is pleasant to see (compared to the previous chapter) INTERFACE. At last the interface is more friendly and rich with more function to analyze items and whatsoever. You have a friendly inventory and a ""notebook"" which collects all the documents, photos and also transcriptions of each dialogue happened. MUSIC. Beautiful classical music always accompanies your investigations, with quiet baroque themes, happy tunes and fast paced tracks...---CONs--- MUSIC. ...Though unfortunately, as in the previous chapter it will repeat the track to death. Too bad because the music is made up of seriously beautiful compositions. MOVEMENT. Serlock is slow... SERIOUSLY slow because most times he can only walk (he can run but only in large spaces) and it's not just that: Anytime he needs to crouch to analyze something he needs to reach the right position for it... And he does it veeeeery slowly... Even if he is already in position he turns a little, then turns back then he interacts. Unnecessarily Odd. GRAPHIC. The aspect ratio is still 4:3 and the maximum resolution is 1280x920... -.- SUBTITLES. The whole game has text during all dialogues and so on but there's nothing during the short cutscenes which is one of the most important moments because something important usually happens or is being said. Too bad. INTERFACE. Nothing too bad, The hot zones for interacions sometimes are not where they're supposed to be, or maybe they're too small, or maybe you click them and nothing happens then maybe you click a little away and it works (a hot zone in a hot zone??). Also the menus have that art style very... Articulated that in some context it's hard to understand where to click (Specifically I'm talking about the ESC game menu, where both in options or save games you have to click the earring to get on the previous screen... And the earring is on the center of the menu, looking more like a decoration than a button). Also the notebook menu where you can scroll and read the documents, they're very small and can't be zoomed, not to mention the ""lower-upper"" page button. That too looked like a notebook decoration because when you go on it with the mouse it doesn't change anything, its colour, the cursor. It's not like it took me ages to figure those things out, but they're simple minor annoyance that should have been taken care of. "

												The progress the Franco-Ukrainian studio Frogwares has made between their first game, Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Mummy from 2002 and The Silver Earring, released 2 years later, is astounding. While the first one was a flawed, mostly cheap looking and generic first person adventure game, more abusing than using the Sherlock Holmes theme and character (Wael Amr himself admitted something along those lines in one of the interviews if I remember correctly) - the studio seemed to learn quickly from their mistakes - and the far better budget the predecessor somehow assured is obvious.  This time it's catering as much as possible to the Holmesians and The Silver Earring, and a much more enjoyable, complex experience, if not without its flaws.Gameplay is more or less typical point & click fare. Pixel hunting wasn't entirely eliminated, but is much, much more rare and less annoying than in the original. Inventory juggling is quite minimal and rare. Using items with people is rare and in perhaps all occasions but one, prompted by Sherlock, and using them together in the inventory itself. All the dialogues, clues, hints & papers are kept by the game and integrated in a sort of a ""quiz"" system, where you answer a series of questions using them as ""proof"" for the questions you're posed. While not perfectly executed, forced, and, perhaps, slightly clunky, it's an interesting system in any case. The game ensures you have everything you need I guess, by keeping you in one place / room / area until you find everything, which helps progress I guess. The puzzles are adequate, logical except for one with a safe (oh, you'll know which one it is) which requires a strange leap of logic. Though having a random character who just happens to dabble in inventions in the game is as cheesy a premise for introducing them as it gets. In general, it didn't thrill me, it didn't annoy me. OK enough.Walking is an annoyance, however, moving is jittery in general, and clicking on a hotspot that's supposed to lead you to a place where the perspective changes doesn't guarantee that you'll get there, as Sherlock is prone to random bouts of turning in place indefinitely. Though you won't get stuck because of it. It just makes the one timed event and 2 that require timing more annoying than they should be for some.The story & scenario are OK, and while it's not the best & original Sherlock scenario you'll ever see, it's fairly complex, with some good sides, and won't annoy the hell out of you like the first game. The voice acting is more convincing than last time (that's not saying much), though how and why couldn't they find a kid to play a kid, instead of an abysmal attempt by a grownup actor is beyond me - it depends on the character really.Graphically it's a mixed bag, with character models ranging from pretty detailed (Holmes) to completely off (Watson... whose character isn't executed exactly flawlessly either). Some scenes are more or less nicely or adequately rendered, some feel rushed & unconvincing. Similar with cutscenes, generally unimpressive, but then you run into the ""dominoes"" one -> effective, very well directed & executed, showing there's quite some potential inside the team. And the outro was at the time, and maybe still is, one of the longest in a game ever (around 20 minutes... seemed shorter to me, but it might as well have been). While there are mild glitches here & there, miles ahead of its predecessor.Music? Dvořák, Grieg, Schumann, Tchaikovsky. Need I say more? Well implemented too. Overall, while, as a point & click adventure game, it will never be among your all time favorites, being a pretty much average adventure game as a whole, it has its good sides and there's no real reason for a p&c buff or a Sherlock fan not to seek it out (preferably in a bundle), so it gets a tentative recommendation... there are worse things to spend an afternoon on.

												It's better than Mystery of the Mummy, but still it doesn't add up for a nice gameplay. The Silver Earring relies heavily on dialogues. (Well, at least they improved voice acting)After an hour of walking around and talking with some funny NPCs, I got bored eventually. There are almost no puzzles, it's just walking and talking, walking and talking... And that's not how I want to play a puzzle game.The Silver Earring would have been nice as a visual novel, if you ignore some technical glitches, but it's below average as a puzzle game.I could recommend this game only to patient old-school detective story lovers; for everyone else - there are better games in the genre.For example, Syberia 1 & 2 go along the same style, but are much better executed.My overall rating 5/10.

The angles are horrible, you walk to corners and can't get out.  If the game was created to irritate and anger you it does a very good job.  I have played this game and the mystery of the mummy.

												The game started out nice enough. Point-n-click adventure game. Not the best, but enjoyable.Then I got to the part where you need to stealthely get by a guard and his dog. A stealth part in an adventure game. Now, if implemented properly, this wouldn't be that bad. Unfortunatelly that is not the case here. The rules of how they can detect you are not explained nor are they obvious. Depending on where you are, Holmes may or may not be able to go where you click. Even after checking out some walkthroughs and knowing what I was supposed to do (which didn't really make sense in the first place) I was not able to get through this stage. Quite a shame since from what I understand, that's about halfway through. Oh well.			"

												The game is in many ways extremely flawed. The GUI is a complete pain, especially in portions where Sherlock needs to be moved around with precision, as he requires several second to just turn around, even when trying to avoid guards, and the game world is filled with invisible walls. The fixed third-person perspective also often turns the game into pixel hunt. Besides that, the game also pointlessly makes the player manually select dialogue options, even though all need to be cycled through, and all are recording in the journal, so there's no need to ever revisit them.Meanwhile, the story does make for an entertaining enough whodunnit, which isn't dampened even by the dismal voice-acting. At the end of each chapter the game makes the player pick the right clues to yield the correct deduction, which is a neat feature, as it prompts the player to pay attention and use their noggin, instead of just clicking on everything and letting Sherlock do the reasoning. For most part, the deductions are sensible, too, though all the contrived puzzles people use to lock their saves and whathaveyou certainly push the limits of believability.			"

And the game doesn't have a good system to track everything together.- Gameplay elements are inconsistent. Sometimes actions require you to click on an object in the gameworld, sometimes you need to click the same object in inventory, or drag-and-drop two objects on top of each other, sometimes you need to use magnifying glass, sometimes you don't. It's a bit confusing.- Crashes - There are few places that cause the game to crash consistently, loosing all your progress since the last save.- Spot the dot - In some areas you literally need to find one small spec in one big room. - Font in messages/books is unreadable ! Overall, there isn't really anything special about this, I would suggest trying newer games in the series, they are much more streamlined. "

												I was all about playing all the Sherlock Holmes games, but this one is seriously taxing my patience. I actually saw the logic of the puzzles, even the safe combination one everyone seems to hate. I like that it's actually investigative, with testimony a major component of the overall puzzles. I was enjoying all of it... until the stealth/timed stuff started. I was frustrated as hell with the first one, to the point of using a video walkthrough, which I usually avoid like the plague. I got past that, and there was a second one. I got through that.Then the forest. Where there are a dozen touchy, camera-angle-changing screen changes, a short, hard timer, and places where Sherlock WILL. NOT. F-ING. MOVE.Despite liking the story, despite liking the puzzles, I may not pick this game up again, and I really can't recommend it to adventure gamers of any but the most stubborn, old-school stripe. When a point-and-click adventure game has timed movement puzzles that combine Nintendo Hard game mechanics with control schemes that would be embarrasing in a free Flash game... if you're into seeing all the Sherlock Holmes games, just play this one until you get to the stupid timed BS, then watch Let's Plays on YouTube instead of subjecting yourself to the bad choices of the developers.

												This should have been the first Holmes game by Frogwares.  It's a very standard PNC adventure, but here the puzzles make sense and the game politely doesn't let you continue if you've missed something.  Insofar as that goes, it's not unwinnable by design except for a small bug that you'll probably never encounter.While not particularly difficult, the worst bits are the two timed events and those are your only chances to prematurely lose the game.

												A definite must-have for any point and click, whodunnit fan. It is one of my favourite Sherlock games, along with the Serrated scalpel and Nemesis (to some extent). The more recent games have seen an increase in morbidity, verging on horror, which is a no buy stamp for me.  This game is not your average point and click adventure, as the difficulty does not rely in inventive ways of combining items, but in interpreting the information you gather through discussions, observations, documents, just like Sherlock would. You have to enjoy sifting through lots of dialogue, names, places etc. in order to reach a certain conclusion. If you don't, then it's not the game for you. The animations are well done, even though where are some issues with the movement of the characters, and they add nicely to the overall atmosphere.All the answers are logical in the end, you just need to pay attention and consider everything. Also, you feel very good and smart when you get them right!			"

The key crime occurs soon after you begin, and what follows is a (mostly) methodical investigation that mixes interrogation and evidence gathering/examining.Having said that, the game is riddled with faults - a lot of the time you have to hunt for microscopic items to progress in the investigation, the placement of 'cursor spots' (for pathing and interactive points in the environment) is incredibly poor, the music is repetitive and dull, the translation for the English language version could have gone a lot better (and they could have used *any* font other than Comic Sans), the end of day quiz that summarises events doesn't tell you which answers are incorrect when you have to retry, inventory items have to combined in specific orders, and during the very lengthy conclusion, virtually *every* clue is explained, regardless of it's ultimate relevance.Ultimately, unless you are a fan of the 'classic' Holmes, The Silver Earring will likely be a very dry, tedious experience, however, compared to the garbage that came before it, it can only be recommended on that merit.

												I love me some detective adventure games where you got to gather clues and interrogate people. Games such as Discworld Noir and Under A Killing Moon do it really well and it's kinda sad that so few games in the genre exist. The Silver Earring is another of these games which does not rely upon ""use item X with item Y"" puzzles but rather on cross-examination, investigation and tying elements together.It doesn't do it as well as the above-mentioned examples, however. In most areas the games is quite adequate but never more than that, and in some areas the game is rather poor. Here's a list of PRO's and CON's:PRO- The game keeps track of everything you collect & where you collected it in list-form. Same with dialogs and letters and other evidence. Very tidy and handy- the Quiz between chapters is pretty well done and forces you to think for yourself- the backdrops are pretty well designed- the game has a nice attention to detail in true Sherlock Holmes fashion- the murder mystery is actually quite engagingCON- the dialog is very hit & miss - some parts are simply poorly written while others are quite convincing. The voice actors are mostly average at best- the characters you meet are not that interesting or simply break immersion by being unbelievable (the drunks outside for example)- the interface is a bit of a chore to say the least.- sometimes the game will let you ""use"" an object through dialog and sometimes you got to drag it onto a person - the game is very inconcistent like that. Since you pick up loads of items, this can be very tedious if you get stuck- the game heavily relies on linearity - you need to find every single clue before it will continue which can be infuriating. A walkthrough is a must if you want to enjoy the game!- the music is not very appropriate a lot of the time and harms the immersion.- the Quiz requires every single answer to be correct and in two instances, I found that the question was confusing so I had to cheat.- Holmes is even more of a jerk than the books make him out to be - he's plainly rude half the time.Do I recommend this game? Just about but barely and only with a walkthrough. If you love murder mysteries, this is still a nice game if you can forgive its flaws ... .			"

												Before buying this game, be aware of these two things:1. If you have an unusual monitor resolution, the game's hot spots may be improperly synced, making it impossible to interact with things. I was only able to fix this by switching to a different monitor. I've only heard of one other person having this problem, however.2. There is a missable clue in the first chapter which breaks the game near the end. The game requires you to pick up all necessary clues before moving on except this glitched one. Consult a guide and save yourself the hours it'll take to start over.All in all, Silver Earring has taken a huge step from Mystery of the Mummy. The story, gameplay, controls, and voice acting are all vastly improved. This game marks where the series really began to capture the traditional Sherlock Holmes vibe. Unlike many mystery games where the protagonist seems to be a complete idiot, Holmes is always a step ahead without leaving the player feeling completely lost. The end-of-chapter quizzes really help to keep you up with the story, so you don't find yourself simply clicking around with no idea what's going on.Though the game is an overall improvement from it's predecessor, it does have its share of problems. The occasional typos and strange subtitles were more funny than annoying to me. The Action/Stealth sections can be a bit difficult as Holmes is not always easy to control, but with a few tries they can be mastered. For the most part, if you are forgiving of the game's age it will be easier to enjoy.			"

												I enjoyed this Sherlock game. It's a point and click title where you control Sherlock or Watson, hunting down clues to allow you to progress, hunting down evidence and questioning the npc characters. I liked the art style, and the general pacing of the mystery. At the end of each act you are given a little quiz to see if you have understood what Sherlock has discovered based on the evidence found, which I did find a little difficult, but the rest of the game is fine and fun to play.

												The leap between Mystery of the Mummy and The Silver Earring is pretty astounding.  The Mystery of the Mummy was predominately a first-person (as in Myst/Riven) adventure with low resolution textures.  Two years later with The Silver Earring, the game becomes a point and click adventure with respectably nice graphics.In this adventure, Holmes and Watson witness the murder of the host to a gun shot at a dinner party they were invited to but didn't see the shooter.  In fact no one saw the shooter, and it is up to Holmes and Watsons to gather testimonials, clues, and documents to solve the mystery.  Overall, it was a pleasant surprise.  The game looks largely pre-rendered, which meant the environment looks nice for such an old game, the trade-off being that people, who aren't pre-rendered, may be disproportionate in size to their surroundings.  For example, when Holmes stands next to a doorway, he might be much taller than it from one camera angle, but look perfectly fine in another.  My biggest gripe is that the controls can be clumsy when trying to control characters to move somewhere, being unresponsive at times unless the character is repositioned.Despite the problem, it's still worth a playthrough.  Every now and then, Holmes and Watson summarize their findings and you're quizzed with Yes or No questions.  For each answer, you have to justify your choice by selecting the appropriate evidence/testimonial.  While the game provides color-coded indicators for choosing testimonial, evidince, or documents, it's pretty cool that it requires you to actually keep up with reading the findings in order to progress through the game.  The game provides a database to look back on previous conversations and findings so a pen and paper is not needed to keep records yourself.This game is recommended on the note that the diminishing point is the clumsy controls.  On a last note, I played the game using DxWnd in order to put the game into windowed mode, which is not natively supported, otherwise the image will be stretched if you have a widescreen monitor.

												This should have been the first Holmes game by Frogwares.  It's a very standard PNC adventure, but here the puzzles make sense and the game politely doesn't let you continue if you've missed something.  Insofar as that goes, it's not unwinnable by design except for a small bug that you'll probably never encounter.While not particularly difficult, the worst bits are the two timed events and those are your only chances to prematurely lose the game. Other than that, it's great fun with some decent voice acting and the plot is full of the expected twists.  As a word of warning, the game does quiz you after each chapter to ensure you're paying attention.			"

												After the disappointing 'Sherlock Holmes Mummy' fiasco, 'The Silver Earring' takes sixteen leaps forward in creating a massively character-rich whodunnit. A lot of the classic Sherlock trademarks are here - opulant mansions, the evidence of the English class system, and shady characters create a great work for this story. Sherlock Holmes & Watson are given a lot to do and make no mistake this is a medium to high difficulty game. Hidden object, casual gamers, leave this one be for now. Puzzles are solvable, but need some lateral thinking, there are some timed puzzles, and probably the hardest aspect of the game is keeping on top of all the characters and plotlines to solve summary quizzes throughout the game. An achievement for NOT using a walkthrough should be somehow earned if you can do it. Finishing with one of the longest adventure game cutscenes in the history of gaming, The Silver Earring is a great next step in the Sherlock series of games that paves the way for the future releases. The game is hard, but satisfying :)			"

												Typical Sherlock game. Had lots of fun. Some of the cutscenes were a bit lenghty. Make sure to save in this game. There a few points where you will loose all progress if not saved.			"

												Among the oldest games in the Sherlock Holmes series, this is perhaps the most one closest to the spirit of the original books. A crime occurs and there is an obvious suspects that has the motive... but something doesn't fit. Go around the scenes and gather information that leads you towards solving the mystery. Collect clues, documents and testimonies and use them to find the correct answers to the questions that arise in relation to the crime.This game is very good, especially considering it's a bit old now. Its stronger part is the gameplay, while graphics and UI design leave something to be desired. Also, there are a few parts (e.g. the forest part) where you may lose, without a checkpoint and no autosaves, which means that if you didn't save shortly before, you are screwed. There are some other minor annoyances such as having to remove the quickbar (can be done with a single button press), in order to go to the previous area or find a clue. Although there are better options out there, this is a nice piece of game that you won't regret getting if you are out of detective games to play.			"

												If you enjoy point and click puzzle games, this game is really not bad. However I had a lot of issues with the mechanics of the game, rather than the story itself. It is not always clear where you can move, what you can click, and the change of point of view is sometimes rather clunky. It is not an overly hard game, but sometimes I'd just be frustrated with the unclear mechanics and look up the solution. The positive side is the plot line - it is engaging and you want to find out more. I purchased several Sherlock games as a bundle, and I am going through them chronologically (this is the first one), so I am hoping that the issues that I've had are solved in the later games!			"

												Surprisingly good for its age. My greatest fear was that the puzzles would be too difficult and require a Holmesian intellect, but this is not the case. The game provides you with all the material you need in order to answer the questions it gives you, while the super heavy lifting is done by Holmes himself. Also of note is the excellent classical music in the background, and the impeccable renditions of luxurious English mansions that you can find in few other games.The enjoyment is only marred by two dreadfully designed episodes: a stealth sequence wherein the rules for discovery are unclear and your motion is very clunky; and another is a timed jog through a confusing maze of pathways. Again I am surprised by how slowly Holmes moves even when running. I guess all that cocaine has not done his health any wonders.			"
