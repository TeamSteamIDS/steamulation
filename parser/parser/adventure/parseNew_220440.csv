												Note: I've mostly played on a friend's copy, so my Steam hours are quite little here.Scrolling through the Steam reviews, there are two things I've noticed.Nearly all newcomers to the Devil May Cry games think this is a good game.Nearly all Devil May Cry veterans ridicule, scorn and decry this game as an insult to the franchise.Personally, I've played through (all the difficulties of) DMC3, and one playthrough of DMC4 (fell short of expectations), both on the PC. DMC3's difficulty was fiendishly difficult and the combat intricate, DMC4's Nero was not really interesting to play as (though Dante was decent).Then I came to DmC. Threw myself into Nephilim (hard) difficulty at once, and could cope rather well (except with those Rages, argh). So, the veterans are right on one count, that the difficulty has been watered down significantly.(EDIT: I have played through all difficulties on my friend's copy, and Dante Must Die mode wasn't even as hard as Son of Sparda on DMC3.)But the gameplay itself is fun, mainly because of the PC-port controls which are pretty decent (as PC ports go). One gripe I have with DMC3/4 is that the PC controls are awkward and clunky as opposed to DmC's. Combos and such were far easier to pull off with DmC's controls, and combat felt smooth.Story-wise, I actually prefer DmC.Stow thy pitchforks and hear me out.In DMC3, you have a brash, young man who has an unexplained grudge with his twin brother, who raised a gigantic pillar/castle/machine down the street from his shop. Said gigantic pillar/castle/machine was to be used to open a portal to the Demon World, and Dante set off to meet and fight his brother following a rather violent invitation. Dante proceeds to slaughter his way past tons of demons, deals with a backstabbing secondary antagonist and clashes with his brother several times before culminating in a battle in the Demon World itself. He realizes that he actually does care somewhat about his brother.In DMC4, you have a brash young man who has an unexplained glowing demon-like arm, who arrives late to church, listens to music during a sermon and tries to leave the ceremony before a mysterious man appears and assassinates the head priest. Demons start popping up everywhere, and Nero begins his journey to track down the assassin, finding out that the church isn't as saintly as he thought, and eventually has his love interest kidnapped by the church. He then tries to save her, willing to kill all the demons and church members in his way.In DmC, you have a brash young man who doesn't give a used fig about anything other than himself. A girl shows up, warning him about demons who have found his tracks, and manages to defeat said demons with the help of the girl. He still doesn't trust her, but gives her the benefit of the doubt, following her to her headquarters where he meets her boss, who happens to be his twin brother. He slowly finds out things about his past by a visit to his old home, and helps his brother's terrorist organization bring down the demons who are behind humanity's unknowing enslavement. Along the way, he begins to care for both his brother and the girl who helped him, moreso than his brother realizes. After they successfully defeat the Demon King, they have differing opinions and go their separate ways.Plot-wise, DmC's is far more complex than DMC3/4.In 3, you have an enemy castle. Go in, kill everything, deal with a secondary antagonist who obviously was going to betray everyone, and fight the predictable final boss in the form of your twin brother.In 4, you have demons and a mysterious assassin, and you kill everything while hunting for the assassin. Then your girlfriend is kidnapped, and the people responsible for it are the ones who gave you your mission. Revenge, save your girlfriend, etc. etc. In DmC, there is actual character growth (only in Dante, admittedly [and to an extension, the girl]), where you have demons hunting you down, an actual backstory and a motivation to hunt down the demons themselves that goes beyond 'I have your girlfriend come and get her >:)' or sibling rivalry. Music-wise, I was initially apprehensive of the song choice. Dubstep/electronica is NOT my kind of thing. But as I played, I found that the pulse-pounding beats actually suited the combat very well, especially one boss fight in a strip club against a baby (no, really).Visually, I find the over-the-top displays of Limbo tearing into the real world really interesting, as how even the city itself swears at Dante alters to impede his progress. The enemies are quite varied too, with the grunt 'Stygians', the 'Knight'-class mooks, beautiful yet deceitful 'Witch' and brutish 'Tyrant', and cool, teleporting, dual-katana-wielding ninjas to name a few.You may disagree with me; feel free! This is merely my opinion, and if it does not sway yours, that's your call.As a conclusion/TL;DR, I would like to make one thing very clear.Though this is a Devil May Cry game, go into it as if you were going to play a completely different hack-and-slash game. An open mind works wonders.(This is the same for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, for veterans of Metal Gear)			"

""You are Dante, nothing more, nothing less""-KatDmC: Devil May Cry, fifth game in the series, is really unique. Unlike the other games, this one was created by british developers, not japanese. You can see it when you compare it to DmC4 - Dante isn't that cool anime guy anymore - he looks more like emo kid that disrespects everything in the beginning. Vergil looks more like in DmC4, but still, he looks younger. The another difference - gameplay style. You fight against hordes of demons, while you would be happy If you have beaten 5 enemies in DmC4. And I could compare here more things...The main plot hasn't changed, it wouldn't be a DmC anymore. Dante and Vergil, children of extraordinary parents, fight against demon king Mundus. But both of them has different opinions what will happen if they'll suceed.Things I like:+Combat style+Weapon arsenal, angelic and demonic weapons (Sword, guns, gauntlets, sickle and more...)+Good story+7 difficulty levels (very challenging)+Combo unlocking+Jokes+The way Dante changes during the story from disrecpectful kid to kind manThings that didn't seem satisfying to me:-Short story-Some fights are boringAlso, there is a DLC called ""Vergils Downfall"" - It explains what happened after the ending and gives you Vergil as playable character8/10 ""In the end, we are all satisfyed, and you are set free""			"

												The Devil May Cry franchise has long been one of my favorites. The games hold a special place in my heart and memory, they were the most cathartic way to get rid of frustration and anger in my angst-filled teen years. Now even as an adult I enjoy popping in one of the originals and battling demons for an hour or two with the wise-cracking Dante. I was in love with the story, riddled with holes as it was, and helplessly in love with Dante.Upon hearing that the current DMC universe was being abandoned you could not find anyone else more upset about it than I was. I was angry and felt betrayed by Capcom, who were cutting short a story I had spent years in. The new Dante character design was bad, his attitude was at best childish. Stubborn as I am, months turned into a year and I began to realize that change was indeed needed. Ninja Theory seemed to be at least listening to what the fans were saying and with the release of the first player footage my mind began to slowly turn from general hatred of the game to feeling that maybe it would not be so bad.I personally feel this game to be somewhat of a prequel to DMC3. There's a lot of interaction between the brothers in this game. And in the end I believe is the reason vergil despises his brother dante in the classics. Now the game revolves around propaganda and a group of revolties. Very similar to the antics of V of V for Vendetta. Mundus makes an appearance as once again the antagonist of the game. They even gave him the 3 eyes just like his DMC1 counterpart as a reference. If you played DMC1 than you know Mundu's wants to rule the world and our hero has to stop him, but it's more than that. All this little things really help build up the story till the very end. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that.The gameplay is awesome, very smooth transitions from the sword swings. You only get around 7 weapons, 3 guns, 2 angel, 2 demon weapons which is a downer for us who like to have more in our arsenal. If you are expecting dante to give us a little exhibition like he did in DMC3 when he acquires new gear than think again. Now for the DT (Devil Trigger), you do more damage, are faster, get white hair and a vibrant red coat. To me it's not as cool as the other DMCs but again this is a reboot so it's expected.The sound for the most part is pretty much what you would expect. Voice acting is top notch, music is metal and screamo. It's alright imo.There are a few little things that could have been done better, but when it comes down to what's important, the game was extremely fun. Alot of negative comments have been said about this game, even before it was released, but I say that if you have been a fan of this franchise or good games in general, give this game a chance. This new Dante isn't emo, and even though he appears to be much different than the Dante of old, he really isn't. If Capcom decides to make a Devil May Cry 5, that'd be great, but I personally hope for a DMC sequel. Ninja Theory has crafted their best game yet, and I can't wait for what comes next.			"

												As far as the gameplay, DmC at least manages this part in a way that reveals the heritage of the series and yet the overall depth of the fighting system is quickly revealed to be paper thin.In a field now populated by competitive titles such as Ninja Gaiden ( not including III) Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, Bayonetta, and others who dare to push the edge of 3rd person hack n slash in various directions, DmC remains strong in it's ability to provide an entertaining playfield for beating monsters senseless. This is accomplished mainly through the addition of a grappling chain taken almost straight off of Nero's mysteriously unexplained arm in Devil 4.  Unfortunately, the combo system is somewhat limited in scope. Sadly, a decently built combat system does very little to dress up the glaring flaws present within this game.After playing through the game on the hardest initial setting, the incentive to return and replay is very small as the range of potential enemies to combat is almost as limited as the weapon options you are provided. Difficulty is measured by increasing numbers rather than by the skill of the opponents unfortunately.From a story perspective, DmC falls into the trap of cliche that numerous hollywood movies and games have also been victim of recently. The main character of Dante is a stereotypical rebellious jock / punk teenager who has enough power to ignore the expectations of society and so chooses to live a hedonistic existence and cares only about satisfying himself. Rather than the calm, intelligent and slightly crazy demon hunter that has been presented in the original series, Dante is here presented as a hotheaded brat whose intelligence is often mocked by those around him and whose only interest is in serving his own interests. In short, this new Dante is representative of the common college frat boy or high school sports jock mixed with enough rebel punk to attempt to appeal to both crowds without truly identifying himself to either.While the supporting cast makes an effort to increase interest in the overall story, an element of the game that has supposedly been more heavily emphasized during this reboot, they add hardly any appeal overall. Truthfully, only one or two secenes through the game and the ending scene posses any real depth or character development or even intrigue to draw you in. From a graphics perspective, you can immediately tell the game is a console port, with limited graphical tweaking available and a bland, washed out color palette that will instantly have you wondering what happened to direct x 11 effects. In some cases players may even begin remembering the blurry days of the first Gears of War and Unreal Tournament 3. In almost every respect Devil May Cry 4 has a crisper, better looking graphics engine than this game does.All in all I would strongly reccomend Castlevania: Lords of Shadow over this title in almost every aspect but especially in regards to storytelling and artwork.

												Being a nephilim with the destiny of killing the Demon King is a dangerous way to live storywise, but gameplaywise it’s fun, brutal and stylish. Fans of the original series should look at this game as a prequel, after all, the main characters are different at first, but in the end they are the characters old fans loved or loved to hate. That said, this game is a good way to introduce new fans to the franchise, even though some things won’t be the same, like some plot details and the gameplay.

This is the story of the rise of Dante, from being a junkie that has supernatural potential but decides to use it to fool around to the demon hunter, protector of humanity. He fights in a world where a Demon King controls humans through debt, who controls the mass media and has a line of products that gets its consumers docile. Dante is introduced to the truth, by his brother, Vergil, the leader of an organization that seeks to free the world by killing the demons that enthrall it and by merging the human world with Limbo, the surreal place where you’ll face your opponents and whatever the environment changes.

The gameplay is what makes the game shine. There is a variety of moves to take down a variety of monsters. Combining heavy with light attacks followed by ranged attack, then pulling some other poor victim with a red chain to do your personal pattern on him is your fun and their bane. Three ranged weapons and three swords, along with the characters abilities is enough to make you love killing demons and enough to make you replay the game just to get all the moves.  Aside from the standard powers, the angelic and demonic ones are what make you feel most in control, by using the former to get to the enemies and for crowd control, and the later to pull them to you and deliver them heavy blows.  There are many types of difficulties; while the typical three are present(easy, normal, hard), after completing the game you’ll have a harder mode that serves as a new game plus, followed by one where everyone(including you) dies from one hit and the last one, where only you die from one hit, difficulties that present another reason to replay the game for those who enjoy the combat or hunt for achievments.

There are keys in secret places that open specific doors in the game, doors that lead you to secret levels, which can be challenging, depending on their tier. Aside from keys, there are lost souls that need to be killed for the sake of being a completitionist. This is one of those games I wished I’d bought earlier, because it was definitely worth the price. It’s entertaining, stylish and the story, although it seems to be made for the teen audience, is engaging and by the end of the game, you’ll know it’s a memorable game "

												DmC Devil May Cry is an action-adventure, hack and slash hailing all the way from the brainchilds of Ninja Theory. Being the fifth installment into the series, yet serving as a reboot, this game received a wide, negative reception from those who are bound tightly around the original series, due to the strong character and story re-telling. Either way, I'm not one of those fans, as I accept this game immensely and greet it as its own beautiful reimagination.The game's protagonist, Dante; a young, rebellious and hot-headed nephilim, (A hybrid of angel and demon.) who has no memory of the haunting and rather unfortunate past that had happened to him quite a while back. After a heavy night of clubbing, excessive drinking and rough sex, Dante awakens the next day with a hangover and is briefly warned by a young, psychic woman named Kat who hastefully warns Dante in her own words, that ''the demons are after him.'' Speaking of the devil, Dante is subsequently fazed into 'Limbo', a place where the demons are present, powerful and crave Dante's blood. After a few ruthless scenes of both unraveling family revelations and major story plots, you pair up with the twin brother-nephilim you never thought you had, and with his intelligence and propaganda sophistication along with Kat's strong knowledge of Wiccan spells, they'll lead Dante to plunge deep into Limbo and face off a number of demonic threats such as a roundabout circus fight with the baboon-faced Hunter. Taking down a Succubus, who's main job consists of human control through producing the world's most popular soft drink, firing off a middle-aged demon puppet of a TV reporter, and even having to dance with the devil's mistress and their demonic spawn. All of this will depend on the ultimate test of encountering the all-powerful demon king, Mundus. Or Kyle Ryder, if you're wanting to know his human-form alias.The game's engine is near to being absolutely perfect and intense. Playing the role of Dante, you have a strong and calculative arsenal; such as performing combos by the slice of his sword, Rebellion. Keep the enemies stunned and juggling with his twin, ammoless pistols, Ebony & Ivory. As you progress through the story, you are granted more weapons, each with their own abilities and strategic modes. New to the series, has got to be the inclusion of the Devil Mode and Angel Mode. Dante's sword attacks change to the Osiris, a speedy, long-ranged scythe type weapon, whilst Devil mode uses the slower but more powerful Arbiter. These modes also alter Dante's mobility. Using Angel mode allows Dante to pull himself towards enemies and various points in each level, whilst Devil mode lets Dante pull enemies and objects towards him. With all of this aside, there are still a few more weapons to discover, but I'll leave the unaware player to discover.It's all worthy to note and check out this games DLC, Vergil's Downfall, which allows you to play as Vergil, in his own side story, which just adds fuel to the fire of satisfying those fans who crave more. I would definitely recommend getting this game around the time everything is on a special deal, as it's only worth buying at that time.The only thing that I find a problem with this game is the fact that the game lacks a lock-on mechanic, which all previous Devil May Cry games had at it's disposal. You only lock on a specific target automatically, depending on the third person camera angle as well as being in the correct vicinity, as you can fire your guns at targets from quite a mile away if you're standing in the right place. But this also adds to some few minor problems, such as glitching out if you accidently latched onto a target, while a short cutscene is playing.As a massive fan of the previous, original Devil May Cry games, I still consider this reboot a new step in the right direction as well as a new breathe of fresh air. Negatively looked down upon fans of the original series, due to the story flaws and late and contrasted character development, aswell the differences it has when compared to the original Devil May Cry games that fans cherish so much, Capcom gave their development rights to Ninja Theory for the correct reason; Their originality is absolutely sensational and I have every right to say that Ninja Theory delivers. I honestly prefer this game's visual style, as it's much more surreal, hollow and darker than the previous 'Anime'-esque originals, not saying I hate the originals, as I love them equally to this reboot, but in a different way. By all means, this game is both for the casual and intense gamer, so it's a win-win situation. It's a massive recommendation from me, to everyone.			"

												I want to start off by saying that I completely understand why fans of the old Devil May Cry franchise don't like this game. And let me follow that up with reminding people that this is a WESTERN RE-IMAGINING OF A JAPANESE GAME, thus things will change including character motivations and designs.If you look at this game as EXACTLY what it is (Re-imagining) and NOT what people want it to be (apples-to-apples remake and/or sequel/prequel), you will find that while it does have it's faults, it's still a good game. Gameplay while easier than the original, is much more fast-paced and still presents it's share of challenges. Story admittedly isn't terribly deep, but I kind of found the idea of the world interesting and while the satire of American cultural ideas is anything but subtle, it is satisfying to play with the idea that some of the things wrong with the country are headed by demonic powers and thus correct them in an over-the-top way.Lastly, I want to say that with some of the things people seemed to have lost their mind over (namely a very short cutscene in the first level), I want to say to them FINISH THE GAME. Dante changes throughout the game, growing as most young people do. In the end, I could sum up almost all complaints about this game as being a over-blown case of ""Judging a Book by it's Cover"". Do I reccomend this game to new fans of the franchise? Yes. Do I reccomend it to old fans of the franchise? Yes, if you're willing to see what this game is, rather than what it isn't.			"

Before all else; a workaround: IF YOUR GAME LOCKS UP, TURN OFF THE TUTORIAL, then reload from the last checkpoint. You can always turn the tutorial back on afterwards.*EDITED FOR LENGTH*  To see the full review, check it out on my forum (if you know where it is ;)Personally speaking, I was a bit put off by the intro... OK, a lot. This world of excess and corruption disturbed me, and I wasn't sure that I would be able to stomach the game. Happily, there's only one other scene in the game that really bothered me.  As a side note, I L-O-V-E-D the sequence where Dante was ""getting dressed."" SO funny! Should I link it? Oh yes, I must!


YouTube™ Video: DMC Devil May Cry-How Dante dress up 

			Views: 4,707		

			I can't find this scene from the game anywhere so i uploaded :D hopefully it doesn't get remove by copyrighted nonsensesxD		

So if you watched that video above, you might have noticed three things:- Language (there is a LOT of cursing... Oh, and innuendo... and disgusting imagery sometimes, too)- Psychedelic lighting (Seizure warning! There are a lot of locations without it, but one in particular is INTENSE)- Grunge (Oh yes, that music is peppered throughout the game)The primary thrust of the game is the combat. There's definitely more to it, but I'll come back to that in a bit. You can slice, you can dice, you can absolutely pulverize your enemies in the most stylish ways imaginable. I'm not being flippant; this game truly has some of the most beautiful battle mechanics I've ever seen in a game. I cannot imagine how the game could be played without a controller, as there are so many moves and combos that I'll only touch on them here. I gathered from the intro that two of Dante's weapons are standard: His sword, Rebellion, and his guns, Ebony and Ivory. In addition, there is also a demon axe, an angel scythe, a gauntlet, a pair of shurikan-type weapons, a shotgun, and more! You're not limited to one or two weapons at a time, no no. You can switch between them at a touch of a button (or several :p), and ALL of them have multiple upgrades!So how do these upgrades work? I'm glad you asked!Every time you defeat an enemy or take out possessed scenery (like lampposts, motorcycles, etc), you will get red orbs, which are used to buy items such as health stars, gold orbs (to revive if you've died -- won't lose progress in the fight if you use these), health crosses. TIP: This isn't an RPG, so if you want to increase your maximum health, save up for the health crosses! They increase your maximum by 10%!Green orbs renew a portion of your health, and can be obtained from green pods and killing enemies (though you won't see them very often.)White orbs come from slaying enemies and by completing levels. Each level is scored, so to speak, and gives you a white orb bonus based on the total points you've accumulated during the level. These orbs are used to purchase ability upgrades, both for yourself and for your weapons.There are two ways to access the shop & upgrades: Through the menu between levels, or by finding Divinity Statues during gameplay. Here you can not only upgrade and buy items, but you can also practice your moves... You can even try out new abilities before upgrading! Not only that, but unlike other games I've played, the upgrades are not permanent... If you decide that you'd rather put that upgrade point somewhere else, just take it off and reassign it; it's that easy~During each level there are multiple items to look for. Finding them will not only give you more orbs, but will also earn you some achievements and increase your level score. Things to look for:Lost Souls - Destroy them to release their soulsKeys - There are multiple kinds to look for: Gold, Copper, Ivory, and Argent.Secret Doors - You'll need one of the hidden keys to unlock its corresponding door (ie. copper key for copper door.) Behind each door you'll find a secret mission, which will gain you orbs, extra combat, and achievement progress.There are 58 Achievements to be had, ranging from things as simple as acquiring new weapons to completing the game on the hardest difficulty.The story, while not earth shattering, was very enjoyable, and the cutscenes are just beautiful (although not all of the content was! lol~) Our character Dante is cocky, but somehow lovable, whereas the antagonist is not just evil, but manages to evoke the purest disgust possible. *shudder*If you're looking for a game of exploration and discovery, you'll find some here, but if you're looking for some righteous, kick♥♥♥♥♥combat, Congratulations! You've just hit the jackpot!			"

												The story is atrocious and tries too hard to be edgy and the combat somehow manages to be less deep than the first Devil May Cry title which came out over a decade ago, yet somehow it manages to be fun only because of how terrible almost every melee action game is.Get it when it's u$20 or less, or if you have an Xbox 360 do yourself a favor and get Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising Revengeance (Update: MGRR is now on Steam, BUY IT) which are games with way more depth and less pretentiousness. If you don't have a console then get Devil May Cry 4 (DmC: Devil May Cry is a reboot of the series) since mechanically that's an objectively better game than this one.			"

												As a standalone action game, it's alright. It's flashy, combat is decent although seems kind of slow paced and awkward at times, and the game makes you feel cool. The level design is probably the best thing about this game; some of the environment aesthetics and boss fights left me thinking 'this is pretty awesome'.As a Devil May Cry game, DmC doesn't hold up to it's predecessors. I understand it's supposed to be a reboot, but they took away so much from the original series it hurts. The fact that certain enemies can only be killed with certain weapons is disheartening. Switching between weapons was very fluid, I'll give it that, but the weapons coolness factor was undermined by a very small moveset compared to the previous DMC games (style moves, I'm looking at you). Granted Devil May Cry games are not known for their plot or writing, but DmC's is just atrocious. I found the new Dante's favoritism of swear words and punk attitude a little overbearing and annoying when compared to the old Dante's cocky, happy-go-lucky overall badassery. All in all, I give the game a solid ♥♥♥♥ YOU/10.Play the other DMC games instead, except 2.			"

 Disclaimer: This is the first Devil May Cry game I have ever played. I will review this game without any comparison to the older titles.  Plot  – The game is a total reboot, retelling the story of Dante whom is a Nephilim; half-angel and half-demon. It is set in a modern-day city controlled by all-powerful demons, manipulating humanity through a parallel plane called Limbo. And being a Nephilim, Dante is being hunted down by the demons who believe that he is the only one who can defeat the Demon King, Mundus. With the help of his long lost brother, Vergil, and a human with ability to see through Limbo, Kat, they take on a quest to end the Mundus’ reign over humans. Gameplay  – You have the Rebellion, Dante’s trademark sword and his trusty high caliber twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory. In addition to these, the game showcases the ability for you to switch to Angel Mode or Devil Mode, modifying the weapon you are holding. For the Angel Mode, you have the Osiris, a speedy scythe weapon and the Aquila, a shuriken-like weapon. While in Devil Mode, you get the Arbiter, a huge axe that deals huge damage and the Eryx, a set of gauntlets that can charged up for greater effect. For the two additional firearms, you have the Revenant, a powerful shotgun which will be useful for clearing crowds on a closer range and then the Kablooey, firing explosive needles that stick to the enemies and detonates at your dispose. Featuring five (5) different melee weapons and three (3) different firearms, players are bound to get massive combos to finish off the enemies thrown at them.The game also offers different types of enemies that will surely give you a challenge and test your ability to the fullest on harder difficulties. Environment and Design  –  The design of Limbo is what I find interesting from start of the game. How the world transition from a modern-world into a demonic scene is something that I don’t see often, and I like it for a change. The environment are well made, the cutscenes are entertaining to watch. I also think that the soundtrack of this game is awesome, especially when you’re on a combo, somehow it goes with the beat and that really keeps me hyped up.  Controls  –I started playing this game using a keyboard & mouse, and then switched to a controller when I finally bought a new one. And personally, I think this game is best played on controllers as you’ll be able to hold the button for either Angel Mode or Devil Mode, making it easier to deal damage in many different ways. Though I had tons of entertainment slashing my way through enemies, there is one thing that ticks me off, and that is the camera angles. Almost all the time, the camera is lowered to the level of Dante’s back, making it harder for me to anticipate whether the enemy behind me is about to attack or not. And this problem got me killed a few times.   Conclusion  – Being the first Devil May Cry game that I played and completed my entire life, I would say I had a great time even though the story is quite short. But if you are a hardcore gamer and a huge fan of the franchise, I think you’ll enjoy the different difficulties this game has. Or whether you’re basically a fan of hack-and-slash games, then this game is a must try atleast.  "

												DMC: Devil May CryRating 9/10Overview: Third Person Action The Good:+ Great use of colors and effects, making the world feel unique+ Well put together story told through multiple cutscenes inbetween missions. + The combat is focused on creating combos and varying up your attacks to keep your combo meter high. With the ability to change weapons mid combo, you have plenty of variety and techniques to keep the combat engaging. Its easy to learn but hard to master. + Plenty of enemy types and weapons that will force you to use many different tactics to win. Relying on a single weapon or combo will get you killed pretty easily.  + Levels design and pacing is superb. Every level either introudces a new enemy or a new weapon to try out. Every level feels distinct and different from the last+ Great Boss Battles + Bonus/secret missions to test your combat abilities + Different difficulty levels that vary up the rules/enemies (unfortunately you have to beat the game multiple times to collect the achievements) + SoundtrackThe Average:The game was designed around a controller. Depending on your view of DMC, you may not like the new look of characters. The Bad:- must complete game 6 times to get all achievementsConclusion:Personally, I loved this game as it was incredibly well done and polished.   "

												FYI - I have never played any other DmC game, so my experience is without any background from the previous games.This game is so beautiful. It's like a walking screenshot. Every single scene, every single demon looks terrific. In the first 20 minutes I made 39 screenshots. When I finished the game the number of screenshots was 529. That's how beautiful and scenic this game is.Apart from the visuals, great animations, great combat fluidity (holy♥♥♥♥♥♥everything is so smooth!), this game has awesome soundtrack and ambient sounds too. You get a full package of great visual and sound experience.The story itself is... OK. Nothing unexpected and nothing mindblowing, but decent enough for an action game.I like how simply you can switch between different weapons during the combat without breaking the immersion.But this game has some flaws too.The camera angles is just soooo frustrating sometimes. It forces you to look where it wants not where you want. You just feel the resistance when you want to have a look around while moving the mouse. I accidently jumped of the cliff more than a handful of times because of this.I really dislike the approach of forced replayability. Sometimes you can't reach something, break something or open a door just because you don't have the tools yet. Sometimes you get those tools only several missions later. And I really hate when games do stuff like this. I just want to play a mission and have the access to everything without worrying about the ""locked"" content. [I finished the game and I'm really not interested to go back and replay the missions just to open a few doors in order to play some challenges]. It's just not worth your time (unless you really enjoy it...).One mission is like a copy/paste of Mad Moxxi's Underdome DLC from the first Borderlands. Just too many similarities. But I liked it. it was pretty well done.Overall, the gameplay feels very segmented: Kill a few waves of monsters, then a few segments of climbing and jumping around. Rinse and repeat. Everytime you see an open area, you can expect a 2-3 demon waves with some strong big♥♥♥♥♥demon at the end. It's always like this. It gets old by the end of the game.But I enjoyed DmC: Devil May Cry. Main story line is about ~13h long and the dlc is ~2h long.Oh, as for DLC (Vergil's Downfall) - it's very shallow and soulless, but at least the action is even more for fast paced than in the main game.

												To newbies, DmC: Devil May Cry supposedly to be a direct sequel to Devil May Cry 4 from the Devil May Cry original series, but the developers decided to reboot the game. To be honest, the past Devil May Cry/s were dark and scary. I remember, when I was still 10, I played the first Devil May Cry on my ps2 and it scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. Whenever I played that game, hairs all over my body started to stand and my heart raced. I don't know if the game was horror, but to me, it was. And there, I found my childhood crush, Vergil. To me, Vergil was cooler than Dante.DmC: Devil May Cry is a totally new game. It's not that dark anymore compare to the original series but it still has it's (dark?) humor. I finished the main story on my ps3 in 18 hours, now, I finished it within 10 hours. Talk about short. Still has the repetitive gameplay and fighting styles and collecting the must collect to achieve that ""SSS"" rank. Though it's the same gameplay from the original series, but it became your typical hack and slash game that's easy to finish.In this reboot, they added new female companion, Kat. Dante and Vergil has a new look and started to be really close within the story until the last. The redesign of both two main characters were actually spot on. Dante became rougher and Vergil became more sleeker.Overall, I like it. 8/10			"

												I hate seeing the amount of people complaining about this game not being a true Devil May Cry.I've played every DMC since the 2nd on consoles, they're all great, they're fun, the stories are cool, and so is the gameplay, but this game might be even better than the others because it's a bit more simple and a different approach to the story. Really entertaining and fun game, very cool story that I don't want to spoil, great characters and great fights, maybe a bit lackluster in the amount of different enemies, but it's alright. It's a very fun game, a good Devil May Cry, and a different approach to what the saga is, it feels more like a spin-off.Honestly, if you liked any Devil May Cry, you will like this game, maybe not as much but it'll still be a great experience for you. Don't think it twice.			"

												Simply a breath of fresh air.I had some money to buy some games as the Capcom publisher sale was on and I stumbled upon this and the reviews seemed decent and I was ready for a break from money sapping microtransaction bulls**t FPS games not hinting any particular ones...I brought this game expecting another decent DmC game but I was not expecting to fall in love so much. In my opinion this game is next to formiddable. The unique style of the bosses and learning new weapons, combos and weaknessess of enemies keeps the ball rolling. Oddly I found myself quite invested in the characters too. You have a new style for Dante which somehow I have come to adore and a string of likeable and dislikeable characters all for good reasons. Nice refreshing fast paced combat tied in with discovering new foes and being told a fantastic origin story of the protagonist. I must say the Second level is slightly repetitive and if you find yourself buying this game and find that too; give it another chance and it WILL win you over. I find it hard to tell whether I love the story more, the combat, the bosses or the characters. This game is a must-buy if you have played any combat games and want a challenging yet story-gripping, single-player experience. Amazing game. Proof that Capcom still have what it takes to win us over. Good Job Capcom.			"

												DMC gets the world building right. The level design is truly excellent. Inspired. Different. Likewise, the writing is solid. Its not world changing, but compared to other video games, its pretty good. The characters are intriguing and the satire is obvious enough to be appreciated whilst not so heavy as to ruin the tale.Pity then, that while this game makes major improvements to DMC's world and characters, is does absolutely NOTHING innnovative in terms of game play.Everything you expect from a typical brawler is here. Gradually escalating enemies, in both number and the tedium involved in defeating them. Gimmicky bosses and mini-bosses whose continued reappearance as part of later waves goes from challenging to annoying with a speed that is mind numbing. Cumbersome and tedious platforming sections that far overstay their welcome, and crop up far, far too often to be fun. Tell me, if the only thing I lose when falling from a platform is tiny bit of health, WHY BOTHER with the platforming AT ALL? It's never been fun in these games, and that has not changed here.DMC tries. It really does. It has all the marks of a developer determined to do something new, relevant and different - constrained by a Publisher terrified of making even one single, meaningful change to what has become the brawler's too-formulaic design. As is typical of brawlers, the first few levels are fun, with single bosses and mini-bosses and relatively simple platforming. As things ramp up and the mini-bosses are combined as repeating waves while the platforming sections become longer and more complex, the fun fades fast.My recommendation: Check out the cutscenes and ending on line. This would have made a fantastic movie. Pity then, that it ends up making mostly a terrible game, in the end.			"

												DmC: Devil May Cry is shameless. It takes a once great character action franchise and dumbs it down for the lowest common denominator. Not only is DmC willing to destroy the foundations that had brought the series the recognition that it had, but it's willing to insult its old fanbase over and over again.DmC's story and writing are laughably bad, almost as if a prepubescent boy had written it while reading Playboy magazines. The game can never decide whether it was to be taken seriously or not, and the shifts of tone are always jarring.Combat has been dumbed down significantly. No longer are you required to know your enemies and manage the way you maneuver your character; instead, the game very ""kindly"" maps all of your directionally sensitive inputs to seperate buttons. Instead of having to push the analog stick (on a controller) in the opposite direction of an enemy to send him to the skies, all you have to do is push the B button. Not only that, but almost all of Dante's moves can be dodge cancelled, which means you no longer have to think about whether a certain combo or move is going to land you in trouble at th wrong time. Just keep mashing the Y button until you win, and if you get into trouble, just keep mashing Y (because then you might parry them with the MASSIVE parry window you have), or just hit LB to simply dodge out of the way.The music is garbage. It's dubsteppy nonsense mixed with guitar playing that is akin to that of a mouse climbing up and down a fretboard while a man slaps some strings. Nothing is memorable about the game's soundtrack.Probably the only good thing about the game is its visual style and graphics. The colors really pop and the environments are pretty creative, even if the level design is lazy. They might've just taken a few islands and strung them together to make the world feel big, but at least it looks pretty while you're running around. The character models don't share the same positive light, however. Everyone looks like a big man-baby, and it's ridiculous. Overall, DmC is a game you should avoid. Please, do not pay for this game. Borrow it or share it from a friend, if you REALLY have to.			"

												Other than the complete travesty of Dante, this game is really damn fun. Story and characters wise, every character other than the two sons of Sparda are really damn cool. Enemies, bosses, ♥♥♥♥ing outstanding in my opinion and it goes so well with the refined combat system. You have weapons, Demon and Angel, alongside your usual Rebellion and Ebony & Ivory. Demon weapons give you a slow, damage based attack and the angel doing the opposite. With these comes the enemies that require you to use a specific type, and will deflect your other attacks. That is generic, sure, but with the DMC combat system its just another fun addition to think of when fighting and makes getting those SSS combos that little more tricky.Level design is where this game really stands out, each and every location is full of nicely designed platforming (compared to other DMC games it works well here) and extremely stylized visuals.Personally, I'd give it a 8/10. The game itself is highly enjoyable, the new Dante is a bit annoying as he doesn't have the charm of the original, but the game more than makes up for that with the combat, super fun bosses and beautiful levels.

												DmC Devil May Cry is a reboot of the popular Japanese Devil May Cry series. Fans of the series will feel for sure since the first moment that the game feels different - DmC Devil May Cry is made by British studio Ninja Theory, only published by Capcom. Is that a big damage for whole series? While I've seen many angry DMC fans, I don't think so.The story feels really cheesy and you can't expect anything specially entertaining from it. The main character, Dante, makes this fact even worse, since developers made Dante a stereotypical teenager with badass powers who is there just to kill every bad guy and say a gag, in good old Duke Nukem style.At this part, I believe, many people would consider DmC being a trash compared to other games but that would be wrong. The game actually offers a great gameplay mechanics, combining many types of weapons and motivating players to swap weapons few times per fight. With balanced difficulty you can expect getting into flow state without problems, enjoying variable combat styles. Controls felt good with Xbox 360 controller, it was a new key combination set for me but I got into it quickly without any problems.Though levels are mostly linear, you will get opportunity to find secrets (and secret challenge levels) in every level. Some of secrets are not accessible for the first play, to give the game a replayability for achievement hunters. Environment of the game is beautiful, there's many places that will make you stop and just look around how beautiful it is. The soundtrack might ruin the atmosphere of the game for some people because it's mostly in electronic/metal mainstream music (something between Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie) to increase the action parts impression.Overall, if you don't mind the cheesy story and teenage brat Dante, you'll get a portion of good gameplay for about 10 hours (per playthrough) that you'll enjoy.

												This is my first time playing a Devil May Cry game, with this being what introduced me to the series. Having never played any of the previous games in the series, all I knew was this being a hack and slash game and that it was a reboot of the series. I know this game received a lot of hate when it was initially released, because of it being a reboot, having a brand new Dante, and that sort of stuff. My review can't really speak on that as I haven't played any of the other games in the series. So my review will be based solely on this game itself and my experience with it. That said, I can definitely say I really enjoyed this game and had a lot of fun with it. The soundtrack is a pretty wild one, with some crazy music, but it definitely suits the atmosphere of the game and makes the battles and fights rather exciting. The atmosphere of the game was really great, as it didn't take long for me to be immersed into the world of Devil May Cry. From the level designs to the art style of the game, Devil May Cry's visuals definitely impressed me and just added to the amount of fun I was already having with the game. It also further impressed me as well. The fights themselves are smooth and fast-paced, with the music just really adding a lot to the fights. It definitely got me really into the fights. There's also a lot of stuff to do in the game as well. The main game consists of 20 missions, but it's more than that. There's lots of collectibles, side missions, and more. With storyline, I thought it was pretty good for a hack and slash adventure-action game, It definitely kept me interested until the end, and even wanting more. Fingers crossed that this game does get a sequel. But yeah, adding onto the game's content, there's definitely a lot of replay value, with the various difficulty modes of the game, which can be unlocked by completing other modes. Or going back through levels to collect missed items, find hidden secrets, and more. As I said, a lot of replay value. To be honest, I think at the beginning of the game, Dante was someone you could have mixed feelings for, but I think he had some great character development as the game progressed, developing into a hero that made me proud to have played.Overall, I found DmC: Devil May Cry to be a great game that I had a lot of fun with until the very end, and yet still wanting more. From an awesome soundtrack to interesting storyline to impressive visuals and atmosphere, this game impressed me in many areas. I had my doubts about this game before going into it, however after giving it a chance and playing it fully through, I can definitely say my initial doubts where proven wrong. I'm glad I took the chance on this game, as I had a lot of fun with it. I've got no problem recommending this game to any of my friends. It's well worth two thumbs up from me.			"

												DmC: Devil May CryTears will be shedWhen you think of Devil May Cry you think of the iconic character that stands at the front of it, the nonchalant protagonist who remained a core part of the franchise and its image. A lot of gamers would see his white hair and red jacket and know it was Dante, from Devil may cry. Dante as a mascot could be considered more prevalent than the series he originated from, with several crossovers including a role in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. DmC: Devil may Cry does away with all of this, rebooting the entire franchise, all of its characters and it’s universe to try to appeal to more gamers, with a contemporary storyline written by the guys at Ninja Theory, you know, the guys who made Enslaved: Odyssey to the west, an amazing game. Unfortunately, while DmC: Devil may Cry may have some of the looks of a DMC game, it’ll never have their fire.DmC: Devil May Cry is a complete shamble. Something went wrong at Ninja Theory when these designs came together, and it’s unclear how such a mess could’ve occurred, but at least there’s something salvageable here, it’s just a question of whether that something is enough. You start off with a pretty off taste main menu, with Dante surrounded by near naked Angels, where-in you can start a game in a few difficulties, with more unlocked later down the line.The opening cutscene is more than enough to make you sick. To put it into simple words, Dante goes to a club, picks up two girls, and takes them to his camper van to have sex with. Classy, Ninja Theory, Very Classy. After this, the first main game cutscene starts off with a naked Dante in his camper, waking up to a disturbance as he’s pulled into Limbo, a Plot gimmick that allows Dante to fight Demons in broad daylight while unsuspecting people go about their day. When gameplay starts after a brief cutscene with the forgettable love interest, you’re taught some basic combat moves as you fight some lesser demons, it plays well, it works and looks good. At 60 FPS it definitely fills its role as a spectacle fighter. Unfortunately it doesn’t get any better.The games story progresses in a linear manner as you’re introduced to characters like Vergil, Kat, Mundus and the other antagonists. The Dialogue ranges from acceptable to messy. When the best your character can follow up a ♥♥♥♥ you with is a ♥♥♥♥ you, then followed by a successive ♥♥♥♥ you, you lose a lot of my respect for the integrity of your story and it’s writing. Also, “You can call me Dante the Demon Killer” sounds like an 8 year old in a playground, which is pretty much what our new Dante can be equated to. Vergil is also a disgrace of his former self, but I don’t think you need to look further than his fashion sense to know that.Gameplay consists of the usual combo fighting expected from a DMC game and it plays very well. From my experience it felt robust and fun to play, and using the weapons was fun, unfortunately, even the best parts have their issues. Most enemy designs are well made and fit with their roles, but the main problem comes from the inclusion of Demonic and Angelic weapons, and the inclusion of enemies that can only be hurt by specific weapons. Limiting your arsenal to specific weapons (Until you get 2 of each weapon, which can be quite late in the game, this limits you to literally one weapon) in a game about performing a variety of combos makes no sense to me.Later into the game you also acquire abilities such as a chain to pull yourself to places and pull things to you, which seem to provide a similar function to Nero’s arm in DMC4. The utility of these in combat makes it quicker and less frustrating to engage enemies as quick acquisition of an enemy is no more than a chains pull away. Along with a glide, these mechanics make movement and combat a lot more exciting and streamlined than previous instalments, and they don’t take away the depth of it either. Some ‘hardcore’ players will argue though that the game doesn’t provide enough weapons or combos to suit their tastes, and this is a valid argument, but for those who aren’t interested in the ‘hardcore’ aspect of the DMC games, the combat in DmC:DMC is good enough to entertain most players looking to do one, maybe two playthroughs.The accompanying soundtrack to this game is questionable, employing such talents as Noisia and Combichrist, one known for making Dubstep and the latter for making “aggrotech”. One or two tracks are acceptable and give a good fighting feel, but a good majority of it resides in the realm of sounding like every other Dubstep track out there, or some loud vocals partnered with unfitting techno.DmC: Devil may Cry features really beautiful environments, some of the best of its generations of games. Not once did I see a texture and think it was stretched or low res, or a model that looked a bit jagged. The Art style for most of the assets is really nice and colourful which is a contrast to previous games in the genre, and although some of the old, dark and spooky areas from previous games are missed, the new ones are a welcome addition. It could be argued that they take away from the atmosphere of the game but it’s a hard argument to make considering the plot surrounding that atmosphere.Overall the plot and handling of the characters is the most controversial topic here and needs some going over. There are some serious issues with the way the reboot was handled, including the defacing of the franchises main character. Many would argue that it's a small price to pay for a good game, but a lot of what made DMC good was the connection with Dante as a nonchalant cool character that broke a lot of normal story telling conventions. Dante wasn't a mopey protagonist who hated being a half demon who had to kill people and had a burdened past or whatever. He was cool, he didn't care, and he was having fun doing what he did and the players were in on that too. At the same time, there was a sense of delicacy with the plots of the original games, which was not taken into account here. The plot feels scrambled together with names taken from the original but not much more care put in past that. Mundus is some kinda weird Corporate Boss that doesn't fit his original representation, Vergil is the new Anonymous ringleader and the ending twist is poorly done and easily predictable.DmC:DMC has some issues and is an insult to the original fans who craved for another iteration of their beloved franchise. It's not bad though, and it has some appeal and fun aspects, but don't expect a DMC game. Expect a game with a poorly mashed together 'contemporary' plot, some awesome spectacle fighting gameplay, terrible Dubstep music, and gorgeous environments.If you're still interested buy it on sale but don't pay more than £10/$20 for it. If you're a fan of the original series and are interested in similar games that could scratch that itch, try Bayonetta or Metal Gear Rising Revengeance (Slated to come to Steam in the near future).

												This was my first DMC from the franchise, so I had no idea what the game was about besides a action / adventure type game.I was impressed at the controls and the game play, it had an easy to get into fighting mechanic that became more rewarding an interesting the more time you put into it.The main thing that makes this stand out from the xbox / ps3 version is the support for higher refresh rate monitors. The game is just much smooth at 145 fps + 144hz.			"

												DmC to me is like masturbating. When the mood strikes, I start it up and play because the combat feels so ♥♥♥♥ing good. That and throw in some badass music that works so well with the game. One of my favourite games all time.Gameplay 15/10Music 10/10Story 5/10Overall 10/10 (:I know the chances of a sequel are very low but I hope NT would one day make a game that feels as good as this.

												You know, I don't even care about the art design, or how uninspired and souless the plot is. I don't care that it's 'edgy' or grimdark, or whatever fanwank bull people throw back and forth about this. This game is bad because it is mechanically a train wreck. The combat is somewhere between mediocre and broken, nothing short of an insult to its legacy.			"

												Before I get to the review; I want to say that the best way of playing this game is definitely with a controller, so before you purchase the game itself, make sure you have one.I sort of have a love hate relationship with this game, as I keep progressing through the main campaign, its problems keeps dragging me back, yet its gameplay is just fun enough to keep me going until the end of the campaign. That doesn't mean the game itself is bad, though, lets start with the positives;+ Gameplay feels fresh, fun, and fluid. With a little practice and some getting use to, you can pull off some flashy and spectacular combos that give you a sense of accomplishment + The style system is great and encourages players to mix up their combos, use different weapons, and not just mash buttons+ Limbo sequences are beautifully designed and are absolutely brilliant to play in and traverse through+ The music fits well with the theme of the game most of the timeHowever, it does have its flaws, and here are some of them;- The main story is pretty boring and generic with a few yet predictable twists, the way its delivered is also pretty uninspired, as there is even a level specifically designed as a generic exposition filler of the campaign's story- Characters are uninteresting and aren't very well fleshed out. Dante's dialogues are corny and his jokes are a hit and miss, Vergil barely does anything throughout most of the campaign, and Kat is just a boring and forgettable side character. The same goes for the rest of the story's forgettable cast.- Enemy designs are recycled and imo is worse than previous Devil May Cry titles- Apart from a few interesting ones, levels are quite linear and can be short sometimes, the same goes for the entire campaign; which is a tad bit short- Bosses are tedious and follows the same basic formula; take out its first health bar, expose its weak point, hit said weak point, take out its second health bar, expose its weak point again, rinse and repeat until it dies- Camera issues hinder the flow of combat and can lead to a lot of frustration, especially when moving or engaging enemies in tight corridors or next to a wall- Certain button prompts seems unresponsive and some of them are poorly implementedIf you can put the game's many flaws aside, the game works for what it is, and is a passable addition to the franchise, but I wouldn't consider it worthy of becoming a reboot of the Devil May Cry series. < 7 / 10 >			"

												Unfortunately not as fun as DMC 3 (the only amazing game in the series). Camera gets lost too often, controls are more loose compared to previous DMC titles. The weapons are fun (though not guns) and chaining combos with various weapons is enjoyable. Some opponents and most bosses are not fun to play against. They're not difficult (finished on Nefilim/Hard equivalent, hardest difficulty you can get on first playthrough), just super annoying. The art design of the levels is occasionaly very good (one of the levels mid game is amazing), but the actual layouts and traversal are uninspired. Platforming elements are very weak.  Altogether gameplay is ok at best.  What is truly terrible is the story. DMC series never made much sense and was always cheesy, but at least it was amusing most of the time. This game takes itself very, very seriously. Characters make fun of Dante for being an emo kid, but it actually is a spot on description. 90% of the cutscenes are cringe worthy and/or boring. At least you can skip them even on first play through. I did in the final third of the game once my patience ran out. I doubt it picked up in quaity. Ultimately, not a terrible game, but average/decent at best and does not kick♥♥♥♥♥like the previous young Dante. With so many cheap, good games available, do yourself a favour and spend your time playing something else. If you really want to play a good DMC game, buy DMC 3 Special Edition.			"

												I am a massive fan of the Devil May Cry games as I have owned each game on consoles beforehand have been very happy with each of the instalments in the franchise. So here we have DmC Devil May Cry the 'Reboot' of the series which has a new Dante in a new universe, now when this game was first revealed the fans lost their♥♥♥♥♥♥all because Dante's character design had been altered a lot.Now at first I was a bit uncertain about his new look but decided not to judge a game entirely based off of Dante’s look which now it has grown on me but I still prefer the classic look. Now for those that do prefer this, there is a costume which makes him look like DMC 3 Dante which I used and LOVE to bits so you can always use that if you don’t like the standard design (although you gotta pay for it soz) so for the design i let it slide now onto the story.The story in this DMC game isn’t great but it’s not too bad so there is SPOILERS up ahead so if you don’t want it spoiled stop reading. Originally Dante’s mother Eva as we all know was a human and his father was the legendary dark knight Sparda, now they are still his parents but Eva is now an Angel and Sparda is just know as a traitor who has been banished forever. Dante meanwhile can barely remember anything cause he's busy banging angel hookers and killing demons.They introduce Kat who is this games Trish (I think) and she basically is the one who helps Dante and is a crappy love interest, Virgil his brother returns with a better voice actor, explains to Dante they are Nephilim (Half Angel, Half Demon) has become the leader of the order who turns out to be a child murderer and power greedy prick in the end. Mundus is back but not in his almighty form like in DMC1 instead looks like the kingpin from Daredevil, he has many great moments such as banging his woman Lilith against a table whilst causing tremors cause ya know he’s a god. The fight against him in Mission 19 is way too easy and so is the final boss which is not usually the case in DMC games.Combat is very good in this game and unique with the different weapons for both angel and demon all though i found firearms to be quite useless, devil trigger is cool but i still prefer the classic way it was executed and the environment known as Limbo was really cool and had so many different areas to explore. The game is best played on Nephilim difficulty when you start as its till quite easy even if your new to the series and also has better rewards. Has some good battle music, is very edgy and doesn’t have many good old smart♥♥♥♥♥one liners like classic Dante did. Also the bit in the carnival where the white wig lands on Dante’s head he says not in a million years? Yeah not cool ninja theory.There is a DLC called Virgil’s downfall that I’m currently playing through and I must say it is very good so far so I would recommend picking it up too.A good game that did not deserve the hate it got at first, if your still not sure check out angry joe's review:

												Bad Capcom. Bad. That's a very bad Capcom. You stop that. Okay, so if your only exposure to these sorts of insane action games are God of War and the like, you'll probably dig this. By the standards of Ninja Theory's previous releases, it's servicable and the plot is not executed poorly.The mistake, you see, was calling it Devil May Cry. Once you compare it to DMC3, or hell, 4, even, it falls apart. The new Dante is an abomination, the new Vergil is a joke, the story is terrible and falls apart. The fights have no variety or challenge, and the entire game is just a bad insult.The Fox News level was pretty neat. I would have liked this, probably, if it weren't Devil May Cry.			"

												Okay, I was really disappointed that Capcom was doing a reboot on this game. They really made Dante unattractive in this T_T God he was so cute back in the original games. The gameplay isn't that good either, it's kinda slow and lacks appeal to me. The music is just downright annoying. I couldn't even train my hands to be strong, meaning I wouldn't able to satsify my boyfriend with a handjob if I were to keep playing this game. Play the original games, they're much better, more fun too.			"

												This game is really good. It's something I keep going back to just for the gameplay, which is a good thing for a video game to have. I don't really have a problem with the story, it's good enough, and I like the characters and the script well enough even though you might cut yourself on all the edge. It's not really good, just good enough. But what really matters is the gameplay, which is really good. Is it easy to get that SSS rank on your combos? Yes. Does that make it any less fun? Nope, it's still really fun to knock a demon up in the air and bounce it on the ground until it dies. The only thing I found myself annoyed with was the platforming. Thankfully these sections don't drag on for too long before you're right back in the action. Definitely get this game if you like hardcore action games.			"

This is, without a doubt, the best hack and slash game on the PC. It strikes the perfect balance between accessibility and depth. It also has. beautiful graphics, a great soundtrack, and above all, extremely fun gameplay. If you appreciate excellence in modern game design then this is game you must buy and play.And before you read any more misinformation about combat fluidity, this is arguably the most fluid action game ever made, once you understand that every move Dante possesses has an actual purpose, it becomes effortless to dodge and move from target to target while remaining stylish.

												I'm one of those people that have been following the Devil May Cry series since its debut in 2001, that loved the first game to the point of obsession and that, in the following years, have been more and more disappointed with the way Capcom managed the franchise and let both the characters and the basic plot of the series go to waste. Hence I wasn't surprised when this reboot was announced, and I have to admit that at first I was amongst the screaming mob that instantly dismissed this game as utter garbage, resulting from a sleazy marketing operation. But instead of stubbornly clinge to a first impression I wanted to try it first hand so that I would've been able to express a complete and reasoned judgement. And well, after watching the credits the overall verdict that I can give to this DMC is actually quite positive.Let's say first of all that the protagonist is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ it just has to be admitted. Instead of the good ol' Dante we have this teenage prick that tries hard to be edgy and acts like the typical street thug, spitting out lines that sometimes are really cringe-worthy, especially in the early parts of the game. But if you think about it, it's not so different from the young Dante that we had to bear in Devil May Cry 3. And guess what? Contrary to the latter, the kid we see in this game actually experiences an hint of character development. That's because the plot, while obviously not particularly remarkable in terms of depth, is still written decently and is surely much more consistent than the awful mess we saw along the years in the various sequels of the original Devil May Cry. Even if don't personally like much the more ""urban"" aestethics of the setting, I appreciated the fact that the developers tried to give it a bit more depth with the whole ""New World Order"" mood, which is not exactly the top of originality (it's actually clearly inspired from the movie They Live) but it suits well to the purpose. So pros to that.The gameplay, which is the primary aspect for every DMC, is pretty solid, level design and platforms are not particularly remarkable but are still well made and the different interactions with the surroundings made possible by the new weapon system are an interesting and fun to use addition. Those who are familiar with the series will notice that the difficulty is rather below its standards, but thanks to the aforementioned new weapons making combos is still fun and the new game modes add an extra challenge to everything. Of course you don't have to expect anything nearly as hard or deep as Bayonetta, which IMO has set the new standard of excellence in this genre. However, If you never played a DMC before and you're not very accustomed to action games this one is an excellent entry point.The biggest flaw I've found in this title is the enemy design: they look dull, unimpressive and generally lack diversity. I don't recall a single boss battle that really troubled me or that left me with a strong impression, except maybe the final battle. That is a big lack for an action game and doubly so for a Devil May Cry. I also felt the abscence of enemy lock-on during combat: to attack an enemy you have to face towards him with the left stick, it generally works well but sometimes you can't hit the precise enemy you want to at the first shot, and that can be really annoying. Aside from this couple of things, this DMC is a good action game that can certainly be considered way above the average of similar titles. Could have been even better if it wasn't for the flaws I pointed out, but it's still good.On technical level the PC version looks flawless and runs perfectly smooth, always still at 60fps without a single hiccup while running at maximum settings (on my rig I currently have an i5-2500k @3,60 Ghz with an AMD Radeon HD 7850). So for once, we don't have to complain about the porting - yeah yeah I know, there are very few graphic customization options but I don't care, considering the average quality of console ports that I've seen during the last years I absolutely cannot complain about this one.A side note about the ""Vergil's Downfall"" DLC: I don't recommend buying at full price, it's very short (only 6 missions) and the story adds very little to the plot, it looks more like a tentative to include a playable Vergil due to popular demand and nothing more. It's not all bad, though: I appreciated the fact that Vergil has its own combat style with some features directly inspired by the Nelo Angelo boss (aka Vergil himself) in the very first DMC as well as the whole atmosphere of the levels, much darker and oniric than the ones from the base game, which fits very well to the completely different personality of Vergil and sometimes makes it all look like a whole different game. Playing with Vergil is also harder than Dante, partly due to the limited move set and partly to the very ""technical"" (yet extremely powerful when mastered) combat style, so expect having to swear a bit if you plan to get an SSS on every level on every difficulty mode. So all considered I suggest to buy this DLC when it's on sale, buying the complete pack on discount would be the best option.As a final and personal note I have to give my congratulations to Ninja Theory, because having to deal from scratch with a series that had such a troubled background and that always brings extreme expectations is not easy, and managing to do so while at the same time giving a new consistence to its plot and characters is a proof of talent. Not many people could have done that. Bravo.			"

												DmC: Devil May Cry (or DmCDMC, as I like to call it) is a reboot/alternate universe of the Devil May Cry franchise, and, as someone who's never played a DMC game before (although I knew the characters and had vague idea of the general plot), I must say it does a decent job at introducing the player to the franchise, or, at the very least, to the hack and slash genre. As I mentioned already, I have no experience with previous DMC games, so I can't really compare the quality of this one to the rest of the franchise, so this review will be mostly about my opinions on this game as a single entity.To begin with, I'd like to talk about the story. I'll admit I wasn't too fond of Dante at the beginning of the game, or the game's atmosphere in general. It seemed to try to be too edgy and dark, with Dante being somewhat of a punk who didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about anything. However, I'd say it worked pretty well in the end, since, as the game progresses, you can actually see some character development in Dante, going from his original self-centered persona to someone who cares about the world, and wants to defend it from the demons. I'd say all the characters are pretty well written in my opinion; and the story is fairly decent, if a bit predictable. I'd say that Ninja Theory managed to create an interesting world, and I'd gladly accept it as an alternate universe to the main DMC franchise, but, sadly, it seems the chances of a DmC2 are pretty much non-existant.As for the gameplay, I really like it. I'd say it's a bit confusing at first, with the three different weapon styles (normal, demonic and angelic weapons), each with their own role in combat, not to mention the fact that certain enemies are immune to certain weapons, but after you get some practice with the combos and such, combat becomes really fun, as you try and get the highest score possible. There's also some platforming sections in the game, some of which can be a bit annoying as the game tends to mess up your commands. I do have some problems with the gameplay, though. Most notably, the lack of a lock-on system, which can sometimes mess with your combos as the game decides which enemy to target (sometimes it even makes you lose a combo by not hitting anything), not to mention that it's also impossible to cancel attacks when the animation is already playing (at least I couldn't do it), which can lead you to being hit, as some enemies have faster attack animations than some of your attacks.The level design is something I kinda liked. Most of the gameplay takes place in Limbo, which is sort of an alternate dimension to the real world, although severely distorted, and it really feels like the world itself is trying to kill you. There's a noticeable different between the real world and Limbo, with the real world looking gray and dull, while Limbo is colourful and feels alive. While I can understand the design choice (the real world looks gray because it's under Mundus' control, while Limbo, the demon world, thrives), the real world sections feel drab compared to the rest of the game. Even then, there's not much of them, so it's not a big issue.The soundtrack is pretty great as well. A lot of heavy metal and the like, and while it is somewhat edgy in certain portions, it fits perfectly well with the rest of the game, so I'd say they did a good job.All things said, I really enjoyed this game. I repeat, I have no idea how it might compare to other DMC games, but, on its own, it's a pretty good game, so I recommend it.			"

												I've been playing this game two days after this game released. I finished this game in days after i got home from school. Really excited to playing this game. Ok here is my review:Devil May Cry is Action Hack and Slash game developed Ninja Theory and Published by Capcom released on January 2013. We are playing as Dante. Dante is a Nephilim; half-angel, half-demon. Dante have a mission to kill King Mundus who kill Dante's mother. He partnered up with his brother Virgil. GameplayWe are playing as Dante who uses his power and weapon to beat enemy. Like the previous series, in this game Dante can perfrom combo using Rebellion sword, ivory and ebony pistols, and more. There is new feature in this game: Angel mode and Devil mode. This new feature can be activated by using trigger. In Angel mode, Rebellion sword change to Osiris and Devil mode changes to a powerful weapon, Arbiter.Pros New features: Angel and Demon Mode More Dante's mobility in Angel and Demon Mode Great visual Bloody palace DLC is free and the others except Virgil Downsfall Attacking combo looking goodCons Dante's hair.... I love the previous Dante hair Damte looks like a badass teenager Boss battle isn't fun as a regular combat do The ending. Oh my god. I dont know why it's so sucks i think. It doesn't fit up the rest of the storySummaryWell i think this reboot of DMC is still a good game. The Angel and Demon Mode is a good addition to the game meanwhile the ending isn't good as i think. But, this game is still very good for DMC fanguy.8.5/10			"

												A solid beat-em-up with terrible platforming and good storytelling.PROS:-Good combat mechanics (fair amount of complexity and depth)-Great voice acting -Great rigging (facial animations, etc)-Good enemy designs using angel/demon weapons (but a LOT more could have been done)NEUTRALS:-Some collectibles, though due to boring platforming actually exploring isn't all that exciting. -Score is based on level completion percentage. This is a bit odd since the completion stays between levels, so once you get all the collectibles, you will always get SSS (x8) multiplier for 100% completion on a level. This artificially affects the score because it means any player wishing to get on the leaderboards must first play the level to 100%, then replay it ""for score"" (since time is also a factor, you want to go fast). Very very minor issue.CONS:-The platforming is AWFUL.  Long stretches of just running from point A to point B with little to nothing happening. The direct jumping sections are extremely shallow and the ""hookshot"" components play out as a glorified flash game (you just hook when the target lights up...)-Only about half the cutscenes can be skipped (BACKSPACE since it never tells you). The other half cannot be skipped for some reason...-TERRIBLE FORCED AUTO AIM. I assume this is the result of poor porting. There is no aiming reticule and the game will often aim at random things, sometimes not even on the screen from where you are looking. However, this is a very minor problem (I beat the game on all difficulties except Hell & Hell with only minor issues).-There are skins for the weapons apparently....if you pay real money? This is a single player action game. Ridiculous.			"

												A new modern twist on the Devil May Cry series that delivers in every enjoyable wayPros--Smooth gameplay-Infinate combo possibilities-High replay value-Collectibles and unlockables to explore-Lively scenery makes it nice eye candyCons--Predictable storyThe classic DMC series battles are here and better than ever with over 8 weapons you can seemlesly switch and combo into for infinate combo options and styles that you are free to choose. Fans of the original should see this as a new stand alone story and judge it as is. Very enjoyable and rewarding to play. "

												It was fun at first but after about 2 hours when you've managed to experience a big part of the combat it becomes apperant that the combat is more shallow than the older DMC games and way easier. Getting up to SSS rank in combat can be done by about 3-4 combos in large clusers.All in all the game isn't horrible but doesn't hold up if compared to other DMC games. If you've never played older DMC games or you're more of a casual player I recommend picking DmC up as an introduction to the series. If you're a veteran DMC player I'd recommend you pirate it and decide for yourself. It's very hit and miss for veterans but the key to enjoying it is to see it as a spinoff, not a true DMC game.			"

												DmC Devil May CryWell this game is completely different from the normal Devil May Cry Series. The game a lot more modernised than the previous games which I completely like some other people like it the other way around but it's my opinion and everyone has there own opinion.The combat feels so smooth and it just feels so amazing to play the story multiple times and to do the bloody palace waves it's endless fun I've played the story so many times and never got bored. As you progress you will unlock Angel & Demon Weapons. The Angel weapons are lighter and does do little damage but you can hit multiple enemies with it. The Demon weapons are heavier and Do A lot more damage than the other so you can combine the angel & demon weapons very well together.The story is very good so you can get dragged into it, Dante is a typical badass who doesn't really care about anyone or anything. As you progress Dante does get dragged into it and realise that the world is something to care about. Personally my favorite Hack/Slash game so it's a flawless score for me. 10/10			"

												Simply just amazing and well done game. Can't recommend enough for people who love hack'n'slash games. Solid performance with decent looking graphics, about 200 stable FPS on my i7-2600k and GTX 770, awesome with 144hz.With 7 different weapons to combo with, you'll find a lot of different ways to defeat your enemies with a good enemy variety.8/10 - I didn't really like the jumping, and sometimes the level design was kinda confusing as I thought other ""hidden"" rooms would reward you for exploring them, but no, it just lead to wasted time running around thinking you'll get a bonus.Other than that, very solid title.

												Great hack&slash game. Level design and its transformations are spectacular. Fighting mechanics are simple and yet infinite in posibilities. You can unlock several weapon types which you level up opening new combos and it's really satisfying and fluid. Story is short (<10 hours), but the game has tons of replayability through different modes and challenges. I'm not really a hack&slash type of a guy, but once I started the game to try it, I had to finish it and enjoyed it in doing so.Gameplay 9/10Sound 8/10Story 6/10Graphics 9/10Polish 10/10Overall Score 8/10 (great game)			"

												I remember when this game first came out. I was all bitter about the reboot. How Dante looked, ect. I've been a Devil May Cry fan for a long time. I had an e-mail account relating to it. Well, 3 years later and I've finally played the DmC reboot, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ It might even be my favorite out of the whole series. While I haven't finished the game yet, I'm working through main story and I just absolutely love the story behind it. The characters, how the world works. It's a brilliant design. The fighting style is just as good if not better then the older games. I'd definitely recommend this to any Devil May Cry fans or 3d Castlevania fans who haven't tried it yet.I'd also recommend it to anyone who's has even the slightest interest in how the game looks, because chances are you're going to love it.

												I am always a big fan of hack and slash games. Devil May Cry might be the best hack and slash series I have ever played since Devil May Cry 3. But this game, woah, the combat system are amazing. The retelling story of Dante seems to be interesting and straight to the point. A lot of fans were angry about the new Dante in this instalment because of his new look hair and his costume. I mean, come on, this new Dante seems to be even more rowdy and a chick magnet.Pros:+Amazing combat system+New Dante+Replayability+Soundtrack fits the theme of the game+Difficulty+Amazing graphics running with Unreal Engine 3+Grotesque BossesCons:-Level Design-Kablooey Gun-Boss fights seems to be easy-Skins as a DLC-No Lock-On during combat-Frustating camera controls for Keyboard and Mouse usersOverall, this additional instalment is fun, satisfying combat with interesting storyline. The bottom line is that, level designs and boss fights felt short. Otherwise, DmC: Devil May Cry is a fun reboot.Updated: 31 May @ 12:02pm: adding headline for Pros and Cons			"

												As one of the naysayers when the game was first announced I have to admit that this game is actually good. It's not as deep as previous DMC games. The story is - uhm - too edgy and not enough campy for me (give me Uncle Dante over ""♥♥♥♥ you!"" Dante any time). There are also few annoying things here and there (color-coded enemies being the most offensive one; thankfully there are mods that fix that) and the game likes to shower you with style points even for minor things (if you don't completely suck in this kind of games, you will manage to constantly get at least S rank for simple button mashing). However, the fighting mechanics are really enjoyable and fun, and the game manages to achieve something that previous DMC games failed at - make the platforming section not suck.			"

												There is no getting around it, DMC being rebooted by a western studio is shocking. So shocking that a lot of fans cried foul and screamed blood murder. Was it for the best? Perhaps it was, DMC 4 was undoubtedly a step backwards after all. Capcom took a chance with outsourcing the IP and surprisingly it paid off.Meet DmC: Devil May Cry, a young fresh reboot by the team that brought you Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. With a slick, stylized re-imagining of the world home to the Nephilim Dante. Born of the Angel Eva and Demon Sparda, he possesses the power of both. Hunted down by the Demon king Mundus, Dante is dragged into the parallel plane called Limbo at every turn.While the initial combat impression and the new look might seem jarring at first. After a few minutes you will find that DMC is very much alive under the hood. The intense high level combat gameplay is still there with some interesting new additions to mix things up a bit. Once mastered you will be able to perform the dazzling acrobatic slashing we all know and love with ease again. I say with ease but do not mistake this for the difficulty having eased up. The challenges are still very much there, though I would recommend people familiar with the series start on Hard.All in all the reboot manages to be fresh, engaging and most of all fun. It will be jarring to some but that is the case with any reboot. If you've enjoyed DMC in the past or enjoy action hack and slash games, give this a shot.			"

												Don't believe the haters. This is one of the best Devil May Cry games available. The criticism against it mostly centers on Capcom's decision to transform the iconic character of Dante. I promise, it's just a cosmetic change. No, he does not look like a gothic anime villain and he does not spend his time hunting demons in medieval castles. Aside from that, he's the same Dante he's been since DMC 3. Yes, he has attitude, but it's not as over-the-top as it used to be. DMC 3 let Dante perform ridiculous stunts like using a motorcycle to pulverize demons and wielding an electric, bat-shooting guitar, all while spouting off catchphrases straight from the Ninja Turtles. While that was campy and lots of fun, DMC shoots for a different tone. This is a serious game with a Dante that is more human than action hero. He's traded his anime garb for something along the lines of urban anarchist. But the game is GOOD. The combat is nearly flawless. Controls have been streamlined, so no more cycling through different fighting styles or trying to decide which weapon to take into battle. This isn't Resident Evil with swords anymore. It's a fully-fledged brawler and it can be legitimately challenging. The storyline is also a vast improvement over previous installments. The voice acting is no longer outrageous. Dante's demons don't haunt dark dungeons anymore. They live all around him: in the media, in junk food, in human lusts and appetites. These are the Seven Deadly Sins personified and Dante embodies them as much as he wants to destroy them. There is internal and external conflict going on, all blending seamlessly with brutal and satisfying combat. Dante's hits shake the earth. His enemies wield chainsaws and katanas. Fans of Nero will be happy to find that Dante's sword now has a grappling function to pull enemies close. Does it look like a Devil May Cry game? No. But all the familiar faces are there (including Vergil, whom you can control in the DLC); Dante's attitude hasn't changed, and there's a LOT to love here. Don't let the negative reviews discourage you. This is a truly phenomenal fighting game that pays homage to its predecessors. As someone who has played the heck out of every DMC game and even suffered through the terrible anime, I can say this is a worthy reboot of the franchise. 9/10.			"

The new Dante makes his mark by being a top-notch character with good punch lines and cool sarcasm.

												I waited with the review until I finish DMC4:SE, so I can see where the hate comes from and to be honest I still think that the hate is nonsense.+Diverse and beautiful level design!+Complex (but not as DMC4:SE) combat system+Diverse enemies+Many and actually good weapons+Very well done platforming+Finally a not annoying camera+Plain-spoken social criticism+Ok story+Top notch music (Noisia!!!!)+Quite well optimized+Final boss+Replay value (7 different difficulty settings!)-Devil trigger is useless (only looks cool)-No Definitive Edition contents (seriously tho, even if we had to pay for it, we would buy that)-Little bit short (~10hs)In overall: Although the DMC fanbase mostly hates this game for being slightly easier and not being anime (thanks god) it doesn't mean it's not a good game. And that 95% Steam rating isn't a lie neither, it's an almost excellent game, which certainly needs more attention (well not the current hate). Well for it's lenght...it may not worth 40€, but that's all up to you. EDIT: People seem to misunderstand my opinion about anime. I have no problem with anime, actually I even like it, BUT! older DMC games (especially 3) used anime very badly in their games (clichés or just simply trying to be cool in an anime way well...let's say unsuccessfully).

The 'styles' system of 3 and 4 (haven't played much if any of 1 and 2) was occasionally tricky to work with, but the angel and demon modes of this game make sense and allow for easy, near-infinite combos once you get the hang of it. But for gods sake, you MUST play with a controller. Handling Dante with a mouse and keyboard is just♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This game is so much fun. The combat is much more fluid and stylish than the previous games. This makes it much easier, but also much cooler to look at. The level design is pretty great and also stylish. The sountrack is also pretty dank and although I don't like some of the songs, I can't deny that they fit the game perfectly. Boss fights are disappointingly easy, but they are a visual spectacle to say the least. The worst thing about this game is most of the dialouge is pretty cringeworthy and outright awkward most of the time. The way the characters talk is sometimes over the top or just cartoonish and not necessarily in match with the tone of the game. Overall, I liked the streamlined combat and more cinematic approach of the game, even if it's much different than the original series. Rememeber a reboot is supposed to be different and shake things up or else the series can get stale. 8/10.			"

												Played, completed in about 10 hours, and started again in the new difficulty mode. Good replayability, once you're done with the story you just want to start from scratch and keep slaying demons, while collecting all of Dante's moves and powerups. The game runs with good graphics without fps issues even during the most violent battles. The combat system is very dynamic and enables for many combos and more moves can be unlocked while progressing in the game. By quickly changing Dante's weapons (and therefore combat style and moves) one can concatenate long and various combos. Wven though a bit too predictable the story is interesting enough, and Dante's  attitude sure helps. The scenery is always gorgeous: you can never be sure about what's going to happen once you're  dragged into the Limbo, except it's going to be exaggerated and fun. And what to say about the music... well... just perfect to go along with the quick and vicious fights offered. To concude, a must for any lover of  the genre.			"

												I wanted to try this game out because one of my most anticipated games, Hellblade, is being made by the same creators of this game. I am very happy to say that there is so much fun to be had in this game. The gameplay is fast-paced, but rewards players for taking the time to study all the combos. The boss battles in this game are some of my favorite, and really do see who took the time to learn all the moves. It's also very fun to compare your score with friends after beating certain levels. Coming in, I wasn't expecting much from the story, but I was very pleasantly surprised by it. The game builds a very interesting world and concept, with character developement from both Dante and Virgil. It even has a great and shocking end bossfight which makes me hope that when the developers are done with Hellblade, they'll get to work on a sequel to DmC. Unfortunetly, the campaign is very short, but it'll make you want to replay levels again on higher difficulties to get the best possible score you can. Theres also a ""Bloody Palace"" mode that has you fight off against hordes of enemies, which can be fun and is a great time killer. The voice acting most of the time is good, but there are sometimes where it tends to get a bit sloppy. The music is also very fitting for the character of Dante and the situations he is in. You'll mostly be hearing Rock, Metal, and Dubstep. Something else I really liked about this game was the platforming. Platforming is fast and fun, but it isn't mindless. In the end, DmC Devil May Cry is a game that provides alot of fun especially if you know a friend who also owns the game and wants to compare scores, but the storyline is very short.			"

												DMC: Devil May Cry ReviewI never had the pleasure to play the previous Devil May Cry games. They came out during a time when I was not allowed to not even touch an M-Rated game. Once I was older, I never sought them out and soon forgot about them. I regret that...slightly.DMC is a prequel/reboot to the Devil May Cry series. It follows the spawn of an angel/demon relation as he tries to find out where he fits in this world and what a world it is! Ninja Theory may not be so subtle in their approach here, but it does go a long way to making DMC's world feel unique among its contemporaries. It's an entire satire on modern capitalism and political ideologies, but it's cool to see the developer have the guts to stick by its presentation and not skimp on it's more obvious satire of more popular people like the infamous Bill O' Reilly. The gameplay is immensely visceral and very complex albeit I believe not as much as previous entries. Nonetheless it's a good starter point for anyone interested in the series. The combos, while there might be many, end up becoming quite simple to memorize after a while since every weapon has the same combos with some slight variations. Overall, it's very refreshing to play a melee combat game that has a bigger move-set than it's contemporaries. Be warned, while this game is easier than previous Devil May Cry iterations, those iterations were known to be pretty difficult. This leads to Devil May Cry being a tougher game than usual and a game that requires your full attention at all times. This might be one game that you should be able to start on Easy instead of Medium without making you feel like you suck. Thankfully the game makes it simple for you to remember combos and times to dodge by using creative visual cues. The gameplay is the main reason to play DMC and trust me it does not disappoint in that department. As for the story of DMC, it ends up being kind of a mixed bag, but overall a much more compelling narrative than most titles released today. While sometimes you might wonder why the developers didn't just make a film, you'll quickly grow accustomed to the slick cinematography and intriguing story. Without giving any spoilers away, the game has some detours in the story that feel more like padding to artificially lengthen the game and ends up messing with the pacing of the story. The main bad guy is intriguing, but unfortunately is not given time to grow to feel like he is a menacing, credible threat. Towards the end a subplot is thrown in with very little flair and is never given enough time throughout the story to be believable. It makes the characters involved in this scene do things that are kind of uncharacteristic, and contradictory to their established personalities.  Overall the story is compelling, but is filled with many tropes and other maladies that bog it down a bit.You may be wondering if I like this game? I’ll tell you this much. I love this game, and while my critical eye is quick to catch where it falls short, as a new fan I must say that I loved being in this world and following the characters on their respective journeys. So it pains me to say that it is a damn shame that we may not be getting a sequel to this game. Being the lowest sold in the series, it makes the prospects of a sequel highly unlikely, which is really unfortunate. From the slick presentation, intriguing story, compelling characters, to engaging combat; DMC will alway remain on my mind as a what if. A series with great potential held back by mediocre sales. One thing's for sure though...I’m going to go back and see if I can play all the old Devil May Cry games. I need more Devil May Cry! 8.7/10			"

												The story is awful. So go into this game knowing the quirkiness of the older games (or with an open mind).This game is gorgeous, beautiful atmosphere and just amazing design work which is what drew me into buying this game in the first place. Combat-wise, it's alright. It's fun, energetic, and is what you'd expect for a hack and slash genre, but be prepared to have to change from blue to red frequently as you defeat an abundance of different types of enemies. All n' all, have fun, yo.			"

												This Review focuses on DMC: Devil May Cry as in individual game, rather than one attached to the previous Devil May Cry series created by Capcom.Personally, I like the old series better, however I had to try my best to stay impartial when giving this game a review.Contains Spoilers!!If you want a short version of this review, please just skip down to the “Overall” section. If you want to read the in-depth information, feel free to read my whole reviewTechnicalI personally enjoyed the games updated graphics and texture features. The textures on the enemies and spawns fit the demonic theme of the enemies perfectly. The detail in the environment added to the overall emersion of the game and the missions, making the plot easier to get dragged into. My only argument about the graphics and textures is that in some points,  such as the fight with Mundus’ mistress , the backgrounds can be somewhat distracting and disorienting to the fight at hand.The mechanics fit the game quite nicely, however on a PC the controls were a little bit whacky. It is hard to make these types of controls for the PC, and I think the game creators did a good job of trying to make it so that you could access all of the skills and combinations for all of the weapons you acquire with this game. It can be hard to remember all the massive amounts of attack combos, but they make it so that the game doesn't require every single combo in order to succeed. Some of the combos are just clicking patterns with your mouse, but others require you to knock an enemy into the air.However, if you’re not good with aerial combos, the game creators made combos and chains on the ground that are just as strong. I know that I survived the game without even realizing that I was using certain combos that I’d unlocked. However, if you’re picky about combos and chain attacks, the game gives you plenty, if not almost too many, combos to practice and learn from, and the game doesn’t make you practice them in the middle of the story, and you are able to revisit them in training mode. Lastly, if you’re big on combos and chains, you can earn additional points toward your missions overall rating. (D-SSS), through your chains and combos.The addition of ""style points"" and rankings based on impressive chains and combos makes it a goal to hit combos, and not a necessity. I personally enjoy all the different chains and combos that they made possible with the game, even if they are tricky to remember. It gives the game a bit more flavor. The best part of this, in my opinion, is that the combos are optional, meaning that the game doesn’t make you learn and master every combo on a dummy a million times, to be able to continue with your game. You can do that on your own time.The unlocking of these skills and combos with rank-up points is also another thing I think that adds to the games flavor. Being able to unlock combos that you think you'll use, and the option to chose not to unlock ones that you don't think you'll use adds the feeling of customization to the game. Even though you'll probably need to unlock everything by the time you finish the game, there are several combos and skills that I didn't know I had prior to visiting the training area. The training area allows you to practice different combos and chains, and I like that as well about the game. It came in handy for me to figure out which set of skills works best with my fighting style, and which ones to avoid.The music choice was a bit edgy for my liking, however the old DMC games contained heavy music similar in style to that used in this game, so I can at least say that element is consistent with the previous series.Character/Plot DevelopmentThe character development for the main characters is solid, and you get to know the main characters the best-as in any game. However, the development of the supporting characters wasn’t as strong. (Such as Virgil, Dante’s brother. You get to know general information about Virgil, but there are still a lot of questions that players may have, assuming that you didn't play the older games.) The development of nemesis characters and boss characters is solid, in that you get to know why you’re trying to kill them, why they are against you, and how you get to the point of facing them. I think this is very important in a game and it’s character development, because why spend the time fighting a boss if it doesn’t have a purpose? In some games hordes all look the same, but some enemies are stronger than others with different skill sets and stats, and it’s important to make stronger Horde enemies stand out. DMC does a very good job with this. The horde enemies have different looks based on their attacks, and the stronger a Horde enemy is, the bigger and nastier the creators made it look. This made it easy for me to tell who to focus on first, and who to shred through at the end. The last aspect of the horde that I think that DMC did a good job of showing, is that each part of the horde is important. If you forget to kill something in the air, it will continue to hurt you and make itself noticeable to you until you get around to it. Nothing really goes unnoticed in the horde, and I appreciate that every enemy has a purpose.!Spoiler Alert! The development of Dante as a character (not related to the Dante used in previous games, but rather looking at him as a completely different person) made me very pleased. You’re as “in the dark” as he is about who is is, and what he is, at most points in the game. Personally, I just assumed that he was a full demon based on his portrayal in the opening scenes, but I was surprised to find out he was a nephilim, and I was pleased with the way that the story carried through with the information. The stories of Dante’s parents are told through several little hints and clues, but it all comes together nicely, and it fills in the blanks that many games tend to leave open. Flashbacks are properly used to portray Dante’s past, and they’re interactive. The makers used the idea of “limbo” in a great way in order to show Dante’s history.My one complaint however, would be the immaturity of his character. He seems like an attractive man♥♥♥♥♥ at the beginning, but we find out (or at least I did) that he's got the attitude of a 12 year old, which was a major turn-off for me. (I'm trying my best not to compare this DMC with the old ones, but if I had to say anything, old Dante is witty and cool and this one is edgy and annoying.)The development of other characters, such as Vergil and Kat, was a bit weaker, but you could see how they tied into Dante’s success. You learn about their history through working with them and their stories are revealed through little hints.OverallIn general, I give this game a positive rating, and on a scale of 1-5 I'd rate it a 4 as an individual game, but in comparison to the old DMC series, it would be a -1 (again, that's my bias talking).The mechanics fit the game, but can be tricky to master, and some mechanics must be mastered in order to complete the game. The game gives you some degree of customization with skills and perks, but since the main characters are set, the lack of player customization is appropriate. There are DLC packs and unlocking features that allow you to change the appearance of Dante and Vergil, however they don’t add much to the game, nor take away from it. The plot development is solid, but sweet and short, and I wouldn’t say this game has much replay value. There are a variety of difficulties, making it so that you could focus on the mechanics and battles, or the story. But in all game modes, if you can handle it, the story development is worth playing through. The main character development is solid, but the supporting character development is a bit			"

												Now I'm gonna start the review off by saying this is one of my favourite DMC games and I stick by my opinion despite playing the others and supposdly being a ""die hard dmc fan""Pros- Combat is fluent and easier to access for new comers- Variety of weapons to suit different playstyles (something like 4 melee weapons and 3 guns)- The soundtrack is amazing and adds to the atmosphere (the music might not be for everyone but it adds to the tension)- Costume change can do it's to give you old DanteCons- Jump puzzles are a little too repeated during level design in my opinion- Mobs have a chance of randomly freaking out and getting stuck on the levels invisible walls- The new Dante won't be for everyone ConclusionOne of my favourit DMC games due to the change of pace with combat and music, too many jump puzzles for my taste 7.5/10			"

You WILL feel like a total badass and that's a promise.If you're not sure if you should play because you're an old-school Dante fan, then buy the DLC and play as classic Dante and stop missing out this great game.One hell of a Hack & Slash! 8/10			"

												Genre: Action-Adventure Platformer / Hack and SlashSub-Genre: Hardcore Hack and SlashAtmosphere: 10/10 - The scenery in this game is absolutely breathtaking with art visuals you could chew on for hours. Due to the nature of the gameplay, the background is consistently changing as you progress. This was no lazy task, my friend. The atmosphere immediately immerses you into the world of DMC the second you turn it on.Sound: 10/10 - Every slice, every shot, every dodge, & every grapple have their own unique sounds. I did not find one recycled sound track throughout the entire game. They are all loud, pronounced, and crisp.Gameplay: 11/10 - You have five weapons to play with and upgrade: A sword, an axe, a scythe, two guns, and a gauntlet. You have the power to switch these out seamlessly, connecting different weapons for different combos to decimate your enemies. It is fun and easy to get innovative. This game has new game plus, as well as seven difficulty settings to play through. On top of that, there is another game mode called Bloody Palace Mode where you fight hordes of enemies as long as you can, eventually facing each boss as long as you can survive. Points earned in that mode carry over to the normal campaign.You can compare this game to it's Eastern counterpart if you want to, but why butt heads just for the sake of butting heads?Ninja Theory took an already developed franchise - some argue not yet fully developed - and rebooted it.They changed the look, they changed the feel, they changed Dante - they changed Devil May Cry.Does that automatically make it bad? To some it does, and for those people they can negate it's existence all they want. But for the other curious brains out there I can tell you that whether you're a fan of the original or not, this is one solid hardcore hack and slash. "

												     Definitely one of the coolest games I've ever played. I can see many people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about betrayal of the original series... But I think it is a step for the better. I've played through DMC IV before and only thing I found better there was much more complex Dante's gunplay. But apart from that, I've found this game to be better in every conceivable way: STORY:     Although Dante's attitude in DMC IV and I suppose the previous games was no doubt cool, I found it a little bit too much anime-y and cliché. In this prequel, Dante is younger, confident, straight-forward, care-free rebel, as lovable as the older himself and much more relatable, mostly because player is able to discover Dante as he discovers himself in the story. The story itself holds together beautifully despite being heavily varied, and story elements like demons, angels and Limbo not only make sense, but they add insane cool factor. Everything in the story works in favor of bringing you the best possible feeling, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is rare.      Character-wise, the cast is not by any means extensive. Besides Dante, his brother Vergil, Vergil's protegeé Kat and four or five antagonists you will sooner or later face as bosses, there is only Phineas, a pacifist blind demon with mechanical eye trapped in Limbo that will help Dante along the way. Other than those are just mindless demons to kill. But don't worry, those few are able to carry to story without any struggle.GAMEPLAY:     The core of the gameplay is of course the exquisite complex combat system. It is easy to handle, yet tricky to master. There are few basic actions that player controls, and then there are variables, such as timing, chaining combos, which angel or demon weapon is player currently using, which firearm... Player with enough skill can use this system to great depth. It may seem as too much at first, but as you get more and more acquainted with the system, the more sense it makes. You start developing different strategies for different enemies, and most importantly, you'll develop your own style of gameplay. The tools this game offers you can bring a great variety of approaches to defeating your enemies. Having said that, I must also mention that this applies mostly for the meelee weapons, since I felt that firearms were of little significance and power, and besides specific cases, I had no need to use them at all.      Another part of gameplay is platforming. Dante's controls are quite fluent and easy, so if there is any difficulty to platforming, i lies in design, not in controls. The platforming also benefits a great deal from tools such as Angel Lift and Demon Whip, which not only add variety, but also a new dynamic and occasionaly even logic elements, not to mention their use in combat.     When the combat and platforming clash together, a boss fight is born. Boss fights in DMC are a true testament to the gameplay mechanics. Not only are you forced to use a great variety of your skills to even survive them, but you also have to look for bosses' weak spots, come up with specific strategies and really put yourself into the fight.      DmC also relies heavily upon exploration and replayability. Although there is no open world and the way to reach the progression of the story is never more than one, the game offers many side tracks leading to items or challenges. You can also revisit all the locations after you acquire a new set of skills, and try to reach prizes that you were not able to before. A great deal of replayability lies it the many levels of difficulty you can replay the game on and test your skills. GRAPHICS:     DmC is one of the most beautiful games I, as a graphic designer by trade, ever played. It doesn't rely upon revolutionary, cutting-edge technology (Although its technological level is quite high as well), but rather on style. Majority of actual gameplay happens after Dante is pulled into Limbo, a twisted version of whatever setting he was currently in, where he can utilise all of his nephilim powers. And it is the idea Limbo that allowed the artists and developers of the game bring in the real twisted beauty DmC has to offer. Be it the city rotting under the rule of demons, night club reality changing to the beat of the music or old mansion where Dante and Vergil spent their early childhood, a great amount of detail and thought can be seen anywhere. And not only that, your surroundings can change at any given moment in the story, bringing you a new, breathtaking sight or often fast-paced platforming challenge.      Design of characters and enemies is equally thought out and accordingly twisted. Artists were able to avoid too much cliché in design, yet were able to preserve the feeling any given enemy or boss should emmit. If the Succubus is supposed to be disgusting, be well damn sure it looks disgusting as hell! SOUND:    The general coolness of the game of course wouldn't be complete without equally cool soundtrack, and it was delivered. Music selected fits the vibe of the game and really helps to increase the immersion. I have nothing more to say about that. Great work on the music.      In conclusion I'd say that DmC is truly a great game. It bring all its elements to nearly perfection. It is unapologetic, cool and action-packed, yet refined and masterfully executed. There are many fans of the original series that are hating the changes, but that is just how some fans are, narrow-minded and blindfolded by the things they love. There is no point in arguing, so don't waste time and rather go play one of the best games of 2013, DmC: Devil May Cry.9/10TIPS:     Learn how to use your weapons. Each of them is good for something else. Rebellion is universal, Osiris is great against groups of enemies and also for juggling them in the air, where most of them are helpless, Aquila is weaker than Osiris, but is great at crowd control, since it allows you to pull a number of enemies to you, stagger many enemies in one attack, trap them for a while and even transform dante into tornado of hits that carries enemies along. On the other hand, demon weapons are more fit for fighting single, strong enemies, since they shatter shields and knock back smaller ememies. Arbiter has heavy strikes, that can leave Dante exposed for quick attack if timed incorectly, but are devastating when they land. Also, Arbiter has some pretty powerful long distance attacks. Eryx is more complex than Arbiter, since timing is everything with it. It can be quicker than Arbiter, but at the same time weaker. The catch is that every attack is chargeable and has three levels of power, last one being among the most powerful moves you can perform in the game. It has also some area-of-effect moves that damage all the enemies about. The key to quick and cool destruction of your enemies is not only learning their weaknesses, but also forming combos with different weapons in quick succession. Every weapons has a moment after first two basic attacks, when if you wait until the weapons shines a little and then proceed with another basic attack, another combo starts that is more powerfull, more specific or has a different effect. The great thing about this that you can use to your advantage is that in the moment of waiting to start this different combo you can switch weapons and do the special combo of another weapon. For instance, you can do two quick slashes with Rebellion or Osiris and the swich to Arbiter's special combo, Trinity Smash, which does thrice the damage as Arbiter's usual last attack, and you can achieve this devastation in much shorter time that using the two slow initial attacks of Arbiter.       I also have to recommend downloading the Bloody Palace addon. It's free, it's easy way to learn how to use weapons and fight enemies, also to earn orbs, and, most importantly, it's fun, especially if you are in mood for some DmC action right away.  "

												I have not played the previous DMC games, for whatever that is worth or not worth to some people, but I have thoroughly enjoyed this reboot.Things might start out a bit slow in the beginning when you haven't yet unlocked all the goodies and combos, but it's a nice way to pass the time once things get rolling, which is greatly supplemented by the free ""Bloody Palace"" DLC, which basically puts you in a survival mode of sorts, going up against tougher baddies, bosses, as well as the tougher versions of the tougher baddies, for as long as your heart desires - something I felt sorely missing in MGR: Revengenana.In fact, the only gripe I really have with the game are the weapon- or, rather, color-specific demons, which can break the flow of the combat early on, though this is less noticable later, when you've upgraded said weapons.If you sometimes want to slice♥♥♥♥♥♥up for a couple of hours, then this might just be the game for you. Especially if you can get it on sale. Seriously - Bloody Palace. Try it.			"

Lo que no quita es su buena historia y sus personajes bien trabajados. Un remake que ha creado un universo donde sus personajes estan en tiempos mas comunes a los nuestros y les aseguro que lo disfrutaran. Requisito para disfrutar del juego: ser capaz de quitarse la negacion por nuestro viejo y querido Dante clasico pues todo lo demas, este es un gran juego.			"

												I'm pretty late with this, considering that I bought the game a week after its release, because I had to look at DmC with quite an ambivalence.After giving it some thought now I decided it's time for my take:This game is for you if:-you like the devil may cry franchise and are not offended by this being a reboot-you can stomach juvenile personalities and  a not-so-ambitious story about a ""...schizophrenic world that is being continuously corrupted by the corporate big boss and his lackeys, where you play as the cool guy with super powers that tries to save the world with his fancy weapons and never misses the opportunity for a witty(?) comment.""-you actually know what this game's story and characters are like and don't mind/care-you like fast paced action, a lot of room for creating cool combos and all that with fancy graphics (they really are fancy)-you like to squeeze every last drop out of the provided gameplay mechanics and spend hours and hours to master the game AND feel rewarded for it-you just want to hop into a game, not having to care about anything that is being said, and simply unload on monsters-you like combichrist and noisia (or that type of music in general)-you played the other DMCs and had issues with their difficulty (this game is VERY forgiving)This game is NOT for you if:-you hate NinjaTheory (and their disrespect towards the fans of the franchise that were not a 100% convinced that this game is/was the second coming) and this seems like a compelling argument to you-you really care about a well written, original story/characters/dialogues  -  feels like a stereotypical teenager's take on DMC-challenging boss fights are a must for you (there are 6ish bosses that feel like recoloured/textured versions of another - except for the very last one, that one is really good)-you expect a similar skill cap to DMC 3/4 and combo variety of that level - DmC is infinitely easier and the difference between 100 hours and 1000 hours of gameplay/practice is marginal -you want a built-in turbo mode (there is a mod for this tho)For a diehard DMC fan like me it was really difficult to give this game a proper review.I mean, look at how awkward it is, even after all this time.I've spent more than a thousand hours on DMC 3/4 on multiple platforms and versions and have yet to master them. DmC has nothing left to show me after the 100+ hours I put into it - good 100+ hours I admit.Unlike with the former two games, I'm done with this one.Conclusion:This game is good and you should buy it.Do not expect D'M'C, this is DmC - keep that in mind and you will have a great time.

												A fantastic game that had me wanting to continue playing it constantly. The story is great and is similar to Devil May Cry 1 & 3. To those who think the ""New Dante"" Ruined the series, I urge you to reconsider for I thought that way as well. This game is beautiful and the music isn't that bad. This game is simply terrific and is the only game this year that has failed to bore me so far.			"

												I really recommend this game. It's just awesome, the design of environment and levels is amazing, Limbo really looks incredible. Gameplay is also fantastic, you have a lot of weapons and combo attacks which keeps you in game until you learn every move... And when you learn enough moves you're going to have a lot of fun in Bloody Palace. Story is great, some people of course don't like the ,,new'' Dante and Vergil but everyone have different opinion. I like new Dante, maybe he's not good like the old one but he's also not bad like a lot of people say he is. The soundtrack fits perfectly in game like in every other DMC. Everyone who loves older DMC games definitely has to try this one! Yes it's a bit different but i think you're going to like it.			"

												Despite Dantes radical new look I can safely say that Ninja theory has satisfied me (a hardcore DMC fan). I was incredibly sceptical going into this revamp of the franchise as would any fan of a series if the main caracter got a facelift but after playing through the entire story 3 times I have several things to say:- Gameplay was both familiar yet edgy, the new weapon switching system flowed faster and as hard as it sounds made the combat even more engaging.- Story, The story was great if you put aside your complaints about his looks Dante acts no different to any other DMC with his smartass comments and his edgy moves and if you hardcore fans can make it to the end you will be pleasantly suprised.- The art style was different and if you actually notice the HD options in the menu (sadly I only found it on my second play through) you can clearly see that it is not just a simple conole port. The level design feels a little too straight forward for my tastes but the secrets were fun to find.			"

												Not only is this a really fun Hack and Slash, it's one of the best out there.I finished this game in one sitting because I could not get enough of the amazing story and beautiful graphics. Not to mention the combat is some of the best I've ever seen, and the PC port is really solid. This is a definite must-buy. HOWEVER, PLAY THIS GAME WITH A CONTROLLER. YOU WILL NEED LIKE 12 HANDS TO PLAY THIS ON A KEYBOARD.			"

												Probably a more beginner-friendly DMC game than DMC 4, but you can still crank up the difficulty to get a more hardcore, challenging, and rewarding experience just like you can get with DMC 4. PROS:+Cool and spectacular visuals and level altering effects in each stage+Music by Noisia (if you're a fan of them)+In DMC 4 I found the controls to be a little bit clunky compared to DmC, but you could also argue that it just adds a layer of mechanical execution that enhances the challenge and feeling of mastery. In DmC, though, they provided what I thought to be a really clever and usable way to switch weapons on-the-fly and mid-combo (making use of both triggers to let you use ""demon"" or ""angel"" weapons without having to reach over to the D pad). Makes it easier to come up with combos that span multiple weapons.+Dante's dialogue and behavior is so over-the-top and irreverent that you kinda have to stop taking it seriosly and just laugh at it.+Ability to play at higher difficulty levels to experience the challenge you may have felt when playing earlier DMC games+Ranking system and leaderboards to encourage you to develop skill and mastery (absolutely necessary for this sort of game to be any fun)CONS-In DMC 4, you had a lot of different enemy types and it seemed you could mostly hit all of them with whatever weapons you wanted. In DmC, some enemies have an ""element"", meaning you can only damage them with one type of weapon. I found this to be kind of annoying. You might say that it adds a layer of challenge for high-level play that wasn't present in earlier DMC games, though.-Some of the platform sections feel like they go on for too long and can get boring.Overall, veterans of DMC will probably prefer sinking more hours into DMC 4. I'd recommend this for newcomers to this series or to hack and slash games in general. If you have a Wii U, though, and you're looking for an excellent hack and slash, I'd recommend Bayonetta 2 over this.			"

The combat isn't as intrigue as Devil May Cry 3, but that is in no way a deterrent from playing this fantastic game.Some of the dialogue is cheesy but so was that from all the entries to this series. Dante may not sport the silver hair but that doesnt change anything.Look past the asthetics of the previous games of this series and you will find a true gem worth playing.9/10			"

												I fully understand that this reboot ""divided"" the DMC fanbase and that some absolutely hate the new version of Dante. But as a dude who's played all the Devil May Cry games (my favorite is the third), I can't lie - I actually REALLY liked this. I think it might be one of the best action games I've played in recent memory. If that makes me not a ""real"" Devil May Cry fan, then so be it. For me, the combat just feels so GOOD. Some people say that it's too easy or not as deep as the older games, which is possibly true, seeing that I regularly get SS or SSS ranks in DmC and rarely did in DMC4. But switching between sword, angelic scythe, devil axe, fiery gauntlets, heaven ninja stars and three different types of gun is such seamless fun, and I love the smooth way that Dante controls and the slightly simplified button inputs. This plus the fact that for once in a Devil May Cry I have almost complete control over the camera is just a dream to me, and a sign of what the old games could have achieved if they didn't have fixed camera angles. (Some people like fixed cameras; I kinda don't, especially when I'm trying to juggle an enemy and the dang view changes on me in mid-air.) There's plenty of other solid stuff in DmC if you're willing to give it a chance - the game's colorful, with bright levels that change on you and some fun environmental traversal aspects that reminded me a little of Prince of Persia and Castlevania, since Dante's got a whip he can use to latch onto platforms. The story kept me engaged more than all other DMC games with the exception of DMC3, but I've seen some folks saying that they absolutely abhorred it, so your enjoyment may vary. Dante isn't as much of an ""emo edgelord"" as they say he is; he's really more of a punk than anything else, and by the end of the game he becomes more like the old Dante we know and love. (Yes, his hair turns white.) Vergil is quite different; he was your typical silent anime assassin badass in the past and they made him into more of a Julian Assange-sorta character here. I think a lot of people probably hate how much he talks in the game, but hey, he controls awesomely in his DLC epilogue.In short, I dug DmC. I can completely understand why people despised it, since Capcom sprung this reboot on a fanbase that didn't think restarting the whole franchise was necessary. But IMHO, this has ended up as my second-favorite Devil May Cry, and I think it's a shame that we're unlikely to see a DmC 2 after the mixed reception this got. (Maybe I'm wrong. I hope so!)			"

The various weapons are sick too, and there is a pretty extensive skilltree. The game doesn't take that long to finish, but you can try to speedrun the game or score attack certain levels if you want to. Definitely worth picking up on sale, otherwise it might be a bit short to justify the price.			"

												My game of the year for 2015. Sure it's not new but MAN was I missing out. I almost never complete games but I blitzed through this one in a couple days. The boss fights were incredibly creative. Fantastic effort.Technical notes: This ran consistently at 70-90 fps on Ultra settings at 2160p on a single GTX970. It's not the most graphically advanced game but it still looks damn good and had no discernable latency at 4K. Thank God.I'd recommend a controller for this - there isn't mouse support in the menus. That's one of very few negatives I can think of honestly.			"

												NOTE: To have no spoiler avoid mousing over black areas and perhaps names or things related to something later, can be hidden or modified. So I believe that anyone can read without fear of receiving any compromising information, however, should this occur notify me in the comments and it will be changed.""DmC: Devil May Cry"" this is a Reboot (Maybe not so true that it is a reboot, after all it is an alternate reality, or even part of the story and tells how it happened before the ""DMC3 "") of consecrated franchise"" Devil May Cry "", which was produced and only developed by CAPCOM, however this new development project was given by the"" Ninja Theory ""she being supervised by it. The game was released in its final version on January 24, 2013.A whole reimagining was proposed: characters, settings as well as throughout history, have been completely redesigned and given a Western perspective in contrast to the other background games (or predecessors) of the franchise.Two things were kept and that all give a special touch to the game is its incredibly fluid gameplay and its heavy songs that dictate the pace of the game, being frantic as all other franchise. Something has changed and I particularly liked a lot was the fact that Dante not be the son of a devil with a human, but the son of a devil with an angel making him a ""Nephilim"" .  Unfortunately this change has changed the transformation and become something which was actually just a frenzy mode and not really a transformation. Fortunately with this exchange brought other functions, including the use of specific weapons for each character so leaving everything more dynamic, more than in other games.“DmC: Devil May Cry - Which Devil Trigger Looks The Best? ” - All Transformations

On the gameplay, portray that is so defined as in other games in the franchise. The MODE 1 transitions, 2 & 3 may be made temporarily by pressing a button while making combos or even permanently, where just push a button will make the change and it will remain so until the player decides.The style meter can stimulate very well the player to show all their potential, as well as the game. After all to get better scores is necessary to make long combos and using various weapons, this is a great way to stimulate the purchase of upgrades for all weapons and not just those most adapted, as this may not be enough to have RANK high : Dirty, Cruel, Brutal, Anarchic, Savage, SSadistic & SSSensational.Combos with the secrets discovered phase, the more time gameplay give a certain score with RANK by respective multipliers. consumed items and deaths have negatively to your score, and item equals - x points and deaths equals - x% of points received. Find all the secrets ensures RANK permanent SSS on the stage, however for this is not so simple, because even in the early stages are inaccessible locations and which can only be discovered when the advance further in the game, getting the necessary upgrades, return those phases and repeat all the way.The game has several game modes, the first with 3 levels and the rest of modes, including Bloody Palace will only be unlocked after completing the game the first time.Something that pleased me a lot is that all modes are connected, by that I mean that no matter what stage you choose all your upgrades will be available, regardless of your game mode and it makes a huge difference.About the extras each time complete the game again is received images and skins as a bonus, other items can be unlocked as well.Plot summary: The story is set in Limbo City, a modern city secretly controlled by demons, manipulating humanity through the comforts of life, with demons living in a parallel plan - Limbo. Living on the margins of society and out of the brainwashing is Dante, a young man in conflict with the demons that constantly try to kill him, and the civilian authorities that control them. Dante is warned by Kat who is in danger and she with her psychic can help him escape from Limbo which was sucked there. After this time he is invited to meet the head of ""The Order."" After being aware about the organization and about your goal. Dante finds out about his past and his connection with the head of the organization. In the course of events the three characters follow the goal of ridding the world of demons, going after the major cause of all corruption. Things that caught my attention in particular:- Excellent Soundtrack.- Great gameplay, despite the available arsenal numberless.- Story surroundings.DmC: Devil May Cry received mixed reviews, both by changes in character as for thinking that there would be changes in gameplay, such as if he had the rebellion the person would not play and the like. This was, as already mentioned, because the very CAPCOM wanted to give a new look, so much so that if it were not so the Ninja Theory have worked the new designer in the old character. However that look based on ""The Dark Knight"" was great. Even with all the changes the game has not lost its characteristics as many have pointed out, I say this as someone who played their other versions for PS2, this fantastic and well fluid. His songs are so good and its replay factor is as big as the other versions. His story despite trying a touch of reality to the game remains interesting and certainly the game is worth.Some of the links used as reference in the analysis of the construction:https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/DmC:_Devil_May_Cryhttp://www.saraivaconteudo.com.br/Materias/Post/49917http://www.arkade.com.br/devil-may-cry-ganhara-reboot-novo-jogo-trailer/ https://eugostodejogar.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/dmc-o-reboot-da-serie-devil-may-cry/ For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit  steamified [steamified.com].

												This is an Amazing game. A true spectacle and a must-have for anybody who loves Hack'n'Slash Platformers!Don't be discouraged from getting the game by people who hate on it just because it isn't exactly the same like a previous installment of DmC. This game is unique and a completely different retelling of the story, but that does not mean it is bad!If you enjoy slaying hordes of enemies and huge, actually fun bosses, as well as a challenge (altho you might need to go through the game a few times before you can actually unlock higher difficulties, which is really not much of  a problem since the game has excellent replayability and tons of secrets), this will be a real treat for you!Make sure you get the Vergil's Downfall DLC if you want the full Experience of the game, it lets you play as Vergil and continues the story of the original game, with new enemies, weapons, secrets and more!A really, really underrated game. As you complete the game you will not only get access to more difficulties, but also new costumes you can use for your character, and none of the points you've collected during gameplay will ever get lost! If you start a new game at any difficulty, you will still have all your Upgrades and points, meaning the game has tremendous replay value!			"

												played all the original devil may cry games as a kid/teenager, loved them to bits, but only picked this up recently in humble bundle capcom. i'll start with CONS first because there's not many- 30 fps locked cinematics (i play at 144 hz so it rips me out of the atmosphere of the game completely)- wierd menus with no mouse or advanced graphics options- Dante is a hipser in an alternate british inspired universe that isn't conanical to the originals (big annoyance for me)- Not enough weapon upgrades to spend hoarding skill points on.PROS THOUGH! - lives up to the franchise in attitude, combat, style- beautiful visuals- new and creative enemies that include air combat a LOT more than the original games- FLUID AS ♥♥♥♥ combat, with the toggle switching weapon system, it's a lot more dynamic.- Grappling hooks- QT 3.14 female sidekick- plays surprisingly well on keyboard and mouse, if you're unable to fetch a controller8/10 so far, really enjoying it.

It's a really good game, with challenge missions hidden around, but gets difficult at / after the 3rd difficulty, cause enemies actually try to kill you.Upgrades, open world, explore, character progression, plot twists, and combo points. Typical beat-em-up style game. Worth it if you ask me.			"

												Extremely polished and edgy with some really sexy and sultry characters. This is a game that can shown to a group of people who will be enthralled the whole time while watching the story unfold around you while you are killing tons of crazy looking demons in multiple flashy ways. I loved the cutscenes and the presentation. Just play the first 15 minutes and you'll see why I love this game so much.			"

												A very solid hack a slash.  Story is pretty lacking in character development, but there is enough to get you through.  The amount of weapons and the switching between combos let's you addictively slaughter everything in the most stylish way possible.  If you enjoy trying to get better with combos and such, it's a solid game.  It is quite easier than the other devil may crys though.			"

												overall a great reboot to the series and highly recommended to old and new playersthe good:- the combat is great and fluid, mixing between weapons is awesome - great graphics and very amazing and creative art style. - killer soundtrack, a mix between electronic and industrial metal - the story is good yet predictable but unfolds in a great way.- all the modes from dmc 4 are here ( heaven and hell, hell or hell, DmD..etc)the bad:- the platforming sections are boring and takes away from the fun - the last few missions are way less fun than the others (too much platforming and less combat) even the story takes a dip too- boss battles, very easy even on the harder difficulties.the neutral: (bad for me but might be good to others)- the game is on the easy side, Much easier than 3.

												This game has been sat, uninstalled, for a long time in my library.As an avid fan of the original series I must admit I was dubious about this reboot.Having said that I very much enjoyed this game and below I will try to cover it in detail why.There were definately issues with the narrative & Ninja Theory were obviously trying to suggest a political undertone relating to today but the story was at least unique & it managed to keep me enaged for the duration. 'New Dante' is a common problem I see reported online & though he may be a little jarring to fans of the old titles, he did grow on me.I won't comment on the graphics at this point in time as I had to resort to an old GPU not long into my gameplay.I very much enjoyed the music in the old games, the combination of metal & classical scores suited the gothic theme they were trying to portray. This is not what you will find in this new iteration, but the new mix of heavy rock and drum & bass definately suits the new narrative.The one area I think this game really shines is combat mechanics. The way you can switch between weapons & continue combo's is fluid & very satisfying. Ninja Theory did a great job of making the weapons feel unique & have impact when attacking enemies. They have very much captured the feel of the original 'hack & slash' series & in all honestly have improved on the gameplay of the old games.In summary if you're a fan of the original series then this game is definately worth a purchase, if you're a little unsure then maybe wait for a sale. Either way if you're a fan of this genre of game then it isn't worth missing!One final note: Having completed the title, could I see new Dante become original Dante?.....Sure....now you want to give it a try right?!

												This is a really excellent character action game that didn't overstay its welcome.  It has an involved and complicated combat system - much more so that the Batman games which are basically ""press A for awesome"".  Even as a newcomer to the series and relatively inexperienced character action gamer, the combat was intuitive and rewarding to master.The plot was somewhat standard but was done well even so.  The game is beautiful and has a great deal of variety in enemy design, combat scenarios, and bosses.  I kept thinking I would put it down, but I ended up finishing it in 2 settings.  The difficulty gradually increases but does so in a more or less fair manner.  It has all the nice Steam features (cloud, trading cards, etc).Really an excellent game all around and well worth the (discounted) price I paid.			"

												Before you read this review, you should keep in-mind that I've never played a Devil May Cry game before so I don't know how it compares to past games. With that said, DmC: Devil May Cry is a pretty great game with enjoyable gameplay and a surprisingly good story. THE PROS: Surpisingly good story that has a mix of seriousness and jokes.Fun gameplay that has a ""Stylish"" system -- you earn more points by doing combos that uses a variety of different attacks, and not just the same moves over and over again.As the story progresses, you see Dante go from ""not caring"" about anything to actually caring about everything.Great level design full of secrets.You unlock new weapons/abilties as you progress.Weapons and abilities can be upgraded with skill points -- or even new abilities can be unlocked with skill points.Beating the game on higher difficulties will unlock even higher diffculties multiple times, encouraging multiple play-throughs.Some cool unlockable skins.Practice mode.Around 10 hours until you beat the game. THE MIXED: Some may find the game kinda repetitive.Some may also find the game too ""try hard"" and/or cheesy for their taste.And of course, some may not like Dante's new design (however, I am personally fine with it). THE CONS: I personally found the final boss fight and ending to be kinda dissapointing.Some fights are more annoying/tedious than fun. THE VERDICT:  8.5/10 ""Between Great and Amazing"" DmC: Devil May Cry really is a great game, and I do recommend it. If you get the game, play it on the Nephilim (hard) diffculty, as it will provide a more challenging and rewarding gameplay experience than the other starting difficulties. "

												I had heard of this franchise over the years, but I hadn’t ever played it myself before. DmC – Devil May Cry is an action adventure platformer from Ninja Theory and Capcom. Let’s get rocking.The GoodThe first thing that really struck me about DmC was how good the graphics looked. I was playing on lower graphical settings (for the sake of performance) and the game still looked better than a good handful of games that are brand new. They were seriously well done.After gawking at the graphics, I next came to the actual animations. Everything is incredibly fluid: combat, walking, jumping, everything. Even if you’re the laziest, most pathetic mortal on the face of the planet, you can’t help but to feel badass while you’re playing this game. That is just how good the animations make everything look.The next thing that I came to that just impressed the hell right out of me, was the upgrade system. While you are in the store upgrading your abilities or your weapons, I discovered the best upgrade system I had ever seen in a game like this. First of all there is an option for you to try out the upgrade before you commit points to it. That’s right. The game let’s you try out the ability or upgrade before you buy it. Secondly, once you’ve purchased the ability/upgrade, if you end up finding out that you don’t like it or you don’t ever use it you can take the points out (free of charge) and immediately put them into something else. Every game should have this.The music is pretty good. I recall seeing Combichrist being mentioned in the credits and another band, but I can’t remember who. That being said, Combichrist was an excellent choice for this game as their contributions to the soundtrack really went well with all the action.Enemy design was pretty cool. Normally, when I think about demons, I’m thinking about big, fleshy, horned monsters that run amok and torment everyone in their path. This was not even close to the case in DmC however. Demons (while some do have fleshy bits) are mostly made from what looks like metal, ceramics, and bone. It was a very interesting take on demonic entities (and, albeit, a refreshing one).Boss design (with the exception of Mundus) was also really cool. Let’s just say that the Succubus is not going to look like your expectations in the slightest.The BadDmC started out with a great story. There were great cutscenes, dialogue, a giant Hunter Demon with a ridiculously cool voice. However, as the game went on, the quality of the dialogue and the story went steadily downhill. By the end of the game things had become so predictable that I felt like I was watching some edgy 90’s teen movie.The MehThe game is pretty short. I blazed through it in right around seven hours.There is a marked lack of gore in most of the game. I suppose this makes sense as (I mentioned above) most of the demons you fight are made from materials other than flesh and blood.Verdict: YeaDmC is a great game and a great addition to any collection. If you’re a fan of the franchise, you’ll no doubt love it. If you’re new to the franchise, I’m pretty sure that you’ll love it all the same. It has a bit of a steep price tag (especially for how short it is), but, if it went on sale, I’d most certainly snag a copy. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												This, unlike the third game, is a very well done PC port. I played it a long time ago and just noticed I forgot to recommend it!+ the graphics are quite awesome considering the system requirements aren't set that high+ the combat (flow): Out of all Devil May Cry games I've played, this one has the second best flowing combat (right after DMC3). If you played DMC4 you probably remember that some enemies were really badly designed: either extremely annoying to beat in a group or designed to only be attackable when they show a weakness, which takes away from combat flow. Do you remember? Well, good news and bad news: it's not as bad as it was in DMC4, but it still is restrictive in this edition of the game for some enemies that can only be attacked by a specific type of weapon. In the definitive edition of this game they changed this but, alas, definitive edition is not available on PC. ♥♥♥♥ me, right? I'm still giving the game a plus for this because they improved it from DMC4. It's really not bad.+ the combat (animations): really nothing to criticize here. Dante tears the enemies apart with an elegance and smoothness I've not seen before in this series. I like the combat animations very much.+ the combat (ease of use): the combat is user friendly. Very minor weapon spoilers here, it shouldn't ruin your experience but I'm putting a spoiler tag anyway: There are 2 angelic weapons and 2 demonic ones (and 3 guns), switching between them is quicker than in other games since they come in pairs. You'll know what I mean after little time in the game.. There are not THAT many combos for each weapon but you can combo one weapon into another (by switching weapon DURING a combo), allowing for more combo depth.+/- The story is not that exciting+/- The depth/personality of the characters is okay/meh, depending on taste.- Combat depth, a minor point for me. I know I mentioned above in a POSITIVE point that the combat is easy to learn and easier to master than in, say, DMC4 (Dante) or DMC3. But while I don't care about this much, they simplified the combat somewhat by taking things like style switching away which raised the skill ceiling by a lot. Again, it's not that much of a negative point for me, but it objectively reduces combat depth somewhat so I only find it fair to mention it here.- Combat controls. Most of them feel fine, but I had an issue with two of them on my Xbox360 pad. One was the special gun move for which you have to press A and X at the same time, and the second the devil trigger for which you have to press both L3 and R3 at the same time. Half of the time I wouldn't press them at the exact same time leading to me failing to do what I was intending to do and instead doing some other move that messes the combat up. Instead of using one of the shoulder buttons for, say, the special gun move, BOTH shoulder buttons actually have the same function...WHY!? You CAN rebind those moves, so it is not a problem for me anymore BUT: for some reason, you cannot rebind the devil trigger key in the ingame config. You have to do it manually in the config file, and I see no reason for this to be necessary. Minor negative point for inconvenience.- I'm not a fan of the devil trigger mechanic. It is powerful, yes, but I don't like it. Basically, you use it less often than in other DMC since it takes longer to charge, but it about doubles your damage and makes all (non-boss) enemies unable to act or defend themselves. It should feel powerful, yes, but DMC3/4 had plenty powerful devil triggers that still wouldn't save you from getting beaten up if you perform badly.- I like the cheeky Dante from the other parts in the series more. This one is more rebellious and more of a ""♥♥♥♥ you"" guy than the cheeky, taunting Dante I know.			"

												I haven't played the others, but as a standalone this is a really good game.The combat is super fun, it's not just spamming. Theres interesting combos that you unlock and different weapons you hold a key to use, similar to God of War, but less inconvieniant. It doesn't just throw health at you either which keeps it from being too easy.The levels are good to explore, really nicely designed. The collectables in the environment attract you to them in a really unique way, and fit perfectly with the art style.The platforming sections aren't exactly challenging but they're entertaining enough. The fast paced sections really keep the action flowing so long as you know what you're doing. I find alot of games never quite get a good balance, though this one is leaning towards the easy side.The art style suits the game and the cinematography complements it brilliantly. The music (which is actually the reason I bought the game) also matches really well and makes the experiance a whole lot more fun. The animations flow really well with both the environment and enemies. Final kill shots, using your last attack on the last enemy, always seem to look great. The characters (which I thought were terrible at first) each quickly show they aren't♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even with the cool guy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the start and that occasionally surfaces, Dante's a pretty cool guy that doesn't afraid of anything. Oh and the facial models and animations are pretty flawless I'd say, not quite HL2 but better than any AssCreed.I am so pleasantly suprised with this game, fun as ♥♥♥♥/10.			"

The story is a bit good vs evil cliche, but who minds that in this genre?Best played with a controller.  I beat it with a keyboard and felt like I was fighting the game a bit.  Mechanics are easy to pick up.  There's plenty of moves to master, but most are not required to finish the game.  The game is a bit linear, but it's hardly a surpsise.  When you play this type of game, it's expected and doesn't really take away from the games focus...action.Audio and visuals are top notch.  The game sounds and looks fantastic.  It's hard not to get pumped up during the early stages of the game before the newness wears off.			"

												This review will have SPOILERS! I absolutley recommend this game! All those salty O.G. fan boys that are upset cause Dante doesn't have white hair are just that, salty fan boys. This is a REBOOT! It's supposed to be different! This game is an incredible hack and slash adventure with a pretty great stroy. I genuinely bought all of the characters and the chemistry they all shared. The combos are easy enough to learn but difficult to master which makes multiple playthroughs of levels to get better ratings something you'll do often. But let's go step by step through the game.SPOILER: Dante does infact get white hair for real at the end of the game. Not just an alternate outfit but his character actually has it. When you selct an alternate costume or weapon skin, STANDARD is thw rod used to describe the things dante has and looks like in the beginning. After you BEAT THE GAME, standard is used for a WHITE HAIRED, PAILER Dante, because he used his Devil Trigger and it gave him white hair. IT WAS A BRILLIANT MOVE BY THE DEVELOPERS AT NINJA THEORY. He get's it when he uses his Devil Trigger to defeat Vergil so anyone HATING this game for the lack of white hair CLEARLY DID NOT PLAY THE GAME TO COMPLETION.Story:8/10Short Version: Very god story for a reboot and to me, more engaging than the original Devil May Cry (the first one not the full series) Dante finds Vergil, fights Satan, and tries to save the world. the game ends on a perfect note and sets up a sequel the right way! Long Version: So like I said, this is a reboot and Dante has no idea he is half angel and half demon (even though his sword has obvioulsy materialized from nothing before and he's been to Limbo multiple times according to him.) So we open with a nightclub party and Dante taking girls to his trailor on the pier. A Hunter demon shows up and Kat, the new love interest, shows up in Limbo to warn Dante that the demons have finally found him. He follows and finds the group known as the Order that she works for. His brother, Vergil, is actually the leader of this group and shows Dante who he really is. Dante agrees to help fight back against Mundus who is essentially the Devil. Hack and slash, platforming, and running around ensues as you fight back against the Demons. The Demons have essentially taken over Earth by taking control of the media and a soft drink with demon chemicals in it. Dante takes down both problems and fights Mundus with his brother. Vergil has alterior motives and wants to take over the world but not for evil purposes, just to protect the humans becuase he beleives they are unable to do it themselves. Dante fights him and Vergil dissapears and the credits roll.Gameplay:7/10No lock on function makes aiming a pain if you can't see very well. I never had a single issue during my ENTIRE playthrough without a lock on, but I can see why some may find that annoying. Very fun and fluid combat! Easy combos to learn but more difficult to master. Yes, the S ranking are easier to get than previous DMC games but that doesn't mean they are just given to you. Especially on some groups of enemies. You get multiple wweapons to choose from and some are clearly better than others. Ebony and Ivory aren't even the best gun of the 3 you can choose form which is sort of a let down, but Rebellion is still absolutley insane. Platforming is a blast and the camera hardly gets in your way or fights against you. Generally, you'll use blue (Angel) weapons on blue enemies and red (Devil) weapons on red enemies which makes switching things up in combat a challenge and something you need to do. Devil Trigger is Dante's special ability and it sends every enemy on screen floating and frozen helplessly in the air where you can combo to your heart's content. While I do wish that it just froze time or maybe made Dante faster and stronger, the floating enemies aren't to annoying to hit even when the camera tries to focus away from the one you are hitting.Controls: 9/10Everything you do with this game feels natural. All the buttons are mapped in an amazing way that makes everything feel simple, even through you are balancing 12 weapons at once. I felt myslef utilizing every button on the controller and not even in a clunky way. I can't express enough how great a job Ninja Theory did with getting these controls right. It only misses out on a 10/10 for the controls cause there is 1 button that doesn't get used, the left stick click. The right stick click is used to re-center the camera like most games of this type, but the left stick does nothing. The game lacks a LOCK ON function and they couldn't think to put it on the button they hadn't used yet?Difficulty:6/10Not very challenging on anything below Son of Sparda. Multiple difficulties to play on with some of he higher ones switching up enemie waves and placements for a pretty much completely new playthrough. Fortunately, unlike most games, you only have to beat the game twice to unlock every difficulty rather than having to beat the game on one difficulty to unlock the one above that and so on. Graphics:6/10Not the best looking game on the market and even modest builds could handle it. Just your average, everyday console port!Length:5/104-6 Hours depending on how much you grab along the way. I probably spent a little over an hour total through my run on just checking every corner but a speed run could easily be less than 4 hours. Rather short game but for the genre it isn't unbearable. I wish it would have been longer but that is only because I wanted to play more! Pros:Ease of entry to the series and genreStoryCombat SystemCharacter DevelopmentCons:GraphicsLengthLack of a lock on funtionFinal Verdict: 7/10While the graphics aren't mindblowing and the length leaves you wanting way more, the game does everything else absolutley brilliantly. The character develpoment is on point and, like i said, they set up a sequel with class and it becomes a rebooted franchise that could possibly be better than the original. Still one of the most fun games I have played in a very long time and if you are looking for an amazingly fun time, this is the game for you!			"

												Well, DmCDevil may Cry was a reboot of the fabulous, beloved and awesome Devil May Cry Series, courtesy of Ninja Theory and  CAPCOM. It retells the story of the origins of Dante, Vergil, Sparda and the iconic Eva, in a twist that breaks the cadre of the story from the previous Devil may Cry series.Review: The story was a (bit) half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character development was shallow, and as such, the previous touch and flair that Dante is known for ( Balls, bravery, awesomeness, cool dude) and Vergil's nature ( Loyalty, skill, distaste for firearms, etc) have neen washed away and in their place, are shallow, under-developed and uninspiring characters for whom no fan of devil may Cry series can connect to easily. The fabled Sparda, and his legend is gone. So if you're looking to reconnect to the awesomeness that Devil may Cry used to be, this is not it. It may feel a bit insulting to the series' die-hard fans.Gameplay: Acceotable. Fluid mechanics,  and the camera can get glitchy at times. For the love of all thats' awesome, why did they leave out Lock On to targets out of a hack and slash game? This makes combat cumbersome, especially in Boss Fights (Mundus, anyone? ). The game also has a short learning curve, and as such, new players to the series will be at ease hacking and slashing demons at the comfort of their seats.Graphics: Pretty average. Nothing spectacular. Runs in DirectX9, powered by the Unreal Engine 3. If you're on catalyst (Running an AMD/ATI GPU/APU), ensure you're using the latest driver. The game is known for being glitchy with old versions of AMD Catalyst, and micro-stutter is  relatively common in CrossFire-based systems. Your mileage may vary.The music is great,m if you're into industrial metal. Noisia and CombiChrist worked up quite the charm here, so you'll be in for a blast if its' your kind of thing.Overall rating: 88% in my personal opinion. Despite its shortcomings, this is a great game with excellent gameplay and many hours of fun, especially when you throw in the Vergil's Downfall DLC and the other mode similar to Devil may Cry's 4 Bloody Palace. Again, your mileage may vary. This is a personal opinion and as such, is subject to personal bias.Play the game, and be the judge.			"

												This is my first Devil May Cry game, so all the criticism it's gotten from old-school fans regarding the ""new"" Dante are irrelevant to me :)  The game itself is a lot of fun.  Graphics are very good with everything set to ""ultra"".  Frames never dipped below 60 (check my PC specs in my profile).  The story is interesting, and the dialogues are pretty cool.  Gameplay is very good, combining a ton of weapons, abilities, and moves.  It takes a while to get used to switching between all of them to fit different monsters and environment interactions.  Finding items and collectibles is also fun, although to gain 100% completion you need to go back and replay levels because you won't have every ability needed the first time you tackle most levels.  I'm not into playing games twice (Skyrim and Mass Effect are sole exceptions), but if you do, this game has replayability value.  Finished in 13 hours and gets an A in my book.			"

												(I previously only played DMC1 and 2)Graphics: The game has probably the best art direction I have ever seen for any action slasher. Great twisted take on modern city settings and very unique environments. All this and it runs smooth like butter on my modest PC.Story/Plot: Mostly meh, only some bright moments like Raptor New Network. The Vergil thing at the end was random and illogical.Mechanics: Very solid mechanics and combos. You can switch between weapon types seamlessly and execute a huge variety of combos and setups. Movement has real weight and there are animation transitions between abilities. Attacks are meaty and controls are responsive. Only complaint is that grappling hook spots can just refuse to trigger even though you are clearly in range, leaving you desperately flailing in midair before falling.			"

												This, together with DMC 4 is the best hack'n slash action game on PC ever released. I was sceptical about this game at first, but it's really great. It offers adrenaline pumped soundtrack, crazy level design, and hundreds of possible combos. The combat system is better and more complex than combat system with Nero in DMC4, although probably not as complex as combat with Dante in DMC4. I recommend playing it with a Xbox360 controller, but it's also relatively fine playable with keyboard and mouse. The PC port is very well done and well optimized, without any annoying DRM. If you like action games you won't be disappointed :).			"

												Before you read this review, you should keep in-mind that I've never played a Devil May Cry game before so I don't know how it compares to past games. With that said, DmC: Devil May Cry is a pretty great game with enjoyable gameplay and a surprisingly good story. THE PROS: Surpisingly good story that has a mix of seriousness and jokes.Fun gameplay that has a ""Stylish"" system -- you earn more points by doing combos that uses a variety of different attacks, and not just the same moves over and over again.As the story progresses, you see Dante go from ""not caring"" about anything to actually caring about everything.Great level design full of secrets.You unlock new weapons/abilties as you progress.Weapons and abilities can be upgraded with skill points -- or even new abilities can be unlocked with skill points.Beating the game on higher difficulties will unlock even higher diffculties multiple times, encouraging multiple play-throughs.Some cool unlockable skins.Practice mode.Around 10 hours until you beat the game. THE MIXED: Some may find the game kinda repetitive.Some may also find the game too ""try hard"" and/or cheesy for their taste.And of course, some may not like Dante's new design (however, I am personally fine with it). THE CONS: I personally found the final boss fight and ending to be kinda dissapointing.Some fights are more annoying/tedious than fun. THE VERDICT:  8.5/10 ""Between Great and Amazing"" DmC: Devil May Cry really is a great game, and I do recommend it. If you get the game, play it on the Nephilim (hard) diffculty, as it will provide a more challenging and rewarding gameplay experience than the other starting difficulties. "

												I had heard of this franchise over the years, but I hadn’t ever played it myself before. DmC – Devil May Cry is an action adventure platformer from Ninja Theory and Capcom. Let’s get rocking.The GoodThe first thing that really struck me about DmC was how good the graphics looked. I was playing on lower graphical settings (for the sake of performance) and the game still looked better than a good handful of games that are brand new. They were seriously well done.After gawking at the graphics, I next came to the actual animations. Everything is incredibly fluid: combat, walking, jumping, everything. Even if you’re the laziest, most pathetic mortal on the face of the planet, you can’t help but to feel badass while you’re playing this game. That is just how good the animations make everything look.The next thing that I came to that just impressed the hell right out of me, was the upgrade system. While you are in the store upgrading your abilities or your weapons, I discovered the best upgrade system I had ever seen in a game like this. First of all there is an option for you to try out the upgrade before you commit points to it. That’s right. The game let’s you try out the ability or upgrade before you buy it. Secondly, once you’ve purchased the ability/upgrade, if you end up finding out that you don’t like it or you don’t ever use it you can take the points out (free of charge) and immediately put them into something else. Every game should have this.The music is pretty good. I recall seeing Combichrist being mentioned in the credits and another band, but I can’t remember who. That being said, Combichrist was an excellent choice for this game as their contributions to the soundtrack really went well with all the action.Enemy design was pretty cool. Normally, when I think about demons, I’m thinking about big, fleshy, horned monsters that run amok and torment everyone in their path. This was not even close to the case in DmC however. Demons (while some do have fleshy bits) are mostly made from what looks like metal, ceramics, and bone. It was a very interesting take on demonic entities (and, albeit, a refreshing one).Boss design (with the exception of Mundus) was also really cool. Let’s just say that the Succubus is not going to look like your expectations in the slightest.The BadDmC started out with a great story. There were great cutscenes, dialogue, a giant Hunter Demon with a ridiculously cool voice. However, as the game went on, the quality of the dialogue and the story went steadily downhill. By the end of the game things had become so predictable that I felt like I was watching some edgy 90’s teen movie.The MehThe game is pretty short. I blazed through it in right around seven hours.There is a marked lack of gore in most of the game. I suppose this makes sense as (I mentioned above) most of the demons you fight are made from materials other than flesh and blood.Verdict: YeaDmC is a great game and a great addition to any collection. If you’re a fan of the franchise, you’ll no doubt love it. If you’re new to the franchise, I’m pretty sure that you’ll love it all the same. It has a bit of a steep price tag (especially for how short it is), but, if it went on sale, I’d most certainly snag a copy. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												Upon completion of this game.All I have to say is that it's amazing.  I really enjoyed the pacing of the game from start to finish.There was never a moment where it felt really slow.  And most missions as in the original DMC series can be revisited in second playthoughs.While it's very hard to gauge this game since it's on it's own spin.I was one of many who outcried due to the change in Dante and after finishing up this I feel that he's something that I've grown used to.This game very well does parallel the personalities albeit Dante kinda is weird at the beginning of the game. But anyone who's ever really followed the series from 1st game should understand that Dante is the 'rebel' between his twin Vergil.At first it seemed as this game heading towards a very stupid plot but later on as the game unravels you start to witness the polar opposite personalities between Dante and Vergil.  They do bring back the nolstagia, the sense of rivalry betweeen the two and what they stand for which makes it a great game.  Maybe, comparable to DMC3 which is a classic and also my fave DMC game.  And this DmC however does beat out DMC4, as DMC4 had a very lackluster plot and very little character development.  In DmC though, I never encountered or felt the game was very haphazard in the sense that it didn't feel like .. ""oh this, is the part where I play Dante.."" which was a weird cut-off in the original series.  This game however doesn't do that.  It transitions cutscenes, combat and characters all in one.  It's a very smooth, very wonderful experience.  Almost every character in this game get their time to shine in their own spotlight.  Which didn't go too well on DMC4.Now, on to the gameplay.  Yes, this game does carry on elements from the previous titles and then some.  It does it in some ways better than others.  Having Dante being able to use a multitude of weapons which do have their lineage in playstyle (*helm breaker*etc.) makes for a variety of choice on fighting your enemies.  They even introduce certain enemeis that are only vulnerable to certain types of weapons as well.  The greatest thing about this game though is the non-existent Nero. Of which I very much despised in DMC4.  Because this game carries the grab/grapple moves into Dante's kit. So there's never a need for a Nero.  Which is something I wish they implemented instead in DMC4 for Dante rather than shoe horning an unpleasant character to play as. I'm not ragging DMC4 in any way, loved the game but this DmC fixes everything that was wrong in DMC4 and delivers in a very fluid, dynamic and then some. The music is awesome it definitely delivers in that department.  I love industrial music and they way they mixed dubsteps in certain fights (bosses included) made battles feel funny and enjoyable.But seriously if you're a hardcore DMC fan like I am I suggest picking this up.  Even if it's just on a steam sale, you won't regret it. But opinions are opinions .. I mean I picked it up expecting to hate it.  In the end the whole just took me by surprise.  Vergil's cold, egotistical yet primmed ego is very well existent in this game.  Felt good to have that opposing ego to Dante's more punk♥♥♥♥♥attitude. Overall, feels like a DMC game. 10/10tl;dr this game is about Two Brothers .. Two Brothers!SPOILER: Dante's hair turns all white at the end.  ALL OF IT! so stop crying already!			"

												The music alone justifies this purchase if you ask me. Particularly the Noisia stuff, although some of Combichrist is also pretty good. The opening music of your first combat scene is Combichrist - Never surrender, it's just freaking epic. Sometimes i will still play lillith's club or another theme (hunter, barbas, poison) even after all this time because it's just that good.The gameplay was delightfully smooth. It's a lot easier to switch between weapons for a sick combo than it was in DMC 4 which is the only other DMC i had previously played. You get the hang of the battle system infinitely faster than in DMC 4, personally i find this a good thing although some fellow gamers seem to disagree.I loved DMC 4 so much i pre-ordered this title (i wasn't dissapointed although now i would advise against this anytime btw) and found it worth every penny. The replay value is excellent as the better you get the more enjoyable the battles become.If this game ever get's on sale, I'd recommend you to give it a go even if you never played a hack and slash game before. DMC is pretty easy to get the hang of and the feeling for and the journey with Dante is insanely cool.			"

												I haven't played the others, but as a standalone this is a really good game.The combat is super fun, it's not just spamming. Theres interesting combos that you unlock and different weapons you hold a key to use, similar to God of War, but less inconvieniant. It doesn't just throw health at you either which keeps it from being too easy.The levels are good to explore, really nicely designed. The collectables in the environment attract you to them in a really unique way, and fit perfectly with the art style.The platforming sections aren't exactly challenging but they're entertaining enough. The fast paced sections really keep the action flowing so long as you know what you're doing. I find alot of games never quite get a good balance, though this one is leaning towards the easy side.The art style suits the game and the cinematography complements it brilliantly. The music (which is actually the reason I bought the game) also matches really well and makes the experiance a whole lot more fun. The animations flow really well with both the environment and enemies. Final kill shots, using your last attack on the last enemy, always seem to look great. The characters (which I thought were terrible at first) each quickly show they aren't♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even with the cool guy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the start and that occasionally surfaces, Dante's a pretty cool guy that doesn't afraid of anything. Oh and the facial models and animations are pretty flawless I'd say, not quite HL2 but better than any AssCreed.I am so pleasantly suprised with this game, fun as ♥♥♥♥/10.			"

												Good short weekend game that's worth the price of a movie and popcorn.Game is short.  Easy enough to beat in a weekend.  Great casual game to just kick back and experience.  The story is a bit good vs evil cliche, but who minds that in this genre?Best played with a controller.  I beat it with a keyboard and felt like I was fighting the game a bit.  Mechanics are easy to pick up.  There's plenty of moves to master, but most are not required to finish the game.  The game is a bit linear, but it's hardly a surpsise.  When you play this type of game, it's expected and doesn't really take away from the games focus...action.Audio and visuals are top notch.  The game sounds and looks fantastic.  It's hard not to get pumped up during the early stages of the game before the newness wears off.			"

The combat is very solid, the visuals are very slick, and the remade Dante and Vergil are not anywhere as annoying as I thought they'd be.

												This is my first Devil May Cry game, so all the criticism it's gotten from old-school fans regarding the ""new"" Dante are irrelevant to me :)  The game itself is a lot of fun.  Graphics are very good with everything set to ""ultra"".  Frames never dipped below 60 (check my PC specs in my profile).  The story is interesting, and the dialogues are pretty cool.  Gameplay is very good, combining a ton of weapons, abilities, and moves.  It takes a while to get used to switching between all of them to fit different monsters and environment interactions.  Finding items and collectibles is also fun, although to gain 100% completion you need to go back and replay levels because you won't have every ability needed the first time you tackle most levels.  I'm not into playing games twice (Skyrim and Mass Effect are sole exceptions), but if you do, this game has replayability value.  Finished in 13 hours and gets an A in my book.			"

												Well, DmCDevil may Cry was a reboot of the fabulous, beloved and awesome Devil May Cry Series, courtesy of Ninja Theory and  CAPCOM. It retells the story of the origins of Dante, Vergil, Sparda and the iconic Eva, in a twist that breaks the cadre of the story from the previous Devil may Cry series.Review: The story was a (bit) half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character development was shallow, and as such, the previous touch and flair that Dante is known for ( Balls, bravery, awesomeness, cool dude) and Vergil's nature ( Loyalty, skill, distaste for firearms, etc) have neen washed away and in their place, are shallow, under-developed and uninspiring characters for whom no fan of devil may Cry series can connect to easily. The fabled Sparda, and his legend is gone. So if you're looking to reconnect to the awesomeness that Devil may Cry used to be, this is not it. It may feel a bit insulting to the series' die-hard fans.Gameplay: Acceotable. Fluid mechanics,  and the camera can get glitchy at times. For the love of all thats' awesome, why did they leave out Lock On to targets out of a hack and slash game? This makes combat cumbersome, especially in Boss Fights (Mundus, anyone? ). The game also has a short learning curve, and as such, new players to the series will be at ease hacking and slashing demons at the comfort of their seats.Graphics: Pretty average. Nothing spectacular. Runs in DirectX9, powered by the Unreal Engine 3. If you're on catalyst (Running an AMD/ATI GPU/APU), ensure you're using the latest driver. The game is known for being glitchy with old versions of AMD Catalyst, and micro-stutter is  relatively common in CrossFire-based systems. Your mileage may vary.The music is great,m if you're into industrial metal. Noisia and CombiChrist worked up quite the charm here, so you'll be in for a blast if its' your kind of thing.Overall rating: 88% in my personal opinion. Despite its shortcomings, this is a great game with excellent gameplay and many hours of fun, especially when you throw in the Vergil's Downfall DLC and the other mode similar to Devil may Cry's 4 Bloody Palace. Again, your mileage may vary. This is a personal opinion and as such, is subject to personal bias.Play the game, and be the judge.			"

It fun and  very easy to lern for every player type whether you're a Hardcore player, Casual player or even a Noob player there is way to enjoy this game for you. In my 20+ hours of playing this game I only see 1 or 2 down side. First one is If you're a fan of an old Devil May Cry don't expect this one to be the same It has some resemble but not the same, in term of story  you have Dante, Vergil , Mundus blah..blah...blah It has some resemble but not the same(it a reboot what do you expect). There is a characteristics change in this game some good some bad( and some of them♥♥♥♥♥♥♥piZZed me off - -*) that I won't spoil it for you.  Second one is If you have played original Devil May Cry series you will find this game is easy and not as challenge as the original one.The final verdict for this game is 8/10""it is a very good action game, If you not cosidering it as a Devil may cry""Now is time for my personal opinion ""I think the new Dante look...STUPID!

												This is one of the smoothest and most enjoyable action hack and slash game I  have play in year. It fun and  very easy to lern for every player type whether you're a Hardcore player, Casual player or even a Noob player there is way to enjoy this game for you. In my 20+ hours of playing this game I only see 1 or 2 down side. First one is If you're a fan of an old Devil May Cry don't expect this one to be the same It has some resemble but not the same, in term of story  you have Dante, Vergil , Mundus blah..blah...blah It has some resemble but not the same(it a reboot what do you expect). There is a characteristics change in this game some good some bad( and some of them♥♥♥♥♥♥♥piZZed me off - -*) that I won't spoil it for you.  Second one is If you have played original Devil May Cry series you will find this game is easy and not as challenge as the original one.The final verdict for this game is 8/10""it is a very good action game, If you not cosidering it as a Devil may cry""Now is time for my personal opinion ""I think the new Dante look...STUPID! (but you can buy original custume for 1 usd which is help alot)""			"

												So much better than what i expected, this was an insane gaming experience, there are many different levels of difficulty so everyone can enjoy this game from the newbie to the expert, graphics are very nice, scenarios are amusing, monsters are very original, Boss fights are epic, you have plenty of different combo to use in your fights, Electronic Music adrenalized me on the way. I completed the whole game without one single crash, so technically is perfect, nice background story.My Final Score is 95 /100  "

												Mostly people have negative experience because they compare this game to previous DMCs, but its not comparable, this is absolutely new game, relaunch and its not reassembled DMC its completely reworked and rewritten. I loved how this game visualize world/terrain transformations when hero goes to other world, design of every enemy, they are realy unique. This game has many other cool things you may and probably will love or at least like. And I think its more enjoyable if you have a gamepad.Totally recommended to eveyone.			"

												As someone playing a DmC game for the first time, I really enjoyed this game. It had a few shortcomings but overall I thought it was a good, fun hack and slash game.Pros:- Fast paced, varied hack and slash combat. Wide variety of moves to keep the game play fresh.- Excellent level design and unique visuals.- Plenty of replay value. Each level has hidden keys, gates and lost souls to find. You'll need to revist earlier levels once you've unlocked all your abilities to get them all.- Well optimized PC port with support for ultrawide resolutions.Cons:- Story and characters are a little under developed, not bad by any means.- Inital play through is rather short, between 10-12 hours.

												I have not played other games in DMC series, so I can only judge this game.And it is awesome. Enjoyable combat: fast paced, many moves and  weapons to use. Controls is comfortable (played only on gamepad, can't say nothing about K+M), although it is kinda bad you can't lock on one enemy.Score system encourages you to mix up different moves and weapons in every fight.PC version is flawless. It is super optimized and has very nice graphics. Level design is so crazy in a good way. Game is not very long, but has very high replayability. Good luck playing it on hardest difficulties if you are average player at this type of games as me. Story is not bad. It keeps you entertaining till the end. It is little silly but c'mon, this is game where you kill demons. Soundtrack is very well matched. Overall, play it. It deserves your attention. It will give you ton of joy.			"

												Awesome game with great sound, graphics, and art direction. One of the most creative and cool looking games ever. Great story and script and great voice acting. The soundtrack is absolutely slamming heavy metal that fits right in when you are going bananas and wiping the floor with enemies left and right, but it is the type of music that is purely best heard while playing the game. I have tried listening to the soundtrack outside of the game and it oddly enough sounds like crap without the game to go with it. The controls are tight and very responsive with zero delay and quick, brutal gameplay. Basically it is a healthy combination of jumping and dodge rolling to avoid attacks, and power moves and grappling and aerial moves. Not all of the moves are needed either unless you are someone who wants to mix things up wildly and get a perfect score of SS on each level. I can usually get an A on every level, and often a S and sometimes a SS. The only downsides I found with the game are the last two boss fights being huge letdowns. Mundis is extremely easy then when I fought the real last boss on mission 20 (I won't spoil who it is) I could not figure out exactly how to finish him off. I had to google how to do it.One of the few games I have ever played where I do not have any real complaints because it does not have any serious flaws. A lot of time and care went into this game and it shows. It is bad to the bone and you get to be a complete badass and go ape♥♥♥♥♥♥and mow down demons mercilessly. Brutal, hard-core fighting at its best, 8/10			"

Bosses are mixed, some are great, some are way too obvious. A lot of difficulties with nice twists makes the game get a good replay value. Characters are lacklust and dialogue is way too cheesy.

												I have only a few hours on the PC version, but I have beaten the 360 version 3 times. So far, the silky smooth 60 fps and high resolution are enhancing the experience even further.An excellent, genuinely underrated game. While I don't like this incarnation of Dante as much due to his lack of clever dialogue (opting for more of an in-your-face, ""♥♥♥♥ you"" type speech than 1-4's more snide and humorous banter) I think pretty much every aspect is equal to or better than the main series. The art style is an absolute pleasure to look at, with carefully chosen colors and architecture. Limbo is a very unique setting and feels very oppressive, which is what they were going for.The music is very high on my list of best ost's, though it's definitely not for everyone. It is a mixture of Combichrist's aggrotech/death metal and Noisia's bass-heavy electronic music (Dunno exactly what genre, but it ranges from Drum 'n' Bass to Dubstep). A testament to the ost's quality (and to the quality of the musicians composing it) is that I actually am not a fan of the genres in general. All in all, it feels very appropriate to the gameplay and pumps you up as you lay down some sick combos.Which brings me to the gameplay. Some criticize it for being less ""free"" than the originals, and I see where they're coming from. DMC4 in particular has quite a lot of stylish freedom in what you can do, and you can perform a buttload of crazy combos with cancelling and tech and all that. However, the grappling system and the ease of switching weapons in the heat of battle make it a very smooth and skill-intensive experience. The multiple melee weapons allow you to tailor your approach to battle on the fly, using a scythe or shurikens to take out a mob of easy enemies, an axe or knuckles to deal some heavy damage to high profile targets, or your trusty sword which is good in any situation. But the thing that makes combat so ♥♥♥♥ing fun is the aformentioned grappling hook. Depending on whether you have angel or devil weapons equipped (by holding the left and right trigger, respectively) you can either pull yourself toward the enemy or pull him to you. This opens up all sorts of ""CUHRAYZEE"" juggling shenanigans.And the bosses. Oh, the bosses! While they are somewhat easy, they are extremely fun encounters with unique mechanics. I don't want to spoil anything, but they're some of the highlights of the game.And so, I wholeheartedly reccomend this game. If you like hack 'n' slash games, this is one you should definitely try out!9.5 out of 10. If the dialogue were a little bit more reminiscent of the originals, I'd give it a 10. Too bad the fanboys killed a chance of a sequel.			"

												SUMMARYThis game is one hell of a ride (pun intended). Has a few issues but otherwise it's well worth the purchase. I've had a great time with this game so far and I'm sure I'll be coming back to it in the futurePROS- So much fun to play- You get to shoot Alex Jones right in the f**king face- Combat is intricate while remaining accessible to new-comers- Has an amazing style that shows heavy goth and punk roots- You get to blow up Mountain Dew HQ- Facial animations are amazing and do a great job of showing the characters' emotions- There's a surprisngly deep lore hidden in this game for those willing to look- Characters are entertaining and fun to interact with- Boss battles are epic and do a great job of testing your skills- Soundtrack is fantastic- The Vergil DLC is just as fun as the main game- Did I mention you get to shoot the f**k out of Alex Jones and Mountain Dew?CONS- Camera can get annoying, keeps locking on to enemies even when you're trying to navigate- Really short story - finished entire game in an afternoon- The price of healing items increases after each purchase which means it's next to impossible to buy any near the end of the game when you need them the most- Playing with a keyboard is... difficult. Strongly recommend using a controller instead			"

												This is outstanding fast-paced hack and slash combat. Forget what the haters ♥♥♥♥♥ about.  The core components of what made the Devil May Cry series revolutionise action-games is here in the new DMC; just a diffrent coat of paint because Ninja Theory was asked by Capcom to set it up that way.  In many instances movement and attacks are more fluid and fit roles better.  No more having too many weapons that you may not use half of them (my friends and I had that problem with lucifer from DMC4).  Ninja Theory did a good job with the combat, story, and mood.  Truth is they improved quite a bit.  Yes it is (slightly) diffrent than what it was before, but I'm a fan of the old DMC and I really like this one as well.  Personally I would like to see more out of both timelines.Dont worry about the limited movesets and protagonist being a jerk at the begining.  Soon Dante finds something to fight for and has an impressive array of weapons and moves to go with it.  Some of the dialog made me cringe, but the old DMC made me do that too.YES the game is easier (someomes much easier) than the previous DMC series.  Keep in mind that DMC3 in perticular had a reputation for being extreamly unforgiving....also the ending was kind of a WTF moment that needs some type of DLC or follow up to explain itself, but I'm not sure when that will happen.

												新鬼泣在画面上和制作上都与前作有很大的区别，可以说新鬼泣本身就不能算是鬼泣的正统续作（本来也不是），但是流畅的动作与出色的打击感配合鬼泣的招牌还是吸引了不少ACT游戏粉的捧场。新鬼泣在操作上比起鬼泣4要简单不少，可以用很容易的操作打出很好的舞台效果，刷分也很好刷，DMD难度想打出12S也不是很难的事情，双闪避的加入让新鬼泣的难度大幅度下降（尤其是天使闪避，就算瞎按也可以躲避攻击+提升华丽度）。如果没有接触过鬼泣系列的玩家可以从新鬼泣起手熟悉之后再尝试DMC4一类的游戏。画面配乐都是上乘，手残党也可以轻松打出的高分华丽特效，配合还算完整的故事结构这部DMC鬼泣可以给10/10.再说说DLC维吉尔，其实操作更简便了。维吉尔的JC用手柄也可以轻松练出来，还有两个大威力低延迟的FS技能。很多人说维吉尔练好FS便可以轻松12S我赞同这种说法。不过幻影剑的使用还是维吉尔玩家好坏区分的标志吧，毕竟熟练运用幻影剑可以打出非常不错的舞台效果。			"

												Incredible game.  Fantastic art direction, locations, and music.  Some of the zones (I don't want to give spoilers) were such a pleasant surprise for their design.  Tight controls, fair upgrade system (doesn't punish player for experimenting with builds, and you can try any move in a ""training move"" mini-game anytime!) make it a pleasure to play with.  Logically placed checkpoints allow for quick drop and pickup play when I need to stop or start (I have kids, so this can make or break a game).  It is actually hard for me to think of anything I would really want them to do differently ... pausable cutscenes?  You can alt-tab, though, to pause them, but it's better to have a non-workaround way to pause the cutscenes without skipping them.My lack of beef with the game really does mean a lot.  I am surprised how good it was.  Definitely buying the next one too for sure when it comes along!			"

												When I was younger, I always enjoyed ""Divine Comedy""(i know its old, sue me so am I) and then watched the OLD as dirt film Dante's Inferno. Later, I made the choice if I ever had a son, I would name him Dante.. and I did. But not before being introduced to the DMC series sooo many gamer years ago. You can disagree with me all you like about DmC... but I personally have enjoyed it from the first 5 seconds of the game.Soundtrack - 10/10Graphics - 9/10Voice Acting - 10/10Controls - 10/10Camera Movement - 7/10Brutality - 10/10My only issue with the game is the camera that occasionally jumps and nearly gives me vertigo. But totally worth the slight nausea!!! I don't think there are many games that I could whole heartily recommend to someone. This is definitely one of those titles. Damn good job.			"

												The first level is probably one of the best designed levels I've ever played. Graphics and soundtrack are also awesome and the combat system is addictive. However, the game doesn't stand up to it's first level and deflates while you advance in the story. Also, I recommend to play it with a controller or it will get frustating with mouse+keyboard. In conclusion... give it a try if you like this kind of genre!Killer is Dead is better in my opinion :P "

My only complaint would be that some points of the game felt like they didn't have a lot of impact on the story if you failed, most would let you retry multiple times the only downside was your score, so that is and isn't ok seeing as there isn't much else they could have done.Overall super fun more than I expected and has a decent amount of replay value after all the unlocks and different unlocked difficulties.

There's only so much style you can do in this game  :'(and also, playing on Keyboard and Mouse is tricky if you're an old DMC player so beware the changeOVERALL, WAS WORTH BUYING BECAUSE OF THE 66% SALE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH THE $30+ ORIGINAL PRICE!

												Mediocore story like the other dmc games. The combat is good and combos are easier which can be a good thing for players who weren't good at the previous dmcs. Hardly any enemies in the game truly try to combo break you other than a handfull even on the harder difficulties. So once you get your initial hit on them they can be infinitely combod. If you are the casual player one to two playthroughs should be enough. If you want achievements and to complete the secret missions then you will need to play the game through several times.All in all not a bad game for a reboot but could have been done better.			"

However, having played DmC 4, I would presonally reccomend that one over this one.The combat system is very fluid on Controller, K+M? No idea. Sadly, the story is lacking, however it does give us a nice retelling of Dante's origin. The DLC? I didn't like it as much as the main game, it was hard to get into.			"

												As a fan of the Devil May Cry series, I wouldn't reccommend this game particularly. It strays from the original storyline and characters in a way that is rather uncomfortable to original fans. The modernized characters are rather lacking in the 'unique' area. Dante has a cliche bad attitude and there are more crude sex jokes and just outright swearing instead of funny quips, etc. The female character, Kat, is basically useless and only there to be the mary-sue love interest. And I'll just stop there...STORY ISSUES ASIDE:If you can play this game without comparisons to the original series; then you'll find the game play is actually really fun, the weapons are great, and the stages are interesting! The soundtrack is also on point! Bad for the original Devil May Cry series, but good as a separate game!			"

But superior edition yet is DmC: Definitive Edition, which is console only edition, it fixes some controversial balance features, of course it isn't make a game to same level of complexity like original Devil May Cry series, but if you are okay with Ninja Theory approach to series it is possibly would be better edition to try. DLC is very short, but worth trying anyway. Only real problem of the game in general, that it is establishing huge lore, but underuse it in meaningfull way, so overall narration seems weak and very clished.			"

												DmC is an awesome spectacle fighter with a killer soundtrack by Combichrist, amongst others. The fighting feels smooth and looks pretty darn awesome, with lots of interesting weapons and abilities, and enemies that require different approaches, especially when the waves begin to mix and match the types you face. The level design is impressive, and the boss battles are pure bliss. But, and there is a but... that only applies for a little bit more than half the game. Just a bit after the half way point, the game suddenly grows monotonous. You've seen everything there is to see by then, and everything from then on is just more of the same with a few variations. The most major flaw the game has is that it relies overly on stamina challenges, by which I mean long enduring fights with no breaks between stages, whereupon you will have to start from the very beginning of the challenge should you fail one stage. These fights are way too common and are there for no reason save to make you loose focus until you make a mistake and have to start over again. They are padding. They are not complicated, as they consists of waves upon waves of the same enemies that you've seen over and over again, they just task your endurance and your focus. There is nothing interesting about these fights. The game also has a major flaw when it comes to non-interactive cutscenes; there are a lot of them and they tend to go on and on. In the beginning they are short and far enough between that they don't distract from the fights, just a breather inbetween the action, but towards the end, they are long as hell and the writing takes a turn for the dramatic rather than the cheese. The cheesy writing is the game's only saving grace when it comes to storytelling, and they cannot write dramatic nor can they deliver it. Despite all of this, I'd recommend the game if you could pick it up cheap (and I mean really cheap), as it is cheesy fun for half the game, despite being dull as dishwater for the other half. Hell, I'd recommend picking it up for the cheese alone. But be warned, it will eventually become a drag. I had to force myself to finish the game when the game ran out of ""new"" and just started to repeat itself.			"

												I'll be clear to start out with.As a Devil May Cry game, this sucks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.As an Action game though. It's really good.Now this was my entry into the Devil May Cry series, followed after by DMC4:SE. As an intro and reboot, the game makes it as a stepping stone to dip your toes in the water before diving in.While I'd suggest playing this game first before other DMC games... The other DMC games are far superior. Even if aged a little. This game is a lot of fun and is hilarious in it's own right. But it defecates on the rest of the series and well... it's just got the wrong tone after the other games.Now to technicalities.The game is utterly mindblowing in it's visuals. The gameplay is pretty solid although jumping is solidly a ♥♥♥♥♥.The humour is relatively crass and surface level but has a harshness and ferocity I kind of enjoy. Each and every boss fight feels unique and individual and stands out clearly from the rest even if the levels can blur together a little. The story is ok and passable for an action game but outright wrong or weak for Devil May Cry. The DLC is spectacular and a MUST HAVE addition to the game. In all the game is decent, dare I say good. But with a grain of salt it doesn't carry the same spirit of Devil May Cry before it.			"

												I have to skip all the cutscenes, but I still cringe whenever I play this game. The combat is fairly standard fare for PLATINUM, lots of variation, combos, set-pieces, etc... but I've never been able to complete this game because the lead character is so ridiculous and corny I get more satisfaction from letting the enemies beat him up than I do from any of the very competent combat mechanics.Get this game if you can get over playing as the ultimate♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because I know for certain there is a very decent brawler underneath the truly hackneyed plot, depressing presentation, and hateable lead character who engenders absolutely NO sympathy from me even after learning about his--of course--tragic background.

												Devil May Cry was always an awesome series but the combat in this one put the others to shame. Story was a bit iffy but funny none the less, Dante still has his ""Shut up and let's fight already."" attitude still. I didn't really like the fact that a lot of the weapons from the previous DMC's were becoming short-handed. You only really get 2 Angel/Demon Weapon's and 2 Guns through the entire game and Rebellion it'self. You can also get a ""SSS"" rating combat rating fairly easy as long as you group up a bunch of enemies and AoE's. Had gotten ""SSS"" on all mission on Hell and Hell mode on Vergil's Downfall DLC which was fairly short, only 6 missions to where Vergil goes mad for more power. But even with all this, the story was like a mix of DMC 1 &3 combined. Bunch of action and gore as usual and Dante's witty comments had me still going and interested. Oh and if your thinking the guns are useless because of the trailer, your highly mistaken. The guns in the game will cause a fairly decent amount of damage and can be implemented in numerous combo's if done correctly. They are also your best friends on Heaven or Hell Mode.			"

												Say what you want about the direction the series went with this entry; you cannot deny its fantastic. The music, atmophere, combat, visual style, are all top notch. The game feels really good and has its own style no doubt. However the skill ceiling isn't even close to DMC3 or 4. The characters and story try too hard and feels beyond westernized with its orignal material. Ninja Theory has crafted a DMC game with their own take on it and it stays true to its combat. It may be easier to ""master"" than 3 or 4, but no doubt feels really good with what the game has to offer. They may have completely ruined Dante, but they sure crafted a fine game.			"

												This is 3rd person, hack and slash, action spectacle fighter where you go through the story and fight hordes of demon spawn on the way.I'll start off by saying that combat system is very fluid. You wield different kinds of melee and ranged weapons, that you can combo very effectively. Basically after executing attacks on enemy, you get different kind of score depending on how fluid your attacks and defense was. Score will award you with points you can spend on leveling your skills and abilities to unlock even more moves, combos and increase the power of already learned moves. Throughout the game you will unlock many melee and ranged weapons that are useful not just for bashing skulls, but also to get into secret places, defeat special enemies, etc.Not going to spoil the story, basically it follows very young Dante who is uncovering his past and learning more about who he really is. Dante is same ""old"" yet younger self, still arrogant and hot headed like always. I found that for me, story in this game was much more enjoyable than in 4th DmC.Game uses good, old Unreal Engine, yet for such recent release it looks somewhat outdated graphically. Non the less game looks good, with uniquely crazy DmC environments, a lot of low resolution textures, good motion capture and facial animation, great voice acting and challenging combat. Not much of eye candy in this one, than in DmC 4, but still great spectacle fighter with awesome yet evil story. Though who am I kidding, it's supposed to be evil. Enjoy.			"

												What a ridiculously enjoyable game. I have played the whole Devil May Cry series, and this game is an exceptional entry into the series. It does away with having to pick your weapon/gun load-out before each mission. All unlocked weapons are usable in combat.  Also, the Styles (Swordmaster, Gunslinger, etc.) have been phased out. All the styles have now been incorporated into the new Dante's combat system. Instead of Royal Guard, they added a demon dodge ability, which rewards you  with increased damage and style points for dodging enemy attacks at the exact moment. You also now have a standard weapon, hell weapon, and a heaven weapon. The hell weapon is for straight up damage, while the heaven arms specialize in crowd control. Also, some enemies can only be damaged by their respective colored weapons (red=hell, blue=heaven). That can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because it gets in the way of fluid combat, but it keeps things interesting. Ninja Theory has presented a great take on the DMC storyline. The game itself is beautiful. Environments are colorful and diverse. Dialogue is a huge step up from previous games. All cutscenes and voices are very well done. The new Dante is great. I never once felt like I hated his character. He comes complete with smart remarks and attitude. It takes about 10 hours to complete the game on your first playthrough. I went on to replay it 2 more times to get all the collectibles and beat the Nephilim difficulty. There are 4 more difficulties above that if you feel up to it. Dante and his weapons have unlockable skins (the weapons only have skins if you preordered from gamestop or something). There is upcoming dlc for a challenge mode and for an extension to the story with Vergil as a playable character.  Steam achieves are a plus!			"

												DAMN. Just finished playing. Let me start by saying that I'm a newbie for Hack n Slash games and the Devil May Cry franchise, so my review might end being highly subjective. 'Cause being an ignoramus on hack and slash games, it's a challenge to write a good and an objective review. But overall, this was just an awesome game, I enjoyed it very much, and I would reccomend it to someone who's completely new to the genre.For me, the controls were a bit complex and it may have taken hours for me to get the hang of playing the game right.But in the end, I think the controls were well designed and so were the combos that were difficult to execute at times because I'm an impatient person. The upgrade system didn't add much to the game for me, except for some essential combos and a few damage boosts. I think I wasn't looking enough for the variety the game would have offered. Probably because it was already complex enough and I kept on forgetting most of the combos constantly. So I played the game in a quite basic way, in the normal difficulty setting. Wasn't that hard, but a few bosses proved a satisfying challenge.The atmosphere the game created was AMAZING. The game jumped immediately to a dark and intriguing cinematic experience. And after the first cutscene the action started right away, and with awesome music composed by Combichrist that just fit perfectly. The dialogues were cheesy and edgy on purpose but with some dark humor to lighten it up a bit. And one more thing I wanted to add about the music design is how well the transitions between running around, entering combat and finishing combat was made. The immersion never broke down.The characters might have been a bit ""one dimensional"", except for Kat who you'll meet when you play the game :). The story was mediocre, but the atmosphere revolving around the story and the setting made it feel better than it was.I also liked the wide variety of enemy castes, and I saw how essential it was for the variety of combat itself. I bet half of the development time of this game went for the designing of these enemies.The game had its usual average length of 9 hours but they tried to add some replayability by adding gameplay modes that remix the combat scenes and difficulty, which can be unlocked after completing the game.Pros:+Awesome music.+Good bosses and gameplay overall.+Immersion never broke down.Cons:-One dimensional story and characters.TL;DR:""being an ignoramus on hack and slash games, it's a challenge to write a good and an objective review. But overall, this was just an awesome game, I enjoyed it very much, and I would reccomend it to anyone who's completely new to the genre.""EDIT: For much easier and smoother gameplay, use a gamepad! In my case, an Xbox 360 controller.			"

												This game gets more hate than I think it deserves. Yeah, the writing is pretty lacking (but coming from a series that has never been known for Shakespearean writing, it's forgivable), the combat is nowhere near as deep as DMC3 or 4 and the aesthetic is very hit-or-miss, but is DmC a bad game? Absolutely not. There's still a lot of depth here, and it actually manages to do some things better than the original series, particularly platforming. The weapon system isn't nearly as deep or open-ended as 3 or 4, but on the flipside, everything is readily accessible, and I never had any issues holding the triggers to switch melee weapons on the fly- it's very flexible and intuitive.Most of the minor gameplay flaws- the lack of lock-on, the stupid color-coded enemies, the broken style meter, and having to collect different arbitrary types of keys to unlock missions- were fixed in the Definitive Edition, but Ninja Theory never made a PC port of that, and two years removed from its release, it doesn't look like we'll be getting it any time soon, which is a damn shame. If you have a PS4 or Xbone, that version is the way to go. It is to this game what the Special Editions were to 3 and 4.As for the audio, the soundtrack is actually pretty okay. It doesn't beat the nu-metal flavorings of 3 or 4, but the Nine Inch Nails and Deadmau5 knockoffs on this game's OST are pretty catchy, and this is coming from someone who doesn't care for dubstep and the like.All in all, DmC is an underappreciated game that is totally worth checking out regardless of your opinions on the rest of the series.

												DMC is a fun and addictive game. Downright sexy graphics and not too taxing on the hardware makes it a subtle experience even on low end PCs. Topped with brilliant fighting style and plethora of combos to try out, this new breed of game is sure fun to play.The mix of level and bosses can be daunting at times but once you get the basics right its just another level, heck some normal enemy (read Dreamrunner) feels more more taxing than certain boss(es). Things gets interesting when you crank the difficulty at SOS (Sun of Sparda) though.Overall DMC is a must have game if you like slashing, hacking your way through. Unique blend of story, emotions and fighting makes its a great game to play. A must have third person fighting game.			"

												DmC Devil May Cry is a reboot of the popular game series which eventually had an anime based off of it. I thought it was the other way around since I watched a couple episodes of the anime a few years ago.  It’s a good thing that the game is a reboot since I probably never would have bought the game if it was #5 in a series. (I’ve never played the old Tomb Raider games either and I loved Tomb Raider 2013). It’s my understanding that the previous Devil May Cry games were known for their high difficulty but fortunately for me, DmC Devil May Cry wasn’t too hard at all (at normal difficulty).The game world is a little hard to explain since there are various “layers” to consider. There’s a Heaven and Hell which you never see (kind of like Darksiders). The whole story takes place in the “real world” and in Limbo, which is sort of a “twisted copy” of the real world infested with demons. All the game’s combat takes place in Limbo. Powerful demons attempting to attack you will pull you into Limbo for the fight, and you can also go in through magical rituals (only happens as part of the story). You play the part of Dante, a loner with mysterious combat abilities and powerful weapons, working to take down the demon king Mundus. Mundus has sort of taken over the city (possibly the whole world) through various evil ways and the humans don’t even realize there are demons among them. Dante teams up with his long lost brother Vergil and begins killing Mundus’ allies one by one in awesome boss battles.DmC is a hack and slash game with anime physics. This means for example that you can knock around a bunch of enemies with a single swing of your sword or launch them into the air and follow them upwards with a 20 hit combo. Like the game Darksiders, you unlock various “moves” by buying them with orbs that dead enemies drop. There’s a lot of platforming involved in the game as well, where you need to get from one area to another by double jumping around and using your 2 grappling hooks (one to pull yourself to a target, and another to pull the target to you). Fortunately there aren’t many puzzles, though there are quite a few secret items to be found. The reason I said earlier that DmC wasn’t too hard is because if you don’t care about your score, you can just keep “continuing from checkpoint” until you win. I believe your score will get chopped in half for every time you die. The same goes for using purchased healing items in the game, your score goes down. The game is broken up into missions, and you get a score at the end of each mission based on your time, secrets found, style (combos), and whether or not you used items/died. Keyboard and mouse controls are very intuitive and worked well for me, but I expect people who are used to controllers would enjoy that more. Pros:+Feel like a badass smacking a room full of demons around with combos and magic weapons.+Very nice graphics including huge demonic bosses. I’m a fan of Angel vs Demon artwork too.+You can beat the game pretty easily if you don’t care about your score.+A lot of humor in this game. Dante doesn’t take♥♥♥♥♥♥from anyone and you get in some insult matches.Cons:-The game is still rather pricy despite being close to 2 years old. I think $12.50 is the lowest historical price.-There are maybe 1 or 2 times in the game where you might get lost in a large level. The platforming is three dimensional so there are a lot of places to go. The game doesn’t have a waypoint system or map so it’s possible to get turned around. The levels are mostly straightforward though.-That’s about it actually, the game is very polished despite being a console port.Overall DmC Devil May Cry is definitely recommended. If you enjoy hack / slash games like Darksiders, you will appreciate the flow of combat in DmC. You don’t have to worry about missing collectables in the game since you don’t necessarily need the upgrades. The story is told through gameplay and cutscenes, and more or less makes sense to people who haven’t seen the anime or played the previous games. Wait for the price to drop, then buy the game! "

												DmC: Devil May Cry featuring Donte™ from the terrible abomination of a remake of a fantastic action series.Let's start with the """"""positives"""""".+ Gameplay is quite fun purely as a normal everyday action game.+ Switching your sword's mode quickly with the Triggers feels pretty good in the midst of combat.+ The level design has neat platforming segments where everything twists and turns and it's actually kinda cool.+ It's a lot easier to upgrade and aquire new moves.+ The Bob Barbas boss fight is the most genuinely cool moment in the game.Now let's get to the absolutely irredeemable and completely degenerate negatives.- This game is a b*stardization of the Devil May Cry series, if you are a fan you will absolutely despise playing this.- The story is some of the worst sh*t I've ever seen in a game. It's so generic, predictable, cringy, EDGY, and horrible.- Donte is an unlikable edgy d-bag fuccboi who only appeals to 14 year old troglodites who actually think he's cool. From his juvenile potty mouth dialog to his weak and unsure sword swing animations, it all just paints him as weak and inferior to good ol' Uncle Dante.- Vergil is a literal fedora trenchcoat wearing, weeb katana weilding, anonymous revolutionary piece of sh*t who is absolutely nothing like his original character.- Kat is completely useless compared to female characters like Lady or even TRISH.- The gameplay is literally dumbed down Devil May Cry gameplay where there's not even a lock-on where instead of analog stick inputs, it's reduced to lazy button combos.- The Style Meter is now ranked on damage instead of, ya know, STYLE.- Devil Trigger is so unsatisfying to use.- Every single weapon except the Ax, from the sword to the F*CKING WEAK SHOTGUN is so unsatisfying.- The mission ranks mean absolutely nothing in that it gives out S's and SSS's like candy when in previous DMC games, you'd only get an S rank for no damage and impressive style. This game rewards lazy play.- The final boss is SO INFERIOR TO PREVIOUS DMC FINAL BOSSES.6/10. The game itself is fun as an action game can be, but I cannot recommend this game when it's nothing more than an inferior version of much much MUCH better games. Please just go buy DMC3 or DMC4 instead of this edgy piece of sh*t. Save yourself.			"

												7/10 game overall.+Stages and music are extremely well designed.+Very well optimized PC port (ran it at 144 fps with zero issues, specs are on my profile).+Enemy/boss design is top notch.+Difficulty levels are very well balanced.+-Streamlined combat compared to the original DMC titles. If you're a fan of DMC3 or 4 and have sunk a good bit of time into either game, you'll feel extremely limited in this one. The combo depth of Style Switcher DMC3 Dante or DMC4SE Dante/Vergil just isn't possible in DmC with the weapons you're given.+-Significantly easier to obtain and hold a SSS rank combo than previous titles.-Character designs. I don't even know where to start here. Dante was never intended to be a serious character, but in the originals, he was overly sarcastic and had a lot of well placed witty one liners. This iteration of Dante, while not terrible visually, just has some of the absolute WORST voice lines in a modern video game. (see: ♥♥♥♥ YOU on YouTube) Also, Vergil unironically wears a fedora.-Color coded enemies. This is an absolutely horrendous choice for a spectacle fighter that is combo based, because several of Dante's ""new"" weapons in this game have little to no combo potential or cancelling mechanic. Older DMC games featured enemies that would take less damage from certain attacks, but not outright invulnerable. Red weapons (the ""heavy"" weapons, if you will) in particular feel absolutely useless, and when the game spawns red-coded enemies that will NOT take any damage from any non-red weapon, it's more or less a giant middle finger to having fun.-One of the worst, most anticlimactic final bosses I've ever fought in a video game.-Vergil's DLC, while being a really interesting plot concept, is incredibly short and feels like it was rushed in development.tl;dr it's a very good spectacle fighter, but it's a bad DMC game. It's a good buy on sale.			"

												Not a completely terrible game. Better than Devil May Cry 2, but that is damning with faint praise.Definitely a PRETTY game, and if it had been unrelated to the DMC series, it would probably have been better received. As it is, it is not the worst, but it is far, far from the best.As an origin story, and to contrast both Dante and Vergil, DMC3 does it MUCH better, showing the differences in attitude between the characters even in their playstyle (it is a shame that the PC version of DMC 3 is such a mess, since that is an incredible game). If this was meant to be a retcon or a modernization of it, it misses the mark severely, since the basic story of the sibling rivalry had been done MUCH BETTER in a previous entry. As a brawler, it is not bad at all, but it is nowhere as fun, polished, or well realized as DMC4, which  is uglier and feels half-done at times since  you DO go through the same levels with both characters, but the weapon, enemy and encounter design in it is so much better than what this pulls.DmC: Devil May Cry is a ridiculously pretty game, top notch visuals for sure, great level decoration, but bad combat design (color coded enemies? Really? That destroys the flow) as well as the worst ranking system in the series (not based on variety, but on damage dealt) make it a, well, honestly decent brawler, but a bad DMC game.Go and get DMC4 Special Edition instead of this.

												Unorthodox graphic design? Check.Excellent gameplay? Check.MOTHERF- COMBICHRIST? CHECK!Unless you're one of them diehard silver-haired Dante fanboys, completing this one hell of a ride is definitely worthwhile.The game has been broadly criticised/praised for the unfitting/fresh design.This refers to both the audiovisual side of the game and the revamped, cigarette smoking Dante.Chewing on pizza or drinking booze, no matter; the protagonist is still an arrogant badass sporting an awesome coat and a variety of demon/angel weapons, plus the good old E & I and Rebellion.The game feels smooth and enjoyable with a decent plot and mediocre replayability value.If you have a taste for carnage accompanied by violent electronic rhythms, DmC is worth a shot. A slash. You know the drill.I strongly recommend experiencing it by oneself.Don't end up with a Throat Full Of Glass.			"

												After having this game's key for like a year from the Capcom Humble Bundle I finally budged and gave this thing a try expecting to hate it. Which I totally did. It's every bit as bad and worse as I expected.Now I had already written long paragraphs going on about how this game is abysmal, and it really is, but here's the bare essentials.-Series that didn't need rebooting (thanks Inafune)-New direction that appeals to nobody-Weak world design in general (the enemies, the world, the characters all look unappealing visually)-Combat that is just servicable (when it's predecessors already had it so much better)-The writing and line delivery is headache inducing-Ninja Theory has a complete lack of understanding for what made this series appealing-As is clear from the GDC'13 panel they didn't even want to make a Devil May Cry game but a different all together-Also no understanding for how to make characters cool or likeable-Ninja Theory and journalists insulted series fans for voicing their disapproval of the gameIn short this dumpster fire of a release is just okay at best and making me want to kill myself from cringe at worst. But it could just be I don't like it because his hair is different.There is a plethora of other more fun and entertaining character action games you could be playing. Avoid this trash.			"

												Spare yourself the pain.DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!I tried to like it. I really, really tried. But... it just sucks. I can't find a single redeeming Factor to it. Everything I liked about DMC3/4 is gone. Everything. The combat doesn't feel gratifying anymore, the main protagonist is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the unreal engine sucks for character action games, the voice acting needs work, the sound design gives me headaches, the enemy designs are bad from a gameplay standpoint, there's no lock on function, the pacing needs work, Devil Trigger mode sucks, the music is uninspired and plain, the writing makes me cringe, and Vergil isn't cool anymore.  What the hell were you idiots thinking? You took everything that was good about Devil May Cry and you reuined it... all of it. I can understand if you messed up 1 or 2 things, humans are flawed after all. But you somehow managed to ruin everything. I don't know how, and I don't know why. All I know is that this game fills me with hatred and sadness. The only valid reason to play this game is if you want to study the no-no's of game design. Please just spare yourself and play DMC4.

Ok, This game is great...But, it's not really that good for someone who has played the original Devil may Cry series, or watched the anime(not a bad anime, but not to be taken seriously as canon to the series).The game its self isn't a bad game, but they even defecate in the face of the original Devil May Cry fans who play it.Including the cutscene where a wig that looks like original Dante's hair flies on the new Dante's head, and he throws it off of his head.Ok, like I said before, the game is great...The Re-imagining of the story however sucks feces.Okay, before I go all James Rolfe* on this, I'm just going to end with the Pros and ConsPros.Fun GameplayYou can get Classic Dante's hairstyle back.The new Dante has abs, and I wouldn't mind a night or two wtih him irl... :3The story is easy to follow.Cons.Dissapointing boss battles.Heaven or Hell mode is a P.O.S.You have to beat the game once if you actually want some challenge. Talking about Son Of Sparda modeThe New Dante is a pushover.He swears like some white gangsta wannabe POS.Well, I'm going to say one last thing, don't buy this on it's full price, or if you enjoyed the Original 4 Devil May Cry games (Don't get them on steam, go out and buy a playstation 2 and used copies of the Devil May Cry Games)With lots of love, Wolf D. Striker[i/](Ps, Steam needs a Meh button on the do you reccomend this game.

I have no words for this.-Mundus went from being the all powerful demon king to a stereotipical jew capitalist with junk control powers-Gameplay is way too semplistic, nowhere near dmc3 or 4-No hard lock on(mod is on its way)-Awful camera(i had to mod it)-Few enemy types and almost all very similar-Unispired level design-Combo system too generous with ranks and easy to exploit, countless times i got to the S+ ranks by simply using the weapons base combos -Gameplay ruined by enemies that require a specific weapon to be harmed, resulting in a block evey time you hit them with the wrong weapon, stopping your combo and preventing you from switching weapon when those enemies are nearbyt.-HORRIBLE boss fights, just ATROCIUS-You have to keep holding RT and LT in order to use the other weapons, making the dodge moves for those weapons completely useless, also no toggle option.-The devil trigger is the most useless♥♥♥♥♥♥i have ever seen, what is the point of throwing all the enemies in the air?

												I’m new to the DMC series, and as an outsider I’ve always viewed the old DMCs as hokey and full of cheesy acting by unrelatable characters. Therefore, DmC astounded me with its intelligent combat system, engrossing story, hyper-stylish mood, vibrant visuals, and virtually flawless execution.DmC is just an incredibly well-made game. DmC is so compelling that I started a new playthrough immediately, which is the obvious intention of the developers what with four (four!) unlockable higher difficulties.All cutscenes are skippable, although the acting is so good I find myself rewatching most the cutscenes. Death is very forgiving, and the pacing never bogs down. I didn’t encounter a single glitch, and the HD textures make for a crisp, elegant world. The sound design is superb as well.Basically DmC is a brilliant game that will last 20-30 hours if you desire to find all secrets and fully upgrade Dante. In my opinion Ninja Theory has taken DMC from niche-bizarro status to universal appeal through sheer quality of design. After 40 hours of play, I must conclude DmC is the greatest action game ever made.			"

												I REALLY wish I got around to playing this sooner. This is a fantastic reboot of Devil May Cry, and despite a really mediocre first 6-7 chapters, the game unleashes everything it has in store after that one chapter after another. The combat has been simplified without losing any of subtlety the previous games in the series have had, and while it's no where near as technically deep as DMC3 or 4, you can still unleash ridiculous combos that require a deeper understanding of the game's mechanics and weapon types. It's late, but if you were at all hesitant to play this because you didn't like the new design for Dante (a younger Dante, so it's fitting), I highly recommend you overlook that because Ninja Theory has proven they can handle the franchise.And I don't want to spoil some of the later level design, but ♥♥♥♥, they are *so* good. *SO* good.

												In my opinion this game is nothing short of brilliant. The level design is spectacular with Limbo feeling like a character itself, the story is engaging and keeps the action going, and the combat rewards those who put in time and effort to understand it. Not to mention the killer soundtrack that backs up the visceral combat. Its campaign is on the short side with a length of 6-8 hours, but the replay value is high and you will continue playing for many hours after.This is a game worth buying if not only for the sole purpose of letting the game industry know that innovation and creativity is welcome and that gamers are open to new concepts.

												Being new to the Devil May Cry franchise, I can`t speak for classic fans. But as far as Ninja Theory`s, DMC is concerned I must say it was absolutely awesome the entire way through. I am definitely not normally into the fighting genre of video games, but I must say the story and world this game twisted and turned you through was action packed, and had me so hooked I actually had to go look up the plots from the original DMC`s. As far as the combat goes the battles are beautifully fluid and almost make you feel like you`re in a movie, perfectly stringing together maneuvers. Throughout the entire game you encounter new Demons to go up against leaving you never bored. In addition, pretty much till the last few missions you will be constantly unlocking new weapons, whether it be ranged or melee. Also earning upgrades is satisfying, allowing you to unlock new abilities and moves with your weapons.  As well as increasing maximum health.  Even with all that the gameplay has more to offer; I would most definitely consider this game a platformer with the amount of climbing, jumping, and swinging that occurs. Where this game shines in my opinion is it`s one of a kind world and story. Most combat will happen once you have been dragged into “Limbo,” a city controlled entirely by Demons. The artwork in this game, (especially in Limbo) is stunning and refreshing, often having vibrant colors and offering a unique look. The demons also look like serious creatures, but still leaving enough room for the game`s dark comedic tendencies. The plot I suppose is more personal opinion but I simply couldn’t get enough! The thought of exploring the afterlife and the backstory of Dante was really cool, and the three protagonists (Dante, Kat, and Virgil) all have their reasons for what make them to me, strong characters. In particular, Dante.  Plus the thought that the world we inhabit could have far more going on than meets the eye. The voice acting in this game is nothing but the best, every moment there was dialogue I always found myself drawn. Overall this game is a must purchase, the world is one of a kind and the plot and characters were extremely engaging. DMC is on Steam right now for only $24.99, which is a steal! Just to back up my recommendation Metacritic gave this game an 85/100, IGN rated it an 8.5 also stating “This is exactly what the Devil May Cry franchise needed,” and Destructoid rated it an 9/10. These are the reasons why I give Devil May Cry a very strong recommendation! (And mission 20 is badass.)			"

												What you would expect from a Devil May Cry game.Demons, combos and of course the cocky protaganist.The weapons are fun and allow for interesting combinations, particularly the angel weaponary;If you like devil may cry, then this prequel will definitely sate your appetite.Also, I'd reccomend getting the bloody palace as it allows unlimited monster slaying as in the previous games.The only downside I'd say was that the ranged weapons are limited, slow and not really worth using (even during combos)..

Posted: February 15, 2014
												I've completed this game yesterday, and the first thought that occured to me after this was: ""I need to write a review about this"". So, here I am :)The game is brilliant, and there are a few reasons for me to say that.The first one is that the game is visually stunning. And it's not an overestimation. Almost all of the game's action takes place in the world which is parallel to our own, Limbo. And in this world, everything you look at is beautiful. Rich colors, walls and buildings floating in the air, beautiful sky, words appearing on the floor and on the walls... These things grant you mind-blowing visual experience. And yeah, about the words... As far as I understand that, those words belong to the demon, one of the final bosses of the game, Demon King Mundus. Usually, some words appear on the floor or on the walls and a harsh voice reads them. My all-time favorite words are ""♥♥♥♥ you, Dante!"" xD I laughed a lot on that one.The second reason is the game's plot. The plot is surprisingly good for a slasher! You don't expect a great plot in such a game, just because usually slashers aren't about the plot at all. However, in DmC, you won't find the best plot in the world, but it's a solid (or even more than that) storyline, it's quite intriguing and the characters are great. And of course, the best character is Dante. He's one of my favorite characters in games, mainly because of his sense of humour and his indifferent attitude to things. He knows he's the best and he behaves as one. However, this is a reboot of the old Devil May Cry series, and Dante... He's still the same. He's younger, he's impudent, he's strong and he doesn't care. If you love this character, just go on and play this game. Dante deserves it :)The most important part in slashers is the game's mechanics. Every fight is spectacular, you have A LOT of weapons and moves to choose from, and even if you're not an experienced slasher player, you'll still be able to destroy hordes of demons in any way you like. And when the fight is over, you feel the need to start another one, just to chop some more demons into mincemeat. Because chopping them is really fun in that game!Also, the soundtrack is perfect for that game. Fast extreme metal with growl vocals adds so much drive to that game, and to be honest, I don't think any other kind of music would fit for the slasher game.The only flow I'd like to underline is that the game itself is really short. I clearly understand I completed it on the easiest difficulty level (human), however I managed to complete the game in 7-8 hours. This doesn't make the game worse or anything, but I expected 25-30 hours of gameplay, something like Darksiders, you know... Oh well, the game is amazing, and that's the most important thing.Overall, if you like good slashers, or if you like stunning visual experiences, the game is totally for you. I loved it.My personal rating: 8.4 out of 10.			"

												While I haven't been following the whole Devil May Cry series, I really enjoyed the fourth game when it first came out for PC and fell in love with the visual style, the cheesy character dialogues and the Japanese story.So when I saw the first few images and videos of the DMC reboot I was... disappointed. Just like many others.But having finished the game now, I can stay rested. This game is not just an evolution of the series, it's a major improvement in every single area, with easy-to-grasp combat systems that are also difficult to master, charming characters that grow up on you and, most impressively, level design that rates among the top ones I've ever seen in a game.The levels keep dynamically changing around you in a way that makes the Limbo world where you play in most of the time a living, breathing place, which is ironic considering that it's the demon world. Some of the levels are such visual feasts that it makes you wonder how much time it took developer Ninja Theory to put those together. And the game just keeps throwing new material at you so that you never get bored too quickly of one environment.The gameplay is as fast-paced as a Devil May Cry game should be. The only issue I have with it is that sometimes you end up aiming at the wrong enemy because of the lack of a proper lock-on system. And with most of the fights consiting of multiple enemies of different kinds surrounding you, some of them that need to be attacked with specific weapons, this quickly becomes an issue.Otherwise the game makes you really feel that if you die, it was your fault, and not some cheap death artficially created by the developer to make the game harder.All in all, a must buy if you liked the previous games, and a very recommended title for those looking for a fast-paced action game.

												7 out of 10 stars. First off, Devil May Cry is a great hack and slash title. It has tongue-in-cheek humor and compelling characters. The story in DmC was original in its own right. Sure it was good Vs evil, save the world, save the girl. But it had elements only a devil may cry title could pull off. The game NOT ending in a romantic kiss was also a nice refreshing sight. Level design and the music composed was just fantastic. I loved the night club mission. I could play it over and over, Lilith's domain was by far the best. DmC did not get all 10 stars because of the repetitive enemies. By mission 3 the enemies are already dull and boring, sure new ones are always introduced but even they are already carbon copies; once you find a way to exploit them, the fights become easy.Also the combat system is rather janky, sometimes Dante would move, dodge, or jump out of time or there would a delay. No game is without its bugs so I will not fault the developers on this. However it is something players will have to simply deal with as they play through the game. Despite the flaws, the game is over all worth playing whehter casually or hardcore and fully clearing each level. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys blood and anarchy.			"

												DmC Devil May Cry is an excellent edition to the library of anyone looking for an adreneline pumping action title with silky smooth combat.  The best part of the game for me was the combat, the likes of which I had never before experienced (yes this   is my first DMC game).  The transitions between combos are so fluid you will forget about them.  The combat will eventually become second nature and you won't even need to look up combos (although this may be partially caused by the fact that there are not a lot of combo options available).  Speeking of combos, one of the funnest parts of the game was experimenting with the continuity of different combos.  Since the game does not directly state, ""use combo A then combo B to deal a lot of damage"" the player is made to experiment to see which order of not only attacks but combos was the most efficient, which again I found to be extremely enjoyable.

Hower, I enjoyed listening to Combichrist before this game was even heard of and his music  is in the game so i gave it a try. And I must admit by the end of the game the characters personalities do become close to what they were in the old dmc games and it was an amusing game in total. It's a good game for people that havnt tried playing any dmc games yet. (side note witty comments are still included even if not as much yet ;P, and this dante isnt that much of a tool.)			"

												Buy? Yes.I found Dmc to be a very solid and competent revival of the series. At first glance Dante looks a bit of a cross between an emo teen and a Jersey Shore reject, but I don't really get that vibe out of the character, other than his ""Sexual deviousness"". The gameplay is very solid and unlike the other DMCs, pretty damn fair - I've never got killed because something was attacking me off screen. In fact, it looks like some enemies don't attack you when you're off camera, so you aren't always constantly managing your camera while trying to survive and fight stylistically according to the standard Capcom ""We must judge your skill level and style"" grading system that came with many of their PS2 era games. This doesn't mean that there isn't a challenge, though, this is honestly the only DMC I have finished, so it's much easier and I think more reasonable than prior games, but unlockable difficulties makes things harder by changing the way enemies spawn (I guess different enemies than what they are scripted in the normal games, so you have to be on your toes instead of memorizing spawns). The game encouranges (Read: forces) mutliple playthroughs if you want to get 100% completion, as some early game obstacles can only be passed with later game items. Thankfully, it appears you can play any mission you have already completed during intermissions. Like many of these linear ""console style games, you may be looking for a secret around the map, but there are two to three paths and what often happens is that you will pass a ""checkpoint"" or enter an arean that ends in the typical YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE annoying game mechanics, which makes it feel like Capcom is judging you for not knowing where you were supposed to go, forcing you to look outside the game to know where to go. Yes, NINJA THEORY developed the game, not Capcom, but it's has that typical Capcom level design that pisses me off.I probably won't 100% this game, but only due to the fact that I'm trying to clear out my backlog. I find a very solid game that is probably my favorite in the series (though, I'm not sure I'm a fan as I didn't Finish 1, hated 2, and got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked in 3, so  I didn't bother with 4). The game is missing some of the original style of the original games, which will be a problem for some fans - while there is definitely the good old spectacle of this genre, much of the ""Hey, look, I'm always doing something cool and showing off, Look at my style and bad assness!"" is lost in this reimagining, but we had four games to do that, so I'm perfectly fine with this. If you had any reservations about the game and like spectacle fighters, I don't see much reason to not get it beyond price.			"

Combat is great (I hate people who nit pick about how its not as good as DMC4), story is great. Character development is great. Level design is phenomenal. Worth every penny. I don't know why Capcom Japan decides it is always best to start with a clean slate with games though, considering the last installment of the classic DMC games was the best-selling game in the series. However, this game is definitely worth a shot.			"

It starts out pretty easy, explaining all the basics and letting you learn without much hand-holding, before it begins to get difficult. The most important part, is how fun the combat is. And I have to say, it was a lot of fun.The controls were perfect, and it was a lot of fun trying new combos out on different baddies. All the demons are unique and fun to kill in their own way. It is stylish, enjoyable, and you want to get more and more points in hopes of hitting that SSS ranking. It took about 8 hours to play through all 20 missions, and I haven't even gotten into the famous NG+ content. I played through on Nephilim, or what would be hard. The graphics were pretty good, and the atmosphere was amazing. One of the best parts was the music. Ninja Theory did a great part on that, getting both Noisia and Combichrist to make some killer songs for it once again.The only two complaints I have are the cutscenes and bosses. The cutscenes, while having great voice acting, were very stiff, and didn't really look up to date compared to the rest of the game. The second problem was that the bosses were really easy. At of all of them, only one really gave me trouble, and it wasn't even the final boss. They all seemed really easy to deal with, even for a beginner like me. Now, I know I wasn't on the hardest difficulty, but I doubt everyone will play through three more times to get the rest of the difficulties unlocked.Either way, this was still a great game, and I would pick it up for the price it is at.I give it a 8.5/10			"

												The PS3 demo is a clunky mess, and a horrible representation of new Dante, and of this game. Do yourself a favor, and get the PC version, which runs at the standard 60 FPS, and allows the game to look as visually stunning as it should. Don't cheat yourself by playing the console version with this one.Dante (or Dante In Name Only, if you prefer) is a simply obnoxious character, for the first hour or so of the game. However, this quickly changes over the course of the story, which yes, this game has. Is it a great story? Maybe, maybe not, but much like Assassin's Creed 2, the main protagonist starts off as an obnoxious, overgrown teenager, and slowly matures over the course of the game, and while I submit that this game doesn't pull it off as well for me as AC2 or DMC3 did, I didn't find myself wanting to strangle the main character for 40+ hours. Can the gameplay carry itself well for that long? For the average, ""beating-the-game-on-DMD-is-good-enough"" crowd, yes. TrueStyle Tournament levels of depth? Not really, but fancy enough to be fun. Completely braindead easy? Only if you allow it to be.Love it or hate it, don't dismiss it. It's something to be checked out. Give it a chance if you love the Devil May Cry series. If the series hasn't appealed to you yet, perhaps consider giving this one a shot.			"

												DmC: Devil May Cry gets some flak from long time fans because it does some things worse than other DMC games. However, it does several things better, as well. The story is about as good as you'd expect: It's nothing extraordinary, but it won't make you sick, either. Dante is young and immature and this is the basically the story of him reaching that level of maturity you're used to seeing in other games. Don't be upset when he's kind of a punk, because that's the point.But this is also a great game for those just interested in exploring Devil May Cry for the first time because the story is a prequel and you won't have expectations set by the other games. In other words, you won't be missing anything and you won't have to know what you're missing.Pros:Some of the best keyboard and mouse controls to ever grace this genre. Powerful, satisfying sense of impact and flair in fights. Top-level combos have less to do with tiny enemy step exploits (like in previous games) and have a more normalized flow. Skill upgrades are tied to XP, not currency, and can be respecced any time between (or sometimes in the middle of) levels. The unlockable content is good, and bloody palace mode is fantastic free DLC. One of the boss fights is really creative and entertaining, but describing it would be a spoiler.Cons:Certain action-less sections of the game are unskippable and become a chore during subsequent playthoughs. Devil trigger has been reduced from an integral part of combat to a 5-10 second invulnerability button. Dante Must Die mode is significantly easier than in previous games. Enemies that can only be hurt while in demon mode or angel mode greatly reduce your combo options and suck all of the fun out of a battle. One of the bosses takes way too long to beat for the amount of variety in the fight (none).			"

												Colour me surprised!I had followed a lot of the news and recommendation around DMC and finally picked it up on sale.  It was worth the wait.One of the best new AAA titles I've played in a while.  It has the occasional hiccup in story or difficulty like you'd expect, but overall it's super polished, super fun, and the definition of Dante in this incarnation is just awesome.  Actually, dialogue all around is fantastic with this cast, and somehow a very strong point in the game.Combat is as fast and fun as ever, but I'll admit it's not great with keyboard & mouse.   Still, you probably know to expect that if you don't own a controller of sorts.Anyway, highly recommended.			"

Do yourself a favor, and get the PC version, which runs at the standard 60 FPS, and allows the game to look as visually stunning as it should. Don't cheat yourself by playing the console version with this one.Dante (or Dante In Name Only, if you prefer) is a simply obnoxious character, for the first hour or so of the game. However, this quickly changes over the course of the story, which yes, this game has. Is it a great story? Maybe, maybe not, but much like Assassin's Creed 2, the main protagonist starts off as an obnoxious, overgrown teenager, and slowly matures over the course of the game, and while I submit that this game doesn't pull it off as well for me as AC2 or DMC3 did, I didn't find myself wanting to strangle the main character for 40+ hours. Can the gameplay carry itself well for that long? For the average, ""beating-the-game-on-DMD-is-good-enough"" crowd, yes. TrueStyle Tournament levels of depth? Not really, but fancy enough to be fun. Completely braindead easy? Only if you allow it to be.Love it or hate it, don't dismiss it. It's something to be checked out. Give it a chance if you love the Devil May Cry series. If the series hasn't appealed to you yet, perhaps consider giving this one a shot.			"

												Well, I don't think that need to say something. It's DmC. It's perfect! :xI really like this reboot of the DmC series, because now I can understand better the Dante and Vergil's history, and the gameplay changes are not bad, you can't make ""crazy combos"", but the game still is really fun to play.

												Not sure why everyone throws a fit about this game. DMC 1 was trash, too held back by its Resident Evil roots. The second game was improved, but was ugly as sin. The third game is as cringe-worthy as Sonic Adventure. DMC 4 and this reboot are the only ones worth playing unless you're a middle schooler, a mall ninja, or you played the game when you were younger and need some nostalgia injected into your face.Graphics are nice, animations are fluid, combat is responsive. platforming is a blessing from the gods.Definitely worth it at full price, a must buy if it's on sale.

												I like to keep my reviews short and sweet, and I'll keep to that. DMC is a game with a pretty simple, but likeable story, decent characters and development, a good twist, excellent writing, and incredible combat. The game has fast, aggressive combat with weapons that are easily switched in an instant, and awesome combos. There is also great design, with really cool level design, bright colors, and really good indicators during combat. The game can also be pretty challenging sometimes, if you're looking for that. Overall, this game is wickedly fun, and I highly recommend it.			"

												7 out of 10 stars. First off, Devil May Cry is a great hack and slash title. It has tongue-in-cheek humor and compelling characters. The story in DmC was original in its own right. Sure it was good Vs evil, save the world, save the girl. But it had elements only a devil may cry title could pull off. The game NOT ending in a romantic kiss was also a nice refreshing sight. Level design and the music composed was just fantastic. I loved the night club mission. I could play it over and over, Lilith's domain was by far the best. DmC did not get all 10 stars because of the repetitive enemies. By mission 3 the enemies are already dull and boring, sure new ones are always introduced but even they are already carbon copies; once you find a way to exploit them, the fights become easy.Also the combat system is rather janky, sometimes Dante would move, dodge, or jump out of time or there would a delay. No game is without its bugs so I will not fault the developers on this. However it is something players will have to simply deal with as they play through the game. Despite the flaws, the game is over all worth playing whehter casually or hardcore and fully clearing each level. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys blood and anarchy.			"

												Devil May Cry is really epic with the amazing level designs. DmC is criticized mostly due to the new look of Dante as in the series before DMC3 and DMC4, he had white hair. He was one all-night-party guy who was a gentleman to girls and a badass guy to the demons. In this game, he is a badass, that's for sure. The story is nice and the gameplay is awesome. The game is addictive and fun to play.			"

												I should start out by saying I am pretty new to games, so I am just going to explain how I enjoyed it from the perspectiveOverall, the game was a lot of fun. It starts out pretty easy, explaining all the basics and letting you learn without much hand-holding, before it begins to get difficult. The most important part, is how fun the combat is. And I have to say, it was a lot of fun.The controls were perfect, and it was a lot of fun trying new combos out on different baddies. All the demons are unique and fun to kill in their own way. It is stylish, enjoyable, and you want to get more and more points in hopes of hitting that SSS ranking. It took about 8 hours to play through all 20 missions, and I haven't even gotten into the famous NG+ content. I played through on Nephilim, or what would be hard. The graphics were pretty good, and the atmosphere was amazing. One of the best parts was the music. Ninja Theory did a great part on that, getting both Noisia and Combichrist to make some killer songs for it once again.The only two complaints I have are the cutscenes and bosses. The cutscenes, while having great voice acting, were very stiff, and didn't really look up to date compared to the rest of the game. The second problem was that the bosses were really easy. At of all of them, only one really gave me trouble, and it wasn't even the final boss. They all seemed really easy to deal with, even for a beginner like me. Now, I know I wasn't on the hardest difficulty, but I doubt everyone will play through three more times to get the rest of the difficulties unlocked.Either way, this was still a great game, and I would pick it up for the price it is at.I give it a 8.5/10			"

												DmC is a good game. Like many tough men I typed a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game and Ninja Theory. Well, they are due an apology because DmC is not garbage. Dante controls very well. The weapons are fun to use and provide good variety for doing combos. Grappling enemies is stolen from DMC4 and is as fun here as it was in that game. Wrangling monsters is oddly satisfying. Someone should make an entire game about just that. Framerate is very good on my old as dirt PC. The game looks great, too. Ninja Theory is one of those developers known for great looking games and I think DmC is a good example of that. Technically it doesn't seem to do anything outrageous but the art is neat, what effects exist are used well and overall it's a pretty game. Enemies are fun to fight. They respond well to getting hit and dragged all over the place by grappling hooks. Many enemies are color coded and only vulnerable to one set of Dante's weapons. This mechanic is dumb and I don't like being forced to use certain weapons.Bosses are straight garbage. Probably the biggest flaw in the game. Every boss is right out of the Zelda/God of War school. Two or three very telegraphed, very slow attacks repeated over and over while their weak spot gets beaten up. After doing enough damage the boss gets visibly hurt, the attacks patterns speed up or very slightly change, and after another couple cycles the boss is dead. One boss is very neat looking. He's basically a demonic combination of Bill O'Reilly' and Max Headroom. The last boss is the coolest but the trick to beating him is foolish. I don't like it when a boss is completely invulnerable except for one specific thing, and especially when that thing isn't obvious. (At least, it wasn't obvious to me; maybe I am too dumb for Ninja Theory's boss fight designers.)Finally, my understanding is that NT was given this chance to revitalize the DmC brand and one area they were expected to excel was story telling. Well, they ♥♥♥♥ed that up spectacularly. The story in DmC isn't bad but it is every part as dumb, nonsensical and populated with oddball characters and off pitch characterization as every previous DmC. Why would Capcom expect any different? Devil May Cry has an insane premise and trying to present the narrative as anything but outrageous camp is doomed to fail. NT didn't make a great Devil May Cry but they made in my estimation the best Western action game of the entire HD generation. That's not saying much and Bayonetta, Ninja Gaiden 2 and of course Devil May Cry 4 are all better games. That doesn't mean DmC is worthless to Japanese action game fans. Go in with tempered expectations and I think you'll agree this is a promising step forward for Western action game development.			"

												DMC series has always been a fast paced hack n slash like no other in the genre and ninja theory's version maintains that legacy. The combat is responsive and quick. There are a lot of combinations possible using the moves given . They can be chained as the player desires. Although some hardcore fans might not be happy about seeing the beloved Dante's look changed. If you can look past it or want to get in the series this is the right game. The Story is average and quite linear and character do develop by the end, especially the relatioship of Dante and Vergil. Level design is amazing. Overall the game maintains the Stylish!!!! fast paced combat which the franchise is known for.The DLC of bloody palace and Vergil's downfall are good value for money. Vergil although isnt as op as in DMC3 is still quick and is fun to play with. The only thing which I felt was lacking was the boss fights werent as challenging as compared to previous DMC titles and personally i dont like the lock on been removed, it sometime is irritating when ou are trying to do a sequence of moves and the Dante or Vergil might just go to someone other enemy entirely mid combo. But other then that Overall the game is good and solid gamelay. With a lt of replayability factor.			"

The controller was to be preferred but that is expected. However, the mouse and keyboard work surprisingly well for this game.   This is also one of the best ports I've ever played. I cranked everything as high as it could go and still ran at a solid 200fps+ which is more than you can say about most ports these days.   I've always been a fan of spectacle fighters and I enjoyed this one alot. It is one of the better ones in recent time for sure. However, some hardcore fans of the earlier DmC games might disagree.

Also the boss fights are pretty hard and they make a lot of fun. Also searching for all the differnt objects you can find in this game is a big competition, because some of them are pretty hard to find.Another aspect, which makes this game great, although it sounds pretty weird, is the soundtrack. You just get an unbelieavable feeling, destroying enemies and listen to great music!The story is ok, it is not the such a great story line as in other big Triple A games, but it is definatly ok. Also not the story, but the gameplay the most important acepect in the game.All in all I can just recommend this game and it is definatly worth the money!			"

												I’ll answer the big question right off the bat and save some time. That question being is this a good DMC game? The answer to that is no it is not. Does that make it a bad game? Not at all, in fact it is a great game and I loved it. As a result I feel that amount of backlash and hate it got was mostly unjustified. With that said I would recommend it to anyone on the fence about buying it. Whether you are an advent DMC player like me or someone who is looking for a new experience. Overall it’s an 8.5/10Below are more detailed reviews for those who want to know more. ___________________________________________________________________For those new to the series:This game is a reboot to the series, not a continuation from DMC 4 or any other game. If you try to go back in the series expecting to see edgy Dante you are going to be horribly lost. Even though I do recommend this game I strongly recommend starting with DMC 3 or 4.Pros:>Visually stunning graphics and levels> Fluid game mechanics and combo system that is extremely satisfying when fighting> Variety of weapons and gadgets for stringing together combos or just fooling around (personal favorite is using the sticky dart to mess with low rank enemies)> The concept of demons integrating into modern society and controlling mankind through media and soft drinks is a funny and refreshing idea to the series.>Moves can be practiced in the item shop before being purchased and can be refunded for new moves. Allowing for a high level of customization freedom.> Great amount of enemy variety> Has a good degree of replay value. > You can punch Bill O’Reilly in the face.For those returning:>	The combat feels similar to past installments >	Guns are more viable during combat with a wider range of upgrades>	Weapon and character upgrades are now dependent on your overall rating during gameplay making it all the more rewarding to get that SSS ranking during combos (They aren’t given out like candy but given in moderation).>	Secret missions can be accessed from the mission menu when they are unlocked. Cons:>	The story is horrible and feels like it was ripped of fanfic.net>	The humor is overly ribald and unnecessary.>	Boss battles are pretty simplistic and too easy.>	Color coded enemies become frustrating and interrupt combos frequently>	The game glitches at times and causes Dante to get stuck in either angel weapon mode or devil weapon mode forcing the player to restart from a checkpoint. >	Voice acting is subpar with the exception of Vergil’s voice actor.>	The ophion weapon whips can be unresponsive at times during platform sections.>	There is no lock on button meaning that Dante will be stuck fighting the first thing he sees.For those returning:>      Chances are if you're coming off from a past installment you'll be dropping your combos often.>	Characters feel out of place and don’t do their predecessors justice. >	Combo system and boss battles feel extremely dumbed down. >	Devil trigger feels like a slap in the face as Dante doesn’t turn into a demon but rather a white haired version of himself. >	In order to do secret missions we now need keys to open the doors that hold them. >	Bloody palace has to be downloaded separately.The biggest complaint I have as a returning players is that the reboot was unnecessary and that the concept and mechanics could have been implemented in a sequel instead with original dante or even nero.

												This game was just awesome. DMC takes place in a modern world that is ruled by demons without us even knowing it. It centers around the character Dante and his brother who are the only ones who can end the demon's rule. The game is a reboot of the Devil May Cry series and I have to say, this is BY FAR the best Devil May Cry game yet. The game offers some of the best combat systems in a hack n' slash game EVER. I don't think I have ever played a game like this that had such a smooth, responsive, and intense combat system. The game is well optimized so most systems will be able to run this game at a smooth 60 FPS with the games nice visuals which does nothing but help the fun of the game. The port of the game was well done but I can't say how the game works on mouse and keyboard but for the most part hack n' slash games work best on controllers so I would recommend you plug in a Suxbox Threefixme controller into your PC for this game. The storyline in this game is good and enjoyable but if you played the other DMC games you will already know how it all turns out. The game is fairly long compared to other hack n' slash games clocking in at about 6-10 hours depending on how much you explore and how fast you are with the combat. New Game + is supported in this game and it should be in more games. The difficulty in this game is fantastic and has some different difficulties you can play once you finish the game once for those hardcore fans. I loved this game and I would recommend it to any gamer looking for a great hack n' slash game and to any fans of the earlier Devil May Cry games. 95/100			"

Enjoyed myself and would play a game like this again, but with my cost ratios I think about, I'd say don't drop over 10$ on this. If you can get it for that, totally a deal.			"

												In this game you take control of Dante (teen years) and then go forth to overthrow the evil lord on Earth. Sounds pretty straight forward right? Wrong!! It gets interesting with the higher difficulties and massive variety of combo's and weapon combinations. Go forth; slay demons, harpies, chainsaw freaks, bats, tanks, wolves, succubus and more. With a gripping story, a genuine feel for the character and the bonds therein, this game really has a massive amount of replay value as you unlock skins, harder difficulties and of course, bragging rights with these achievements!! :DRegarding the DLC, to be honest, the levels are intruiging, but short. Nonetheless, the gameplay is much faster as Vergil can quickly swap between enemies with his teleporting abilities and the combination of attacks also make it very interesting. All and all, I'd rate it 10/10 in my books.			"

												Ok let me start this off by saying I LOVE the original Devil May Cry series (except 2). Over the top action, cool weapons and ridiculousness abounded in each game, getting more crazy as the series progressed. This, unfortunately, is an exception. While the gameplay is fun, and some of the puzzles are kinda clever, the overall feel is...well hollow. One of the things that made the previous games entertaining was the way Dante acted, causal and laid back. Here? Teen angst to the max, complete lack of reason, and the version just comes off as a complete jerk. Other classic characters from the series share very little with their original counterparts, and the story felt too toned down. I get that Capcom is trying to appeal to this generation's audience, but I feel like more effort could have been put into this game. This is not to say, however, that the game is complete mess. The new weapons and abilities feel very DMC and the idea of the environment being your enemy is a cool concept; but its execution falls disappointingly short. Overall, the game isn't complete garbage, but it feels like a half-done idea rushed into production. Better luck next time, Capcom.Final Grade: D-			"

												TL:DR - 7.5/10 for fun action gameplay, easy mechanics, and an okay storyline. Worth it if on sale, up to you at full price.I have just finished my playthrough of both the base game and the DLC Fall of Vergil gameplay on Devil Hunter difficulty. DMC has the humor and I feel they got Dante's cocky demeanor down to perfection. The story was pretty good, if not predictable at times but you don't really play games like these for stories, you play them to feel like a badass. In this case, the game delivers. The game is kind of short, as I have beaten the base game in 8 hours and the DLC in about 2.Dante is given his trusty Ebony and Ivory, his sword Rebellion, and four other types of weapons. Two of them being more power based and the other two being more speed based. You can switch between the four extra weapons seamlessly for some pretty awesome combos. I found it pretty easy to get at least an S rating on combos once I got the controls down and I got them down really quickly. It's easy to understand how each weapon works and you're pretty much limited by your creativity when it comes down to putting combos together. Since I played the game on Devil Hunter (normal), it wasn't that hard to beat but still challenging enough to feel satisfied when you get an SSS combo score. No doubt the harder difficulties will provide some fun and frustration.Fall of Vergil really pales in comparison. I know it's a DLC so it won't have as much content but will Vergil you're only given Yamato and his Illusion powers. Don't get me wrong, Vergil's a badass and it was rewarding to kick♥♥♥♥♥with him once I got used to him. The difference is that while Dante has an arsenal of weapons that allow him to handle multiple enemies at once allowing you to be a powerhouse, Vergil was more limited and I felt you have to be more evasive and strike more precisely. That said, his demon form is pretty cool and is a little more dynamic than Dante. Still it doesn't beat being able to switch multiple weapons and going to town on those demons.The only way this game could have been better is a longer game and more interesting characters.Do I recommend this game at full price? As cheap as I am, I would say no. But I feel I'm an outlier of the average consumer when it comes to assessing the worth of games. I'm incredibly cheap and I only ever really buy during sales. That said, I bought this game during the Summer Sale and by that I would absolutely recommend getting this game.I say wait for a sale and then get it. But that's my personal opinion.			"

												Whether you're an oldschool DMC fan and haven't tried this one because of Dante's hair or the new story, or new to the series completely, you're in FOR A TREAT. The game's combat can be insanely fun and challenging, with quite a decent amount abilities to unlock and slice waves of demons with. Lots of combo variety that you're gonna have to master in order to get those delicious SSS ranks. Combichrist and Noisia are providing you with sick demon killing fuel music in the background with industrial metal riffs that will be stuck in your head for weeks. The game's story can feel a little dry or silly at times but still retains a lot of elements from the older DMC games and wraps up nicely. The only other con for me are the boss fights, who could have had a little bit more complexity to them, but are still fun and decently challenging.The higher difficulties just take the cake for me.Worth every cent.

												Considering this is my first game in the DMC series, I guess I don't really have much to go by, but without a doubt, this was one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time.  Qualms about Dante's character aside (though I actually found Dante quite likeable as his character developed), the visual style and art direction are fantastic.  The world of Limbo crawls alive around Dante, often begging you to stop and look out into the distance.  Yet before you earn this respite to enjoy the view, you'll often find yourself engrossed in combat with the various monsters that'll be thrown at you.  By far the strongest and most important aspect of the game (besides the divvying up of angel and demon monsters), DMC's combat feels tight, fluid, and (though apparently simpler than previous games) feels very much streamlined.  Though there are no huge combo strings to learn (thank god) attacks flow seamlessly into each other, each weapon with its own rhythm and set of attacks.  DMC combat appears simple, but still feels incredibly satisfying when self-made combos can be pulled off.Vergil's Downfall (which I also ended up buying after I beat the main game) is satisfying in its own right.  Though it lacks the fantastical environments of the main game, playing as Vergil and seeing an ""end"" to his story has its own unique yet highly enjoyable feel.			"

If you think you are good with your gamepad, then you should try this stylish action game. The moves are cool, and you never get tired of watching the protagonist's acrobatic fights. The demon designs are sick. Maybe some people will find this game repetitive, but in fact the weapon combinations will keep you occupied for hours and hours. Really recommended for completionists out there.			"

												Unlike common opinion due to the controversy for the new look of the franchise, I think this game is pretty good, awesome visual style, awesome soundtrack, groundbreaking level design (quite literally), really well balanced gameplay and combat based more on skill and reflexes than just memorizing attack patterns, the weakest part would be the fairly average story, but it's completely compensated by all its strengths.Some people say it's too easy for hardcore people, but I believe there's a thin line between a fair challenge, and just stupid impossible, this game has a difficulty for real casual players and for those who seek a true challenge, and playing on the hardest difficulties will always keep you on edge.This game is worth every single pennie if you give it a chance, for those who are still mad for the new Dante, it can be at least a good way to release stress hacking and slashing.

DMC is a fun hack 'n' slash game with skills that feel powerful and enough abilities to mix things up stylishly and effectively. I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Limbo, the world where most of the action takes place, showing the demonic influence on everyday events in the ""real"" world. If you're a die-hard Devil May Cry fan, you may take issue with the change of style and pace.

												Short and Detailed review. Don't vote if you don't bother to read.PROS: Jawdropping level design and audio-visual experience. Reworked but still great combat with some creative enemies. Fantastic narrative and rather simple but very enjoyable plot with great character progression and drama (especially if you know what these rebooted versions of the characters are supposed to be like). Surprisingly intellectual social-criticism which is the last thing I have expected. Online leaderboards for everything as a welcome addition for professional DMC players, supporting the well known series of higher than higher than high difficulty levels. High replay value, and longer playtime than any other DMCs, added tiny things that help the professionals keep track of their progress.CONS: You really have to force yourself through tolerating Dante's personality early on. Alternative costumes, traditionally unlocked by succes on higher difficulties are cut out paid DLC (some remain free). PC version feels abandoned by devs. Context: it is a freaking good PC version, have no doubt. Technically even far superior and better optimized than it's console counterparts. It just pisses me off that despite paying for Vergil's Downfall DLC, and basicly every DLC for full price just because well, fanatism, the later relased nextgen version gets additional content such as a different, new Bloody Palace mode for Vergil, turbo mode and alternative controls by getting the focus system added back. Hell I'd even pay for the Definite Edition full price, as stupid as this is, to have those on PC. Sadly, we don't. There are no cool weapon acquisition cutscenes. Vergil's hat. What were they thinking?Detailed review:First of all: before it's relase, I really hated DmC. It directly spits on everything that defined the franchise, it's characters and design and goes straight to the opposite direction, in a way maybe 10 year olds think it is cool. Continous needless swearing and primitive talk, antisocial irritating skinny toughguy behaviour from the main character (who -by accident for sure- just happend to look exactly the same as the dev company's boss until the early fan outrage that thankfully forced changes before relase) disgusting things, replaced all the sort-of japanese high fantasy / gothic looks and the classy, elegant characters - and some of the cutscenes directly mock players like ""yeah you liked the old one? **** you then, this is better!"", among others the white hair scene early on.Despite all the hate I had towards DmC before it's relase, I've seen a really good trailer for it and decided to give it a chance - and I did not regret it. Oh boy, quite the opposite. Dante's new personality sometimes still makes me want to let him die on every corner, but looking at the greater picture the having his early personality like.. what it is, early on is a genius. Not because I like any of it, but because it adds marvelously executed, meaningful character progression to the story. It makes the lead character hated by the play, and by the end achieves the same character to be liked by the same player. And that's a big thing. Without spoilers, you cannot compare to what Dante becomes by the end of the story to what he used to be at the start of it. And there are a lot tiny details hidden though the plot that slowly changes him to a very likeable character who stands up for the weak he literally ""doesn't give a **** about"" before.The stage design is jawdropping. The oversatured colors really work well in limbo as a contrast to reality's empty greyness which we also live in. The on the fly transforming levels and the ""They Live"" movielike hidden messages or I could even say direct references spread out through the whole city combines to a never before and I risk to say it nowhere else to be seen experience. Overall it is unique visual experience with hardly any competitor because simply there is nothing like it, especially looking at triple A relases (for the picky ones, yes, as a matter of fact it's possible I overlooked some nobodyheardofit indie title that is similar). The visuals are supported with adrenaline pumping heartbeat accelerating aggrotech music by Combichrist and drum n' base / dubstep / breakbeat / whatever they are NOISIA. First is responsible for painting a badass audio layer on the chaos of limbo during combat and certain cutscenes (with even the song's titles adding thoughts and tiny details to story, such as ""Empty"" for the last mission), second has done many electronic background music for stages that sometimes even change and transform matching the music's tempo. Just like other aspects of the game, I also didn't really like it before relase but quicky grew to be one of my favourite.The gameplay has gone through significant changes aswell compared to the original series. Most of Dante's moves still remain (altho' named slightly differently and it kind of gives away a pathetic feeling how the devs really want to send a message about ""ours is better!"" to the fans of the original series. Like million stab became trillion stab, and pretty much everywhere they just want to say ""bigger"" than the source material they worked from). Controls are really different because  there is no focus system and it rarely but can be problematic when you try to focus some airborne enemies with ground enemies below them, but for those who aren't looking forward to play the extreme on top of extreme difficulty levels, just ignore what I said, it really won't matter. Combat design shifted from difficult executions and frame-cancelling to smarter positioning and isolating, making the tougher fights actually tactical and control based far more than hightech player execution lockdown damage nuking. The gameplay is still as fast as before, or even faster, only the controls required to play it fast got a lower requirement which makes this entry of the series a very user friendly one, unlike the others before, and at the same time still keeps the challanging and hightech execution aspect for those who look for it, on higher difficulties.As a huge fan of the original DMC, as I said I really hated DmC at first. But it succeeded in exceeding my expectations continously over and over on every aspect that defines a game (gameplay, story and it's narrative on it's own, actually meaningful character drama and relationships, audiovisual experience). Yes, it is significantly different than it's predecessors. Yes, characters are nothing like the old ones, one of Vergil's moves somewhere in the middle of the story still bothers me, and I still cannot help but hate D--ch-bag Dante early on in the story. But give it a thought after you finished the game and look back, and you'll see the big picture I see, and it makes the game a damn well done masterpiece, on top of a very enjoyable journey as the first playthrough. And after DMC3SE, a dream came true that I could live to see Dante and Vergil work together as brothers through an entire game.			"

												I'm not fresh on the old games. So this review might not contain the angst of the diehard fans, that being said it will be as objective I could give. When I first saw the teaser for this game and Dante's new look, I was in the outraged group of people. I remember swearing not to play this game and yet here I am. The main part of this game I feel will be remembered is its aesthetics. It's beautiful. And that's ultimately what's captured my interest after the failure that was the my introduction to this game. Distinct aesthetics mean good direction, and direction is what most games lack. But i digress. Despite the game's gorgeous looks, and this product being a port, the optimization is quite decent. It's not ideal, but it's more than passable. And the port itself was made not in a money-grubbing way. There are some problems here and there, but they do not really interfere with your experience. Production is really hit and miss. For example Dante and Vergil are voiced by one actor, and sometimes it really shows, breaking the immersion. Sometimes they even look too much the same and it doesn't help. Brothers don't really work that way. But then there are some props like graffiti art that warmed my heart and really did help with immersion. So that's up to you. In the process of the game you can unlock cool concept art too. But they show all of it in credits roll, so i did not really get that. Music is much the same techno sounding metal stuff, as in the last few titles, if a bit modernized, it felt fitting to this game overall. Gameplay wise there is not really much to tell. It's hack and slash, it's enjoyable. Honestly, i can understand the new looks too. It's not the long-haired flannel wearing grunge kids that are today's youth, right? Overall it's a must play. I haven't had this much fun in a while. I don't know about DLC, though. Production values are lower, most everything is rehashed. If you really enjoyed the original game maybe try the DLC. I wouldn't reccomend, though.			"

												""THIS IS HARD HITTING NEWS BOB!""First it has to be said - don't listen to the DMC fanboys who hated on this game since the reveal trailer. They hate the game no matter what, and their oinions can't be taken seriously.How do you know if they're a biased fanboy? Telltale signs include called Dante 'Donte', and outright hatred and vitriol towards the games existance.Now that we have that out of the way and the baggage of a much loved franchise is put aside, is this game good or not? The answer is yes, it's a very good game, in fact it's one of the best action games I've ever played.Devil May Cry 1 was an instant classic, it was my first PS2 game and is still my favourite DMC game. I've played every game in the series, including the terrible sequel, and in my opinion DmC is easily the second best game in the series. Arguably it's the best. Note that many consider DMC3 to be the best, and that's perfectly agreeable, I ultimately prefer 1 because of the atmosphere, and Dante in DMC3 was a little too over the top, OK a LOT over the top.DmC has the best combat and platforming in the series, the most well told and interesting story (it fleshed out the characters in a way that the entire tetralogy never did), and it also has one of the most striking and interesting visual designs I've seen in a AAA game.Ultimately this game is pure fun, as with most straight up action games, you know what you're getting - linear level design, fast and furious combat, in your face characters and a rocking soundtrack. I've played all major franchises in this genre - DMC, God of War, Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden; DmC is easily the best of the genre available on PC.The goal of these games is to make you feel like an all-powerful badass, and have fun while you do it, DmC delivers.Get it, have fun, kick♥♥♥♥♥- win.P.S. Make sure to get Vergil's Downfall, truly a great little piece of DLC that completes a fan favourite character's arc to the dark side.			"

												Not normally one for hack & slash games, but I did find this game quite enjoyable. Graphics and gameplay are awesome. There was something quite satisfying about beating the crap out of hordes of enemies.The only thing that struck me as a little odd was that the boss fights were way too easy. I remember (back in my day) when boss fights were challenging, really challenging, to the point that when you get to them there’s a slight feeling of dread at the beginning of every boss fight and a sigh of relief once you finally beat them. But in DMC you get to the stage that when you see a boss health bar you just see it as another monster that just takes a bit longer to dispatch. "

												Being a hardcore Devil May Cry fan myself you'd proably think I'm one of those shuttle♥♥♥♥s that hate on this game, but I actually love it. I jerk off to it every once in a while and when I mean once in a while I mean ever time I get the.......chance. Sorry about that I was jerking off to it. Chance taken as you can.......see. Sorry I did it again, I hope you get the point. The game isn't without its flaws but as a whole its ♥♥♥♥ing great. The soundtrack(AKA the combichrist opening that I would scalp a man to) is great and punchy. No song other than my scalping song really stood out besides the Bill O'Smiley boss fight. Everything else kinda dissapeared in the wind just like the voice of reason which I strangled and sold to buy this game. The combat was amazing but who that actual♥♥♥♥♥♥licking, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing,♥♥♥♥♥♥inserting, nazi loving, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thought,""Hey look how every game ever has ""x/square"" as the meelee button so lets be different because I'm a hipster all of a sudden!"" and didn't blow their brains out? Well they probably did but life goes on. Not for that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Easiest 14k I've ever made.....and spent on a few thousand gallons of lube. Off topic. The pacing is wionderful, the weapons are diverse but some of their uses are shoehorned on for the sake of massaging Kat's perfectly spherical breasts. MMM girl. Anyways, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing great, you should buy it. If you don't, well thats fine.......until you hear never surrender playing in the background.			"

												From the view point of someone who hasn't played the other DMC and has not gotten the fanboy fever I can happily say that this game is one of the greatest I've played in a long while. The combat is some of the most satisfying ever and the story is actualy pretty cool I like it. First I thought this game would be one of these games that were over hyped just because it was ahead of it's time(Talking about the whole series) but now when I've played this one I think I may try the others if they are anything like this :DI recommend you buying this game(Now especialy because of the sale) and play it. Such fun much DmC :DDDDDDD			"

												Okay, because a lot of fans of Devil May Cry dislike the new Dante, i'm gonna talk about just how the game plays.In my honest opinion, the combat is a hit and miss, though thankfully more of the former than the latter from what I've played.Yes, it sucks that the color coded knights force you to use either your angel or demon weapon (though from what i've played, i've seen less of them as the game progresses).However, my main gripe with the game is the lack of a proper targeting system. However, those problems are offset with the overall combat system, as you can easily switch between the Angel and Demon weapons simply through pressing the left and right triggers respectively, which I felt held the game together.

												Shallow and slow combat, which never reachs the depth of the original series, plus no lock-on makes it impossible to target the enemies that you want, which creates some frustrating moments.Terrible characters, it's not just Dante, the worst one is actually Vergil.Some unskippable moments make it a slog in subsequent playthroughs.The port is excellent, and aesthetically the levels look good and the level design is great and all but when the most important part of the game is so shallow, it makes the game hard to recommend.

												A wonderful game of a great series.DMC is for all those who love the stylish fast paced multi button combos.Gamepad is heavily recommended as one gets 7 weapons in total each with different buttons for combos,so switching between them is made easy with gamepad.Death is forgiving and the difficulty unlocks are very good,making sure the DMC hardcore fans have a lot to play for .The boss fights are a bit disappointing compared to DMC 4 ,which had a lot of bosses.But apart from this, a lof of emphasis has been made to normal units ,many of which are unique and have different powers .Going up in the difficulty ladder gives a different set of enemies in the same environment , which will need different strategies to ensure a smooth progression to the next level.All in all, a good game and would recommend it to the DMC fans .

The combat system is also really good and fast pased especially on Dante Must Die mode. I recommend giving the game a try and don't listen to people who say you should'nt buy it cause of the new look. the story and gameplay is amazing and if you really are a fan of the series then whats stopping you getting the full story?.

												Bought this game a while back, and i gotta say, it's no way a devil may cry game. (mostly just similar hack and slash combat system) But it's quite fun. Aside from all the non canon plot and backstory, there were acouple things i just didn't like: The story was mediocre at best, mostly predictable ending and plot points; how the game has times where it really plays its self; the distinct lack of puzzles, heck, i started the game hating the rebooted characters, espically dante, but over time, i grew to put all that behind me, that's only because i looked at this like like a different franchise all together. This game was actually challenging on average difficultly, which makes the many difficulties that more terrifying.Some of the things i really liked about this game:-The Music: the music in this game was all produced by one group, which gave it consistantcy. The music in the game really does a great job blending from combat music to ambience. But along with that, the music really did fit the style of the game, a little bit of edm, mixed with some metal. All the bosses had their own music, and the repeated music is really enjoyable. It really makes you want to take on every demon spawn that comes your way!-The level design/overall art style: if theres one thing i love the most about this game, it's the levels, so much work went into this world (espically when you get to the tv place). It really feels like a unique experience every level, which was something a few of the original dmc games lacked. The artstyle was the real cherry on top, they really didn't try for realism in this game (original artstyle is one of my favorite things) they had a comicbook/western animation style, and stuch with it.-satisfying gameplay and combat: this game was well cared for in the combat mechanics department, it feels so great to slash and bash enemies, and the combos are much easier to obtain (unlike in previous installments in the series) The weapons in this game are also compelling, from powerfists to shurikens, you'll be wanting to use all of the weapons to get as high of a hit score as possible, and with a simple weapon switching system, you can pull of alot of diverse combos, and feel like a badass the whole time.sure, some of the enemies are annoying.. but that just makes it all the more satisfying when you kill the last one and get that slow-mo money shot.Overall: if you're a die-hard dante fan, maybe don't play this one (unless you're openminded) but if you like hack and slash games, like beyonetta, or god of war, that means you don't really give a damn about plot, and this game is for you.If you really want to get started with this genre of video game, I absolutely recommend this game			"

This game was so satisfying to play. Decent boss fights satisfying combat depth and that tried and true Capcom level of Hiding Secrets that you feel like you should be able to solve but your bad and it makes you feel bad?My one gripe is some early levels have content locked behind upgrades you find in later levels so you have to play the game more then once to actually get everything. No Clean perfect runs. But for what it is I would highly recomend picking this game up on any discount. It was great every minute I played it.			"

This game has an engaging story, witty humor, gorgeous visuals at 60fps (PC), semi-satifyingly creative boss battles, and a character development of the main character that you dont find in many games.

There are a lot of combinations possible using the moves given . They can be chained as the player desires. Although some hardcore fans might not be happy about seeing the beloved Dante's look changed. If you can look past it or want to get in the series this is the right game. The Story is average and quite linear and character do develop by the end, especially the relatioship of Dante and Vergil. Level design is amazing. Overall the game maintains the Stylish!!!! fast paced combat which the franchise is known for.The DLC of bloody palace and Vergil's downfall are good value for money. Vergil although isnt as op as in DMC3 is still quick and is fun to play with. The only thing which I felt was lacking was the boss fights werent as challenging as compared to previous DMC titles and personally i dont like the lock on been removed, it sometime is irritating when ou are trying to do a sequence of moves and the Dante or Vergil might just go to someone other enemy entirely mid combo. But other then that Overall the game is good and solid gamelay. With a lt of replayability factor.			"

												DMC is a fun game and the story is something new which I enjoy a lot. Combat is fluid and the animations are realistic. Story-wise, so not like Devil May Cry to me. It has a completely new lore with the demon concept in it.The replay value of this game in my opinion is low. I replayed Devil May Cry 3 and 4 countless times. This one however, I forget about it once I have beaten the game because nothing to me is worth seeing again for the second time.			"

												Unlike common opinion due to the controversy for the new look of the franchise, I think this game is pretty good, awesome visual style, awesome soundtrack, groundbreaking level design (quite literally), really well balanced gameplay and combat based more on skill and reflexes than just memorizing attack patterns, the weakest part would be the fairly average story, but it's completely compensated by all its strengths.Some people say it's too easy for hardcore people, but I believe there's a thin line between a fair challenge, and just stupid impossible, this game has a difficulty for real casual players and for those who seek a true challenge, and playing on the hardest difficulties will always keep you on edge.This game is worth every single pennie if you give it a chance, for those who are still mad for the new Dante, it can be at least a good way to release stress hacking and slashing.

												First off I'm someone who never played 1 or 2 but , I played 3 and 4.This is a solid game but this Dante is nothing like the others.He is cringy and fake , it seems he tries very hard to be edgy and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but he is not.He seems to be a automaton who speaks words and has fake emotions to try and fool everyone around him.Vergil is not Vergil either.Why would Kat even like a robot , some kind of fetish I can only assume; She is alright and the demons are more likeable than the nephilim.Backspace is your friend in this game :) Press it every time you see the robot and his act.The gameplay is solid and very good.This is all I liked about this game.Lots of fun is what I'm having so far.If you want a hack and slash with tons of moves and combos this is it.If you never played a DMC game before you can jump into this one without having to know any of the past games because this is a reboot with a robot.I would definitely recommend this game for the gameplay.    I'm going to add more to this review once I spend a bit more time in this game.I just wanted to get this out there for some who have questions on what I think.			"

												Not normally one for hack & slash games, but I did find this game quite enjoyable. Graphics and gameplay are awesome. There was something quite satisfying about beating the crap out of hordes of enemies.The only thing that struck me as a little odd was that the boss fights were way too easy. I remember (back in my day) when boss fights were challenging, really challenging, to the point that when you get to them there’s a slight feeling of dread at the beginning of every boss fight and a sigh of relief once you finally beat them. But in DMC you get to the stage that when you see a boss health bar you just see it as another monster that just takes a bit longer to dispatch. "

												""THIS IS HARD HITTING NEWS BOB!""First it has to be said - don't listen to the DMC fanboys who hated on this game since the reveal trailer. They hate the game no matter what, and their oinions can't be taken seriously.How do you know if they're a biased fanboy? Telltale signs include called Dante 'Donte', and outright hatred and vitriol towards the games existance.Now that we have that out of the way and the baggage of a much loved franchise is put aside, is this game good or not? The answer is yes, it's a very good game, in fact it's one of the best action games I've ever played.Devil May Cry 1 was an instant classic, it was my first PS2 game and is still my favourite DMC game. I've played every game in the series, including the terrible sequel, and in my opinion DmC is easily the second best game in the series. Arguably it's the best. Note that many consider DMC3 to be the best, and that's perfectly agreeable, I ultimately prefer 1 because of the atmosphere, and Dante in DMC3 was a little too over the top, OK a LOT over the top.DmC has the best combat and platforming in the series, the most well told and interesting story (it fleshed out the characters in a way that the entire tetralogy never did), and it also has one of the most striking and interesting visual designs I've seen in a AAA game.Ultimately this game is pure fun, as with most straight up action games, you know what you're getting - linear level design, fast and furious combat, in your face characters and a rocking soundtrack. I've played all major franchises in this genre - DMC, God of War, Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden; DmC is easily the best of the genre available on PC.The goal of these games is to make you feel like an all-powerful badass, and have fun while you do it, DmC delivers.Get it, have fun, kick♥♥♥♥♥- win.P.S. Make sure to get Vergil's Downfall, truly a great little piece of DLC that completes a fan favourite character's arc to the dark side.			"

												I hated the new character design when it was first shown.. There, I said it!DMC as a franchise is something I've always held close to my heart growing up. It was the first tv-ad I can remember showcasing a mature PS2 title and with a badass looking character. I got the game, loved it! Granted the sequel was vastly inferior but after that it seems Capcom has done well with the franchise. The one thing that's always been off with the series has been the lack of story. Much like Mortal Kombat, they actually went back and tried to fix that aspect in the reboot. Is it for the better or for the worse?Better! With DMC4 they obv tried something more but it was for a character we were never attached to, one that never got well recieved and the story overall was a clusterfu*k!This reboot completely re-establishes the DMC universe with interest and for the first time in the series it finally feels right. Gameplay has always been fun but the story was never too much for discussion. I'm thankful Ninja Theory took over this project.Dante is back! Nero wasn't Dante, this one is for sure. The cockiness and attitude is back, the feel of DMC3 with a younger version of himself is at hand and we get to experience what made the character so great in the first place. Everything comes in place with this game. The best thing is, it feels natural and not forced!Minor spoilers ahead:So it's explained Dante is a hybrid and offspring of the love between a demon and an angel, as such he can wield powers between the two races. This is something I cant remember have been explained prior in any of the previous games, BUT it feels so obvious that it should have been! I never gave much thought about it before but now I can't understand how this wasn't part of the old universe! Ninja Theory got me hooked by mission 2 and I've never felt this excited going through the game for the story parts!Gameplay is fine as expected as well, not even worth stating the obvious.Final word from an old-school DMC fan?Yes again the look, hated it when it was first released.. It does however fit with his younger self perfectly and honestly it felt natural within the first 3 missions or so. I have to say that if you're unsure because of the idea of the new design and reboot - TRY IT! I'd be surprised if you cant get attached to this amazing persona and gameplay.This is handsdown the best game of the franchise yet with the exception of DMC3Bosses aren't as memorable and overall the game feels easier despite me being rusty for not playing DMC4 in 5 years. I keep getting A-S ranks in first atempts thus far.ALSO there's some random crashes here and there but its not destroying the game experience since theres now checkpoints during stage progress.Overall I'd give this a pretty solid 4/5 - I hope this isn't the final entry as I want more of this greatness!

												For someone who is now a huge fan of DMC 3 and 4, I don't see where all the hate comes from in regards to DmC: Devil May Cry. My best guess in most cases is due to the fact that fans desperately wanted DMC5 (which I totally understand) and didn't receive what they'd been hoping for.DmC retains the same fast paced combat and stylish combos from the previous game, but has undergone some changes which make it distinct and quite different. Combat is much faster this time around, and arguably a ton more fluid. It looks great on the unreal engine and has what I consider to be an interesting artistic design. A newly composed soundtrack in combination with the quick and flashy combat makes for a lot of fun. Honestly, it made me feel 'cool'.Anyways, this is a solid game in its own right, but not a solid DMC game in the traditional sense. It's very similar, but it's different and changed in ways that hardcore fans of the originals will not appreciate. That being said, if you're fairly open to having fun and enjoying an actiony hack and slash type game, then I'd recommend giving this a go. It's not as replayable or skill based as previous DMC games, but it will give you a solid couple hours of fun. The DLC with Vergil is a nice challenge, and entertaining due to giving a new playstyle.			"

												I will preface this with a statement: I wouldn't call myself an avid DmC fan. I have the other games. I've played them, and they were fun. Heard varying opinions of this game and got it on sale to see for myself. First off, a lot of the people saying its horrible and the spawn of Satan and the like are wrong. Kinda. It has its good points, it has its bad points, and it has quite a few just plain mediocre points, so I'll try and be as fair as I can here.(Warning. Warning. A new Wall of Text approaches.)First off, how does it play? Decently. Combat is nice and smooth, flows really well, but... it's not at all that difficult. Some of it just gets kind of silly too. Once the grab mechanics got introduced, I almost immediately figured out how to just return to my home planet without much difficulty at all. While things like this are usually possible, in this game it seems rather hilariously simple to discover and then spam them to your heart's content. Also, Dante's devil trigger is kind of silly. He freezes time, which would normally have me :D'ing, but then he flings everyone up into the air where they are annoying to hit, invalidating every single ground combo I have, basically. Anyway, I didn't find quite as much depth or challenge to the fighting mechanics as I would nessecarily like, but this is coming from a guy who loves Dark Souls and plays everything on the hardest difficulty he can, so my definition of challenge is a bit different from most casual players. Aside from being somewhat more simplistic than I expected, however, there isn't much of anything you can call a fault in the combat. It's pretty looking, very smooth, and kind of mediocre, really.Plot? Look, let's be honest here, no one plays the original DMC games for the plot. That was one of the many mistakes they made with 2, in fact. That said, unlike the original games, which were trying harder to be entertaining that tell a really detailed story, this one has one. A rather large one that I'm not really a fan of. However, all matters of opinion aside for the most unbiased review, it's mostly another ""Eh"" from me. Despite usually being an obsessive gamer who watches every cutscene and searches for all the little details etc. I just wasn't that interested in the plot. It's there, yes. Is the writing horrible? No. Is it fatastic? No. Looking at it as a whole, I can't really say there is anything about it that ever goes above average. Some is below, most is right on the line, and none of it really gets very much further than that.Next we have DmC Dante. Gonna say it straight out. I think he sucks. I don't find him funny or entertaining in any way, shape or form. This is without comparing him to the old Dante at all. had I never played another DMC in my life, I would still get a headache almost every time he opens his mouth. I have laughed at literally none of his jokes, I have completely failed to care about any of his actions at every turn, and in general just been unamused by his existence. He is whiny, thinks he is so cool for being a punk, blah blah blah blah I don't even want to listen to him any more. It seems from where I'm standing that the writers just went with any uninspired bit of excessive vulgarity they could come up with to make him seem ""cool"" and then went to lunch. That isn't me being a prude. What with all the time I spend online I'd probably have an aneurysm by now if I was. However, all of the teenage-class stupid that spews forth from his every orofice has gotten mindbogglingly old, so unless you giggle at ""dirty words"" there isn't much there that could possibly be called humor. Once in a while, he makes some comment that gets my hopes up and I think ""Is this actually going to be witty and intelligent?"" and then he finishes what he was saying and it all comes crashing back down to dull. And do I even need to bring up the infamous ""**** YOU!"" ""NO, **** YOU!"" exchage? he is absolutely the worst part of the game, as far as I'm concerned, and it says a lot that my feelings about any game can be summed up with ""The main character is the worst thing about it.""Music... is really another matter of personal taste, I suppose. In my opinion, the main game's soundtrack sucks, but that's just because I hate most of that genre to begin with. That said, it suits the character just fine, so if that's what they were going for, great success! Considering that the Vergil's Downfall DLC switches to a totally different theme, it probably was what they intended. (That music is a little eh, too, though. It's there, it doesn't sound out of place, but it isn't stellar for the most part either. Maybe I haven't payed enough attention to it, but that it can't grab my attention does say quite a bit.)With all said and done, my final opinion on this game is mostly just ""Meh"". If I had never bought it, I would be perfectly content with my life. If I had bought it full price, I would probably regret it a bit. It runs well, plays decently, and I can't say I wasted the time I spent on it any more than it would have been wasted on another game, but I still find the combat lacking the challenge I looked for, and the new Dante spent a good portion of the game giving me a headache before I just ragequit to play Vergil's Downfall for a while instead. My statements that the combat lacks depth should still be taken with a grain of salt, as the combat will probably be perfectly acceptable to most casual players, but if you are looking for all sorts of tricky shenanigans like in certain other games in this genre, you probably won't find a ton of them here. The plot was uninteresting, at least to me, and way too full of dropping anvils (That's TvTropes speak, for those uninitiated in that specific internet timesink) for me to take it seriously, and as characters I find the new cast bland at best and generally annoying at worst. As far as I'm concerned, if it's on sale and you feel like it, sure, go ahead and get it, I suppose, but if I had a choice between this and DMC3 or 4, I'd leave this one sitting in my games library collecting digital dust, which I can say with complete certainty, because that would be what is happening this very instant, and will probably still be happening whenever you, whoever you are, come by this little corner of the web and read this particular post. However, since there is no button that says ""Meh"" and displays a shrugging stick figure, I guess I'll just say reccomended, with the imaginary caveat of ""When it's on sale"".			"

												First, let me just say that this is my first Devil May Cry game. That being said, I thought this game was GREAT.Story:I don't know much about the original story, but I definitely liked this ""modernized version"". It's not a very complicated story: Dante wants revenge on the demon who killed his mother (and who is pretty much controlling the world). But honestly, that's enough for me. I really liked the look of the game and how the world was portrayed - especially ""limbo"", the hidden ""demon world"" around us.Looking through the other reviews it seems like some people think that Dante is too ""cool"", and yes, he sure is confident and maybe a bit smug, but honestly, I liked him. Despited his ""flaws"" he seems like a good person, and he made me laugh several times throughout the game. And yes, he is cool.My favorite character was probably Kat, a human who helps you out on your missions. I really wish we could have gotten to know a bit more about her, but sadly we probably never will as a sequel doesn't seem to be coming any time soon.Vergil, Dante's brother... He is the smarter sibling, while Dante is the stronger one(?). I knew before starting the game that some things would happen between them, but I don't want to give away too many spoilers.Then there is Mundus, the demon god. Decent bad guy although I would have liked to know more about him as well. Especially regarding his relationship to Dante's father.Gameplay:I can't remember the last time I had this much fun fighting in a video game. The fighting feels fast, smooth and kick♥♥♥♥♥ All of the weapons are really strong in their own way, and while it is easy to get into the game it takes some practice to slash and bash through legions of mobs without getting a chainsaw in your back.Apparently this game is quite a bit easier than the previous Devil May Cry games, and I agree that putting a check point before every fight was a bit too much. It sometimes felt like, especially on the harder difficulties towards the end of the game, instead of starting a fight with 10% health you might as well just suicide and respawn with full health (at the cost of a lower score, of course). It doesn't really give you that ""I gotta try my best to survive!""-feeling. On the positive side, having check points before each fight means you can try to chain attacks and pull of amazing combos evey fight without worrying too much about screwing up.The only part of the game that I didn't really enjoy was when you have to run around helping people in the real world, since you aren't really able to fight while doing this. Luckily most of the game takes place in limbo, which is where the fun happens.Graphics:The game looks good to me. I really liked the style of the game, and although the game is fairly linear, the world around you changes all the time, making it feel like you are actually part of something more open and bigger. The first time you move around in limbo you will most likely have a blast.Music:The music in the game is heavy metal/heavy rock-ish(?) stuff, which is not really my type of music, but it sure makes you feel like a badass when you fight through hordes of enemies with that music playing in the background. It really suits the mood of the game, and the fights would feel way less epic without this great soundtrack.I also really liked the voices of the different characters. In my opinion, pretty much all the voices were spot on. The one liners from Dante were perfectly delivered, making even the bad jokes funny. Well done.Overall:Again, this was my first Devil May Cry game, and it seems like most of the negative reviews are from people who have played the previous games. For me, this was a great introduction to the series, and I'm definitely going to play the originals as well. If you want a really good fighting game with a decent story that looks and sounds great then look no further. This is the game for you.			"

												Finally went back and finished this after it had been in my backlog for a long time. DmC Devil May Cry, the remake done by Ninja Theory back in 2013 is a badass package. Screw the haters, this is without question the best Devil May Cry game ever. Great level design, creative and wicked intense boss battles, smooth and more user-friendly gameplay, good sense of humor, and an awesome story. The game also isn't as punishingly difficult as previous entries, making it easier to get in and enjoy the game without having to memorize a million combos and maneuvers to survive. My only real complaint is that the main game is pretty short (only 20 missions which can take anywhere from 2 to 15 minutes to complete) but there are plenty of unlockable bonus missions and difficulties. I hope Ninja Theory gets a second shot at the series, cause I had a blast from beginning to end with DmC.			"

												Took about 10 hours to complete the main story on the next to hardest difficulty. tried it out with both mouse & keyboard aswell as with an xbox controller. The controller was to be preferred but that is expected. However, the mouse and keyboard work surprisingly well for this game.   This is also one of the best ports I've ever played. I cranked everything as high as it could go and still ran at a solid 200fps+ which is more than you can say about most ports these days.   I've always been a fan of spectacle fighters and I enjoyed this one alot. It is one of the better ones in recent time for sure. However, some hardcore fans of the earlier DmC games might disagree. But if you're a PC guy like me and want a solid spectacle fighter - This is where its at.			"

												DmC manages a fantastic balancing act between accessibility and depth -- the first time through, weapons, moves, and enemies are introduced at a measured enough pace to make it possible to keep up with them, but there's still a massive scope for building your skills and racking up massive scores with SSS combos in battles that used to be a struggle just to survive, just by mastering the systems and weapons. Different weapons are swapped in instantaneously using the triggers as a modifier, and it results in a really wide toolbox of attacks that can be strung together in very satisfying ways.The combat is the real reason to play, but this is also a fantastic-looking game, particularly in terms of the imaginative environments, which make heavy use of ripped and distorted versions of real-world locations. And being on PC running 60 fps helps a lot too. The story and dialogue is a bit less successful -- it has enjoyable moments, but is on the heavy-handed side in terms of its satire.Despite going into this with no expectations or background in the series or genre, I liked it enough to play through the game and the DLC on four consecutive difficulty settings, going up to Dante Must Die, and would name it my Game of the Year for 2013. It also inspired me to seek out more in this genre, which I had mostly ignored previously. "

												This game is Okay, but really just that. The combat is fine, though a little boring, probably because of the lack of different combos, the weapons are okay, but a little generic (they have the exact same combos as your sword, one is just heavy and hits hard, and the other is fast and AoE), and you're forced to use certain weapons on certain enemies, but that's acceptable I guess. The thing that really turns me off about this game is the huge amount of platforming sections in a game that's supposed to be focused on combat, the jump doens't feel great, the airglide doens't feel great, and half the time there's a fixed camera angle that makes the platforming more tedious than fun. Overall this game is probably fine for someone who isn't farmilliar with the genre, and has some interest in it, but playing this game after playing Bayonetta, this feels like baby's first character action game.

												Well, first of all I play in Nephilim (hard mode) and the AI is so poor they wait you kill their friends to start come in the melee too, it makes fights sleepy and lacking of intensity since you almost don't have to escape, and well, if you die, who cares? You just start again with full life, indeed, it's cheaper to die than buy health, it's the first game rewarding death.Secondly, the plateforme system is so badly done it brings you years back in the past, especially after release of tomb raider 2013 that made plateforme goes smooth for once or regret former prince of persia. Décors are poor, the one of the nighclub level will ask you to play without sound and with sunglasses.Some items are useless like half of the weapons, and fact Dante became a half-angel/half-demon, well why not but charm was justly he was half demon only but this is not the problem. So far, the story could be interesting, taking in, but gameplay really makes regret former Devil May Cry 4 and the others, Dante's character is very well done, Vergil is a pleasure to see in another side but this game lack of greatness. We are fighting the demon king and we have to break in poor places like a nightclub, underground bases...It's sad they aimed for 12-15y old people cause despite some ideas are nice : demons controls medias and junks to sleep us but the boss are very easy to fight and you don't feel yourself like in a war against demons, just again a little mafia boss somewhere in the city ruling few clubs with a system of move that makes looks princes of persias like oversmooth games. They tried to make it in a fashion period where devils had to be hyped, modernized like the Castlevania 2 hard fail, but it just doesn't work or as a cover, until it brings you in a real big game with decorums, darkness and cynism.Ok, nowadays it looks cool to say some game is nice just because of the name especially helped trough bad games journalists, but this one is honnestly too much unfinished and badly done (one level decor is only colored cube you jump one, making looks like mgs ps1 training session for sober and well made) to be really granted as a good game despite some good ideas. I liked Tomb raider 2013 reboot but this one is really not a good thing.			"

												Fantastic!I hadn't ever played the original Devil May Cry games (but I did pick up 4 recently) but this was amazing!If you haven't played the games, you're in luck. From what I've now read, this doesn't follow the original story so it's a great place to pick up.In this game you play as Dante, a half demon, half angel creature who is battling a world completely controlled by a demonic ruler, Mundus. Your goal is to hack and slash your way to victory with the help from the small resistance (super small, actually... just two other people).The game is a spectacle fighter. All of your sword moves are massive and sweeping. It's just as much fun to watch since it all plays out as more of a flashy dance with swords than a brawler. By the end of the game Dante can seemlessly switch between eight weapons all in a single combo. You may start your attack with a dash to the toughest enemy, launching him into the air with your battle axe. Then spin around and throw some ninja stars at the weaker enemies to keep them off your back while jumping into the air and laying on more attacks with your angelic scythe before bringing it all home with your lava-covered boxing gloves.You also have the ability to turn your swords into grapplehooks (either pulling you towards enemies or enemies towards you). This makes for very fast traversal around the arenas and lets you keep the pressure on.The levels and areas in this game are incredible. I've never seen anything like it. Also though a lot of the story takes place in the ""real world"" the missions mostly play out in the parallel dimension, Limbo. Both worlds are tightly coupled and the giant monsters that destroy the Limbo world also cause chaos back in reality.All that to say, buy this. I played it with a gamepad and it was amazing.

Seeing how good the game actually is, left me shaking my head about the untruths written about it on the internet.There is even one review on Steam that writes ""This is a casual game"".

Also, a lack of powerful special-attacks proved to be rather disappointing. All you have to work with are combos and more variations of them, which can be boring after a while.Characters — 4/5Dante is, without a doubt, the strongest character of the cast: Well-written, relatable, and at times, even funny and authentic. Virgil closely follows as the aloof and distant brother who stays true to his motivation to rule the world. Kat (or however her name is written) is by far the weakest and least convincing character and needs some rewriting, or a complete reset, for an eventual sequel. While there are worse characters out there for similar games, she did not add to the overall story, or game, with her presence.Story — 3/5The story takes a different route to most Western games by embracing a confrontational approach regarding modern media, society and, a tiny bit, religion. Luckily, it avoids being too confrontational by making statements that could offend or annoy potential consumers. Edgy, snarky, and cynical, but always within what is widely acceptable.Enemies — 2/5The first boss of the game created appetite for more but the bitter truth was that he remained one of the few highlights in the entire game.

												I actually dislike most of the action (adventure) games like God Of War and Devil May Cry. They're usually all about the combat, which becomes a boring aspect for me a few hours into the game. And yes, they have great visuals most of the times, but visuals isn't a key aspect for me. Then again; they do help to pull the player into the game world. Anyway, DmC managed to surprise me because of it's environments, fluent combat and, maybe even more important for me; short campaign. You read correctly, a short campaign. It will take a player somewhere between 7,5-12 hours to fully complete one playthrough, which is a decent length and for me long enough to not become boring or overstay its welcome.The new Dante starts off as an annoying, run-of-the-mill character. But along the way I started caring for him. He grew more mature it seemed.Dante will start the game with some basic weaponry and will get new moves and weapons until late in the game, which keeps the combat fresh. Obviously, all weapons and moves can be upgraded. And there really are some amazing moves in there. Using a controller I was able to pull off some of the hardest combos. I'll admit, there was some button mashing involved, but most of the times I actually knew what I was doing.The environments steal the show though. Rarely have I seen environments this brilliant. The TV show (including boss fight) and nightclub levels are some of the best levels I've ever seen in a game. DmC uses a variety of bright colors, while still having a certain gothic feel to it. It's exceptional.You can tell they put some real love into the PC version since it will never dip below 60FPS. On Ultra settings things look (mostly) sharp and seeing the game in motion is a real treat, especially during the acrobatic (non-)combat sequences. The voice acting is top notch, but, unfortunately, the story is a bit on the light side.Time to wrap things up: I had a great time with this game and I would gladly recommend it to all serious gamers out there.[Rating: 80/100]			"

Summary I like this game but it could have been so much better as a child of the DMC franchise.My RantThis game would have been much better served by being a stand alone title rather than attaching itself to the DMC franchise.The game itself is great in most areas, I hated the colour coded enemies, they really brought the combat to a halt.The stylish ratings felt too easy to obtain aswell (this is due to my experience with the previous titles).I loved the new ways of getting around and the angel/demon crossover theme, however the angels were somewhat unexplained as new additions to the franchise.Overall, this game was ruined for me by being devil may cry (and by having a total tosser for a protaganist). I would have been perfectly happy to play it it again if I wasn't constantly getting the nostalgia knife to the face.			"

												I watched my friend playing this game when Dante was in limbo, and I thought ""the color is too bright, I don't like this game"".Some limbo stages has bright red colors that makes me said that. Most aren't though.But after I got this game by Humble Capcom Bundle, I decided to try this game.Turns out the game is pretty fun to play. Unlike DMC 3 (I haven't played DMC 4), this game has Angel & Demon weapon which make it easier to reach far enemies resulting longer combos.This game surprisingly has good storytelling. It tells much about Dante's story and his brother, Vergil. Again, I compared it with DMC 3 which lacks story and just focuses on battles and actions.Enjoyed the game, but I don't bother to get all the achievements.Too many achievements and seems they need 2-3 times longer than time needed to just finish the game.The game runs perfectly with my xbox controller. I personally feel it's easier playing with controller than playing with keyboard.Definitely worth it, especially when it is on sale at Humble Bundle.			"

												I had mixed feelings when I bought this game. I saw many reviews saying how bad it was yet I saw some saying it was good. I would like to say that DmC: Devil May Cry is my favourite game of 2013 and in my top 3 games of all time. The graphics instantly hit you when you load with their many colours and what seems to be some of the most realistic graphics I've seen in a video game. The combat system is very easy to use, besides a few late registrations. The new and improved Dante is a blend of ""Super-model pornstar"" and ""Popular comedian"" with a slight hint of mystery to him. The variety of enemies to kill and weapons to kill them with is even better with the huge number of combo moves that you can unlock. The collectables are easy to find and a challenge to get to, yet very satisfying when you get them. The secret side challenges are amazing, ranging from easy to hellishly hard.Pros:- Dante has been highly improved- Funny and subtle hints to previous games get you ammused instantly- Easy controls- High number of enemies and weapons- Large number of combo moves to unlock- Side challenges to do when you want a rest- Amazing stroyline- Jaw dropping graphicsCons:- Some minor glitchesIf you have some spare cash lying around, I would highly recommend this. You will not be disappointed.Overall, I would give this game a well earned 10/10!			"

												Took about 5-6 missions before I got the combat, but I ended up finishing it.  I like the face animation stuff Ninja Theory does, fun levels, entire soundtrack by Combichrist so it fits the rediculous motif, stupid-fun story, and only a few annoying boss fights.  8/10 SSSADISTIC!!!			"

YouTube™ Video: DMC: Devil May Cry Review 

			Views: 321		

			We take a look at the newest entry in the franchise that gave birth to the Extreme Combat subgenre. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

DMC Devil May Cry has certainly been the victim to a bunch of hate, some of it warranted, but most of it just nitpicky and unnecessary. If you go into this game with an open mind and are aware that is a reboot and a reimagining of the tale of Dante then you will be more than able to thoroughly enjoy yourself, However if you go into it expecting Devil May Cry 5 then you will be sadly disappointed.The game still focuses on the stringing together fast paced, brutal combos in an action-oriented combat that system that were so prominent in the previous entries. And the game still offers the style ranking system based on how well you perform in combat. But while the game still focuses heavily on the two key components that made the franchise famous…It does make them incredibly more “accessible” to players who have never played any of the previous entries, which wouldn’t be a bad thing seeing as the game offers seven different difficulty levels, However only three are unlocked from the start of the game and all three are simple enough where you can easily breeze through and get “Savage” or better on most levels. So unless you truly want to get some form of challenge from the game you’ll have to do a few play-throughs of the game before you really find yourself struggling to chain together a good enough combo to actually feel proud of yourself when you hear the omnipresent announcer proclaim “Savage!”. The oversimplification isn’t all bad, the game does offer incredibly streamlined controls that allow for lengthy combos to be chained together while swapping through all 8 weapons and both grappling hooks on the fly without any obstructive interface or item swapping. The natural feel provided from the streamlined controls is easily one of the game’s greatest features.Besides the dumbed down difficulty and scoring system the game is also hindered by its generic level and enemy design. None of the design in the game feels new or fresh; it’s just a bunch of dark, glum, narrow corridors with hordes of the same bland enemies with some fairly enjoyable platforming elements sprinkled in between. Not only are the designs of both the enemies and levels bland, but the main characters themselves are also both predictable, and flat. This isn’t the bias hate rambling of a fan-boy who’s♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥they changed Dante’s hair color, I’m honestly fine with the appearance of all the characters, even the new Emo Dante, but the game does offer plenty of alternative skins for those who are too turned off by the emo vibe.The visuals of the game are another one of the games strong points, offering easily some of the best visual graphics to come out of a Capcom game to date. And the game is certainly a solid PC port, during my playthroughs of the game I managed to stay well over 100fps without any dips that could potentially interfere with the fast paced combo chaining combat.  The soundtrack of the game is honestly a hit or miss based on your view of how you feel about Electronic Body Music, as the soundtrack consists primarily of the band Combichrist, I personally enjoy it however to each their own.After hearing the review thus far you would probably expect me to poorly rate the game, but its actually quite the opposite. Despite all of the complaints and flaws that this game has, it somehow manages to get passed all of that and provide an experience that is genuinely fun. If you look at the game you can easily pick apart the design flaws and nerfed difficulty, but even with all the flaws, DMC Devil May Cry proves to be an excellent game with strong enough legs to stand on its own and not be judged based on the previous entries in the franchise….because that’s the whole point of a reboot, to break away from the past and become something new. So don’t let the look of the game turn you off, pick up a controller and play through the game on the hardest difficulty you can and experience the beauty of the fast paced, stylish, streamlined, chaotic fun that you will have.http://noobsthatplaygames.com/ "

												While I am choosing to not recommend this game, I'd rather this review be seen as a ""Meh"" or ""Average."" DmC hits many things really well, and then falls flat on its face in others. I would like to preface by saying that I haven't played the original DMC games, but I have played Hideki Kamiya's Bayonetta, so my comparison will be based a bit around that.By now, it should be well known that this reboot's Dante is a black haired, foul mouthed early twenty-or-something troublemaker. While a big problem is how he compares to the original Dante, for this review I'll mostly be looking at the reboot as its own series separate from Kamiya's. So how does this Dante hold up as his own character? He's not necessarily a bad character. He displays growth, and becomes less bull headed and more concerned for others such as Kat. Some of his lines and actions are actually really good too, with his attitude being a perfect contrast for some of the serious guys there such as Vergil (in one particular scene, he answers Vergil with a shrug and ""So what?"" when Vergil brings up the idea of freeing the citizens). Dante exemplifies the punk movement, which is what he (and to an extent the society around him) was based off of, and I think he does a good job with it. That isn't to say he's the best character ever written, but he was the best in this game, as all the other character become really boring and flat to follow. Vergil is written awkwardly, with a shallow emotional spectrum to accompany him; essentially, he is our exposition machine. Kat is so flat I don't even know what she was doing in there. She does something action wise, but personality wise I can barely remember what her personality was after finishing the game 10 minutes ago - it's that bad. Mundus and his minions are all stereotypical demonic villains, looking to rule the world. Nothing about the writing sticks out, and many attempts at banter or funny one liners fail and just sound awkward. The voice acting for Dante is the best most of the time, but there are still a few parts when his voice actor seems to be new and they didn't go for a second take.The game does shine when it comes to its art direction, its music, and its combat system. The art, with the contrasts for Limbo and the original city, are great to see, and the music was cool to listen to as I'm slashing away at demons. One thing to note is that, if you don't like punk, or growling vocals, then this soundtrack will not be for you. The combat itself is apparently dumbed down, from what I hear, but it's not a bad thing for new players. I personally don't play much hack-n-slash so this was a good thing for me, I think, but I can see some veterans becoming bored (in which case I recommend playing the hardest difficulties). When I played I never got anything below an A, on medium, so maybe this can indicate how difficult the game is. It was still very satisfying combat, especially when it came to the harder to kill enemies, and getting those combos were awesome. However, I did find that there seemed to be a delay between inputting button commands, as many times I went to strike and wanted to dodge an incoming enemy attack, but I had to wait at least half a second to a second for my input to actually register as dodge. This can be annoying and especially frustrating on harder enemies. Furthermore, this game has a lot of platforming, more than I expected, which can be annoying at times; it also has a lot of cutscenes, sometimes with only a tiny element of gameplay (moving Dante to the next point) involved, which can be annoying as well if you want to get straight into the action. There's also no lock-on button, which can be absolutely bothersome combined with a frozen camera (see below).Some minor gripes: I played on a controller, and often times the camera would lock up and prevent me from spinning it, resulting in me getting hit by enemies. I'm not sure if playing with a KB+M is better, but I heard it is decent. Also, in comparing to the original DMC games, I wish this Dante would flourish his weapons each time he got them, but alas, Ninja Theory did not do that.Overall, DmC is certainly not a bad game gameplay and art wise, but the story is horrid. I recommend purchasing it on sale, and only if you're interested in the combat. If you like story based games, this one is not written well and will possibly disappoint you.			"

												If you liked the original Devil May Cry series, prepare to be disappointed.Rubbish combat system:1) Hold left trigger or right trigger to use either weapon, just remember to let go of them when you wanna use your UNDERPOWERED ebony and ivory2) No lock on, making combat even more sloppy and more about button tap rhythms3) Specific weapons for specific enemies, have fun using the right and left trigger!4) Despite all the flaws with the combat, you will rack up a high stylish rank with ease!Terrible story/characters:1) Dante is a brooding arrogant teen, not a slightly camp and charmingly arrogant badass.2) Story is REALLY cliché, Dante is now a half angel, half demon (snore)3) THE CORPORATIONS, DEMONS, HURRRR4) Characters take themselves seriously like in every sub-par disaster film from hollywoodDon't buy this game if you have a fondness of the Devil May Cry series, I beg you. If you were born at the end of the nineties or later, you may like this game as you have probably been critical of games for far less time than my cynical self.			"

												I always liked Devil May Cry games. My play time in DMC4 says it. I have DMC2 on PS2 that I completed on all difficulties as both Dante and Lucia. I didn't play DMC3 because it is buggy and almost impossible to setup. This DMC is a total disappointment for me. - I want to start with color-coded enemies: You know ""use blue weapons to kill blue enemies and use red weapons to kill red enemies!"" Not only this limits your options at weapons you can use against certain types of enemies, but it also ruins your variety of combos which Devil May Cry is all about. This is the problem which will persist you through the entire game.- I don't know who of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Ninja Theory or Capcom thought that it would be a good idea to levitate all enemies in the air while going into Devil Trigger mode, either way it's stupid and annoying.- Dante's appearance change.- Lots of references to the past Devil May Cry games.And I am only half way through the game.

												So that's it, fanbase, you almost got me!, really!, your ridiculous butthurts about a reboot almost got my ears and i ALMOST discarded this AWESOME (i'll say it again, AWESOME) game.Talking seriously here, guys, what the heck are you in to blame an entire work for a character? i have to agree, Donte (yes, i refer the new Dante as Donte) , can't be compared with the old Dante, who needs no dirty words, no sexual content or neither pathetic look to earn a legion of fans , but for reals, he ISNT,THAT,BAD, okay? give him a chance, like me, and you'll see the Donte's new look (pfft, really, talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about a game because they re-designed a character...) and personality CHANGES trough the game, im not here to say ""hur dur, the DmC is way better than original, hur dur"" because it isn't, but its an superb job and has everything that characterizes the DmC's gameplay, the combos, the weapons, the upgrades, the hidden things,  the orbs is here! only little things have changed and for better.The Plot of the game is really amazing, full of Critics to our society (the Virility Drink, the Demons who represents men of extreme influence and power),and its everything well planned , the only thing i have to say here is that Kat can be more explored and developed, though, the Nephalem legend-based story for the Twins really fits the characters (thats MY opinion, i dont care if you agree or not, but if you wont, feel free to talk about it)Graphics , Soundtrack, Dialogues and jokes are really good and add a good temper to the game, everything is beautiful and well designed, the levels of the game have a stunning view, the music is awesome and fits in to the hack'n'slash gameplay, everything here is fine.The game is incredible, but has its issues, the camera is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes it didn't respond to my right analogic stick and didnt turn left or right, i need to wait a little to turn it,so , i fell often because of this in plataform mini games,  the lack of lock in is a great problem that made me miss almost every long combo i try to did, and i found the game too easy (playing on the Nephalem dificulty) if was compared to the old ones.Yes, i recommend this incredible game, who needs no dante to be good, if you want to be mad at something, talk about the stinky port of the Devil May Cry 3 for the PC, THIS is a thing to be upset with good reasons,  9/10			"

												A game with much controversy surrounding its release due to both the stylistic change and the developer's confrontational and punk-like attitude.The result, while not being the pinnacle of hack and slash/spectacle fighters that one of its predecessors was (DMC3), still comes off as very enjoyable and even addictive at times. Starting with the bad, the fighitng system has been simplified from past releases. Gone are the variety of styles and in their place two new types of weapons are available by holding down each of the triggers. Each weapon type has in turn two sub weapons that behave differently.This doesn't mean that this is a Fisher-Price, nursing school fighter. The game still requires skillful and deliberate actions in order to be able to deliver a standing ovation worthy, class A demon spanking. It's just that, in what i guess was, an attempt to trim some of the franchise's fat the devs cut off some of the meat as well and this in turn hurt both the gameplay factor and the overall longevity of the title.Another drawback is that there is no visual indicator for the targeting system so focusing on different opponents and prioritizing your targets feels more clunky. Finally the point system feels off as it awards more points the more enemies you hit in one blow or the more hits you deliver in a short ammount of time rather than handsomely rewarding precise actions like countering hits.  This in turn makes combat feel more spammy and offense-based rather than the ""taunting"", bursty type of combat in previous DMCs.From the above you'd guess that i don't like DmC? Well you couldn't be more wrong.First of all the level design in this and level variety in particular is one of the best of the series so far, with levels like Lilith's Club, and the News Network stealing the show.I really liked the punk/pop/street culture based style of the visuals as well. The fighting while simplified as mentioned above is still very satisfying and fun to play and the angel/demon based mechanics, aside from a cool nod to Dante's duality as a character, are well implemented allowing you to pull off every move imaginable on the fly.Opting for including platforming rather than puzzles that slow down the pacing was a solid decision on the dev's part imo. It just keeps the game flowing better.The game's story bears strong similarities to J.Carpenter's ""They Live"". Personally i found it enjoyable yet nothing groundbreaking given that it's a concept that i was already familiar with through said film.Character performances are solid as well with Mundus's standing out for me.The only sour note in that department was that Dante's one liners come off as forced and ""wooden"" at times.I also liked the soundtrack as well but i realize that given the niche of the genre (Electro/Industrial) it won't be for everybody.On the technical side of things QLOC have done a terrific job making this game look spectacular while mainting very high fps and motion fluidity on max settings, resulting in this being one of the best uses of UE3 to date imo. Overall, a very fun to play H&S title, excellent for newcomers to the genre as well as those that want to rekindle their interest in spectacle fighters.Recommended. "

												Firsrt off this is not a spoiler alert for those looking to buy this game for the first time. The first act you will see Dante at the naked pizza scene in this game while flying through the air and having a baseball bat cover his nutsacks. Just makes Dante come off as a complete slob. Putting on whatever clothes were in his path and NO SOCKS with shoes. Nasty. Would have been much more appealing if it was the chick in the air doing the scene. Guess your life is over so PLEASE TAKE NOTE:  If you're unlucky enough to have someone walk in while watching that scene YOUR LIFE IS OVER.. Not so appealing in the slightest. ""  P.S DO NOT TRY TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF! Your sexuality will be questioned. Last but not least I recommend this game.			"

												I played the DMC´s before, I´m playing this one. In my opinion this game is really, really good. The new Dante is pretty cool, the possibilites of combinations are awesome and the game has a good difficulty if you play VMD, DMD/ Hell and hell. If you like playing hack´n slays with style, awesomeness and lots of badass enemies I highly suggest you to get this DMC. Many people say this game isn´t ""DMC"" it´s a reboot BUT if you liked DMC before you will like this sequel too. - Bossfights are pretty cool- Some enemies are really annoying (this dumb rats, if you playthrough on Son of Sparda or higher, you will see what I mean)- 60 hours ++++ playtime if you try to get all achievements (depends on your skill, knowledge about the DMC mechanics, and so on)- Pretty cool Dante (My opinion)This game is just underrated! JUST GET IT NOW! And yes, if you like DMC you shoulda get the DLC. It has only 6 missions but Vergil´s Downfall is pretty cool to play.-- Get it -- !/Edit: Got all achievements now. 51 hours needed.			"

												Without touching on the stupid story, cause this isn't the focus:- The combat is weak as hell. At first glance it seems alright and similar enough to classic DMC, but enemies are incredibly easy to juggle forever - playing this game on Son of Sparda difficulty (the one right before Dante Must Die) is equivalent to playing DMC3 on normal. The game tries to create challenge by putting in enemies that can only be hit by one type of weapon (a very annoying mechanic that goes against the basic concept of the game) or facing you up against really annoying enemies that take way too much effort to open up for attacks at all (do the chainsaw guys seriously need to enter a Hyperarmor state every 5 seconds??). Even DMC3 had its enemy design pitfalls but DmC really becomes just annoying- Why is the game so easy?? The encounter design is mostly a joke, the bosses are all gimmicks with nothing interesting to them. DMC3 had a lot of crummy bosses, DMC4 fell short on making them interesting beyond the devilbringer interactions - they're both vastly superior to what this game got. The final boss is a retread of DMC3s final boss except its incredibly pathetic in comparison. Good summary for the game in general- Instead of any sort of interesting level design all this game has is dumb artsy concepts interspersed with copy pasted hallways and floating platforms to spend another hour platforming on. Instead of exploring an ancient demon structure like in 3 you now get to grapple onto blue ""press button"" prompts while impact fonts get shoved in your face and the game tries to make you go Wow!!! via some or other stupid manner of bombast that just makes the whole fighting arena look like♥♥♥♥♥♥(the disco is especially unreadable and offensive to the eyes)- Constantly breaks up the flow of the game by making you platform. Why so much platforming. What the ♥♥♥♥. Also constantly shoves cutscenes in your face, why is there a shot of dantes eyes every time some demons spawn. DMC usually was nice enough to reserve cutscenes for the start and end of missions, and bossfights.- For how the game trys to be a reboot they doubledown on the devilbringer, except making it far less interesting and forcing you to use it constantly in pointless sequences that are neither challenging nor fun. Using the subweapons and the special property dodges is an annoyance cause you seemingly cant set it to be a toggle, so I hope you like holding down the trigger buttons all gameIt's bad and nothing but dangling keys in front of people who have no clue about the genre (all the visual clutter and the stupidly easy braindead gameplay makes it a normie favorite) and Ninja Theory is a bad developer and I hope they go bankrupt			"

												A good game for the non DMC series fanatic (And if you are then you are probably off cursing Ninja Theory and Capcom somewhere on a message board in japan). Most of the negativity for this game comes from previous DmC fans who absolutely refuse change. I have personally been playing Dmc since the original (have a copy in my desk right next to me :cwat:) The only one I haven't played is 2. That being said yeah, It's different, but it is truly an enoyable hack n' slash action game.Pros:-Surprisingly decent storyline, Not Squeenix quality... But good enough.-Combat: Good 8/10, It has a wider range of weapons that can be used creatively and fit better to a play style resulting in enjoyable combat. I have my complaints some of them being that the devil trigger is now a next to useless feature and the guns are even less effective as combat tools as they were... be that as it may, the melee combat is superb.-Gameplay: 7/10 Above average, The smooth gameplay is ridged with average linear level design giving you deja vu 20 times before the end of the mission, and the difficulty is definitely easier (I remember the days when you had to work to get the double jump ability), but overall the gameplay is nice and the interaction and dynamics of the levels make it a positive experience.-Art: 8.75/10 Goodish Great, Grafitti is not really my style, however the art was fantastically done. Much brighter than past games and much more colorful. While some people like the pure gothic artistry of old, I prefer not to stare at grey walls for an entire 31 hr story based game. In game graphics are good quality.Cons-Character Development: Let's just say this dante, while at times can have good character enlightenment, is mostly a 15 year old kid who just filled out his profanity lexicon. The ""bad boy"" theme is way too overdone to the point that it is a pile of swearing and rude gestures on top of an ego obssessed frat boy. I found myself more interested in the development of the side/main character Kat. I'm not going to start on Virgil because spoilers however potential was lost.Middle Ground:-Music: While not my choice, there was still some death metal battle themes and that's all I expected.tl;dr It's a good game, pick it up on a sale for some good old fashion hack n' slash fun			"

												This game was my first Devil May Cry ever. I know that some people prefer the old ones but I really do not care, because this game gave me everything I wanted to get: non-stop action, badass fights, and an epic story.If all of this is not enough, this PC version is very well optimized, I can run everything at max., with my laptop that is far from being the most powerful machine on this planet.The game also gives you some real challenges and includes unlockable outfits and hidden missions. Also, I did not have any bug.Conclusion: buy it right now!			"

												Too many people hates this game because of the new Dante but this is a reboot they had to change something. Whatever, this game is amazing. I really enjoyed while playing. I beat it like 30 times, maybe more and I never got bored. Completed to 100% (unlocked all concept arts, got all achievements) in 77 hours. Boss battles, combo moves, graphics, story, everything is great in this game. So don't hate it just because of the character, give it a try. Trust me, you'll love it! Only thing that I don't like in this game you can't evade some enemy attacks because you can't cancel every attack.			"

												I think this game gets many bad reviews from the DMC community because of the 'New Dante.' I have not played the older games, but I have watched DMC3 and the anime. I understand where they are coming from...BUT this is a GAME review, not a Dante review!I don't use any controller plugin, so combat was somewhat funky getting used to. After remapping the Angel and Demon weapons to my mouse, my experience was definitely changed for the better.Combat felt rewarding, and it would get to the point I wish I could fight enemies endlessly (Bloody Palace DLC).The story was good, but the dialogue could have used a bit of a touch-up. There were many scenes I was left thinking         ""Well OK then!""But viewing this game as a separate universe from the originals, I thought it fit well to the characters.There are several difficulties to replay the story on, and a slew of upgrades to purchase for Dante's Weapons.For those butthurt about the new Dante, it's time to move on.8/10			"

Where I like Kat's character, they seemed to try to hard to make Dante a badass, but made him come off as just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Plus Virgil's beloved character took a major downgrade.Despite the bad hero characters, I say this game is pretty good, forcing you to use different weapons to complete puzzles and beat enemies.			"

												I am new to the DmC franchise, so I don't have an opinion on this game as a sequel.  But viewing it as a standalone game and without specific expectations, I'm finding it a joy to play.  I'm not the biggest fan of the popular genre of action games with pretty graphics, but this one really stands out.  The combat, though fairly categorized as ""hack-and-slash,"" is very satisfying.  The responsiveness of the controls and the fluid feel of the combos make for a visceral experience that is more enjoyable than with any other action game I've played. Added to that gameplay element is the artfulness of the story and graphic design.  I was skeptical on this front when I bought the game since I'm not really into Goth or anything like that.  But the artistry on display here just won me over.  You really have to play the game to understand what I mean on this subject.  The cutscenes, the sound, the art style--everything in this game comes together in a way that makes it more than the sum of its parts.  Kudos to Capcom.			"

Posted: September 30, 2015
												I'm gonna start by stating my ""controversial"" opinion on the franchise; I have played and hated every moment of the first Devil May Cry and played tidbits of the others. If you go through my reviews you'll notice a pattern with Capcom games. I hate them. For various reasons I hate them. It's mostly their terrible attempt at Americanizing their games (I always loved Onimusha 2 becuase it's Japanese and feels like it. It doesn't feel like it's forcing itself to be Japanese). The original Dante was less likeable than this guy, mostly because he didn't have a personality to like. While the new Dante doesn't start off too likeable and if you go by just his appearance (which I imagine most of the Devil May Cry-babies have done) he does come off as a bit of an arrogant prick. In fact that doesn't really change but as the game goes on you get to see his human side as well as the devilish side, I didn't think I'd say this when I started it but he is a great character. His brotherly interactions with Vergil are amusing and I imagine quite familiar for anyone with a brother.The story itself isn't earth-shatteringly amazing but it is good and more importantly it's well done. The graphics are nice, especially if you can handle Ultra which you should be able to do, my pc is currently a hunk o' junk and can pretty much run it. The whole Limbo thing is pretty awesome and the level design in general is good. Certainly better than the previous Capcom titles as it features no backtracking whatsoever which I hate with a burning passion. At no point did I get bored of this game. The story mode took me about 14 hours and anyone who thinks that's too short can fornicate themselves with an iron stick, especially if the game has good replay value. There's a New Game+ mode so you can go back and get some of the secrets you couldn't the first time round (I think you can do this at this at any point just be redoing a level after you've aquired the right stuff) with you're fancy new gear and give yourself a bit more of a challenge at the same time. Some people argue that they've ""dumbed down the combat"" but the way I see they've simplified it to make it more intuitive and fluid and the bosses are much less of a grind/colossal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥that take all the fun out of life. The soundtrack is just awesome, Combichrist and NOISIA (Vision backwards/upside down, you can thank me later) make the action sequences feel so much more electric and even the tense or mellow parts. It's just the perfect soundtrack to this kind of game, although that's probably debatable but then what isn't? All in all this is a good hack'n'slash with good acting, a decent story and character develpoment, an awesome soundtrack and good gameplay. Don't listen to the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off fans, they just hate because Dante. I sincerely hope this game gets a sequel.			"

												about 7 hours to beat. I played it on the normal mode(it was not that challenging, may want to consider hard mode if you want a serious challenge). It is an action game. There was a bit of platforming but nothing terrible. The fighting is very entertaining because you are always switching weapons to keep your combo grade rising. The story was good. It had a few laughs in it. Certain enemies were weak to certain moves from specific weapons which was very neat. It had puzzle elements on many of the bosses and used floating text like in splinter cell conviction to send messages your way. The music was just there, not memorable but not bad. Whenever you filled your combo grade to S/SS/SSS an announcer chimed and voiced the grade out(It was a very good effect). The game was really solid. Did I mention the fighting was fun?9/10 HIGH RECOMMENDED			"

												This was my first entry into the Devil May Cry series and I have been thoroughly impressed. The story is interesting, but not overly original. The graphics are great and the style is unique. However as the game progresses there is not a ton of variety in environments.The gameplay is truly outstanding and what makes this game shine. I played with a controller and the ability to smoothly chain combos together was great fun. Rarely do I replay a single player story, but I've started working through the story again just because the gameplay is so much fun. I can't compare it to the others in this series, but this game is just plain fun. If you enjoy melee third person action games you need to get this game.

												:::::Intro:::::Devil may Cry DMC is a reboot that explains things in a single package instead of having to play several games to understand the DMC universe. The first thing to note is the big change of  him being half angel and half demon instead of just half demon/human. I actually liked this change as it adds more depth to the parents he had and how in a sense they betrayed heaven/hell to be together. :::::Gamplay:::::	The gameplay is fluid like usual but veterans will find the combos easier to pull off and less challenging overall. New players will find this game quite hard if they are unfamiliar with the DMC universe and have not racked up enough experience with games like this genre. Mostly though I doubt people new to this series will find new dante discouraging in any way or the combat “easy” for that matter, in fact they will find it more enjoyable seeing as how its just as visually appealing as the rest of the DMC games just not as hard to pull off.:::::Level Design:::::	The level design I don’t see talked about much even when they were recommending this game and I don’t understand why. The level design is pretty great and its not really the details that sell it but rather the variety in animations and movement you see in the environments as you progress through the game. Though notably towards the end this feels less and less true but it was still solid. Note that there is indeed platforming in this game. :::::Platforming:::::	The platforming is pretty much done right seeing as you use the grapple hooks and wings to navigate throughout the levels. The platforming doesn’t get complex it rather paces itself as you gain powers and is used for boss fights also which is very welcome. Since you know I do not like demon vomit melting me.:::::Conclusion:::::The major two positives in this game is the gameplay and level design which for most people is enough to justify buying the game even if its on sale because we are off-put about the new story and characters.

												DmC Devil May Cry is a reboot to the popular video game series by CapcomThe Reboot was developed by Ninja Theory and they did do a good job, unless you ask the fan boys, which have their heads so far stuck up their arses, they don't realize it's actually a nice change. If This Dante was older maybe it would be a valid opinion.Gameplay wise it's fast paced hack and slash action full of combos and ""♥♥♥♥ing demons"" to bash your way through the simple Story.(but better then the other DMC stories) Graphics The game looks good for what it is. I like how the game actualy runs well on high settings on my terrible laptop.The Story is re written more human society version of the first game with Mundus being the Antagonist again but this time he acts as a ""Human"" ruler who rules the world in debt.I don't like in the credits though how much Ninja Theory promotes themselves they even put themselves above capcom, which isn't right since the game is owned by capcom and all.t;'dr Dont put a stuck up fanboy and play it for what it is. its fun, the character is actually not bad at all.

												I've always been a fan of the Devil May Cry Series. As this game is now on sale, I thought it's a good time to write a quick review.Dante might initially get a pretty strong reaction from some fans, he's no longer a cocky badass, instead he's something of a lowlife rebel. That will sting on occasion, because the cocky badass persona had been built up over several iterations and had gained some pretty good (if cheesy) characterisation in Devil May Cry 3.But given that this is the game after Devil May Cry 4, it's a vast improvement in almost every way. The story is ok (in that the character development is there and the plot is solid) but never shines, or at least not in the way the gameplay does. Fighting is smoother than ever, switching between weapons feels seemless, and no one weapon is ever distinctly bad for a given situation (the game may sometimes force you to fight opponents immune to certain weapons but is otherwise happy to let your style dictate how you fight)I think the best game to compare it to is Devil May Cry 3. Both have Dante at the start of his story, both have him meeting with Vergil, his brother but they both take it in different directions. The gameplay is better in DmC, the story better in Devil May Cry 3, but both still have the cheesy dialogue and incredible action sequences.In short, if you loved the old games, you should love this one just as much. If you loved the old Dante however, it might take a while to adapt.			"

												I don't get why so many DmC fans hate this game, it seems to be mostly because it's not exactly like other games in the series, while this is a western take on the franchise, and therefore does not represent the original games. The plot and character development could have been played out better, but it's a hack and slash game, everyone is going to care much more about beating the hell out of enemies than worry about the story. I've heard complaints about it being too easy compared to the other games too, while once again it's a western version and 9/10 times a western release of a game is much easier than a japanese release, so I don't think you can really complain much about that.Overall I rather enjoyed the game and would definitely recommend it to my friends.

												Now that I've had time to play it away from the anger of not having silver hair I have come to a real conclusion on this game. It's an 'eh'. Hidden behind beautiful environments and a fine premise is a combat system which in any game would be 'fine'. Here the approach to fighting is entirely dictated by the game and not the player. Enemy has a shield? You pretty much have to use your grabber to take it off them. Enemy is a specific colour? Well I hope you like the maximum two weapons that will hurt them then, because otherwise you're ♥♥♥♥ed laddy. Also the dodge mechanic. Now in DMC4 there was a similar skill which allowed for perfect last minute dodging and that worked fine because it could cut through your combos and allow you to escape. Here if you've fired up one of your slow attacks (all your red weapons) and you see something about to hit you, there's nothing you can do about it. You're stuck swinging this big ♥♥♥♥ off axe. This may not be such a problem if the game wasn't limited to 30fps where every frame counts and you've got to hit the right one to get away. In previous DMC games we had choice. We could string together any combination of moves, weapons and style to get what we wanted. They weren't always successful against everything but then we learnt to adapt. Here you are given no such freedom. You do exactly what the game wants and if you don't you get♥♥♥♥♥♥on. Bosses have huge glowing weak spots to wail on, overly telegraphed attacks and the platforming sections weren't fun when DMC3 did it. There is no quick thinking to be done, because if you're not thinking at the game's speed then you'll just end up frustrated. I want to enjoy it, I really do. But I can't stand more than a (incredibly short) mission at a time.			"

												This game is my favourite in the series. It gets a lot of hate for reimagining a series so beloved by so many- but I am willing to bet none of those people have actually *played* this game. The system is exactly the same system we know and love- hack and slash, style combos, and a bunch of different weapons to test out on enemies.  Not to mention an amazing soundtrack.And Dante? Dante is the exact same cocky jackass we know and love. In fact, even more so. He dives fully into the lifestyle of debauchery that was always hinted at in previous games, and yet, never fully shown. No such qualms here- his life is presented in startling detail. His character, of course, develops to have better morals by the end of the game...while keeping that cocky, snarky outlook on life we all know and love.However, the story is really what shines, in my opinion. It is an antiestablishment story- a world controlled by demons, using mass-produced products and news. Sound familiar? In my mind, it's an artistic social commentary. The entire game is done up in this fantastic artsy grunge style. TLDR: Buy this game. Especially if you're an unbeliever. It is fantastic.Story: 9/10Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Soundtrack: 10/10			"

												I don't recommend this DMC to people that played and loved the DMC series before this one, the characters are just awful, I was having a hard time hearing Dante talking like that while playing, not only they changed his appearance but they also changed his personality to something absolutely horrible and he is not the only one that changed either, the story could have been better if the characters didn't keep swearing at each other, and really that part where Vergil says ""And I have a bigger d***"" was that part really necessary? Now I do actually recommend this game for the gameplay, it feels fun and it seems to be more simple than the other DMCs, not in a bad way, I don't care much if it's harder to make combos or not just as long as the game is fun, and yes this one it is. I also liked the story, but like I said before, swearing like kids just destroys the personality of the characters in my opinion, Dante was just being a jerk and immature, and you don't really have to play the other DMCs to see that. If you just don't care about any of this then you are good to go, feel free to buy this if you are only looking to have fun, make some badass combos, destroy everything, do you want your character to swear to every single boss he encounters? This game is for you, if not, buy Dmc4:SE instead, much better in my opinion.			"

												I have to feel sorry for the poor souls who are in the room when the lead designer in a long running franchise utters that dreaded word; reboot. Whenever a well-loved series is started up again from scratch there seems to be an inevitable backlash from long term fans who hate the new direction, the design, the characters or whatever. DmC has taken this to a whole new level though, and I can’t say I’ve ever seen so much outrage directed at a game’s reimagining. The widespread verdict among long-time Devil May Cry fans has been incredibly negative. It’s not a Devil May Cry game. Exterminatus. Kill it with fire.Screw those guys; DmC is a damn good game. It’s not perfect by any means, but it’s damn good.If your sole connection to the previous games was Dante, you’re going to be disappointed. I like to think that there was more to them than a bloke in a red trench-coat though, no matter how cool or hot he was. DmC, like its predecessors, is committed to having superb gameplay, solid and thoroughly enjoyable combat as well as fitting in as much sheer absurdity as possible. Sure, Dante is a bit of a flat character. He’s arrogant, poorly written and seems to confuse wit for using as many f-words as possible. He also kicks monstrous amounts of♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it’s a hell of a lot of fun when he does just that.In our rebooted universe, humanity is being controlled by the subtle forces of the demon king Mundus. This take of 21st century western culture has us enslaved by our consumer culture, ignorance and greed, represented by not-coca cola, some big bank and what is most definitely FOX news. Yes, according to Ninja Theory, the spokesperson for the legions of hell is Bill O’Reilly. The satire is heavily applied and mostly clumsily executed, and though it elicited the occasional laugh it felt quite forced for the most part.Meanwhile, it’s up to our hero to, well, not really give a ♥♥♥♥ about any of that stuff. In fact, to begin with, all he does care about is getting his end away, though that changes somewhat when he meets his long lost brother  who isn’t evil just yet . Now it’s up to him to save humanity and get revenge, putting a stop to Mundus’s plans.This is where the game’s core mechanic comes in. Combat is obviously central to DmC and is very well executed. Attacks are divided into the usual heavy/medium/fast categories, with some enemies being vulnerable to only one attack type. Combos chain together well and switching between attack types is effortless; easy to learn, difficult to master. Taking on a large group of varied enemies, blocking and dodging their attacks then dispatching them in a storm of axe and blades is immensely satisfying.That’s not to say combat is without flaw. I can certainly accept that the combo meter builds up too easily and getting an S rank is hardly an achievement and though the highest SSS rank is quite a challenge it doesn’t feel as difficult as it probably should do. There is a small amount of lag present, not enough for me to notice during my Nephilim playthrough, but it’s certainly noticeable by the time you get to the Dante Must Die difficulty. Another glaring omission is the lack of a lock button. Say you want to target those annoying flying things that keep on lobbing bombs at you but will die in a single hit? Tough luck, the auto aim will go for the nearest enemy, no matter how you try and aim. Finally, the Devil Trigger ability feels a bit lame; instead of allowing you to clear a room, it just gives you the drop on one or two enemies.The game is backed by a simply awesome soundtrack; it’s some sort of dub-metal that goes so damn well in a game like this. I can’t believe I just said “dub-metal” and “awesome” in the same sentence, but it sets the tone perfectly and really goes with the crazy combat. Dante’s animation, particularly in combat, is brilliant, fluid and convincing. The way he ducks and dances in combat, the way he attacks and just generally moves about is excellent in a way that’s rarely seen even in the mega bucks budget games of these days.Occasionally the game stops the demon killing for some platforming sections through the bizarre realms of limbo.  This is accomplished with familiar techniques; a double jump, the ability to fly for a couple of metres, as well as Dante’s special hookshot which has the ability to either move debris or pull him towards things. It’s during these sections that I first noticed some of the control issues I mentioned and while the platforming looked occasionally impressive, I never really warmed to it.Overall DmC is an excellently put together hack ‘n’ slash game with a crazy and absurd style, fantastic combat and some of the best boss fights I recall playing. There are a few flaws in the design aesthetic and certain technical aspects could do with a little polish but these are minor gripes when compared to the strengths of the game as a whole. It may not be as good as its predecessors, it’s most certainly not as good as Bayonetta, but it’s still a hell of a game.Final verdict:7/10Additional notes about DLC:There are a few bits of additional downloadable content, perhaps most predictably that of a classic skin for Dante (for an outrageous £2.99 mind you), as well as an additional few levels of gameplay in the form of Vergil’s Downfall. This allows you to take control of Vergil for a few hours, giving a new set of powers and some slightly different combos. It’s mostly quite familiar, though the combat is a little stiffer and Vergil feels rather more underpowered than Dante does. The story is boring as well, Vergil decides to become an emo and kill things, nothing more than that. It’s still a welcome expansion to the game and adds at least 3-4 hours. Given that the DLC has the same difficulty level selections as the main game, you may very well get a lot longer than that. Overall I’d give it a 6/10.			"

												Not bad, but still way worse than the main Devil May Cry games. The style simply isn't as good as the others (Dante's character is just uncomparable). Nice game though. There is only one real problem: the replay value. It's common for DmC games to have a lot of extra difficulties, and this one has too, but after 3 playthroughs you'll start to find it boring because of the ""meh"" style of a lot of levels. If you are a fan of the brand or if you are searching for a decent action game it's still worth a try, though (maybe on discount).			"

												DmC is a visceral, fast paced game with meaty hack and slash combat mixed with some platforming here and there. Storywise is where DmC really caught me off guard. I went in not expecting much but a mindless murder spree of demons and a pun here and there however, I was pleasantly surprised by the competent story. All of this plus the awesome soundtrack that was a mesh of thrashmetal and house music performed by Combichrist makes for an awesome experience. Rating: 7.7/10 "

												I've never been a big DMC fan before, and never played the early ones, but anyway, this piece of art work is my favourite hack and slash game! The music the moves the combos all fit together and makes a totally badass and awesome game, which makes me play the whole story over and over again. Also It's a reboot of DMC so if you are new in this world, you didn't really miss anything from the previous games.			"

												Before  any of you read this review, let me say that i am an AVID Devil May Cry fan. I have played the originals 1-3 as well as 4 and beaten all of them on DMD mode. With that in mind lets start this review. This game is REALLY fun. The gameplay is some of the best i have ever played in any hack and slash title; right off of the bat you recognize moves Dante uses in this game that he also used in the older titles, they really looked at the older titles when they made dantes combos. This goes for Vergil's combos as well in the Vergils Downfall DLC. The gameplay can be difficult at times on the harder levels but this is to be expected in any devil may cry game. i HIGHLY recommend a controller when playing this on PC; the mouse and keyboard controls do not suit this game. Here is a short list of pro's and con's about this gamePRO's- Addicting Gameplay- Good Graphics (easy on the videocard) Running on a HD7850 ultra with everything maxed, average around 40-50 FPS- Amazing Swordplay- Good Platforming Sections- Good Music- Decent StoryCON's- New Dante. What can i say, coming from the older games its really sad to see this new dante compared to the old dante that was laid back, funny, and awesome. It takes a bit of getting used to new dante but still, i really wish old dante was in this game.- New Vergil. Same thing here. Vergil was a complete badass in DMC 3 but now he isnt until after the end of the Vergil's Downfall DLC. In my opinion the Vergils Downfall DLC is much better than the original game as Vergils combos are way cooler and do more damageOverall, id give this game a 8/10 just for the fact that the new characters are terrible. I would recommend this game to any Devil May Cry fan but i would only buy it if its on sale, which i did back in 2013.			"

												Amazing game, strong story line and character progression. There are up to 20 levels and some secret missions through out the game + several difficulties which effect the way the game is played. (Depending on the difficulty you choose, there will be more random and stronger enemies, they will havea  different attacking nature making combat harder to predict)The game is loads of fun and you can play multiple times, to help your interest in the game you can change the skins or your weapons and character through game completion/DLC.For those of you who are big fans of the original Devil May Cry games, like myself, will also be amazed at how enjoyable this game is. I was scetchy of the redesign of the characters and the looks of the Rebellion but they all grow on you sooner or later, though I still prefer old style.			"

And Hank from breaking bad is trying to find you and kill you, but Keanu dont take his BS and going on demon killing spree. also graphics are nice with good level design and well made skills tree, you can even remove skills you dont like and you get your points back, cool stuff.

With its cool and aesthetic character and fighting combos, playing DmC is an experience that every gamer shold experience. Differing from the first four games of the series, it has a different story taking place in an alternative DmC universe. Similar background but different story details... By and large, I highly recommend to play DmC. I am sure that you won't regret.General Point 8.5 / 10			"

												Actually pretty good, decent port that ran consistently at 1080p/60fps. Some purists might be put off by the reboot, and to be honest the game is more of a Bayonetta/Heavenly Sword than classic Devil May Cry. But it's still pretty good, and with the dearth of 3rd person action-brawlers available on PC it probably stands as one of the top 5 of it's genre on the PC.  If you're not sure just wait for the summer sale.			"

It's one of the best games of 2011 with references to future events that took part in 2013. Dancing More Cats was a short, but increasingly enjoyable game.

												This game got an unfair amount of flak by gamers too nostalgic of the previous titles, disregarding that this is a reboot of the franchise. Devil May Cry is undoubtedly the posterchild of the hack and slash genre, and this game does everything correctly. The combat is oustanding, the boss fights are creative, and the entire game is a visual trip with its environments, cinematics and effects. Old mechanics that were sometimes frustrating like switching stances have been made more fluid. They have even made the sections between fights into very fun platforming sequences. Overall I'd highly recommend this game if you are a fan of hack and slash games, especially now that it's so cheap on Steam. And definitely plug in a controller for this one, otherwise you will literally destroy your keyboard with presses when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan.			"

												DmC is by far the best 3rd person hack-'n'-slay out there.The combat is perfectly fluid, there are a lot of combos (with 5 melee weapons and 3 kind of guns)and the (level) design is incredible. I promise you, if you play the game for the first time,you'll enter a totally new world when it comes to game design. There is a reason why DmC won prices for that.What else? The story is the typical evil bad guy bla bla and Mundus makes a return as demonic capitalist.On your way to him you'll fight a baby, a propaganda machine and many enemies, each with different strengthsand weaknesses. Every enemy type fits in perfectly with the design of the combat and, in the end, gives you an experience in gameplay you've never had before.I played it on PS3, PS4 and now on steam... and I still can't get enough of the combat. And, different to almostany other game, the arena mode, ""Bloody Palace"", is acutally challenging and enjoyable.			"

												Disregard any misconception about this reboot being terrible; it's quite good.  Combat and control is different, yet familiar and retains the depth of previous DMC games.  The game is eye-candy, with a rocking soundtrack to compliment it.  The characters surprisingly turned out well (Including Dante), save one important character; the story is the best in the series (And by best, I mean with the most depth).  It's a good game in the DMC series, and a very great game if it wasn't.			"

												Note: I only review when I finish the game.Despite the initial prejudgement, this one is very good as always, one of the best DMCs. With the new commands we can create combos combining weapons with facility, making it much fun to execute them, but perhaps it needs of some training. I thought it might have more bosses and they would be more challenging. The action scenes are as always stunning, but I guess that playing with Vergil is cooler than Dante himself. 8.5/10			"

												Awesome game!! I heard people hating on this game because of its poor character development and new looks. Well I haven't played the classic DmC games, so I had no problem with the designs at all, actually, I looked at the classic Dante and Vergil and I like this new ""fedora"" Vergil alot more!So let's have a quick look:The game's story is kinda interesting, there are some political issues with ""terrorists"" because Dante is not a human, he can move from the real world to ""Limbo"", which is a demon world he gets grabbed into wherever a demon wants to fight him. But some of the things that happen in Limbo, are happening in the real world aswell so then the reporters claim that Dante is a terrorist. Then Kat finds him and leads him to Vergil, who is Dante's brother. Together they make a plan to kill the main leader of this corrupted world, Mundus. If they will succeed or not, I won't tell.The character developments are not quite deep or anything, except for Dante, he matures throughout the game from an edgy teenager to a demon slaying world saver. As I said earlier I liked the designs aswell.Graphics and style of the game is also pretty epic. Limbo is a colorful shape shifting world, while the real world is really shady. It has its style.Controls are suprisingly good, if you are new to hack n slash games (I'm not playing them much), you will have no problem whatsoever as keyboard and mouse are fully supported and in-game tutorials are told with keyboard and mouse in mind (unlike Dark souls which propably doesn't even care about keyboard and mouse). Most of the combos are not hard to execute without controller, only maybe the angel and demon evade (Shift+Q, Shift+E) were difficult for me, as I'm of course using the left shift button. But otherwise it's not complicated and easy to catch up.Soundtrack is one of the best parts of this game. If you're a fan of heavy electronic metal and catchy tunes. It's there, definitely.And finally, the gameplay. People say it's execute 10x better than the previous games, I can't tell, but what I can tell is that the gameplay is totally awesome! It's smooth, flashy and epic. Only thing I can dislike is the story length. If you'll not go for all the collectibles or not willing to replay the story (which is required if you want 100% every mission), you will not enjoy the game for long. It will take somewhat 6 hours, for me it took 8 as I was pretty slow in my progress.BUT, there are other things to do aswell. There's the free Bloody Palace dlc, which is an enjoyable wave-mode. There's quite a bunch of difficulties and also every mission is packed with hidden things all over it, which you will need to collect if you want to achieve the highest scores.SHORTLY:+Story+Style and atmosphere+SOUNDTRACK+Controls+Gameplay!+Bloody Palace mode+Tons of collectibles and secrets in each mission+Style ranking system-Lenght~Some people dislike the new looks of characters, I take it as a neutral as for me, they were fine9/10  Solid game for me. Only the length is a thing to take in consideration if you want to buy it.			"

												Never played the origianl DmC series so this is the first i have played so will review it as that.Overall a decent game, nothing standout, nice humour decent story, challenging boss fights and lots of different modes to play once you beat it, plus the satisfaction of wanting to get SSS on every level find every secret you can get a bit more time out of it, but for just one play through it didnt last too long.Combat 8/10 Felt Fluid and enjoyable just didnt enjoy it as much as other games like this.Graphics 8/10 (Everything maxxed out) Looks good played smooth good effects and decent cutscenes.Sound 9/10 Loved it, fitted the game really well pumping thrashy guitars to beat demons too.  Didnt enjoy it as much as Remember Me ThoughStory 8/10 Well put together well told, decent humour if you like that kind of thing Dante is a real Comic with his one liners and puns. Didnt draw me in as much as other games have done but still appreciated the effort they put into telling it, even if it did feel a bit short.Overall 8/10  Not the best game i played recently but not bad at all what it does it does well just nothing spectacular.  Nice Boss fights and no QTE's bit of a + for me felt better to do the things myself through comboing my abilities than do it by pressing buttons when told.			"

In spite of the fact that it's been negatively reviewed by people who simply don't like the ""direction they took the main character,"" the game itself is a dream. The animations and combat are perfectly designed to the points that, if you are a ""skill gamer"" you'll be playing the same levels over and over, pushing for more and more stylish and perfect combos. Not only do you have a huge number of moves available to you, but they all look amazing, and are easy to pull off. The trick isn't complicated input; it's doing the right thing at the right time. And ""right thing"" refers to one of ~20 or so of the moves in your arsenal, and ""right time"" refers to a single digit number of animation frames. If journalists didn't have a problem with rebellious teenage boys wearing eye shadow, this game would not have received so much hate from the media.			"

												I highly recommend DmC. Even though I had prejudiced first, after complating first two missions I had pleased to have this game. With its cool and aesthetic character and fighting combos, playing DmC is an experience that every gamer shold experience. Differing from the first four games of the series, it has a different story taking place in an alternative DmC universe. Similar background but different story details... By and large, I highly recommend to play DmC. I am sure that you won't regret.General Point 8.5 / 10			"

												Ninja Theory has done a terrific job capturing the spirit and flow of original Devil May Cry series, but fell short of expectation in terms of presentation. I cannot defend the new characterization of gaming's beloved icon Dante (and Vergil) because he is nowhere near as likable and admirable as his original counterpart. The plot is uninteresting, and all these new concepts and premises Ninja Theory added to the DMC universe just seem trying too hard. World and environment designs, though, are surprisingly well done. The surrealism of mysterious art in which angels, demons, and humans coexist (albeit on inimical terms) in modern times is consistent and convincing that the game is confident in what it is. One complaint that has stood out to me during the game is sometimes getting to where the hidden items are requires weapons that have yet to be introduced. I found it a cheap way to entice the player to come back to certain levels after beating the campaign and having acquired all the weapons. But in the end, the core of this game lies in an adrenaline-rushing, intense combat action, and it successfully kept me entertained throughout. I'm very impressed by how Ninja Theory has achieved such a fluid combat system that is equally profound and easy to wrap one's head around, much reminiscent of the original DMC series. Some combos are as easy as pressing the same button 4 times in a succession, and at the same time there's an endless possibility to what kind of high-damaging and stylish combo sequences a skilled player could come up with to sweep through the horde of enemies.The DLC chapters are disappointing, however. Faithful recreation of Vergil's fightstyle and familiar movesets is impressive, but the rest of the game does not tie up the base game's loose ends. Cutscenes are replaced with cheap, anime-style black-and-white videos that add nothing to already-bland narrative. Level designs are atrocious with simplified areas surrounded by ambiguous invisible walls, which effectively makes the game tediously linear. Placements of supposed ""hidden"" items are predictable, uncreative, and lazy to say the least. The players don't take long to realize that what they're doing is essentially going through a straight-path corridor with some background that gives them a cheap illusion of exploration, occasionally triggering enemy encounters at fixed locations. Unlike the base game, all levels' environment designs look the same and are uninspired. The disappointment in this aspect saddens me, given that base game featured an interesting art direction of which I was hoping to see more. Game's occasional attempts at changing things up with cheesy and poorly designed platforming don't help redeem its quality. Perhaps the biggest turn-off of all for me is the recycled levels toward the end. It is as though Ninja Theory ran out of time and budget after putting all their effort into Vergil's playable character model alone. It's a shame.Still, DmC is definitely a solid game and worth a try.			"

 The Good The gameplay was a lot of fun.  There are multiple weapons and different combos to use that keep the game fresh.  I know that the style meter is supposed to be a big draw, and perhaps to some people it i, but I rarely paid attention to it.  You get most of your equipment pretty early in the game, which makes the gameplay pretty deep and fun right from the beginning.  You can get some neat combos going, and some of the enemies require different weapons to damage them.  That sounds tedious at first, but makes you plan out some battes once the game starts mixing the enemies it throws at you.Speaking of enemies: I have heard some complaints about the enemies, but I thought they were done pretty well.  Some of them are pallette swaps, (which just means they are succeptible to different attacks) or just upgraded versions that take more hits, but there are some that are completely unique and can be fairly challenging when they appear with a horde of different minions.  The graphics are pretty good, and the stages do have some variability to them that makes them feel fresh, without getting too stale.  One of the best parts of the world, are the morphing of the world around you as it changes.  Looking down a hallway as the exit zooms away from you is a really cool effect.The game will also give you hints at how to kill certain enemies, but only after you have fought the enemy a couple of times, which means you still have time to figure out your favorite way to kill a type of enemy before the game just says, ""yeah, this is how we meant for you to do it.""The BadCombat - One of the main draws from the original Devil May Cry was that you used a sword AND guns.  Your starting guns in this game, the pistols Ebony and Ivory, are absolutely terrible.  I never used them unless I was fighting the one enemy in the game that was only vulnerable to bullets. Bosses - A lot  [strike[all the boss battles[/strike] all the boss battles except  the final boss battle  are dissapointingly easy, and tedious.  Most of them go a little something like this: fight to expose boss weakness, hit boss weakness, repeat steps one and two.The UglyCharacters - The characters in this game are so bland, so boring, so awful.  Hands down the worst part of this game.  I feel like every review touches on how Dante is terrible in this game, and it is true.  Dante is supposed to be cool, but he is just an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥  Every time he said something,  all I could think was, what-a-tool.  Story - There never was anything surprising about the story.  There were some things that just confused me, like how the real world interacts with Limbo, and vice versa (the rules seem to change depending on how the story writers wanted craete tension). Fortunately  the main problems with the game don't prevent you from enjoying yourself as you are actually controlling the game.  You may just want to hate yourself during the cutscenes.  With that in mind, the game is really enjoyable, and provided me with a bit of fun.  There are a fair amount of levels, it isn't too short, it isn't too long.  And if you enjoy challenges there are quite a few higher difficulty levels that allow you to have some replayability.			"

												Never played the origianl DmC series so this is the first i have played so will review it as that.Overall a decent game, nothing standout, nice humour decent story, challenging boss fights and lots of different modes to play once you beat it, plus the satisfaction of wanting to get SSS on every level find every secret you can get a bit more time out of it, but for just one play through it didnt last too long.Combat 8/10 Felt Fluid and enjoyable just didnt enjoy it as much as other games like this.Graphics 8/10 (Everything maxxed out) Looks good played smooth good effects and decent cutscenes.Sound 9/10 Loved it, fitted the game really well pumping thrashy guitars to beat demons too.  Didnt enjoy it as much as Remember Me ThoughStory 8/10 Well put together well told, decent humour if you like that kind of thing Dante is a real Comic with his one liners and puns. Didnt draw me in as much as other games have done but still appreciated the effort they put into telling it, even if it did feel a bit short.Overall 8/10  Not the best game i played recently but not bad at all what it does it does well just nothing spectacular.  Nice Boss fights and no QTE's bit of a + for me felt better to do the things myself through comboing my abilities than do it by pressing buttons when told.			"

												Ninja Theory scores another hit.First off, it has a console game pedigree, you're probably best off with a gamepad. Also, I've never play the other Devil May Cry games, so this is being judged on its own.The graphics are fantastic, especially the motion-captured animation and the generally trippy and dreamlike set design. I found myself really enjoying the soundtrack even though metal and industrial aren't really my thing. The audio reminded me of Max Payne 3 in that regard.It did feel a little short at 10 hours on a normal mode playthrough, but the game encourages replaying and thus I'm not sure I'm done with it.			"

												This game was not what I execpted it plays to much like an arcade game and it is remarkable similar to darksiders one.  I wanted an adult content roleplaying game. I hate the way the sections of the game end with just a screen instead of more content or contentious game flow. The game isn't bad per say but I do not enjoy it because I could care less how many points I earn per level.  Maybe this is the game other people wanted but I learned a painful lesson not to listen so much to what other gamers say.  The melee action is just to unrealistic it feels fake it's too over the top not to mention the guns are similar fake in an under powered way.  The bullets just keep coming there's no limit to them or refill animation and the sword action is mostly just button mashing.			"

												I wanted to like this game. And indeed there is a lot to like about this. The game play is mostly solid. It's fun as hell chaining combos and it has some proper old-school boss fights. I didn't have a problem with the Hot Topification of Dante, and while he can be somewhat annoying to listen to, the game as a whole finds some charm in its sense of humor. However, the overall experience in negated by some questionable level design and, more importantly, the worst camera I've ever experienced in a video-game. I'm serious, this is not nitpicking. It's broken to the point were it often negates the enjoyment you might be otherwise experiencing. In calmer, corridor levels it's just annoying when it gets caught in terrain. However, in platforming sections, the camera occasionally does a 180 degree turn around Dante while you're power jumping to the next platform, sending him in the opposite direction and ultimately falling to failure. This is never not frustating. The worst, however, is when you find the final boss. It's almost always impossible to employ the correct counter, because while the game is trying to telegraph what move he's about to make, the camera is showing you some lovely clouds and a few damaged buildings in the background. Without these issues I'd have no problem recommending this as a great game. Unfortunately, as it is, it's the wrong kind of challenging.			"

I liked ""new dante"" from the first time i saw him. And then I saw angry nerds getting upset about him not being a white guy with white hair and I liked him even more. I like the story and the levels are pretty awesome. The boss fights are all different and pretty well balanced. They're not all super japanese like in the other games. Most of the japanese stuff is gone really. I don't mind much because the japanese stuff is pretty meh and it's not a plus for me.Bottom line, play it. It's fun.			"

												I was always a fan of the old series. The old Dante was a wise crack and a badass character. At first glance of the original trailer for this game, I hated it to its very core. It's not the DMC that I knew but over time I felt like they were heading in the right direction for this game and I ended up pre-ordering it. I'm a real DmC fan, no matter how awful the game might be (DMC2, anyone?). I ended up loving this game. The art style is gritty and dark (which I love), the gameplay is very smooth, the soundtrack gets you pumping (like any DMC track should) and the characters grew on me. Even the new Dante.The only complaint I have about this game is its way too easy compared to the other DMCs. Call me a sadist but when it comes to DMC, I want to feel like ripping my hair out then that adreniline rush when I finally beat something. DMC is known to be hard and I feel like they lightened this game up for any new comers. Which isnt really bad if you think about it.			"

												Dante's new outing contains more creativity and imagination than all of its predecessors combined. It's not the DMC you want, but it's definitely the DMC you deserve. Ninja Theory throws off the shackles of the series and does something original with a series that was never really capable of being taken seriously from a narrative perspective. DmC has all the bases covered. Though it's not the mechanical masterpiece that is Dante's Awakening, it succeeds in breathing new life into a series that, after DMC4, deserved to be put down.			"

												So far the action and story are ace and on pace with Bioshock Infinite. I rarely get pulled into a game like this; It feels like playing through a rich novel. Mature themes, dark ambient environments will fancy action gamers who might have also enjoyed The Witcher series and Far Cry 3. I'm a few hours into the game, hope that the pacing and content doesn't wear itself out. BTW how bout' that art direction?			"

												DmC starts off a bit slow, but finishes so strong and turns out to be one of the best games 2013 had to offer.  The combat is extremely satisfying once you unlock a few different weapons and are able to switch between them mid-combat.  The game has some of the most memorable boss fights in recent memory (think Asura's Wrath visuals, but enjoyable to play).  Ninja Theory, as usual, delivered.If it matters (it shouldn't), DmC is the first Devil May Cry game I've played.			"

												Right up there with DMC4 as 2 of the best hack and slash games of all time. Graphics is top nouch. The art direction is more appealing than some of the other games with good graphics, although this can be subjective. The action is very smooth, and this is expected from a DMC serie game. Combos are not too hard but fun to pull off. BOSS fights are also well designed. Comparing this to Metal Gear Rising, this game is way better, in terms of game play, graphics, art design, story, and voice acting. Overall , 9/10			"

												First off, Dante is not gone. He is not that far off from the original once you finish the game. That being said, most people are turned away from the game as it is not the Dante nor the Universe we've come to know and love. But you have to understand that this game is acutally a reboot for Capcom. And in my opinion, Ninja Theory did a marvelous job with this game. (Sectioned these off, just look at first sentence for categories. TLDR at the bottom.)First off, the universe. Before, in previous Devil May Cry installments, Humans and Demons lived on one plane. In this game, not so much. Here, Demons and Humans are separeted by ""Limbo"". A plane really close to that of the human world. In this universe, humans, demons, anything and anyone can be pulled into Limbo, and the only way to get out is to kill the demon that dragged you into Limbo. In this universe, you have a more stylized and modern intrepertation of demons. They control the world with debt, keeping them docile with soft drinks called Virility, and monitor them from Limbo with CTV Surveilance systems in the real world. I think this is a pretty interesting take on our modern day and might actually be conveying a message.As for the visual aspects of the game, I have to say it's quite gorgeous. The stylistic combos that Dante can pull off between his human, demon, and angelic form are quite a sight to see. Animations are much more realistic as they represent actual human movements. What I mean by this is that they transition quite nicely. The point system now shows you what you are getting your points from, how much you're getting from them, and what special actions you've performed that netted you those points such as perfect evades and environmental attacks. All the while, the game is running extremely well. I play on a Laptop, which really isn't the greatest for gaming, but boy. I ran this game on Ultra settings, 60Hz refresh rate with HD texture and HD Anti-Aliasing. 60FPS the whole time. Cutscenes are extremely well done, voice acting is top notch, and make the game pretty believable. I can only recall maybe 1 or 2 events where the voice acting took me out of the game.Difficulty? Not much here until you hit ""Dante must Die"", ""Heaven and Hell"", and ""Hell and Hell"" modes. Hell and Hell can give you a real challenge comparing to that of Dark Souls or Monster Hunter. See, in this mode, if you're not familiar with previous games is a challenging difficulty level where Dante dies in one hit, while his enemies have full health. This right here, this, is the hardest you're going to be able to play this game. Seriously, the difficulty level in this game is a joke, I beat the game on Standard difficulty dying only once and managing an S or SS rank at the end of the mission. As long as you do what the game tells you to do (Angelic weapons against blue enemies, and Demonic weapons on red enemies) you'll be fine. Took me about 9-10 hours to beat the main DmC mode on that difficulty alone. But I kind of want to go back and finish the game on all dificulties in order to get all the achievements and perfect my combos. That being said, this game is a breeze.Story wise, like I said earlier, this game has an interesting take on today's society and the demons that walk among us as your everyday Joe. I do have to say, Character Development is not a big thing in this game. When there is some, it's kind of out of nowhere and really bland. One of the most interesting characters in my opinion is Kat, but you don't really get enough of her to justify her as an interesting character all that much. Though I do have to say I was EXTREMELY impressed with what Ninja Theory and Capcom did at the end. They set this game up so well for a sequel and in my opinion, stayed true to DmC. I was absolutely speechless, no doubt do you have to play this game for that. With that ending, you know that they also listened to their fans. Hell, it may seem like they didn't at first glance, but they did. Secretly. They did a very good job calming the populus somewhat with Dante's original redesign. Long story short, the story is entirely riding on the ending. It's pretty generic throughout most of the game and the end just leaves you breathless.Music is okay, not really much to say here. Basically what you would expect Dante to be listening to while murdering demons. Only complaint is that the music sometimes doesn't stop when all enemies are killed leaving you to think that there are still more when there actually isn't when the music is NORMALLy supposed to fade away after you get them all. But that's not the only thing. Sometimes it doesn't even fade. It just stops. Abrubtly, just like that and you're just kind of taken back a bit. Nothing too major though. Replayability? Hell yes. You'll see collectibles off in the distance far too many times throughout your playthrough wondering how to get there. Simple answer? You can't. You have to gain access to certain abilites and then revisit those levels to reach those collectibles for a higher completion percentage and the mission score screen. Also necessary if you're hunting for those achievements. DLC, I'd say skip out on it. It's not that good. By the name of the DLC you can tell you play as Vergil and I'll tell you, while he seems cool, you just feel extremely limited with him. After getting SSS ranks in combat with Dante, barely being able to scrape a B rank with Vergil just hurts. You can combo much better with him as your progress, but you don't even get all of your abilities until you finish the sodding DLC. That's right. Your reward for beating the DLC, is an ability that would have helped you clear the DLC. Their choice for this was obvious if you play through it, but it's best to just either pick this up while on sale or just skip it entirely. Another gripe of mine with this is that the cutscenes, they appear to be concept art, Just a slideshow or a quick demo of what the cutscenes should have looked like/portrayed if they were actually animated. Not only that, they switch from concept art into ACTUAL animation out of nowhere towards the end of the cutscence. REALLY takes you out of the experience. TL;DR: Game stays true to DmC history, just with a few of it's own twists taking place in a more modern universe that resembles our own. It may not look like it at first glance, but it is actually pretty spectacular with what they did with the ending. Gameplay is satisfying, beautiful, smooth as all hell, but extrememly easy unless you pick one of the higher difficulties like ""Hell and Hell"" which you have to unlock by beating the game several times. Great replayability requiring you to return to previous missions with abilities obtained in later chapters to get all collectibles. Music is okay though music sometimes doesn't stop as fast as it needs to, or ends too abruptly after fights. Story wise, kind of generic, but my god, like I already said, the ending... Left me as giddy as a schoolgirl. As for the DLC, either skip out on it or pick it up while on sale because it's not that good. If I HAD to give it a score, 9.5/10			"

												I have never played a Devil May Cry game, and from what I understand a lot of DmC fans were deeply disappointed in this reboot. The criticisms they have of it seem fair - especially about the overly edgy protagonist Dante and his edgy mcedgyton brother Vergil. While Dante certainly wasn't a very fun character (I was sort of hoping he'd become funnier as the game progressed) he's not completely terrible. I never found myself cringing at his emo edgyness, and some of the lines he had were decently funny. A lot of jokes fall flat because they consist mainly of variations on ""♥♥♥♥ you."" The story isn't amazing, typical evil dude running the world and you have to take him out. I do think it does a good job of setting up future game stories without a ridiculously stupid cliffhanger or anything. It reveals something, resolves it temporarily, and sort of lets it be. The gameplay is where I had quite a bit of fun. The action starts out reeeeaaallllyy simplistic, but once you get the scythe it all sort of starts to make sense. The fun comes in mixing and matching the various weapons together for good combos. Each creature has a weakness for you to exploit, and some are more obvious than others. For example there were these ninja dudes who I had NO idea, until the last level of the game, were incapable of blocking the axe thingy. I had completely switched to the fists and thought the axe was useless until I realized that. Of course you can't just use the axe on them though because it's slow, first you have to catch them off guard with something else. The same thing applies to a lot of the battles - you find new combinations as you play and it continues like that until the very end. Hell, in the very final boss fight I discovered a new way to use a weapon I thought I had figured out. One thing about the combat that sort of fell flat was the enemies which REQUIRED you to use either an Angel or Demon weapon. I can see how that introduces challenge in fights where there's more than one enemy but it still felt extremely cheap. There'd be a red enemy that I can only use the fists or axe on, so I would just spam one of those until it was dead. No fun or strategy in it, just a huge annoyance. It became especially annoying when certain enemies would simply become ghosts if you weren't holding down the left or right trigger. Really?That said I enjoyed the combat all the way through, and the boss fights were decent as well. I thought the next-to-last boss was a bit stupid because he took up so much of the screen that dodging all of his attacks were nearly impossible, so you just had to get lucky. The raptor news boss fight was the best though - it was funny and well designed. It was by far the most creative fight in the game.Overall I would recommend this game, especially if it's on sale. It's a solid game with some good design. If you can forgive the edgyness, generic story, and heavy use of dubstep.			"

												DmC is by far the best 3rd person hack-'n'-slay out there.The combat is perfectly fluid, there are a lot of combos (with 5 melee weapons and 3 kind of guns)and the (level) design is incredible. I promise you, if you play the game for the first time,you'll enter a totally new world when it comes to game design. There is a reason why DmC won prices for that.What else? The story is the typical evil bad guy bla bla and Mundus makes a return as demonic capitalist.On your way to him you'll fight a baby, a propaganda machine and many enemies, each with different strengthsand weaknesses. Every enemy type fits in perfectly with the design of the combat and, in the end, gives you an experience in gameplay you've never had before.I played it on PS3, PS4 and now on steam... and I still can't get enough of the combat. And, different to almostany other game, the arena mode, ""Bloody Palace"", is acutally challenging and enjoyable.			"

												This game got an unfair amount of flak by gamers too nostalgic of the previous titles, disregarding that this is a reboot of the franchise. Devil May Cry is undoubtedly the posterchild of the hack and slash genre, and this game does everything correctly. The combat is oustanding, the boss fights are creative, and the entire game is a visual trip with its environments, cinematics and effects. Old mechanics that were sometimes frustrating like switching stances have been made more fluid. They have even made the sections between fights into very fun platforming sequences. Overall I'd highly recommend this game if you are a fan of hack and slash games, especially now that it's so cheap on Steam. And definitely plug in a controller for this one, otherwise you will literally destroy your keyboard with presses when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan.			"

After this game I wanted to play full series starting from DMC1 to DMC4 and proceed my DmC: DMC adventure. Fight system is fantastic, story wonderful. Game shows how media and politicians or rich people can control almost everything and manipulate unconscious people, that's most what I liked. Music was great, because of this game I started long ago being a fan of Combichrist and Noisia.

But the changes to the character didn't bother me, I had no other Dante to want him to be.My main point is, that the reason people didn't like it as that its a very different game to what came before in the series.

Game is very polished, great voice acting, great graphics, etc.  It's not as hard as earlier DMC games, but at least they offer higher difficulty modes, even going to borderline insanity.  There is a New Game+, which is nice.  Dialogue a little cheesy in places, but what else would you expect from DMC.  Boss battle was annoying to figure out how to finish Virgil; once you figure out the fight, and with a little luck, you can finish him in 3 minutes.  I don't mind that since it took me a lot of time and to figure him out, so I appreciate him not just being a bullet sponge, but requiring tactics to defeat.			"

												A really fun and fast action game. It's quite different from its predecessors, but this diversity makes it feel much fresher than the previous installment. Very pretty and very easy to run too, so it's a treat on both gameplay and visual ends. If you like action games, don't even think twice about getting this (and DMC4 as well).			"

												Fans of Devil May Cry and hack-n-slash in general will defiantly get a kick out of this. It is a nice reboot to a classic, but don't hold your breath for anything groundbreaking. Story is rather generic and the constant ""pull"" to purgatory just feels like forced plot point. Like you can no longer fight around humans seeing demons and such so you are always conveniently placed in a between world that Dante can fight in. All things considered, I would say this warrants a pick up and play through when it hits the sales.			"

												I always want to play this game, but then get bored playing it. And frankly it is a bit hard for my tastes, but I am not a big action game guy. Sometimes it just seems like it takes a million hits to down some of these guys. I'm told that you need more combos, but with as much text as this game puts on screen it doesn't give you the best damage info. Also some of the combos just don't always seem to work. Again, might be that I am not used to the genre, but I sit there in training and do exactly what it says and if the thing involves any pauses it just doesn't work. Any way, the design is pretty cool. The sense of humor gets old fast. The bosses look great, but all the level combat gets majorly tedious. A lot of the game is based on redoing things too which is definitely not the best things in the world when the combat is already tedious. On balance, worth the time, but only at a cheap price.			"

												From the very first announcement of the Devil May Cry series rebooting, to the development of this latest addition being turned over to a non-Japanese studio, a far greater number of critical gazes fell upon DmC. Luckily, the people at Ninja Theory did more than simply pay due homage to a venerable gaming series; they infused it with a fresh look at the characters, the world they reside in, and the gameplay that is the series staple.While die-hard Devil May Cry fans may cringe at the idea of a rebooted story, it does little in the way of producing disappointment. Dante is crass and womanizing, but manages to get away with being a rebel due to his unique ancestry. After several hours into the game his bad-boy personality is peeled away to reveal a fractured individual that mirrors the jagged intersections of limbo that crash into his world.Gameplay-wise, DmC offers an intuitive ""quick-switch"" weapon system that lets you change between several different kinds of weapons in mere seconds for some truly awe-inspiring combos from dedicated players. Throw in a pumping soundtrack and you have a pulse-pounding game that make the hours slip away as though they were mere seconds.			"

Its okay but we didn't need it2 years later and I'm still holding the fact that this is not a good Devil May Cry game.Mechanics that were once reserved for players who actually tried learning have become easy making combos effortless. ""Old"" mechanics such as style switchinghave been butcherd and replaced with odd button mapping making the control schemefeel out of place and cluncky, for example weapons that were once swappable with easevia  the tigger buttons are mapped on the d-pad. On its own merits DmC is a good character action game for entry level players interested in the genre. 7/10			"

												This game is MUCH better than I had thought it would be.  The storyline is a bit confusing be cause the first cutscene when you start a play through would make more sense to be a mid-game cut scene.  As such, the first 4 DMC games (simply title Devil May cry 1-4) should be played before this one. That said, it is a re-boot done well.  The story feels even more captivating than the original, the character dialogue is some of the best writing i've seen since Borderlands 2, the difficulty curve Is on the opposite end of FFIIIX (meaning that the parts that seem hard are hard because of skill, not some cheap boss fight where tactics are necesarry).  There are a few minor things that I notice for one, all the game play takes place in the alternate demension of limbo, where demons are visible. Granted there are angelic weapons and demonic weapons that revolutionize the god of war esque hit-something-till-it-dies gameplay.  At $50 its a steep asking price, but well worth the cost.  If you dont like the new dante's appearance, if you get the DLC you can use the classic dante's. Capcom definitly made up for their past mistake of making DMC 1-4 have a strange, hard-to-follow chronology(DMC1 was the 2nd or 3rd chronologically, and DMC3 was the first). Admittedly, The limbo dimension DOES explain how the demons control the humans with out the humans knowing any thing.  There are some minor problems with some mid-game mechanics, but im not going to explain them here as to not spoil too much of the game.  I give it a 10/10.			"

												On a 10-point scale, DmC is a solid 9. I got into the series some years ago after playing the third game. Comments by DMC purists sparked my interest in this... and they don't know on what they're missing out.I think the story is great, there's some character development, the soundtrack is awesome and the gameplay is very satisfying. I unlocked all 48 main achievements in a three-week span (about 60 hours playing and I have yet to buy the Vergil DLC) and I'm still not tired of playing it. The game is definitely lengthy and it does have replay value. Bloody Palace mode is really fun. While the game's difficulty has been toned down to appeal to less skilled players, it's still DMC to the core, and the higher difficulty levels shouldn't disappoint.On the other hand, almost all bosses are uninspired. Only the first and the last ones felt like true bosses. They're way too static (apart from the aforementioned ones) and humanized. I was hoping for more beast-like ones. All guns are useless and a couple weapons didn't satisfy my inner demon slayer, like Aquila. While Eryx was good, it was the weapon I used the least. Despite the flaws, this kicks♥♥♥♥♥and I can't wait for a sequel. If you buy this, you won't regret it.			"

												DmC has been added to my 'guilty pleasure' list of games.+ The environments of Limbo shift and change for a unique and unstable feel. + The controls are tight, and the flow from one move to another can be learned rather easily. - The dialogue is somewhat weak or downright cheesy at times, + The motion capture for said dialogue is AMAZING. I don't have much for gripes about this game, minus the simplistic/edgy quips between characters, and that has nothing to do with the gameplay itself. So yeah. Solid game!This does full justice to the name, even if Neo-Dante isn't entirely what the crowd wanted.			"

												First thing first, I have played the orignal 3 and the extra 4th Devil May Cry games several times and understand the characters and the world rather well. So when playing this game seeing how the plot is just a shity merger of the previous 4. The characters where re-done terrible (you should not change mains) and some rather important parts where changed; example, Dante wants to help protect humans as he is close to his ""human"" half, he also has strong emotions towards his ""human"" mother who is known to be a long haired blonde ""human""; so why in this game is his mother a red haired ""angel"". Also the whole Nephilim rubish, made by the ""secret union between angel and demon was inconceivable"" - Vergil; inconceivable - not capable of being imagined or grasped mentally; unbelievable. Yet later we get told that ""The Nephilim were the third race, sadly they were hunted down, and slain"" - Phineas. So their existance is inconceivable it was epected to never happen, but it happened before, and to a large quantity for it to be labeled a ""race"". Their are so many issues in story; characters a badly done, visuals are good in most senses however enemies apperances are not that good and bosses are worse (See Dmc:Devil May Cry Succubus vs DmC 3 Nevan (Not labeled as a Succubus but her abilities moves and character match)). Combat is done well as a base but the adding of the ""Blue"" and ""Red"" weapons and the corresponding enemies was a terrible idea, it might of been better to go half and half as to say the ""Red"" enemies had a red hue but not totally red and take reduced damage from non-red weapons instead of immunity. Also as a personal not did not play the game without the Dante skin change to the correct(ish) appearance as I really did not like the new appearance, however that is a routh topic; however you made the personality s**t also and you changed the way the iconic weapons looked and you just ruined it.Gameplay = Survivable (Good and bad moments)Visual = OkayStory = Mostly Skipable so their is thatAchievements = Easy 70%+ okay 90% difficult 100% (DLC achivements)Final result = F**k this game, kept wanting to like it but no matter what it kept defecating on-top of itself.

Let's be real, they butchered Dante, the art doesn't have the same apeal as the old game and think most die hard DMC fans aren't going to like the new direction...HOWEVER, the game is actually pretty solid and while I stopped caring about the story about 5 minutes into the first cinematic I still respect the gameplay quite a bit. Its still a responsive action game with stylish combat and fun combos. If you like Action Hack and Slash games, this one is right up your alley.			"

												Whilst I was scptical about playing this game at first my mind was quickly changed. The gameplay is fast and fluid making it fun as hell to play (pun intended). Dante is funny with his one liners and his cocky attitude. This game is pretty much an 80s movie that you play through. The place where this game shines IMO is its level design and the combat. The boss battles are all cool and you are never really given an item that's a throwaway. Every item has a purpose even if they're mainly artificialy made IE needing one to advance through the level. The weapons change the flow of combat and you are rewarded for mixing it up but can get by on the same three combos at the cost of style points and ranking. The story is also not bad. I really liked where they headed with it. Its all the right amounts of cheesy. Overall if its sitting in your backlog or want something fun to play give it a shot.			"

I was sceptical about this young Dante but he's not bad at all, he still has his badassery. Everything in this game is awesome, platforming is much better than in the previous DMC episodes, it's still action packed, storyline is good... the only thing that bothered me a bit *spoiler alert* is the Hell and Heaven monsters, as you can't kill those monsters without the appropriate weapon, so you have to kill that minion with exactly that weapon, which isn't that much of a problem as they are pretty rare.All in all, I really recommend this game. Wether you are new to the DMC series or an old fan, you should try it out. I had loads of fun and I still have.			"

They have made weapon switching easier, better camera angles (not the fixed position which always would mess me up) and added plenty more abilities and weapon upgrades. The new Dante can come off as a little stupid sometimes, I like the DmC 3 Dante better, but I do not believe that this new Dante takes away from the game as some have said. I recommend this game for all long time DmC lovers or to those who are just starting to find this series of games.			"

												Very good combat system. Eventhough there isn't as much techniques as in DMC 4 , yo ucan combine those you have in a large number of combos. Graphics nice , the game runs smoothly  all the time. Nice bosses but enemy variety is lacking  imo.  "

												It was nice learning how Dante became the way he is. I only played one other Devil May Cry game, but I can't remember much about it. The music, the gameplay and the storyline is pretty solid. I'm not really sure why this game received so much hate... maybe it's because Dante didn't have his famous white hair... and ended up with a small patch of white hair for awhile XD			"

												I'm a pretty humble person, so when a game like this makes you feel like an Unequivocal Badass, you know they've done something right.With addictive gameplay, consisting of a great range of fight moves, weapons, and environmental challenges, ridiculous level design that leaves questioning reality, and moving performances from the life-like but not 'uncanny valley intruding' characters. I was hooked.Oh, and the soundtrack is a mix of eerie atmospheres, merciless rock, and brutal drum and bass. I'd always been a fan of Noisia, but introduced me to many of my favourite works of theirs.			"

												Regardless of the vitriolic hatred aimed at this game by its rabid ""fanboi"" populace, this is possibly the most solid entry in the entire DMC series.  With a stronger focus on quality storytelling than prior titles, DmC: Devil May Cry provides a much more coherent, ""all growed up"" retelling of Dante's origin.  Accompanying this excellent narrative is an incredibly solid artistic style.  The environments, special effects and monster design are all quite fresh.  Creatures you encounter are instantly recognizable; there will be no confusing one demon for another.  The soundtrack also remains superb, as one would expect from this series.  Granted, it's a slightly different style of soundtrack, featuring more electronica (of the industrial variety) and less heavy metal-inspired tracks.Now for the critiques...DmC features an ""angel"" and ""demon"" weapon system.  At first blush, this seems like a perfectly reasonable tweak/addition to the game.  First impressions would lead you to believe that it livens up combos and adds more variety to the game.  This is, however, only half true.  The angel/demon weapon system can, in some cases, leave you more limited in your combo choices.  When a designated angel/demon enemy type is struck by anything other than a matching weapon, the weapon bounces off harmlessly, (which also leaves Dante open and vulnerable for a moment) ending any combo chain you may be in the middle of.Throw just one of these enemies into a mix of other types, and you are forced to either A.) Remove that enemy from the group with a pull (which, granted, the game gives you the tools for) or B.) Kill the whole group with a matching weapon type.Over all, this isn't a huge deal, and you won't often be bothered by it.  There are criticisms to be made about this system, however, so you might find yourself occasionally irritated by the situations you're put into.The Vergil's Downfall DLC is also fairly disappointing.  Vergil's combo list is, generally speaking, much smaller and more sparsely populated with techniques than his brother Dante's.  This leaves Vergil's fights feeling a bit stale and repetitive until every option for his combat is unlocked (and even then, it's less in-depth than Dante's is).The cutscenes of Vergil's downfall also features a completely different visual style.  In Vergil's Downfall, the cutscenes are comprised of minimalistic animations, as opposed to the motion-captured CGI of the main game.  While not necessarily inferior, it can be visually jarring when one goes from the main game straight into the DLC.Anyway, that about wraps it up.  This is a solid game, with little to actually complain about once the nostalgia glasses come off.  Fans of the original DMC (myself included) and its subsequent sequels should feel right at home here, assuming they are capable of being objective and unbiased.			"

			Views: 280		

			Dante is back for some more action, But this is not the same Dante from previous games. DmC is a game for PC, XBOX 360, and Playstation 3. The video was recorded using the PC version.		

This is a fun game, even if this is not the same Dante. Just enjoy it as is. "

												An INCREDIBLE game. It doesn't give you even a moment to relax. You always have to concentrate, especially on HOH and HAH levels where you have no posibility to make mistake.Battles are awesome. Much improved, comparing to DMC4. You can make combos without any interruptions. the world around you canges really fast and you should be ready to flat out, fight with hordes of different enemies (On high levels they require some tactic because you can kill some enemies only using particular weapon).The atmosphere of Limbo is something that can't be transfered using words. You, literally, immerse in this world. But, actually, the story line is not really exciting.In conclusion, it must be said that this game worth being played.P.S: Soundrack is something that should be mentioned. It's at least one reason why you should play this game.P.P.S: Nice idea Ninja Theory ATTENTION SPOILER!!! DEMONS, WE HAVE AWOKEN.			"

												As big DMC fan I gave this game a go thinking its a reboot I will think about it from fresh perspective. The game graphically is good the environment that you play in is very interesting and unique the main character is the guy you will hate for 80% of the game play. He is huge disappointed who hardly knows what he wants but he develops as you go along into more or less likeable guy. The game mechanics are boring and repetitive game is more target for people that are into tapping single button rather than making huge combos with variation of moves. if I were to score it for story 7/10 graphics/music etc 8/10 characters 4/10 gameplay 5/10  adding my love for the series which was crushed with this DMC release 2/10 giving it overall of 6/10 but nevertheless if you want to kill some monsters with brainless button smashing for next couple of hours go for this game. Its not that bad to be unplayable			"

I was sceptical about this young Dante but he's not bad at all, he still has his badassery. Everything in this game is awesome, platforming is much better than in the previous DMC episodes, it's still action packed, storyline is good... the only thing that bothered me a bit *spoiler alert* is the Hell and Heaven monsters, as you can't kill those monsters without the appropriate weapon, so you have to kill that minion with exactly that weapon, which isn't that much of a problem as they are pretty rare.All in all, I really recommend this game.

Anyone can mash buttons which is pefectly fine with me, but once you get the ""feel"" you will want to keep going. Really want to pull the trigger on the expansion. Can't believe I waited so long to play it!			"

												DmC: Devil May Cry exists in a really odd space.  On one hand, veterans of the DMC franchise are going to look down on it for it's simpler combat that doesn't offer fine control or complex, rewarding mechanics of games such as DMC 3 or DMC 4.  It is a significantly easier game and there is a lot less put into the fighting mechanics of the game itself.On the other hand, DmC: Devil May Cry offers is a refined experience that I think most people will enjoy!  Despite it's flaws when held up to it's predicesors,  DmC offers smooth combat and top-notch presentation.  The major criticism I'd offer are that the boss fights are boring, QTE-ridden, forgettable snore-fests.It's definitely not a bad game and as long as you are willing to remove expectations for DMC 5 from this title and accept it for what it is, it's a fine game by itself.

												8/10 Hey Everyone, I have to say when I first saw this game I was a little bit set back on buying it. But let me tell you that this has to be one of, if not THE BEST Devil May Cry to date! Fast pased action, Tons of new weapons at your disposal at any time during the game for tons of play styles and different combos, And I have to say once you get past the new Dante's look, He is no less of the old Dante. And he's honestly alot funnier then in the older games. And Honestly I would give this game a 10/10 if the ending of the game wasn't poorly made. If you love fast pased hack and slash games, with good graphics, awesome story, and the coolest protagonist in the world, then this is your game!!!			"

												I'm gonna start off by saying this was one of the best DMC games so far, and YES i've played all but 2 (no loss there). This game is so well crafted, i dont think i can really find a legitimate flaw in it or anything that was half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are three things that hit me hard with this game:Visuals:Let me go ahead and say that when i saw the original trailer for this game, i was as turned off as any of the other DMC bashers. I didnt like the direction they took with the character because Dante of old was such a lovable guy and his aesthetic had been well established. Now that i've played it, the only thing thats really that much different about him is the short hair and different jacket. SPOILERS... his hair becomes white over the course of the game anyway, and they manage to tie it into the story. Aside from that, every character and demon is not only believably realistic, but the things that aren't rooted in realism feel very creative and fresh. The environments in this game are STUNNING and kept me stopping to look at them constantly during my playthrough. Ninja Theory knows how to craft a beautiful world.Gameplay:Not much to say here because they essentially took what made the old games great and fine tuned it a little more. The gameplay is purely DMC, there should be no complaints. They even managed to get some fun platforming sections in the game that dont get in the way of the pacing of the game. Story:Dante's personality in this game wasn't as wacky and goofball this time around, and I am not exactly sure that it's a bad thing. Don't get me wrong, he had loads of one-liners that scratched that itch, but it definitely wasn't as comical as previous games. They toned it down just a bit so that they could tell a more compelling story... and they definitely managed that. This has to be, by far, the best DMC narrative so-far. Especially after DMC4, which was a yawn fest until Dante showed up to crack some jokes. This game's story is a bit on the EDGY side, but it's totally relevant to todays hot topics and it actually makes sense when you give it a chance. The characters feel real but interesting, where as in previous games there were always characters that just felt like flat cartoon personalities.I'm really hoping that there is a sequel in the mix and that the visual backlash didn't ruin it for Ninja Theory, this series is in capable hands once again and I can't wait for the next one to come out. I highly reccomend this game for DMC newcomers and veterans. Give it a chance and you wont regret it.10/10			"

												A fantastic reboot of the DMC series lead by Ninja Theory. If you have played Heavenly Sword, and enjoyed it, there is no reason not to pick this up. While the story is a pretty run-of-the-mill coming of age story, the combat is perfect. Fast, flowing, and frantic; this version of DMC is great for newcomers and old fans alike.			"

												Extremely fun fighting game. More actiony than the previous in the series. Combat  is smooth and satisfying. Controls and weapon combos are intuitive and taught very well. You really feel rewarded when you pull off amazing stunts. Visually, the game looks really good, but could have been cranked up more. Awesome music and character design. The story is basic, and isn't explored much at all... at one point I thought the story was going to get amped up, but they got lazy. Has some of the most memorable levels and design I've seen in a long time. Boss battles are awesome but way too easy and lack build-up and multiple attack patterns. Feels like the game gets dumbed down as it progresses. The final fight is also extremely unsatisfying and executed poorly. I really enjoyed this game for what it is. The DLC is good as well, with new environments and a different character with a unique (but similar fighting style.)			"

												I think DMC just may have been written by David Icke. The story plays out like one of his lectures. The game play itself reminds me of a lot of that newest Alice game. There's a lot of jumping on blocks suspended in mid air for a little bit then getting to a bigger platform where you fight a bunch of dudes then go back to jumping some more platforms and repeating the process. The game is very linear with some hidden things off to the sides. It's all been done before, but the story was really a lot of fun and I looked forward to seeing what happened next. The game took around 17 hours to finish.The combat is based on stringing combos of hits together and racking up points for beating enemies up with style. The Vergil's Downfall DLC was a let down. It is the epilogue to a story that didn't need one. The pacing of the main game is good and it reaches a satisfying conclusion. In the DLC, the cut scenes are done with a cheap hand-drawn animation that are a severe step down from the campaign and also the story of the DLC is a lot less fun. The whole epilogue just seemed pointless.  Just pass on the DLC. The main is a fun and I do recommend it.			"

												So as a DMC game it was kinda blah and didnt run the characters quite right feeling but then again its a reboot and all how you wanna take the changes to the core characters (or added there of). As a game its well done and nicely tuned for a refreshing crash course in stylish action. This game takes alot more liberty to make socio-polictical jabs (some quite blunt or otherwise hinting at real groups/services) and what-not and generally turns down  floaty feeling of the classic DMC games. Also i will say for all in all get the main dlc for a dark and otherwise cheaply done end content. Vergil was a rough not particularlly engaging character comparably and had some confusing restrictions but was worth playing through and through. Compared to 4 i will say it cranked out the level design and motives to explore and repeat much much better.			"

												The 5th title in the series was a very fun one. There have been a lot of arguments about this reboot. I've played all of the games (cept for 2) and enjoyed them. However i'm going to compare this one to the previous one and I can only say that they are back on the right track again.The 4th game was suffering from a very, in my opinion, unlikeable character  you had to play with half of the game. The other half of the game was playing as Dante, who had to backtrack through the same levels. Not a lot of fun for me there. Number 5 is a new start with a restyled Dante, gameplay wise it's incredibly solid, plenty of weapons, firearms to make combo's with. However, getting SSS ratings are rather easy to obtain, using the same move with certain weapons on bosses will give you a lot of points. A little dissapointing. They also added some more platforming elements, didn't bother me. The storyline amuses, the city Dante lives in is ruled by Mundus, a demon overlord (Also a restyled version of the very first badguy in the first DMC). The whole city and the plot has some very entertaining satire to it; The masses are controlled by television, energy drinks and nightclubs filled with narcisstic demons. And Dante is going to wipe the floor with all of those things.There are some other characters, like Dante's brother Vergil and a girl called Kat. Kat is rather forgetable, even if she is very prominent and is the damsel in distress. I couldn't really care for her. As for Vergil, if you have any knowledge about the DMC games you know how things are going down between him and Dante.Speaking of which, I also played the DLC Vergil's Downfall, that one is very subpar compared to the maingame; horrible animations, elements from the plot in the maingame are twisted around, the rating system is different and the gameplay has some faults in it.My rating would be:DMC 8.5/10Vergil's Downfall DLC 5/10 "

												The game has it's flaws, but as a character action game It's really well done. The combat's a shallow entry, but after you wade in it for a bit it begins to get deeper; The extra difficulties and DLC will have you coming back to experiment more and more. Though I highly suggest you ignore the ranking system. I commend Ninja Theory for taking the dive, though I do hope they get a better writer for the next game, if there's going to be one. If you still haven't made your decision and you're reading this, just think for a second. How many decent stylish action games does the PC market have? If you like those types of games adding this to your library won't hurt. Not the end all be all, but good for what it is.==============Long==============Where do I start with this game?In a Vacuum this game is a solid 7. ""Why a 7"" Is probably the question you're asking. Well for starters, the script; while workable and functional leaves something to be desired even though it gets you through the game. I know you've probably heard the outcry for the ""F*ck you-F*ck you"" back and forth between Dante and the Succubus; though I guess you could look at that  as Dante's such an♥♥♥♥♥that he has the innate ability to♥♥♥♥♥♥off demons without trying. No, being an♥♥♥♥♥is not necessarily a bad thing. Then comes the voice acting. I have to give it a pass simply because the only real cringe worthy lines in the reboot, won't scar your brain like the original (look up ""fill your dark soul with light"" on youtube, you'll see what I mean). The voicework is on par with the script. Passable, no stellar performances, some hitches here and there (hitches as in cringe-lines), but it's not bad. For an example of bad, look at the original resident evil, or Sonic Adventure. The combat is decent. Hell when mastered it's practically on par with previous games, though there are still things that I personally wish they kept. For one, royal guard is no more. That got replaced by the parry system. This system is good and bad, because you can use it intentionally to make enemies kill/damage themselves, but at the same time you'll get a bunch of free points just by accidentally parrying enemies you had no intention of parrying. The H/H weapon is just plain boring to use; effective against certain enemies, but still boring. Sorry but Beowulf was just too damn good to not miss it.Taunts are missing even though there's a free button that's not used while playing with Dante. This was a fun mechanic for funzies that is definitely missed. Another issue with combat is that it's so loose that when you try to cancel certain moves it causes conflict with the animations which leads to certain abusable bugs or Dante Jerking around. I honestly can't recall previous DMC's having this particular combat bug, though the ""fair play"" bug seems to be shared.What I mean by fair play is that enemies usually won't attack you unless they're in the camera's view, or are already in the middle of an attack when the player points the camera away from them. Though sometimes while looking at enemies they behave as if the camera isn't looking at them and they'll just stand there in one spot, confused. This is usually fixed by turning the camera away and turning it back, but at the same time, why would a player want to do that? >.> This Dante is practically a more solid version of Nero (DMC4). Take note I only say this because I personally found Nero boring/too easy to play with the tools he had. Others will have their own opinions of him.Compared to previous DMC's the story here is more focused on the main character. Where Dante's given a history. Where as with the original series (as far as the games were concerned) was more a history of Sparda and Dante is simply cleaning up his dad's leftovers. Granted, the story in Vergil's downfall DLC is as anime as it could get, but still the gameplay offered in that DLC makes up for it. I mean I personally found Vergil more fun to play.The music works for the game. I can't complain about it at all.			"

One of the best games I've played and the PC are lacking in this type of games.

												DmCThe Look - The game's visuals are all top notch. The developers were clearly able to put a lot of time and effort into the environments and character designs. Dante and his cohorts all have a unique look and interesting attire. The game received some flack during its reveal for ditching the classic white-haired Dante but I think that there is a strong, fun, and unique visual style that permeates the experience. You will see some recycled enemy designs but there are enough minor differences between types that I never felt bored by their appearance. The main visual treat is the environment, which has a habit of transforming as you move through it. Walls rise and fall and floors will turn into stairs, pits, and stepping stones, as familiar environments often get twisted into a more hellish version of their former selves.The Sound - No real issues with the audio quality. That said, the music tracks might not be for everyone. I don't have prior experience but I felt that the musical stylings of Combichrist had the potential to be somewhat polarizing. If you don't like heavy metal or death metal (or precious metals?) you might not be a fan of the audio tracks. However, I'm not a huge fan of the genre but I was never really put off by it so I think most people will be fine here. Great use of sound effects with some nice visceral slices, slams, and crunches during combat. Additionally, the voice acting, which you'll be exposed to frequently, is very strong on all fronts.The Gameplay - Despite some claims of oversimplification, I think this game is tons of fun to play. It follows the basic 3rd person action trends with all of the combos, dodges, and power moves that you'd expect. What makes DmC stand out a bit is the variety of weapons and the diversity of each. Heavy, Medium, Light, and Ranged weapons are all on display and all offer something fun and new when unlocked. The game's grading system (a genre staple) is also a fun way to compete against others and yourself while trying to unlock things like concept art and new costumes. There are a number of hidden collectibes that can be found in the game, but these often veer into the dangerous territory of tedium when you try to seek them all out. Also, despite the fast and fun combat, there are some levels that feel overly long or overly short so don't expect that each new chapter will take the same amount of time as the last one.The Story - DmC's story is a simple but fun affair. You are Dante, half-angel/half-demon, and you're out for revenge on the demon who orphaned you and is currently trying to take over the world. There are some fun twists and turns along the way but nothing jaw dropping or genre defining. While Dante's brash attitude may seem a bit obnoxious, the character grew on me and by the end of the game I found myself eagerly awaiting his next quip or shocking turn of phrase. The narrative has just enough momentum to keep you interested in learning more about Dante's past and to see what steps he'll take to get his revenge. You'll never be moved to tears, but you'll probably get a few laughs out of this yarn.Other Thoughts - There's not a lot to say here. This is not a game of great thematic depth or complexity. The combat, on the other hand, has both in spades. I think this is a great first chapter in what will hopefully become a new series of games. Oftentimes, 3rd person action games will lose their footing somewhere. The story may be obtuse or boring, the combos may be too tough to pull off, the enemies might be too easy or difficult, etc. DmC does a great job of walking this line and not overstaying its welcome. Score - 4/5 (A solid game. Genre fans should love it, while others will probably really like it. Check it out!)			"

												This new Dante feels like an old friend.I'll admit, I was skeptical of this series re-launch, especially when it was first announced back in 2010 and the first promotional image was this: http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120923082161/devilmaycry/images/1/12/Dante_dmc_2010.jpgMy gut reaction to seeing that image back then was ""You just ruined Dante and the DMC franchise."" and to an extent, that gut reaction sort of stayed with me until I finally had a chance to try the game for myself.Thankfully, the end result was far from my initial fears.DmC does a good job of managing to reinvent the so-called ""origin"" story of Dante and Vergil, and yet by and large once you manage to get used to the new face and very different attitude (at least at first) of the new Dante, you'll discover that the gameplay itself is nothing short of the classic DMC style you've come to know.Controls have been somewhat re-imagined in a way that neither takes too long to get used to nor feels terribly unfamiliar. By and large they are handled well, and a lot of the familiar signature aspects that the franchise is known for are still here as well.For example, orbs and the time statues for ""shopping"" are present here. Dante still has Ebony and Ivory and they still get unlimited ammo. Signature abilities like Stinger make their return with a new control schemata. Devil trigger is of course also present, though it works in a slightly different way than in most of the past entries, it nonetheless manages to impress just as it always has.While I did have some initial complaints about Dante's voice acting (the lines seemed really flat early on in the game) once you give it some more time it fleshes itself out better, and that also gives you a chance to get adjusted to the new Dante as well.And it IS an adjustment. Gone is the super confident whimsical and snarky don't-take-life-too-seriously Dante of yore, for the most part. This new Dante is younger, more apathetic and less enthusiastic, but to an extent this new attitude is plot related as well, and for what it's worth I think it is a convincing way to show character growth and progression.Gradually as Dante begins to open his eyes to the situation around him through the plot events, he starts becoming more empathetic, and discovers his own true nature in the process.I won't spoil the details too much, but it was good to see his character maturing over the course of the game. And while I do feel like he never reached the same height on the badass meter that classic Dante manages to capture, by the time all is said and done it's clear to see he's squarely on his way to becoming more like his platinum haired alter ego.Take away from this what you will, but if you're willing to brave the initial storm and wait for the seas to calm, as far as the new Dante goes, you'll see this is another great entry in the DMC series. It takes a bit to get used to the changes, but change can be good sometimes.			"

												I couldn't tell you if this is a good game or not, because it's only playable to a very select few of us humans. The very first time I launched it after activation, it was one hell of an adventure. I absolutely loved it (take into consideration that I haven't played any of the previous DmC games).Had to force myself to bed, for the greater good. However, up until this day I haven't been able to get into the game. It insta-crashes on launch, consider yourself blessed if you got to see the capcom screen. Brave as I was, I decided to wander around the world wide web, surely there will be a solution out there! And yes there was one solution, then again, deleting system 32 gets rid of most of your problems....doesn't it?			"

												A reboot of the well-known devil may cry series, DmC is a game which takes things to a whole new level, with new weapons with ""angel"" and ""devil"" alignments and with different usages and more. The visuals are a huge step-up, the graphics in this game are pleasing to the eyes and the game does not require high-end specs to run, the gameplay is smooth and fun to play around with the different moves and combos you can execute to rack up style points (Side note: The style counter is different from the original games), the story is great as you play a younger dante who is much more reckless and violent who is fighting for mankind and to in turn restore his forgotten memories, soundtrack and ambience is more of a rock and roll, violent kind of world you are thrown into. Overall, it is a really great game (well it is made by ninja theory), 8.5/10			"

												On a 10-point scale, DmC is a solid 9. I got into the series some years ago after playing the third game. Comments by DMC purists sparked my interest in this... and they don't know on what they're missing out.I think the story is great, there's some character development, the soundtrack is awesome and the gameplay is very satisfying. I unlocked all 48 main achievements in a three-week span (about 60 hours playing and I have yet to buy the Vergil DLC) and I'm still not tired of playing it. The game is definitely lengthy and it does have replay value. Bloody Palace mode is really fun. While the game's difficulty has been toned down to appeal to less skilled players, it's still DMC to the core, and the higher difficulty levels shouldn't disappoint.On the other hand, almost all bosses are uninspired. Only the first and the last ones felt like true bosses. They're way too static (apart from the aforementioned ones) and humanized. I was hoping for more beast-like ones. All guns are useless and a couple weapons didn't satisfy my inner demon slayer, like Aquila. While Eryx was good, it was the weapon I used the least. Despite the flaws, this kicks♥♥♥♥♥and I can't wait for a sequel. If you buy this, you won't regret it.			"

												This game is highly addictive and its incredibly fun to play. I understand how other devil may cry fans may miss the feel of the old series as well as the 'old' dante. But hey its an alternate take on the series just something to change things up abit. Dante at first glance may look like some sort of emo, but he does bear some revelance to the original dante such as the rough rebellous nature, the secret compassionate side and of course the badassery of the original Dante. DmC is a good reboot but i guess the classic series prevails because of the avantage of nostalgia and being the classic.			"

												Being a huge dmc fan since the first game and i have beat them all several times each i was not sure about the new reboot but after playing it i have fell madly back into love with the series!! the graphics are beautiful the gameplay is smooth and brutal combat is epic as hell music is beyond badass and the story is good !! The new Dante took me a while to like he looks kind like emo rock star lol having said that all they really did is modernize a old character for the new generation his attitude and back story is far more darkafter beating the game several times i feel that this game is more of a prequel than a reboot it explains why his hair is white and explains why the world has demons walking around and explains why he becomes a demon hunter. when in the original he just eat pizza and be like ooh yap kill me some demons the old Dante makes me think kind like dead pool in his his attitude the new Dante is more realistic to me as the son of Sparta killer of demon kings!! Its a Epic Game i found my heart racing and gripping my gamepad the whole time i would pick it up if your a hack n slash fan or dmc fanboy must try!!!			"

												I've played this to death on Xbox 360 and took the plunge on PC and notice a huge difference. The graphical difference isn't that noticeable, although the PC version runs in 1080P and does look better than console, it's not a ""holy crap!"" jump in quality. The real reason to get this again on PC is the fact that it runs 60FPS vs. 30 on the console releases.Simply put, the game is smoother than a baby's♥♥♥♥♥now. The game feels much better to play and this is the only version I will play again. DmC on PC is the definitive version. My only gripe is that this, and other Capcom  games on Steam, are way over priced. If they go on sale, jump on it. I got this during the summer sale along with the DLC for peanuts. I would NOT pay full price for this game if you already own it. Hell, even if you don't, $50 for a game from 2013 is ridiculous when the console versions are in bargain bins at Best Buy.			"

												Haters gonna hate the new Dante, but nevertheless, this is mechanically far better than it's predecessors. Gone are the stupid resident evil style static cameras, gone is the need to lock-on to foes in order to effectively track them. Gone are the derptastic controls that made this franchise a nightmare to newcomers. Now you can actually CONTROL the camera, dish out the pain in copious amounts, and feel good doing so! So what if the new Dante is a derf at first? This game gets a few things wrong, but gets a lot of things right. Even though DMC5 will feature classic Dante, I certainly hope Capcom takes some notes from DmC, as this is how you do that genre properly; Easy to learn, difficult to master.I also expect classic Dante to have a retort for new Dante's 'white hair' wisecrack... because Dante would totally bash other versions of himself. (That joke really annoyed fans of the series despite that being a very Dante thing to do... which makes me sad)			"

												Don't let my hours fool you. I've completed this game on multiple modes on the PS3.DmC Devil May Cry is a reboot of the Devil May Cry series. Telling the story of Dante's origin story. Retaining it's fast, fluid combat and bringing us a new Dante, (I prefer the old Dante, new one is kind of a prick). His attitude is more immature but I suppose that would be fine since the game is telling his origin story. At times it may feel repititive, but a vast array of weapons will keep you trying out different combos and combat styles.This game's storyline isn't amazing, but it isn't bad either. Characters are pretty well acted and the voices are great.If you're into to action hack 'n' slash games, then buy this.9/10			"

												I want to start out by saying i have never played Devil May Cry. So I would be the general audiance that recived the wow factor when checking out the trailers. i Main character dante is a complete badass. i love the way they portray him as not giving a ♥♥♥♥, but they don't do it too much to where it looks fake. Thery also give him a very realistic personality in regards to how he decides to help his brother vergil. he doesn't act like ""so what if the worlds is ruled by demons"" i he is wor willing to help to save the people. Showing his personalioty twards the people of earth			"

												Don't listen to the haters.DmC is by no means perfect. I don't think anyone will ever recreate the magic that was DMC3, but for all the negative hype that the game received, DmC really does its best to impress.Mechanically, the game is fantastic. For veterans of the series, it is a breath of fresh air. Dante retains all his abilities (similar to his appearance in DMC4), and through five different toggle buttons he's able to quickly access any of his tools. Perhaps most notably, almost all of the tools in DmC are different and useful. Each attack sequence has a unique purpose for which it is best-suited, and while you'll probably come out with some favorites that you rely on, you'll almost certainly use every tool in your kit to play on the harder difficulty modes.Also, DmC is hard! For people just wanting to experience the story, the easier difficulties are quite easy. However, even the Nephilim difficulty is fairly hard on one's first time through the game. Series vets who want a challenge will find it, and unlike DMC3, the DMD difficulty is pretty fun and rewards aggressive play rather than the tedium of DMC3.The story is a mixed bag, but it is two stories in one. The surface story -- the one most people comment on -- is rather contrite. It's a story of revolutionaries fighting against evil governments and corporations, and makes a lot of overt social commentary on modern culture. DmC throws this message in your face over and over, and honestly I was turned off by it. Fortunately, there's another story behind that one.The real story of DmC is its commentary on freedom versus order, or chaos versus slavery. It's also a story about the little people, and not about the godlike characters (Dante, Vergil, Mundus) who move the plot. In the end, even though one side does triumph, it is supposed to be a hollow victory, as though something of great importance was lost. DmC has a lot of message beneath its very blatant and shallow surface, but because the social commentary is so loud and obvious, it tends to be obscured.Perhaps most noteworthy about the story is that, other than his appearance, Dante is still Dante. While he's young and a bit inexperienced -- allowing him to grow as a character  -- he retains all the elements we're used to with Dante. He's a brash, arrogant jerk with a heart of gold, fundamentally the same Dante we've known and loved.			"

												Incredible game. At the beginning I didn't feel attracted by the characters or story, but with two hours of gameplay I totally dived in the game! The art direction and soundtrack are so awesome that you can feel yourself inside the game in a level that the previous ones couldn't reach. The ""new"" Dante is a little ♥♥♥♥♥y, but later things get more interesting, giving epic boss fights and a more involving Dante. Recommend to everyone who didn't give it a chance.			"

Maybe that is right, maybe this should have been a spinoff, rather then a reboot. Myself I have never been too deep into the DMC cannon, all I can say is that it does stand up as a separate entity.

												I can appreciate the complaints people have about this game.  Sure you could look at it, and then look at DMC4 and say this is obviously a better game, and it is.But that's because it's not eight years old, and it doesn't hold to a twenty year old rulebook.DmC did a few things right,  Made massive progress in the way of saving, weapon design, etc.On the downside, it was also a massive step backwords in terms of core gameplay.  Sure old DMC is the agrivating kind of difficult, but DmC just hands you victory.  I wouldn't call it a button masher, but I did press one button an awful lot.It's fun though.			"

												I love this game :D.I think the best of this game is its combat, it has many weapons and many combos and still it's very easy to remember each one, and also, the game effectively teaches what's the purpose of all the weapons.In a single playthrough I ended using effectively all the weapons and most of the combos. In most hack & slash I end using only few combos and few weapons (usually I don't replay games and I play in normal difficulty). So, this combat is very easy to learn but still deep, and that's awesome.A great thing of this game is the level visual design, it remember me Alice: Madness Returns but with action music instead of thrilling music.Lastly, recently my GPU stopped working and I have to survive for a while using an Intel HD 4000 graphic card, and I can play this game with ultra graphics at 1366x768 with 30 FPS without frame drops. I'm very surprised of that.			"

												A very enjoyable entry into the Devil May Cry series, even if not as conventionally brow-beating as the rest of the series.Dante's characteristic bravado and wit are somewhat subdued here, and he is much less campy and over-the-top. And yet, I find it an enjoyable break by providing some much-needed character development.While I was very skeptical at first, the gameplay and art style went through a few revamps and I was sold. When I began playing, I was immediately engrossed in the drop-in gameplay and the interesting new mechanics borrowed from DMC4's Nero and his Devil Bringer.While a stark contrast to the previous entries in the serious, I would recommend DmC to fans of the series and newcomers alike, as long as you don't hold your breath for some of the same old.Critiques I do have are mostly based on the style change (which I got over) and the ease of difficulty, which seems less masochistic than the more current entries.

												DmC has been added to my 'guilty pleasure' list of games.+ The environments of Limbo shift and change for a unique and unstable feel. + The controls are tight, and the flow from one move to another can be learned rather easily. - The dialogue is somewhat weak or downright cheesy at times, + The motion capture for said dialogue is AMAZING. I don't have much for gripes about this game, minus the simplistic/edgy quips between characters, and that has nothing to do with the gameplay itself. So yeah. Solid game!This does full justice to the name, even if Neo-Dante isn't entirely what the crowd wanted.			"

The gameplay has a generous learning curve, the graphics are beautiful, and the social commentary on the state of humanity being ignorant, brainwashed, and self-destructive is spot-on.There are a few things I take exception to, like the platforming, the dialogue that feels like a cross between a teenage drama and an R-rated suspense movie, and the reestablishing of Dante's and Vergil's origins as Nephilim. Other than a few hiccups, I won't throw shade at DmC: Devil May Cry. I enjoy playing it.			"

												Not many people are happy at this series getting a reboot, but since Capcom wrote itself into a corner as of DMC4, they don't have a choice. That being said, this game is worth a try. While some of the dorkyness that came to define the series has been toned down, the gameplay remains top notch, matched only by the enchanting Bayonetta. If you played the past DMC games solely for the story, then I don't know what to tell you. BUt if it was the gameplay that kept you coming back, then this game doesn't disappoint.The series needed a reboot, and this is an amazing attempt at that. Its not the DMC we all played back on our PS2s, but it is a refreshing take on the characters with the same classic gameplay that made this series a success. It deserves a chance from any ""fan"".

												This a rewrite, having spent more time with the game now my opinion of it has changed quite a bit.If you were a fan of the last four Devil May Cry games, you'll probably love this. In this retelling of Dante's origin story, a lot of the combat elements of it's predecessors has been brought here and refined to near perfection, something Ninja Theory is very good at. However the art style and the personality of the protagonist, Dante has been changed dramatically. He is less a facetious, care free, badass demon hunter from DMC 1, 2 and 4 and more the irresponsible punk with demon powers from 3, but somehow more annoying and crass. There is a point early in the game (which I personally do NOT appreciate) where Dante wanders through a circus or fair and through circumstances a wig very similar from the hairstyle and colour the old Dante wore lands on his hair, and he throws it off in disgust. Overall, I would give this an 8/10. It IS a great game, however some of the direct insults thrown at the older games, intentional or not are off putting to me as a fan of the series.			"

												Basically this game, as many have noticed after a few minutes, is just a bad imitation of the Devil May Cry saga. Combos, controls, Devil Tigger, characters, story, level design are all different.Defining it as a bad imitation is not, however, a way of telling that it is, also, a bad game. Despite differences, some gameplay approaches are enjoyable, like the possibility of using the entire arsenal at Dante's disposal. Let's just say it's a decent action game that expected to be dragged to the success through the use of a popular franchise, or at least for the most part. If we pass above all of this we have in our hands a pretty funny 10 hours action game. Gameplay is rough in some ways (automatic lock-on and an awful Devil Trigger, for example) but with good possibilities of being developed in the future in a better game with, let's hope, an own core and soul (and better story/characterization).

												Game is REBOOT NOT PREQUEL, the soundtracks are amazing the levels are very unique. Storyline is great but dante has lost a bit of his personality but the boss fights are really fun in this game. Bob Barbas ""Just do'in gods work"" very hard boss :S. Monsters in this game have really changed from the first Devil May Cry in 2001. They are so much harder in upped difficulties you will find doing normal monsters worse then bosses themselves considering some of the monsters will hit you for a 1/3 or 1/2 of your max life (even with extensions). Great game overall going to buy #4 and hopefully they redo #2 and #3 and just as good.			"

While the main problem was its name DmC---I still love the characteristic in DmC4 cause that white-hair-man is RRREALLY COOL! But never give this game a negative comment just because Dante is not that cool, Instead, its flexible and plentiful actions should bring you extremely enough enjoyment.

												Pros: + Easy, yet satisfying Combat. A bit different than in the originals, but good nonetheless.+ Music is fairly good. Gets you in the mood for hacking&slashing. Fits the tone of the level.+ Artwork & Level design is great.+ Great pacing: Platforming introduced and works in between fights.+- Monster Design on bosses: great, normal enemies: meh/alright.  Cons:- Dante and the whole game feels a bit too try-hard. A lot of 'f*ck you's' and 'bigger d*ck' jokes, yet all fall flat.- Seasoned original DMC players breeze through the game on harder difficulties. Went in on hard difficulty, never used one healing item in the playthrough and almost every level i completed on a S-SSS rating.- NO LOCK-ON IN BATTLE!- Story was underwhelming and felt a bit too 'They Live' movie to me(please go watch it, it's a classic). Seems like the team tried to hard to put in a (hidden) message into the story. Establishment vs freedom-fighters-esque.- Few weapons- Camera issues in tight quarters. Sometimes camera would not move 180degrees.- MUNDUS. What a letdown!Still, i recommend the game if you want a fun hack&slasher. But don't expect the same as the originals. I played DMC1, 3 & 4, but they each had better fighting mechanics imo.			"

												Despite the great art and visual design of this game, sooner or later you're going to get tired of the console tropes.  The worst are the bosses where you have to follow stupid patterns and mash specific buttons at exactly the same time.  If that's what you want in a video game then you'll love this.  I'm half way through and I'm probably going to put it down because of the fights. Also, the camera and controls are wonky so you constantly fall of edges, fight the wrong oponents, etc.  Too bad...Ok, that was written late at night in a fit of frustration...actually, the game is a lot of fun, a little short but if you're in to the challenges/secret room things, it lasts longer. Definitely buy on sale, not sure about full price...			"

												DmC tries too hard. ""Dante is cool in this one,"" it says, ""see these girls? He totally had sex with her last night. Sex is cool, right?""""And look at the bad guys,"" it gushes, ""they're metaphors for corporate sleazebags who try to keep society dumb and obedient. Enslavement through faux (Fox?) news and sugary drinks! Get it?""""You're the Resistance. You're standing up to the demons (corporate overlords) and insulting them in their faces! Ever wanted to say '♥♥♥♥ you' to the Man? Dude, we have you covered, there's so many '♥♥♥♥ you' lines in this game that you're going to feel empowered as all♥♥♥♥♥♥""There's the seed for a good plot in there somewhere, buried beneath piles of awkward dialogue, oversimple characterization and the promotion of social-commentary-that-should-be-subtext into neon-lettered, 50-foot high signage. Dante isn't really likeable, the storytelling is awkward and I was embarrassed several times watching really badly-written dialogue exchanges. Worse, I found myself cheering for Virgil, the more put-together brother who bothers thinking ahead to what's going to happen after he and Dante bring down the Evil Overlord. What's wrong with being the guy in charge of picking up the pieces after the world is turned upside down, again? I guess it's bad because DmC has a very marked punk ideology and becoming the authorities goes against that?So why do I recommend DmC? The gameplay is pretty good, and that should be the main reason for you to buy this. Not as good as Devil May Cry 3, but then what is?			"

												For a reboot/prequel, DMC checks all the right boxes when it comes to nods from the original series, refresh on game mechanics and overall introduction to those new to the series. I really enjoyed the gameplay but that was not surprising comging from the Ninja Theory team as all of their games have been strong in that department. What I did not care for in this game was the camera controls. There were many instances where the camera was stuck in a corridor or on a wall and I was not able to rotate it without moving my position (which sometimes this was very difficult due to the current camera angle I was in). Overall, not the worst third person camera angle ever, and compared to the rest of the series, it really wasn't unexpected. However, being made in the Unreal engine, I had hoped for better. Ninja Theory did an amazing job uitilizing the rendering power of the Unreal Engine as the levels were not just physically beautiful, but the way the environment reacted to your presence was something that I really had not seen done in previous games. The use of the environment shaders and particle effects in this game were astounding. I really felt like I was playing in an extended scene from Constantine with a heavy metal thrash soundtrack. Definitely recommend this game to those who have enjoyed the other Devil May Cry games, however they should be prepared for Dante's mannerisms to be different than the previous games, but in a fresh sense more inline with modern youth rebellion behavior. New people to the series should also like this game if they like games like God of War or the like. Since it is a prequel/reboot, no knowledge of the previous games stories are necessary to enjoy this game.			"

												Great spiritual successor to the previous series!  The gameplay is there, but the characters and story are wholly reimagined.  Those who have played the originals will find the gameplay to have familiar control schemes combined with a refreshingly unique angel-demon weapon system.For reference: my personal favorite of the series is DMC4, followed by DMC1.  I hated the remake of Dante, and disapproved of everything I saw in trailers.  However, after playing it, I see why they pursued their creative differences from the original team. While I do not think this exceeds the quality of 4, I do think it's an amazing game and is one of the best in the series, and a great start to a new Dante universe.			"

I understand people's frustration from this game since its a reboot however i feel like they retained some of the key elements of what makes Dante, well... Dante. Not only does the combat feel so much more lively than any other DmC game (imo), the visuals are stunning and very tense with an incredible sound track makes this a must have for any fan of the series. This is coming from a guy who finds games hard to complete as i get bored quickly and lose satisfaction. This game has such a good intro and first hour gameplay; i was addicted.			"

												Note: Only consider buying it on sale. I barely recommend it and bought it on sale to begin with.I'm a bit on the fence with this one but I don't regret the purchase so I guess it's a recommend. Ultimately, it's a mediocre game with a handful of redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, it's more of a linear, 3rd person adventure game than a hack and slash. In other words, don't expect the normal Devil May Cry.Cons:The story has some political subtext HAMMED into it. The presentation of said story is also pretty bad with some very trashy lines filled with profanity to make it seem edgy or something.If you are the type of person who analyzes games for their design, you'll notice quickly that the game is a compromise between the combat centric design of the first Devil May Cry games and something like Legend of Zelda/God of War. The result is a somewhat run-of-the-mill combat system, somewhat stale exploration, and similarly stale platforming.Jump canceling is easier. This means that you can do stupid stuff like gain infinite height using the hook+JC combo with one enemy. It looks silly/game-breaking and is stupidly easy to pull off.Metal music that doesn't sound that great for metal. It sounds like 2nd rate indie metal. Weapons seem to fit very specific purposes against specific enemies rather than opening up options for player creativity. Furthermore, some of them don't even have that distinct of a behavior, making them mechanical variations of a more limited set of weapons.The lack of a targeting system makes the controls feel pretty awkward.Pros:It tries to experiment with some mechanics to varying degrees of success like how you can pull to and pull in enemies at will unlike Nero's buster which was limited to enemy type.Jump canceling is easier. This is also more welcoming to newer players.The levels look pretty impressive and the color oversaturation is a nice mix up. It does get in the way at times but it wasn't nearly as offensive as some people claim in my experience. I never felt sick or anything and I feel ill if I play CS:GO too much :/Lots of weapons at least keeps it fresh.Lots of secrets to find.Enemies give very clear tells. The dial up combo system that has been standard in Devil May Cry is now aided by a light up effect, letting the player combo more consistently.Story has it's moments that made me chuckle for various reasons.Faster rendering/loading times than Devil May Cry 4. Also, it's a finished game unlike Devil May Cry 4 and not an awful port like Devil May Cry 3.If you're fine with a B-movie story and a decent chunk of optional exploration and mandatory platforming, DMC: Devil May Cry is a game worth picking up considering the amount of content and decent amount of interesting exploration.

												Pros:DMC has a fluid combat system that allows you to switch between any of your weapons mid-comboControls are fairly easy to pick upFun platforming sections between Hack and Slash fightsCons:Dante's New look/attitudeNo cut scene where dante surfs on a demon around his office, guns blazing, with a slice of pizza hanging out his mouth and a scythe protruding from his chest.Conclusion:Overall I enjoyed the game, but I hated the new Dante. I grew up with the Devil May Cry series through Junior High and High School and I was looking forward to seeing the pizza loving demon hunter return with his cheesy one liners. Instead I got an angsty, barely-legal, frat boy who lives in a super sketchy looking mobile home who also happens to have Nephilim powers. I feel that the developers tried too hard to make the game appeal to a mature audience by putting the word ""f**k"" in the dialogue every chance they got. Also the levels are really psychadellic (not sure on the spelling of that).Over all I think they tried to make the game more appealing to a casual western audience instead of the die hard fans of the original series, but I still enjoyed playing the game minus the part where a pregnant woman and her child get shot. Yeah. That's a thing (and it could have totally not been included).			"

												Fantastic game from start to finish.  Beautiful visuals, good storyline, good voice acting, great playability, good replay potential and music from one of my favorite bands of all time Nosia.  I was a decent fan of the first Devil May Cry, but not enough of one to play any of the other follow up games.  This is not a follow up game, it's a complete reboot and in my opionion absolutely destroys the first one in terms of being a great game.  It's as if God of War and Silent Hill had a baby.  If you're a fan of the God of War or orignal Devil May Cry franchise, this game is must.			"

												I've always wanted to play Devil May Cry(DmC) games. Growing up, I was a Nintendo fanboy, so I exclusively used Nintendo consoles and systems(don't ask lol) so I didn't play a lot of the cool games on XBOX or PS2. Naturally-- I had to pick this game up when it went on sale. I found that the game is fun and action-packed, just what I'd expect from a hack n' slash title. The story is intriguing and has kept me interested. So far, so good. My only complaint is that (for me) there are too many things going on weapon-wise. The controls take a little getting used to, which is expected, I guess. The whole Angel/Demon dual-weapon-system-thing is a little too much for me. I think it might actually make me a better  multi-tasker though, so that can't hurt haha.Overall 7.5/10 "

The guy is a complete badass and the story is actually pretty good. The camera views are what I love. It always stays on your character, all though you have control over the camera.

												DmC tries too hard. ""Dante is cool in this one,"" it says, ""see these girls? He totally had sex with her last night. Sex is cool, right?""""And look at the bad guys,"" it gushes, ""they're metaphors for corporate sleazebags who try to keep society dumb and obedient. Enslavement through faux (Fox?) news and sugary drinks! Get it?""""You're the Resistance. You're standing up to the demons (corporate overlords) and insulting them in their faces! Ever wanted to say '♥♥♥♥ you' to the Man? Dude, we have you covered, there's so many '♥♥♥♥ you' lines in this game that you're going to feel empowered as all♥♥♥♥♥♥""There's the seed for a good plot in there somewhere, buried beneath piles of awkward dialogue, oversimple characterization and the promotion of social-commentary-that-should-be-subtext into neon-lettered, 50-foot high signage. Dante isn't really likeable, the storytelling is awkward and I was embarrassed several times watching really badly-written dialogue exchanges. Worse, I found myself cheering for Virgil, the more put-together brother who bothers thinking ahead to what's going to happen after he and Dante bring down the Evil Overlord. What's wrong with being the guy in charge of picking up the pieces after the world is turned upside down, again? I guess it's bad because DmC has a very marked punk ideology and becoming the authorities goes against that?So why do I recommend DmC? The gameplay is pretty good, and that should be the main reason for you to buy this. Not as good as Devil May Cry 3, but then what is?			"

That combat system coupled with the environments they crafted really what I come to this game for. I just love the look of the game.

Dmc fans will mostly say it's the worst thing ever i think you guys should judge it on it's own which is the better mindset for this game. The story in the game is decent but forgettable now I did like how they re did the origin for dontah and no i don't hate this new dante he is a differant dante i say and i think he is ok. Gameplay is a blast the sword combat is well done and the platforming is really fun and it works now. Yes the game is somewhat easy and yes it may be stream lined but I don't care. I also like the music mostly from combi christ noisia is eh. Now give this game a chance for once now i will say this Metal gear rising is way better but DmC is still really good. I reccomend this for new dmc players honestly.8.5/10 really fun and worth the cash I payed for it.			"

												Pros: + Easy, yet satisfying Combat. A bit different than in the originals, but good nonetheless.+ Music is fairly good. Gets you in the mood for hacking&slashing. Fits the tone of the level.+ Artwork & Level design is great.+ Great pacing: Platforming introduced and works in between fights.+- Monster Design on bosses: great, normal enemies: meh/alright.  Cons:- Dante and the whole game feels a bit too try-hard. A lot of 'f*ck you's' and 'bigger d*ck' jokes, yet all fall flat.- Seasoned original DMC players breeze through the game on harder difficulties. Went in on hard difficulty, never used one healing item in the playthrough and almost every level i completed on a S-SSS rating.- NO LOCK-ON IN BATTLE!- Story was underwhelming and felt a bit too 'They Live' movie to me(please go watch it, it's a classic). Seems like the team tried to hard to put in a (hidden) message into the story. Establishment vs freedom-fighters-esque.- Few weapons- Camera issues in tight quarters. Sometimes camera would not move 180degrees.- MUNDUS. What a letdown!Still, i recommend the game if you want a fun hack&slasher. But don't expect the same as the originals. I played DMC1, 3 & 4, but they each had better fighting mechanics imo.			"

												I enjoy this reboot more than the original series - it plays a lot like Bayonetta, although I personally prefer Bayonetta.Basically the game is about performing stylish combos. In this way it is a lot like a rhythm game or even an extreme sports game like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater in the sense that your main goal (other than beating levels and not dying) is to link together seamless combos.Don't be disheartened if you suck at this game at first - I really did. It makes great use of all of the buttons on the controller (I played with an Xbox 360 controller). You must be constantly messing with the shoulder buttons and using them in tandem with ABXY as the shoulder buttons change your weapons on the fly when you're holding them. It's a system that was difficult for me to get used to, but after about four hours I was handling it pretty well.The main game doesn't take very long to beat, but the fun of it is being able to play the game again on harder difficulties. The main difficulty is not very hard, and I rarely died. But as you get into the higher difficulties that are unlocked as you beat previous difficulties the game tests your ability to quickly think up smart combos and understand how to deal with each enemy. Aside from the gameplay, the game has a fantastic presentation and a decent story. The story is predictable and bland, but it serves the game and it is satisfying when you finally get to take down the games main bad dude. The presentation is wonderful - really cool colors, especially when you take the contrast between the ""real world"" and ""limbo"" into consideration, which I think was intentional. The real world is really depressing and bland, but limbo is ridiculous and colorful. Very cool game and I highly recommend it now that it's cheaper.			"

												Well..I just finished this game. I always was wondering why people were bashing Modern Day Dante so much and the only thing that I saw that was annoying was his personality. He just didn't have his usual crazy "" I can take on the world"" personality that we all grew up with in the before gamesThe gameplay was great, the storyline was interesting..it was just hard to put this game down.

												An above average hack 'n slash that was marketed so poorly that people thought it was an ""edgy and gritty"" game that had a message, which resulted in horrible sales and a permanent stain on what should have been another high note in one of the most original series of our time.DMC: Devil May Cry is not a grimdark trek through Dante's psyche, nor is it about him going to prison and becoming emo. This game is a retelling of DMC. This time, instead of a castle filled with enemies that reek of Resident Evil, it's topped to the brim with color, personality, and attitude. Granted, that attitude is extremely childish and on-the-nose, but that adds to it's charm.This is the perfect game to turn your brain off to, plus a great action game to boot, but it's not a DMC game by any means. Vergil is there, Ebony and Ivory are there, and Rebellion is there, but this is no Devil May Cry. If you can get past that and take this game for the goofy, vibrant game that it is, then you'll have a blast.Oh, and it's a little easy.			"

												There is no denying for the fact that the new Dante was not a well established protagonist. Although the developer Ninja Theory might slightly missed their aim for the moon, they definitely landed themselves among the stars. DMC : Devil May Cry is without doubt a game that has been well thought of from its mechanics, all the way to its overall design. This is a reboot done right.DMC : Devil May Cry lets you play as Dante, an angel and demon hybrid that lost his memories from early childhood and possesses the ability to travel in-between worlds called Limbo, a twisted alternatives of the real world. In this world, every secrets, lies and deceit of the powerful, evil (literally) bank CEO that controls the economy are exposed, but only Dante are able to see them. Experience as Dante teams up with a splinter group as they tries to send the devil back into corporate hell (literally. okay I should stop saying that).If the summary of the story sounds somewhat ridiculous to you, trust me when I say that the story was delivered flawlessly in the game. I do not know how the developers able to achieve it, but they did it.Review Summary -You should forgive this game for its :- Majority of the characters in the game are not likeable to some degree, but at least their motives are deep enough to give them a bit of character.- If you ended up hated listening to the new Dante when he is talking, you could always mute the sound. No big deal, come on.- PC controls can be difficult to master, but god bless the option to be able to remap the keys. So you could find the control sets that suits you.You should LOVE this game for its :- EXCELLENT FULL BODY MOCAP. The in game cinematics was well made, and the excellent mocap contributes a lot for its delivery in storytelling. Their facial expressions is extremely lifelike.- EXCELLENT GAMEPLAY AND COMBAT ANIMATIONS - Good job for Ninja Theory that chooses fully keyframed animations  just like the old DMC. Keyframed animations (compared to dynamic animations like Euphoria) allows for a very well translated moves, seeing Dante in combat has never been so realistic and believable. Every swing of Rebellion (the name of the sword) looks realistic and carries inertia with them.- WIDE RANGE OF ENEMY TYPES offers new challenges as you progressing further in the game, so there is no such thing as repetitive combat playstyles.- TRUE DIFFICULTY. Did you know, on higher difficulties, enemies and bosses not only react more quickly, but the also possesses new combat moves when attacking. This ultimately creates new experiences and rewards huge replay value for the players. Cool, right? Some developers went lazy in higher difficulty by raising ONLY the hit points and damage dealt upon the player. So job well done Ninja Theory.- A REBOOT DONE RIGHT. Ninja Theory is daring and strong enough to take this franchise to new directions. Without taking too much from the old material but only the amazing combat play, the developers has made a game worthy for a reboot. Ninja Theory does not rely on the power of nostalgia, but they believed that some originality will still appeal to most gamers out there, and they are right.The unforgiving thing about this :-The final boss fight is a huge disappointment. Enjoy the fight with regular enemies and early bosses as much as you can. Its a damn shame, the combat mechanics can be used exponentially, but they ended up as some gigantic fat♥♥♥♥♥blob for the final boss. urghh.- No DMC sequel. Are you kidding me capcom? Canned the sequel for a reboot? Because the sales did not met expectations? Thats a ♥♥♥♥♥ slap to the fans of the new reboot. Sorry boys.-The only bad thing about this game is only the characters. Thats unfortunate, but If you think you are going to dislike the reboot, there is always the old franchise for you to play. They're not yet extinct, people. There is a franchise for almost everybody out there.Final Verdict""DMC is a game that remains true to the core of classic hack and slash games, while offering new directions in storytelling and dynamic level designs. A game worthy for a reboot. 9/10.""			"

I imagine a 360 controller would be much easier on your fingers in high pressure fighting/platforming situations.Also story is the only game mode avalible without dlc, which hurts the replay value a bit.This game was my introduction to the Devil May Cry series.

												Let me start by saying that this is the first Devil May Cry game I've played, and I therefore won't compare it to any other games in the franchise. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The combat is fun and simple to learn, its not hard to make new combos, and the story was intriguing and amusing. Controller support was also a crucial factor. If you're like me and just wanted a nice hack n slash game with a cool story to get into, jump right in and grab this game, it's worth it!			"

												I enjoy this reboot more than the original series - it plays a lot like Bayonetta, although I personally prefer Bayonetta.Basically the game is about performing stylish combos. In this way it is a lot like a rhythm game or even an extreme sports game like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater in the sense that your main goal (other than beating levels and not dying) is to link together seamless combos.Don't be disheartened if you suck at this game at first - I really did. It makes great use of all of the buttons on the controller (I played with an Xbox 360 controller). You must be constantly messing with the shoulder buttons and using them in tandem with ABXY as the shoulder buttons change your weapons on the fly when you're holding them. It's a system that was difficult for me to get used to, but after about four hours I was handling it pretty well.The main game doesn't take very long to beat, but the fun of it is being able to play the game again on harder difficulties. The main difficulty is not very hard, and I rarely died. But as you get into the higher difficulties that are unlocked as you beat previous difficulties the game tests your ability to quickly think up smart combos and understand how to deal with each enemy. Aside from the gameplay, the game has a fantastic presentation and a decent story. The story is predictable and bland, but it serves the game and it is satisfying when you finally get to take down the games main bad dude. The presentation is wonderful - really cool colors, especially when you take the contrast between the ""real world"" and ""limbo"" into consideration, which I think was intentional.

												I wish I didn't like this game, but I can't. DmC is, for better or worse, a really very well done game. Thanks to its engine it enjoys amazing PC compatibility with amazing textures and graphical features, and an immense amount of controller compatibility extending beyond XInput and M/KB. The combat may be less accurate than other DmC's as there's a greater focus on crowd control and aerial combat, and a push for simplicity, but in the process they removed many of the risk/reward systems that flourished in earlier DmC's. The aggrotech soundtrack seems a risky move but pumps you almost as well as any industrial or metal soundtrack from any other game. The art design is peerless too, using bright lights and blue or red tints to highlight the feel of the world you're in.The only down points are the plot - typical ANONYMOOSE bull and a retread of They Live, but retooled for the Xbox-and-self-stimulation crowd and not the fans of DMC yore, the interactions between Dante and Vergil and the inevitable corny shi**y junk jokes, and Dante's failure one-liners.But I've sunk close to 40 hrs into this. For comparison, I've sunk 55 into DMC4 on the 360. So it must be doing something right.Get it if you're craving a different action game with an actually controllable camera (I'm looking at you, Revengeance).			"

												Okay, so here's the thing about DMC: Devil May Cry; it's not perfect. It's a re-telling of the 1st game, in a whole new light. It takes place in a world where Mundus has taken over all of humanity. He controls the population through the media, as well as other neferious means. Unlike other DMC-games, this one does not take place with an older, experienced, badass Dante. Instead, you take the role of a young, arrogant, and generally, even more immature than normal, black-haired Dante. The gameplay is without a doubt inferior to the fourth installment of the DMC-series. But that shouldn't be a deterrent as to whether or not you'll enjoy the game. I wasn't too thrilled when I saw the trailers for this, as I thought it would be a mediocre experience, but I was wrong, it was pretty awesome. The music is decent, albeit it's more of a techno-dub-steppy sort of music, rather than the usual heavy metal, but it's not half bad. All in all, the game is better than DMC 2, but no as good as DMC 4. Get a controller, because using a keyboard is nigh-impossible.			"

												DmC is surprisingly a really good game. I had heard only bad things from the hardcore fans, but when I played it I had a hell of a time. The action is quick, responsive, and addictive. The scenary is beautiful, and I have learned to like black haired Dante. I have a fairly old rig, but the game runs amazingly. I never noticed frame rate drops even during the most action packed scenes with lots of enemies on screen. If you are looking for a character action game, give this game a shot.			"

												I'll preface my review by saying that before this I had only ever played Devil May Cry 4, so I'm certainly not a long-time fan of the series, but I did play dmc4 pretty thoroughly. Anyway, on to the review! --Compared to Devil May Cry 4-- DmC: Devil May Cry reimagines the series from the bottom up, and essentially chronicles Dante's transformation from an edgy dude who can see demons and enjoys killing them when he finds them, but doesn't quite understand who he is, into the full-blown Nephelim badass who is now killing demons with understanding (perhaps that he's not just crazy?) and purpose. The game in a smaller part also basically tells the story of Vergil and Dante's relationship develops (I'll leave it at that), and how the world becomes a place where a demon hunter would be necessary. The story really doesn't take itself too seriously, for better or worse. Dante, especially during the earlier parts of the game, is an angsty hot-head, which definitely rubs many people the wrong way, but there's defenitely a level of character development that takes place in which he becomes more of the Dante I remember seeing in dmc4, both in attitude and appearance. I don't understand all of the hatred on Dante's look. Dante's hair starts turning white as he realizes his true potential, when he first starts devil triggering his hair starts turning white. Beat the game and you can play through with white hair. I personally thought this was a nice touch, as when you start the game Dante doesn't know that he isn't human, hasn't realized his demonic powers, etc.Gameplay is (in my opinion) far improved upon from devil may cry 4, there's about the same variety of combos and weapons (not including the variety presented by pandora) but the difference is in the ability to chain combos and attacks together between weapons. This was certainly possible before, but now it feels like almost every combo and attack can be chained together to create a lot of potential variety in how you approach each battle. Also, love them or hate them, this game has zero quick time events --As it's own game-- This has quickly become one of my favorite hack and slash games to date, the story has pretty consistently good voice acting (crazy from a Capcom game) and an entertaining story that's funny, full of over the top action and told well with the help of the aformentioned voice acting but also fairly organic movement and gestures from the characters within the game. The main game took me about 20 hours to beat playing on the hardest difficulty that you initially have unlocked, but I started a new game+ the second I beat it, and the next difficulty up gives all of the enemies new and remixed move sets that have kept the game fresh and have forced me to develop new strategies to deal with old enemies. All in all, I would highly recommend this game. Oop also I played with a controller, I don't know how the combat would be using mouse and keyboard, but I can imagine it wouldn't work as well. "

I haven't gave DMC a chance due to bad reviews on release but i am glad i did as the amount of action in this game is pretty good and the level design is amazing and just surprises you at first.DMC left me smiling after every mission cause of how well the level design is and the variety of enemies. If you're bored of other genres, Give this game a shot for 2 hours before you refund and you be the judge but as for me i'll keep playing this game :)			"

												Doesn't deserve the hate. Not as good as classic DMC but still a solid hack and slash.If you want to put as many hours into it as I do, download the Gentleman's Bloody Palace mod. Having a challenging gauntlet adds so much to the game. Wish something like this existed for DMC4.			"

												Definitely my BEST BUY OF 2013. Would purchase at full price of $50. A must buy for 3D.Pros:*Superb soundtrack.*Actually, the soundtrack is brilliant. I don't even like the genre of music, but it just ""fits"". Perfectly.*Graphics that would make a PS4 blush. And go home to change its pants.*Amazing lighting effects.*Fast, fun melee fight centered gameplay.*Gratifying button mashing too -But not so fast that your fingers bleed.*Unintrusive, mature story. It's an RPG that grabs your attention, but mostly stays out of your way so you can enjoy playing. FYI, if you want to skip the cutscenes, simply hit the back button on your controller when they are playing. *Uncomparable experience in 3D. Even Batman didn't look or feel this good.Cons:*I feel remorseful for having got this game on sale.			"

												This is my favorite brawler game I've ever played, hands down. Game is well developed and runs at very high frame rate with everything max'd out on my medium-spec laptop, and is absolutely gorgeous. Level design is unlike anything else, the map feels alive and responsive to your every move, seeking to find you and kill you. Enemies are relentless and well designed to challenge you. Through out the game you get several weapons that you replace on the fly with the d-pad, and each one has its own large set of skills and upgrades to train yourself through. The game rewards you for using style, and this is one of the first games I've played where it's actually fun to change up your style and try new ways to get through hordes on a map. The reboot is great, the story is fantastic for a brawler, and I'm excited for the sequel.			"

												Initially great game. Really liked this in the beginning. Unfortunately, the main drawback is that it's clearly meant for controller use. If you play with keyboard/mouse, the timing required for some of the run-sling-jump-boost combos can sometimes be pretty challenging... actually more like impossible, due to the sometimes awkward camera angle. Maybe someone else can pull off to get over the bridge to the tower, while the tower shoots those insane destroyer beams at you, when using a keyboard, and when the camera gets stuck at some off-angle causing you to either fall off or be hit by the beam... I can't.Stuck.This sucks.			"

Still Combichrist replays on my foobar music player.Best Installing Simulator ever made, haha. ;)Buy this game if You like awesome storyline, a lot of destruction given to enemies, epic music that motivates You to make insane SSS ranks, it's 200% worth of its price, believe me. :)			"

												Drop that♥♥♥♥♥♥with the new Dante... If you like the other Devil May Cry games, then this one is a very fitting reboot.I've not played the other DmC, this is my introduction to the series. (How good this game was, prompted me to buy DmC 4 and 3)Gameplay:Is very well done. Your hack and slash just got more awesome. With various sick weapons you gather along the way you can use, there is a HUGE playground for combos and styles. I never stopped toying around with the different things you can come up with. No QTEs (Thank god), the bossfight are ♥♥♥♥ing badass. Period. As if the game is not hard enough for you... you have various modes, each taking more extreme hops in impossibility. (Highest mode: Dante Must Die mode, oh don't even start...)10/10Story:I may not have played the other DmC, but I have many cousins who are huge fans, therefore influence being indirect. Cannot say I dig the particular personality they stuck to the new Dante. (Pessimistic, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, failed attempt at swagger.) Storyline was mediocre. For this type of game, story isn't emphasized. But, it was good overall. 7/10Visuals:Very ecstatic. The world design they have done with Limbo is almost mesmerizing. Level design was also very good, pertaining to your regular action game genre expectations. With a little height of difficulty of course. (Getting around with the angel snitch and the demon pull sometimes) For the new decade, these graphics are very adequate.9/10Music:MMMMMMMMMM. HELL YES.10/10Overall: 9/10This game was awesome. Get it, unless you don't want to deal with the new Dante. (Justin Bieber look-alike?!?!)			"

DmC: Devil May Cry suffered some hate even before launch because of its departure from previous DMC games. The combat is revamped and the protagonist is aged down and punked up (also people really seemed to care what color Dante's hair was. Because that really influences the game experience).DmC is a shining example of the hack-and-slash genre. The combat is complex, dividing attacks into three categories (standard, angelic, and demonic), but this organization makes it easy to master. The more you play, the more competent you become with the system and the more complex and satisfying the combos become. The story is a bit hit-or-miss, but honestly all Devil May Cry games have had lackluster stories. The ridiculousness of the series has been dampered, so you won't be skateboarding on demons and eating pizza with blades sticking out of you, and honestly it makes the game better for it. It's a much more serious take on what always should have been a serious game.Aside from combat, the soundtrack is the best part of the game. Noisia and Combichrist provide heart-pounding beats to compliment your demon crusade. The music is well integrated into the flow of combat but is also pleasant to listen to on its own.			"

												They clearly attempted to round up a new audience for this game. The Humor is even more  immature than in the older ones, and taken to gringy levels far beyond reason.The Game has plenty of bugs and glitches, and it's only few saving graces are pretty smooth animations and decent enough graphics. The Game also has minor performance issues. Fighting mechanics are incredibly generic: all the weapons are one and the same, and most things blocking you're path have a retundant replica of another weapon needed to open the path.  Most of the combat involves hitting the enemies with the correct type of weapon and... Well, that's it. That's all the combat is.Plot is like something out of a 10 year olds daydream. All in all, it's a pretty bad game since it doesen't do anything interesting, and it just lacks the feel of a DMC game. 5/10.I can't say I recommend this game to anyone...			"

DmC: Devil May Cry suffered some hate even before launch because of its departure from previous DMC games. The combat is revamped and the protagonist is aged down and punked up (also people really seemed to care what color Dante's hair was. Because that really influences the game experience).DmC is a shining example of the hack-and-slash genre. The combat is complex, dividing attacks into three categories (standard, angelic, and demonic), but this organization makes it easy to master. The more you play, the more competent you become with the system and the more complex and satisfying the combos become. The story is a bit hit-or-miss, but honestly all Devil May Cry games have had lackluster stories. The ridiculousness of the series has been dampered, so you won't be skateboarding on demons and eating pizza with blades sticking out of you, and honestly it makes the game better for it. It's a much more serious take on what always should have been a serious game.Aside from combat, the soundtrack is the best part of the game.

												If like me you have a real urge to hack and slash your way through a shed load of enemies then this game is definitely for you. I've seen this game played at 30 fps on consoles and it really doesn't work for this kind of game so this version is the only one worth playing.A lot of fan boys cried about this game but I kind of liked the move from awkward stupid boring level design to a more visually impressive shiny arcade style. An impressive modern twist on an overrated original, I'm all over this reboot it's untrue.Get it, get it now!Have you got it yet?			"

												An above average hack 'n slash that was marketed so poorly that people thought it was an ""edgy and gritty"" game that had a message, which resulted in horrible sales and a permanent stain on what should have been another high note in one of the most original series of our time.DMC: Devil May Cry is not a grimdark trek through Dante's psyche, nor is it about him going to prison and becoming emo. This game is a retelling of DMC. This time, instead of a castle filled with enemies that reek of Resident Evil, it's topped to the brim with color, personality, and attitude. Granted, that attitude is extremely childish and on-the-nose, but that adds to it's charm.This is the perfect game to turn your brain off to, plus a great action game to boot, but it's not a DMC game by any means. Vergil is there, Ebony and Ivory are there, and Rebellion is there, but this is no Devil May Cry. If you can get past that and take this game for the goofy, vibrant game that it is, then you'll have a blast.Oh, and it's a little easy.			"

												It's worth noting here that I can't speak to difficulty. I'm not good at fighting games, and that seems to translate here. i played this on 'Human' difficulty, and still had a few deaths. This is also my first DMC, so I can't speak to the fans of the series, just to people who like good games. This is a good game.The plot is definitely 'B' rank, but it's the good sort of 'B', Army of Darkness sort of thing. (Actually, it's probably less silly.)I enjoyed the fighting, even if I can't combo to save my life, and the system felt very well done. There was a nice variety of enemies, so you can't just use the same attack over and over and have it work well. There is also plenty of replayability, between the collectables, challenges, and trying to get a better rank for the levels. There's a decent upgrade system too, so you can get more out of the weapons you enjoy, but it's nowhere near deep enough to even say 'RPG elements' I should also mention, the visuals are great. Lots of weird and interesting areas to fight in, and they all look pretty damn good. My issues with the game: The majority of the boss fights sucked. They were about a 6 on a scale that goes from 1 to Deus Ex: HR. ""Dodge this annoying and lengthy attack pattern! Now hit the obvious weak spot! Lather! Rinse! Repeat!""Also, I had some weird pauses in the game. My system can handle games pretty well, so I'm not sure what was causing them, but I kept having the whole game freeze for a few seconds in the middle of battles or platforming (which is not a fun place for that to happen). Dunno if this was my fault or if the game's buggy, but there you go.oh, and here's a hint: Eryx uppercuts on the Dreamwalkers. Those guys can go to hell. Uh, pun not intended.			"

												Overall this is a great game.  I bought it for $20 on sale and it is very much worth that.  I don't know if I would pay a full $50 for it but I am a brok grad student so to each there own.  Here are my pros and cons and odds.Pros-Awsome combo system.  It is not overly complex but it lends it self well to being able to do easy combos very early on and letting you make your own combos later by builing off of the fast past combat.-Great story.  The story isn't very complicated but it is fun and well done, adding to this really awesome cut scenes and good transition from cut scenes to action and its a major boon to this game-7 difficulty settings.  If you aren't good at these types of games that's OK set it on the lowest and you will learn and progress fine, if you are awesome at them you can unlock difficulties that boggle the mind.-Fights are lots of fun and there are many ways to win.  They tend to go with large amounts of enemies over one mini boss type almost all the time.  Usually when you are fighting only one enemies it is the first time you have scene it and the game is giving you a chance to get you strategy down about it which leads to-Good difficulty progression, this game gets much harder as it progresses but it prepares you for it so you never feel like ""where the hell did that come from""-Lots of fun weapons and powers-Fun jumping puzzles-Great level design, there fun, have environmental factors that hurt you and the enemies, hard to get lost in and are aesthetic pleasingCons-Not fun jumping puzzles (seriously some are great some are terrible)-The camera angles hate you, its not game breaking but it is annoying.  The camera tries to center it self to whatever it thinks you are attacking and while it usually does a fine job when it doesn't its pretty bad-One of the main way it hides collectibles is via the camera automatically turning in a way you don't see it, this leads to forcing the camera to do things it doesn't want to often which wouldn't be bad except how many collectibles you get and how long it takes you affects your xp-You can't get all the collectibles on the first run through.  Its not that as a human you will miss some its that they will require abilities you cannot posses yet.  This isn't bad exactly but it leads to trying to get something till you get frustrated and move on only to realize that when you go back to the level later its not even a challenge to collect it.-Short, took me about 8 hours, would have been 7 if I didn't constantly force the camera to odd places.  This game assumes you will replay it.Odd-The boss fights are the easiest levels.  There not bad they just follow a much slower progression.			"

												I love this game! the level design, the bosses, the combat. Its all really awesome! Even the story is great, well it does have some pretty bad one-liners, but it also have pretty good ones like for example all the quotes from the succubus are awesome. One thing that I didn't like was the final boss, I don't why, but I just didn't enjoyed it like the rest of the bosses. Ive played all the previous devil may cry games, and I have to say even though this new Dante is different but he did surprisingly  remind me of Dante from the other games. And if this new Dante is stopping you from buying this game then, do yourself a favor, just buy this game, trust me, you'll love it, even if its a bit different from what you are used to. It  still has the awesome combat, bosses, upgrades,  and cheesy one-liners.			"

												DMC: Devil May Cry is a reboot of the old Devil May Cry series. Lots of controversy has been had over Dante's new look, but I personally never really cared since I have never played any other DMC game (even though I eventually planned to since the  Spectacle fighter sub-genre is my favorite game genre). Now this game is a very fun spectacle fighter that lasts about 8-10 hours with the Vergil DLC adding another hour or two. Now the story in this game isnt very strong, but it is good enough to keep you invested. The combat in this game is amazing and very different to that of other spectacle fighters like Ninja Gaiden or God of War. You can switch weapons mid swing from a sword to an axe to a scythe. There are a total of 8 weapons and they are all very fun to use. The bosses are also a ton of fun to fight and can give you a challenge, especially the final boss. In my opinion the final boss in this game is one of the best final bosses in any game I've played so far. He legitimately feels like you equal and the area around you changes as you fight him and he is not easy, but not hard either. More games should take notes and make bosses more like DMC's final boss. Overall this game gets a 9/10 and is very fun and the story is decent and I highly recommend you play it if you like hack and slash games.			"

												DMC Fan through and through.Check my Steam.  DMC3. DMC4, DMC4:SE  DmC:DmCPlayed the orginal on PS2, and even played the 2nd game which we shall never speak of.I cannot begin to explain how good of a game this really is.  To Start the theme.  An american city, A demon lord that has more less taken over the world.  This of course cannot be the same games as the previous ones.  While the orginals are amazing.  This game too is amazing for the evenviorment that it is set in.  This refreashing twist to DmC could make for a great duel layer franchise, as well as reboots of plenty of characters.  Which I would find interesting.Does this game give you the standard hack and slash of the other Devil may cry games?  NONow, Hold that thought.  Many of the enemys in this one are more of a tactical thing.  Dodging, Avoiding, Smashing.  Not the normal, Oh look they have that purble haze on them, better hit them with strong attack.  The controls are just as roubust as the old games.  Rather then using the triggers scroll though weapons it activates your angelic and demonic weapons.  I found myself switching through various weapons causing massive mayham just as I would with other games.So is this a real DMC game?  To me, yes.  Buy it, Play it, Kill everything.  Trust me.......... It is worth it.  Just remove the old storys from you minds and go with the flow.			"

												Awesome graphics, bangin soundtrack, demon killing, a plethora of badass weapons, a storyline and plot that's engaging making you scream for more while sending enemies at you from all directions. It's challenging, awe inspiring and just one hell of a great game. If you're still on the fence about playing it, you need to hop off and claim your destiny as a demon killer. Played it through 2 times already and going for a 3rd.  You can be quick but it really pays to hone your craft with weapons and upgrades.			"

												If you forget this is called Devil May Cry, this is a great game. The combat is fast and with the insane combo potential of the new DMCs, the ambience and aesthetic are unique and cohesive, and the platforming is not as god awful as it was in the old DMCs. Also, the port works perfectly, unlike DMC4SE. And the characters are honestly not bad, but they don't have the charm the old sons of sparda had.Overall a very good game, shame it is replacing the classic instead of being his own thing.			"

												The environmental design is nice and it was tolerable enough for me to actually finish it but it's just not very good. The combat is much slower and has far less depth then DMC4 and the story is no where near as good as it thinks it is.Also well colour coded enemies in this kind of game is a stupid idea, fighting a heavy enemy that only takes damage from the light damage weapon meant for crowd control just leads to you clearing out the rest of the encounter and then wailing on it for a minute while it never touches you and it just kills the pace of combat.

												Wow! I really wanted to be able to sit here and say that I loved this game. Having not played other games in the series I was not blinded by nostalgia or a bias for the older versions of the characters, and I genuinly found it, as a property in its own right, to have characters and plot that, whilst not original, was developed well enough and satisfying and I genuinly looked forward to coming back and seeing what would happen to them next. The combat was fun and surprisingly deep and challenging and I enjoyed all the weapons and combos and unlocking new abilities.The enemies are well designed for the most part, varied, interesting, and exciting to fight. Some are better than others, of course, but by all counts its a solid show. The exception are the boss fights, where both design and mechanics are sadly incredibly tired and cliched for the most part with only a couple of exceptions.The level designs are pretty standout, with amazing skyboxes and interesting secret areas and agility trials. There are not really enough puzzles for my taste, but oh well. That is not a big thing really. There are a couple of very memorable levels, including one in the opening sequence of a TV News programme, and that was clever and appropriate, and original too. Unfortunately I don't think enough was done with it really. The graphics are good, considering, although the textures do sometimes take a long time to load, especially in cut scenes (and this is running on a machine at least three times as powerful as it needs to be).Now we get to the big point...the negative...the thing that ruined the whole deal for me...the one issue, so large, that it singlehandedly earned the game this negative review and my undying hatred after a considerable amount of swearing.The final, piece of a*** bossfight.It started off interesting enough. For the record, to challenge the fanboy morons who would say ""You just cannot play the game"", I lost less than a quarter health before I got to the final, last stand, part of the boss' routine. So clearly I can manage well enough. This last stand consists of summoning a double who defends from all attacks. The boss is crouching, healing, and is totally untouchable due to their double's defence and attacks. I expended all my healing and regeneration items on trying to figure out the secret, only to have to reload. And guess what. Your items do not reload with you. What kind of shoddy, dreadful, gut-wrenching design is that! But I managed. But I could not figure out the secret. I was getting really cross and fed up with this lazy repetitive nonsense, and I finally broke my sacred rule and looked up a walkthrough.The secret? A contrived use of an ability that, at no point before, had been used for this use, nor said to be useful for this use, nor hinted at in the bossfight. I would NEVER have worked that out on my own, and perhaps that makes me thick, but I maintain it is lazy and shoddy game design to introduce a new gameplay mechanic, which in essence it is, in the last boss fight as the only way to make it tough, because otherwise it was not.And even WITH that advice, it was a matter of sheer luck as to whether or not the ability, which requires items or grinding attacks to build up to a useable level, would actually perform as needed when activated and drained far too fast!I cannot begin to describe the amount of bad language I used and how close I came to rage quitting, which is rare for me. Every example of poor design in a boss fight is present in this final, extrenuous encounter.And if that wasn't bad enough, the ending afterwards was not even worth the effort.I am genuinly upset that I cannot recommend this game, but it would be hypocritical of me to recommend a game with so many flaws even in just one fight that I would crucify any other game on.Disagree with me if you want. Say I cannot play it if you want. I can play it. I did play it. I was playing it on medium difficulty (ok, so not the toughest, but it wasn't the easiest either!) and I managed to achieve a lot of high scores in other levels and as I said I did really well to begin with against this final boss and did not find it hard to hit them, dodge their attacks, or otherwise fight them. It was purely this execrably poor mechanic that foiled me, and at the same time sapped all my goodwill for an otherwise enjoyable game. Play it, don't play - it is your choice. It has its fun moments, but the plot ended up lamely and the final boss fight was a joke of bad design. I would recommend DANTE'S INFERNO as a game before this!			"

												Let me just start this by saying: I'm having fun with this game. Well, I was, anyway. The system requirements are questionable as to whether they'll get you a working 640x480 or a stuttering mess at times. The game can be cheap as hell. It requiring fine responses from you but it can be a flip of a coin at times whether it will accept important dodge moves or just ignore them. Hit detection can be all over the place, with a chainsaw holding enemy managing to hit without their weapon making contact, or miss while the chainsaw goes through Dante. The level design can be confusing, with times all I could think was ""What do you want from me?"" as I try to determine where the next neatly disguised platform has been hidden, resulting in not even realising which order the game was after. The method of accessing platforms (one grappling hook for pulling them out, one for pulling Dante to them) seems confusing as to when it will decide to acknowledge Dante is in a suitable place. And the sections where Dante has to outrun walls closing in can be nightmarish in its' ignoring attempts to jump and furthering the need for good reaction times. The end result is a game that takes your health for its' inability to follow through on jumping (a fall ""off the map"" costs Dante health) and dodging, then penalises you for using items to heal that health. A game that confuses with poorly designed platforming sections and things to hit on the wall, then takes away score for taking a while to work out what comes next. A game that makes some enemies a chore (the afforementioned chainsaw weilding ones, anything in the air that requires a lock on that ends with the game focusing Dante on the wrong enemies), then you lose score if you shoot at them because it's the only way the game won't play cheap and steal health and cause frustration through making it far more dangerous to Dante's health than actually fighting against them would be without all the issues mentioned here. That's saying nothing for the maybe 15 frames per second I'm getting or the 5 seconds where the game will just stop in some areas (I think when it's trying to do pop-in of partially transparent character models in a wide space), including during battle.The game can be fun, at times. It's a lot more whimsical than previous entries and feels more enjoyable (as someone who has played previous Devil May Cry games), with a plot that helps keep up the interest. But it's getting more of a chore than it may be worth for me now, what with the unfair mess it has turned into.Not recommended.(game played with Xbox 360 wireless controller, computer meets and/or exceeds system requirements)			"

												Greetings developers from #Ninja_Theory!you have made a really nice product, to the some point he is not a Dante that we got used to but it has a really nice gameplay and storyline.... And here is a downside....what I do not like is a quality of the game. Hell, I'm not talking about minor bugs or smth.Im talking about the fact that I can't pass through the lvl 12 ""In a Siege"", where I need to buy time for Vergil and Kat to get info from server. I do wipe out the enemies, but nothing happens afterwards, music goes on like Im still battling but there are no foes.You have made the game that's not functioning properly and it is not on open-beta or smth. And I want to use my right as a consumer to get my refund or provided with a product that does work.Thank you for your attention!P.S. I have tried to replay that mission several times, reinstall game. Nothing helped. Steam is switched on an autoupdate mode.			"

												The game is pretty good for the first 9 levels, but when you hit the 10th you end up fighting game mechanics instead of enemies.  Just trying to get to the tower sees the camera getting fixed at a weird angle about midway through making falling highly likely requiring you to start over.  Fighting the boss sees more issues with screwed up camera angles that leave you fighting the mechanics to even get to the crystals you need to break instead of fighting the boss or evading his attacks.You'll also never get full completion without going back to replay earlier missions over again once you have the right tools.  In mission 9 you'll never complete it without going through the mission multiple times as you need the gold key and the only way to get it is during a fight by using the enemies to help get you to the upper ledge.The story is intriguing, so it's a real shame the developers decided it would be a good idea to have the player fight the game mechanics--a real no-no in game design.

												DmC is not a bad game. Its got great graphics, good music, well done voice acting, and smooth gameplay. So why am I not recommending it? For a couple reasons.1. Super repetitive. Everything from the areas you are in, to the challenges you must do, to the fights, and overall graphics. Oh look, its another part of the city thats getting mutated into a chaos realm. Joy. Hardly any variation. Levels in this game are what those special ""Artistic"" levels in other games do as that one time side mission. Only, these are EVERY part of the game. The gameplay in each is always the same too, with the game going through the same sets of scripted events over and over again. ""Oh, think you made it to the end of the level, NOPE, here are more enemies, or here's a roadblock that suddenly forms causing you to find another way."" Rinse, repeat. I kept hoping for even one level that didnt have that ""you've done way too many drugs"" look to it, and it hasnt yet happened. Overall, just playing through these levels and the gameplay, is dull.2. Too many combos. Sounds silly right? There comes a point when the 8+ buttons your fingers have to manage on a controller have surpassed the insane when it comes to various combinations they must learn and use. Its good for a game to have combos. Games like God of War showed this, Combos gives you that extra bit of exciting ""oomph"" to combat beyond bland button mashing. However, this game goes to the extreme with the amount of buton combinations you have to use, enough to tie your fingers in knots. It then scores you based on how many of these seemingly infinite combos you can do. The irony is, many of the enemies DIE before you can manage to do enough combos to often get a good combo rating.  This game is litterally like ""Twister"" for your fingers.			"

												DMC: Devil May Cry is the fifth part of the entire series of Devil May Cry. Being the latest of all, the graphics, gameplay and the sound quality is naturally far superior than its predecessors. This is the first time I played a DMC, and I am awed with it. I can write a thousand enthusiastic lines that will flatter the game throughout; that's not at all why I am writing this. What has really surprised me is the HATE that this piece of art is facing from the fans of its predecessors. Comparisons have arose particularly from the 3rd and 4th part players. They have simply fallen in love with the characters and its the CHARACTERS of the game that really interests them, nothing else. Though I didn't play its predecessors but I watched the walkthroughs of all of them. My conclusion: every game has its own unique features that makes it popular,for this one they are :-1. THE COMBAT.2. THE MUSIC.3. THE WEAPONS RANGE (8 in numbers).People are going far enough asking to play M**** G*** R***** while these two are completely different; not to mention that it also requires a very high end PC and quite a few bucks to fulfill their choice. For the Predecessor Fans (P Fans), my only request is please find a person who has:-1. played the latest DMC first in the whole series,2. hated it,3. purchased any of its prefecessors, and4. prefers it over the latest version.Also to add, there are tons of fans who, though played the prequels, didn't hold back to say that this one quite impressed them.This game is a masterpiece at a modest price requiring almost a moderate specification to help it run and guarantees satisfaction at least for a few months. All the hack and slash games really fade out in comparison to this.To come accross such a fluid stylish gameplay, this is certainly staying in my PC forever. For people who have not yet played this game, it will surely quench your thirst.Can't wait for the Sequel.Warning : YOU WILL PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN...			"

												Overrated.  The game starts out with BOOM! and grabs your attention with arresting visual style, great graphics and cool take on the DmC universe.  Unfortunately, the game slowly layers more and more complexity onto the proceedings until it's a giant muddle of ""hold this button while pushing this other button while holding the stick up to do so-and-so"".  The combat becomes tedious because enemies further along in the game can only be dealt with effectively using certain pre-ordained moves, which eliminates your license as a player and makes the game inflexible and repetitive.  While the ideas of demons running the world's companies and media outlets, etc. is intrigueing, the game is often crass and tasteless for no reason at all.  The death metal soundtrack, while appropriate, becomes grating after awhile also.  In short, it's fun until about halfway through when you say ""enough is enough"".			"

												The story sucks and a completely plagiarized hack job at that. If you watched 'They Live' you don't have to experience the drivel this game provides. There is no message in the satire. All the characters in the story bore me to tears. The supporting cast spout nothing but exposition and add very little to the narrative. Dante and Vergil are as interesting as a moldy peanuts. Dante feels like a Justin Bieber knock off and has as much charisma. Vergil is a massive D-bag and that's about for him. The only thing good about the story is the chemistry between Kat and Dante, but their relationship is left unresolved.The gameplay is neutered beyond belief.The style points is given so generously that a random button mash can get S rankings and above.The lack of a Style-system means Dante's move set is also streamlined. Theoretically allowing smoother, flashier combos. Realistically, it means the skill ceiling/ skill floor is so low that you can find everything you can do in the game very quickly. Resulting a game that has nothing new to offer once you finish the campaign.You can no longer lock on to an enemy so making the camera focus on a certain target is more difficult then it should be. (trivial for keyboard and mouse users, annoying for gamepad users)The boss fights are pathetic and the difficulty curve might as well be a Jackson Pollock painting.			"

												Where to begin? It's a decent game, but not one that belongs in the Devil May Cry universe. it has anice aesthetic but that's about it. The story is somewhat of a carbon coby from DCM3, which is imo a much much better game.The combatd is flawed, too slow, and you can't combo because there are color coded enemies on which only 1 of your weapons will work, so a scoring a long combo to get points is out of the question, not that it matters anyway.The combat ""style"" meter you see, is tied to how much damage you do and really easy to maintain. There's no challenge in it what so ever and makes the game uber easy. Alsotaking hints from GoW, your weapons range goes accros the screen. This is not how DMC should be.Devil trigger is absolutely useless because for some reason it launches all your enemies in the air. It's forcing you to go aerial, which is neat, but in other DMC games you had the CHOICE to do that and i was not a thing forcibly pushing mechanics.ALso where other DMC guys are riddled which exceptionally well designed boss battles, this one has only ONE memorable one, the bob bardas fight, and even that is way too easy.Conclusion: the levels and general aestethic look really nice, but it's gameplay that this game is lacking, a game needs more then just eyecandy to be good. It's like all other Ninja Theory games: they show promise but it's that ""Almost good, but not quite there yet"" why their games are so mediocre. "

												The game has a nice fighting system for first timer Devil May Cry but if you were a fan of the past titles don't bother. Nice way to end your game as well Ninja Theory (Giving the fan of the past title the finger) What a joke!I don't know who is the lead writer over at Ninja Theory but saying the F word a bunch  of times does not equal your  character to being cool and stylish			"

												Overall the game is OK. I would say 6.5 out of 10.Graphics are decent and the combat system is enjoyable.This game lacks in the storyline being boring.The original DMC was good because it was mostly serious with a couple one liners, this game, however, is all onliners. If they want to keep this series going I would say they should go back to the original.Also the DLC Vergil's Downfall is absolute garbage. They cheaped out on cut scenes and did comic style animation.This game is worth 7$ tops.			"

												This isnt as deep or long an experience as even DMC4, but it's a decent beat-em-up. Its not terribly difficult at the highest initially unlocked difficulty and the story isn't all that engaging. It looks okay, but is by no means the best looking or ugliest game out there.They tried way too hard to make Dante be an aloof jackass-turned-caring good guy, but the game wasn't long enough to allow you to care all that much.Despite all that, I enjoyed it for what it was worth. I don't think the gameplay could sustain my interest for much longer than it did, so the timing of the ending was very good, it did no overstay its welcome just in order to be longer. I'd say only buy this at a $10 or lower pricepoint.			"

												This is the first Devil May Cry game that I have played so I don't compare it to the others.  This is one of the best games I have ever played.  I started playing with keyboard and mouse then decided it was funner and better with a xbox controller.  I highly recommend this it has really cool sound and story and is a great hack and slash adventure with cool boss fights.  I give it a 10/10  would be 9/10 but bonus points for just having a really cool modern psychadelic feel to it.  This is in my top ten favorite games I have played.			"

												I remember being pretty upset when this game came out, I hated the design choices, the dumbing down of the game, and all the other changes. I finally did pick up the game for $7.50, and I have to say, it's really good. I'll break everything down:The gameplay: Despite dumbed down, the gameplay is very fun. Everything feels really polished and smooth, and still allows you to do really cool looking combos, but it is a lot easier and feels less rewarding.  This really isn't that much of a deal, as it is nice to just sit back, and enjoy a game casually. The boss fights are fantastic, each feel really creative and intense, but lack depth, and are pretty easy.  This game also features a little bit of 3D platforming, while it is very simple and does a lot of hand holding, it still looks pretty cool, and isn't terrible. The level design is really good, but it gets al little annoying towards the end, but some levels just are pure magic in this game, fitting the syle of the game, and accommodating for fighting excellently The gameplay is definitely really good though, everything feels great, despite being a lot simpler.The graphics/aesthetic: The game has a very flashy, bright, and hyperactive style to it, kind of like it was designed by someone with ADD. Don't view that as a bad thing, because the art style works really well for this type of game. The way the environments contort and change, is incredible, it's easily the best part about the game visually, it's some really impressive stuff. The one thing I was on the fence about, was the design of Dante. His design isn't super great, there's just something off about his appearance in the game, but this can be easily changed by getting the costume pack and using the classic Dante skin, it makes him look much better.The writing: This is definitely the weakest point of any hack and slash game, but I have to say, it's not bad in this. The story is okay, it works, and I was intrigued. The one liners are okay, they're certainly not as intelligent, but I liked them. The dialogue is a little weak though, some exchanges between characters feel awkward and forced. It's okay most of the time, but sometimes it can get pretty bad.The music: While all the previous games did a more instrumental type of metal, DMC: Devil May Cry, went more a much more electronic metal. It's great, but it fits the style of the game, and does its job. I didn't mind it, but it can feel a little overbearing at times, and tries a little to hard to be edgy.DMC: Devil May Cry may have a dumb title, and a few issues, but if you're looking to have some classic hack and slash action, and not much of a challenge, I'd definitely recommend this game. It's really good, and while I don't agree with some design choices, I had a fantastic time playing this game, it's just so good. "

												The game has a bad problem about enemies, that you have to use only certain weapons to kill them. DMC has to be a game that has a great variety of combos using more than one weapon at the same combo. I got a lot disappointed with this feature. Also, the story of the game is not all great, there are a lot of mistakes everywhere, everything that is done is hard with the enclosure of the story and lacks periods.			"

												Where to begin? It's a decent game, but not one that belongs in the Devil May Cry universe. it has anice aesthetic but that's about it. The story is somewhat of a carbon coby from DCM3, which is imo a much much better game.The combatd is flawed, too slow, and you can't combo because there are color coded enemies on which only 1 of your weapons will work, so a scoring a long combo to get points is out of the question, not that it matters anyway.The combat ""style"" meter you see, is tied to how much damage you do and really easy to maintain. There's no challenge in it what so ever and makes the game uber easy. Alsotaking hints from GoW, your weapons range goes accros the screen. This is not how DMC should be.Devil trigger is absolutely useless because for some reason it launches all your enemies in the air.

ProsGameplayMusic is really, really great and totally fits the actionDialog can be fantastic at timesColorful scenariosCharacter's style: From Dante to the bosses, pretty much all characters look really stylish and greatTons of combos to perform, if you account all the different weaponsConsLow variety of enemies: there are lots of reskins with different characteristics and thats it, I guessGraphicsThe world looks gorgeous and colorful even though you mainly play in the Limbo, which is a similar world to the real world, just more red-ish coloredThe characters look fantastic. TBH I wasn't even a fan of how Dante looked before I played and always felt CAPCOM tried to make him look as edgy as possible but honestly, pretty soon into the game, you'll feel that Dante looks really badass and his looks really fit himMOCAP was greatly usedGameplayAlright, so this is pretty much a DMC gameplay mechanics, if you're already familiarized with them. If not, you can expect a pretty much flawless gameplay for this kind of game, only second to (IMO) BayonettaYou get quite a few weapons but the thing I felt was that the ones you unlock later tend to be better AND cooler. Maybe it just fit my playstyle but I prefered those ones. You'll still need to use the ones you unlocked first in some areas thoughOverall you can expect a very, very solid gameplay with tons of combos and with each weapon feeling quite unique in gameplay. Maybe the best DMC game gameplay-wiseAudioFantastic, fantastic OST. Perfect for DMCI loved some of the dialogs, specially one with a boss. The voiceovers are very good and, again, Dante is a really cocky badass. Fits the character's age very wellFinal ThoughtsKinda jumped into the game not so sure with Dante's edgy looks but was blown away with how great CAPCOM made him look, speak and act. A very pleasant surprise.The pace of the game is high, the gameplay is pretty much flawless with the tools and mobility Dante has and it and it's just a blast to play. You'll have a great time!Rock solid game and probably my favourite DMC.Higly recommended! "

												Let me just start this by saying: I'm having fun with this game. Well, I was, anyway. The system requirements are questionable as to whether they'll get you a working 640x480 or a stuttering mess at times. The game can be cheap as hell. It requiring fine responses from you but it can be a flip of a coin at times whether it will accept important dodge moves or just ignore them. Hit detection can be all over the place, with a chainsaw holding enemy managing to hit without their weapon making contact, or miss while the chainsaw goes through Dante. The level design can be confusing, with times all I could think was ""What do you want from me?"" as I try to determine where the next neatly disguised platform has been hidden, resulting in not even realising which order the game was after. The method of accessing platforms (one grappling hook for pulling them out, one for pulling Dante to them) seems confusing as to when it will decide to acknowledge Dante is in a suitable place. And the sections where Dante has to outrun walls closing in can be nightmarish in its' ignoring attempts to jump and furthering the need for good reaction times. The end result is a game that takes your health for its' inability to follow through on jumping (a fall ""off the map"" costs Dante health) and dodging, then penalises you for using items to heal that health. A game that confuses with poorly designed platforming sections and things to hit on the wall, then takes away score for taking a while to work out what comes next. A game that makes some enemies a chore (the afforementioned chainsaw weilding ones, anything in the air that requires a lock on that ends with the game focusing Dante on the wrong enemies), then you lose score if you shoot at them because it's the only way the game won't play cheap and steal health and cause frustration through making it far more dangerous to Dante's health than actually fighting against them would be without all the issues mentioned here. That's saying nothing for the maybe 15 frames per second I'm getting or the 5 seconds where the game will just stop in some areas (I think when it's trying to do pop-in of partially transparent character models in a wide space), including during battle.The game can be fun, at times. It's a lot more whimsical than previous entries and feels more enjoyable (as someone who has played previous Devil May Cry games), with a plot that helps keep up the interest. But it's getting more of a chore than it may be worth for me now, what with the unfair mess it has turned into.Not recommended.(game played with Xbox 360 wireless controller, computer meets and/or exceeds system requirements)			"

												DmC: Devil May Cry, the ""reboot"" of the original Devil May Cry games set in a more contemporary setting.Just a basic run-down of my relationship with the franchise and with this game:I've played DMC2 and 3 to completion and only bits and pieces of DMC4. As for this game, I got it for 9$ as part of a Humble Bundle and personally that's the only way I'd be able to recommend this game to anybody, at the time of me writing this, I have 7 hours on the game. A little less than 6 of those hours were a complete playthrough of the game on Demon Hunter (Normal) and the rest were me being afk so needless to say I stand to give a review of the game. As for Pros and Cons,Pros:-The Combat System feels great as it should in a hack and slash type game, it seems that even though the game was made by a different studio than normal, they definitely captured the Devil May Cry feel in the gameplay.-The music is amazing, extremely blood pumping, encouraging players to want to do better in the game and overall makes combat 10x more enjoyable.-Tons of replayablity with numerous collectables, unlockables, and the variety of difficulty settings going all the way to ""Hell to Hell"" mode where Dante dies in one hit but everybody else is significantly stronger.-Great Social CommentaryCons:-The story is trash, even by Devil May Cry standards. I totally understand that they were trying to make the story more ""modern"" if that makes any sense, but they blew it, big time. One of the more popular reviews on Steam explains it beautifully:""The story of a man and his brother who dream of destroying Mountain Dew and Fox News just so they can kill the owner of Bank of America."" -stikasThat's the whole story, take it or leave it.- The game really cheaply tries to force players to use/mix up their combos by incorporating the other weapons. This is a bit of a tough one to explain because you really have to play the game to comprehend how bad a solid half of the weapons are, yet they still try to force you to use them. ""Dante"" (I use that name VERY loosely) has 9 weapons he can use, only about 4 of them are actually useful.Rebellion, the default sword, Eryx the second demon weapon you get (huge fists), Aquila, the second angel weapon you get (some glave shuriken type things... they just stun people), and Kablooey, the third gun you get toward the end game (stops enrage). Idk where I'm going with this, but if you buy the game for whatever reason, trust me you'll agree with me- The characters (Dante and Vergil) and watered down hollow shells of their former selves. To put it bluntly, Dante is an annoying prick that's gotta make a stupid remark about everything, now that's pretty much the old Dante, except imagine if it was a 7 year old and his vast vocabulary doing it. Vergil on the other hand is pretty close to the original, except for the fact that he throws honor completely out the window and just does what he wants.- Boss Battles are lackluster, idk what more I need to say.In Conclusion, the only way I can possibly recommend this game is if you get it on sale or part of a bundle, as there are plenty of other hack and slashes (like the original games) that do what DmC: Devil May Cry does, but extremely better.

												Greetings developers from #Ninja_Theory!you have made a really nice product, to the some point he is not a Dante that we got used to but it has a really nice gameplay and storyline.... And here is a downside....what I do not like is a quality of the game. Hell, I'm not talking about minor bugs or smth.Im talking about the fact that I can't pass through the lvl 12 ""In a Siege"", where I need to buy time for Vergil and Kat to get info from server. I do wipe out the enemies, but nothing happens afterwards, music goes on like Im still battling but there are no foes.You have made the game that's not functioning properly and it is not on open-beta or smth. And I want to use my right as a consumer to get my refund or provided with a product that does work.Thank you for your attention!P.S. I have tried to replay that mission several times, reinstall game. Nothing helped. Steam is switched on an autoupdate mode.			"

												The game is pretty good for the first 9 levels, but when you hit the 10th you end up fighting game mechanics instead of enemies.  Just trying to get to the tower sees the camera getting fixed at a weird angle about midway through making falling highly likely requiring you to start over.  Fighting the boss sees more issues with screwed up camera angles that leave you fighting the mechanics to even get to the crystals you need to break instead of fighting the boss or evading his attacks.You'll also never get full completion without going back to replay earlier missions over again once you have the right tools.  In mission 9 you'll never complete it without going through the mission multiple times as you need the gold key and the only way to get it is during a fight by using the enemies to help get you to the upper ledge.The story is intriguing, so it's a real shame the developers decided it would be a good idea to have the player fight the game mechanics--a real no-no in game design.

												DMC: Devil May Cry is the fifth part of the entire series of Devil May Cry. Being the latest of all, the graphics, gameplay and the sound quality is naturally far superior than its predecessors. This is the first time I played a DMC, and I am awed with it. I can write a thousand enthusiastic lines that will flatter the game throughout; that's not at all why I am writing this. What has really surprised me is the HATE that this piece of art is facing from the fans of its predecessors. Comparisons have arose particularly from the 3rd and 4th part players. They have simply fallen in love with the characters and its the CHARACTERS of the game that really interests them, nothing else. Though I didn't play its predecessors but I watched the walkthroughs of all of them. My conclusion: every game has its own unique features that makes it popular,for this one they are :-1. THE COMBAT.2. THE MUSIC.3. THE WEAPONS RANGE (8 in numbers).People are going far enough asking to play M**** G*** R***** while these two are completely different; not to mention that it also requires a very high end PC and quite a few bucks to fulfill their choice. For the Predecessor Fans (P Fans), my only request is please find a person who has:-1. played the latest DMC first in the whole series,2. hated it,3. purchased any of its prefecessors, and4. prefers it over the latest version.Also to add, there are tons of fans who, though played the prequels, didn't hold back to say that this one quite impressed them.This game is a masterpiece at a modest price requiring almost a moderate specification to help it run and guarantees satisfaction at least for a few months. All the hack and slash games really fade out in comparison to this.To come accross such a fluid stylish gameplay, this is certainly staying in my PC forever. For people who have not yet played this game, it will surely quench your thirst.Can't wait for the Sequel.Warning : YOU WILL PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN...			"

												This process can be repeated over and over again with a number of games.   If you can come up with an idea...just improve the original idea...MAKE IT GREATER....I really enjoy the gameplay, storyline and the overall re-invention of the classic.  I can remember when I first saw this game in the coming soon sections of game articles and could not wait to pick it up..boy was I happy when I did....It's been a pleasure to watch how it has progressed over the years. I guess the only thing that I dont like about some of these games, of all categories,  is the sellers intention to squeeze as much money out of gamers with these DLC's as they can when the original format I remeber when I was playing games was you beat the game on different difficulties to get all the unlockables, but now...you basically have to buy them....NOT COOL!!!!.Now the only thing to do with this franchise is to keep on doing what your doing cause all of the fans of this game....ARE STANDING BY WAITING TO SEE HOW THIS GAME WILL IMPROVE IN THE FUTURE.....I saw go ahead and keep recycling them...THE POPULARITY CAN ONLY GROW.....Game Rating: 10 out of 10  System.out.println(""EXCELLENT"");			"

												I wish I didn't like this game, but I can't. DmC is, for better or worse, a really very well done game. Thanks to its engine it enjoys amazing PC compatibility with amazing textures and graphical features, and an immense amount of controller compatibility extending beyond XInput and M/KB. The combat may be less accurate than other DmC's as there's a greater focus on crowd control and aerial combat, and a push for simplicity, but in the process they removed many of the risk/reward systems that flourished in earlier DmC's. The aggrotech soundtrack seems a risky move but pumps you almost as well as any industrial or metal soundtrack from any other game. The art design is peerless too, using bright lights and blue or red tints to highlight the feel of the world you're in.The only down points are the plot - typical ANONYMOOSE bull and a retread of They Live, but retooled for the Xbox-and-self-stimulation crowd and not the fans of DMC yore, the interactions between Dante and Vergil and the inevitable corny shi**y junk jokes, and Dante's failure one-liners.But I've sunk close to 40 hrs into this. For comparison, I've sunk 55 into DMC4 on the 360. So it must be doing something right.Get it if you're craving a different action game with an actually controllable camera (I'm looking at you, Revengeance).			"

												I think its a good game. I wish they did as with Bayonetta and given it a diffrent name. To me this is as wrong as if they had given Bayonetta the name Devil May Cry... It just isnt. And the fact that the company who made this **** on the fans of the real DMC and the real Dante. :(  With that said, It is not at all a bad game. I found it a bit easy to get combos, and I havent even learnd the combos well yet. I still get realy good score and I don't think thats a good thing. xD  I had to go away form easy as I have always played, for it was just so stupid. I didnt get hit at all. I started playing on the Nephilim and it was a little better, I get hit now and then but its still realy easy. Still getting high on combos. Game looks good more or less all over. The way the main caracter moves is realy good... I like the weponsystem. Enemies are cool. Bosses are... I guess some of them are good... I havent gotten so far that I have played all of them yet.Its a good way to get into ""hack and slash"" games I guess. Story is good entoh but I dont like some of the acting. No its not just that Im a old Dante fan, The new Dante's personalety and caracter in general seem as split as his race.... It just feels wrong. Also the bad jokes. xDTo the Real Dante fans, you can get the dlc to play as him but he looks a bit strange from the front in my opinion, the back works tho. Also just to be ****'s they only made it work with about half the cut scenes. Well thats my guess why they did it anyway.I guess If it had Its own name and wasnt a ripoff of itself.   >_<  It would have been a 70/100.All in all I would give it a loose 65/100, Worth getting on 50% Sale.

												I already played DmC: Devil May Cry on consoles, so this review is coming from someone who knows the difference between both that version and the PC version. I'm also a DMC veteran who has played all the previous DMC games.The PC version definitely benefits alot as far as ports of fast action games go. Meaning that you get the 60 FPS gameplay that previous DMC games hold up for the more dexterous veterans. If nothing else, the Unreal Engine 3 visuals on PC still hold up nicely.However, few pre-rendered cutscenes will feel jarring to look at. Gameplay-wise, I still have an issue with the dumbed down Style Ranking and the red/blue enemies that force me to use only Angel/Demon weapons. If you're just in this visuals and spectacle, this game is worth checking out.			"

												In one sentence : they noobified the series.The new controls are not that bad, it's more fluid than the original and you can have multiple weapons to use at the same time, but they removed the targetting system and this makes the game a mess when you are fighting many enemies and you won't attack the one you want to. The stylish points are not awarded properly, you just need to do a lot of damage and you will get top score, this happens even at the hardest difficulty and makes the game too easy. The story tries to be different and it's ok if it isn't for the fact that has nothing to do with devil may cry, they just took the characters from the original series, made them look similar, gave them completely different personalities and made a complete different story, sorry, this is not how you do a reboot.The new Dante is a really badly characterised character, it wants to be cool and edgy, but it's never a badass, and that's all the original Dante needed to be. Too many scripts during the levels and the platform sections become boring after a while.I cannot recomend this over the classics, get devil may cry 4 on steam, it's great, this one is not.			"

												First, I won't call this a port since realease date is nearly the same with PS3/X360 version.It was built from Unreal Engine 3, which is (I think) very lightweight even for my old laptop (i3 2.33GHz, 4GBs RAM, nVIDIA 520MX 1GB).- Great controller support, I recommend using x360ce for the best performance on any gamepads.- I haven't played any DMC games before, so this one for me is a blast. Various combo styles and significant number of weapons.- Newbie-friendly. Why? The game saves itself in certain checkpoints, the story is divided into 20 chapters. If you completed the game and want to play it again, you can choose which chapter to do so within main menu.- Badass characters.- High replay value.- You should get Vergil's Downfall too. Very good DLC at a so-so price.Well, that's it. The only downside is that there're not many options for graphic and sound.			"

												Must to say , really badass game , couldn't stop play the whole story with one break of one game.The Story line is awesome , you're a cute person named Dante and your goal is to destroy the demons worldwhice is hard because you got ""stuped"" demons keep away from destroying it.Dante is really cool talker and now how to make you laugh , at least for me.the whole characters are helping you along the game , example - like Kat , she's hot and trying to show you how to enter and get out from Limbo easily without get hurt , Dante and Kat are super duper couple :3The combo system is the best , never seen such hugh amount of moves in one game , more than Mortal Kombat.you can slash , stab , scratch , shoot , punch , fly and anything that makes you feel ""STRONGER"" in Combat.3 kinds of weapons , 2 kinds of demon weapons , 2 kinds of Nephilim weapons , the main sword is the best.Fast slashing but slow killing , whice makes you have fun from killing with it , long kill , great for long combos.Also , this game contain (spelled wrong i think) full controller support , whice makes you enjoy your Xbox \ PS3 controller in the game , it's fun and reminds me playing before long time ago Devil may Cry in my PS2 :PThe graphics are awesome , really perfect world objects , beautiful view (you can see it fromm my pictures) and nice shadows. the game has red , black , white colors mainly because of the real world area and Limbo area whice red way more than the real world. the black and red affects are great and makes you feel like you're really in demons world (in the game :P)ahh, the Music , the PERFECT thing in this game , it's so amazing and awesome with house and dubstep music , playing and doing combos , makes you hiperactive and be focus on the game , the music is managed well in the scenens and you can see that well in the end , i reallly enjoyed the music so far , really amazing.if you think SinglePlayer are waste , most of them maybe , think again about this game , will grab from your free time a lot hours of playing , like from me :3 really cool game , amazing graphics , sounds and affects.

												Never before have I played a game where I actively hated every single character in it with such passion.  While the core gameplay may be good, the context in which it was delivered was so soul-wrechingly awful that I had to ignore it.  I got this game during the CAPCOM anniversary sale, and it was the worst thing I've ever spent $12 on that didn't give me a venerial disease.If you think that My Chemical Romance is the epitome of thrash metal, or are sixteen years old, or have a psychological disorder  that makes you unable to feel basic human emotions such as rage, you may be immune to this garbage.There are not enough words in the English language to describe how truly, truly awful the script and characters in DMC are.  I want to punch the faces of every single person on the writing team.  The writng for this game reads like Japanese ""visual kei"" artist Gackt squatted over a stack of Twilight fan fiction and let loose the most horrific, vile, psyche-destroying diarrhea ever known to man.  If this game had a smell, it would be that of a rotten egg stuffed inside a dead cat's♥♥♥♥♥♥  If it were an ice cream flavor, it would be ""poop.""Mild recommendation to avoid.			"

												Dmc - Devil may cry 5: (8/10) A Hack´n Slay that u dont want to miss! Graphic: (7/10)definitely better detail than in the other dmc´s.why 7/10 ? because its more likely designed like a comic to me.Even more than all other dmc´s together. i dont rly like that tbh.Gameplay: (9/10)Amazing weapons, even though a bit too much tbh.Playing with that Rebilion again is just amazing.Boss fights were a bit unsatisfying. Not enough movesets in my opinion.Enemy design is ok. There are tricky enemies and enemies that are just standard.But the Aquila thingis are a bit cheesy tho. You can stun pretty much ""every"" enemy. Not all but many.Sound: (10/10)Again amazing battle sounds. Clearly that what u want when u fight through that demon waves ;)Character: (5/10)I dont rly like the ""teen"" dante, because he always talks in that modern language and that destroys the atmosphere in my opinion. I´m a huge fan of the old dante,  thats why i cant get over the younger one.As a conclusion i would recommend this game, if you´re a fan of hack´n slays.Amazing sound, good gameplay and decent Bossfights. Only the character design is a desaster in my opinion.Lets wait for the ""real"" dante 5  :)			"

												Remember when combos required stringing moves together, juggling enemies, and employing every move in your arsenal? This game doesn't. Red and blue enemies are a cheap way of forcing you to only use half of your moves, and there is no combo timer. That's right! You can hit an enemy, run and hide in a corner for two hours, then hit him again, and it counts as a combo as long as you didn't get hit in between. This renders the whole combo system refined throughout the series pointless, and rewards slow methodical gameplay in a fast paced action game. Moreover, the developer said he redesigned Dante because the old one ""would get laughed out of modern bars"". What, he thinks edgelord the steel donut wouldn't?*teleports behind you*/10			"

												Hi people keep asking why DmC's combat is bad compared to the old ones.- The grapples make the Stinger basically worthless.- Every gun except Kablooey is useless.- Combo meter is based on damage instead of style now, which means that angel weapons are useless as the meter decays faster than they can cause damage, and everything is about demon weapons. And by ""demon weapons"" I mean ""the Defiler"" because Eryx requires charge moves to be good and even then they don't do much damage.- The controls are really badly designed. Mapping ""modes"" to the triggers means there needs to be two dodge buttons (that both do the same thing) or else reaching the dodge button (which you basically need to be accessible at all times) would be a horrible cluster♥♥♥♥. In order to have two dodge buttons,- they got rid of the lock-on button- It's pathetically easy. I went through my first time on the ""Hard"" equivalent (Nephilim?) and died three times throughout the entire campaign. Twice because they wanted me to jump onto red platforms in a red room with a floor made of red lava and grapple onto red points. The third time was because when I tried to grapple onto an enemy flying above one charging into me, and grappled into the charger instead, because they got rid of the lock-on button.- Man speaking of which, there is a ♥♥♥♥ton of platforming in this game about stylish action.- Color-coded enemies are a dumb gimmick, especially the ones you can only use angel weapons on, because they don't adjust the HP to match, so you just sit there wailing away on one guy forever.But nah, DMC fans are just mad about Dante's hair lol			"

												Honestly, this game is overrated, not just a little bit but a LOT overrated. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but it's not a great game that all critics claim either. It's just above average by a small margin. Ninja Theory took everything that made DMC series great, threw it out of the window and went with their own version and ideas instead. That's not necessarily a bad thing, if the game we got could live up to expectations. Sadly it doesn't in my opinion, and it's inferior to previous installments in every possible way. They took our most favorite DMC characters, Dante & Vergil and turned them into the most despicable morons on the planet. The new characters aren't likable at all, Kat is just laughable and Mundus's ""wife"" is ridiculous. However, it still is on its own worth a purchase, but that's mainly because there's not many other games like this available on PC.Pros: Art design is amazing, the setting and locations are beautiful The combo system is somewhat enjoyable Enemy design and bosses are appealing aesthetically  Platforming sections are fun and exciting Checkpoint system works great and is balancedCons: Character design is god-awful, they're all forgettable and uninteresting Music took a HUGE step backwards with the new industrial/electronic metal crap There's no lock-on system, hitting flying enemies is a nightmare Devil trigger is worthless, except for regenerating health The game is too easy on the highest default difficulty, there's no challenge at all Color-coded enemies that only take damage from specific weapons Boss battles are too short and repetitive Dialog is just ridiculous and plain nonsenseGameplay = 8.5/10 ; Visuals = 8/10 ; Audio = 7/10 ; Music 7/10 ; Story = 5.5/10Verdict: 6.5/10 - Above AverageUnfortunately, I can only recommend this game to hardcore Beat 'Em Up fans because there is not much this game can offer in terms of visuals, story or soundtrack. There's just no reason to play this game if you don't like this genre, story provides zero incentive and the character design is god-awful.			"

												This game was a dissapointment in every way.  Dante is a dissapointment, the story is completely one-dimensional, the face-heel turn is hilariously ham-handed...really the only thing worthwhile is the world they built.  Even the combat is annoying.  The camera auto-locks, they shove all 6 weapons on you at once, and in-depth move sets are not a thing that happens.  And they kept the reliance on the pulling mechanic and ""epic cutscenes"" from DMC4 of which I was not a fan.If you're a fan of the original Devil May Cry series this game just might make you sick.

												Worst game in the DMC game franchise by far, somehow even beating out the ""Press Square to win"" DMC2. The plot is bad, even by DMC standards in addition to a somehow even more bland and unlikable Dante. That aside, as plot and character development has never been one of the franchise's noted high points, the combat is dull and uninteresting with each of the new weapons you get being more or less completely identical to Rebellion (except being less fun) and I almost never used them unless forced to by a color coded enemy that required me to fight them with an unupgraded weapon I didn't want to use (yay). I had additional complaints in mind but they seem to have escaped me as this calzone I just finished eating appears to not be agreeing well with my belly organs. To fans of either the DMC series or those of action badass games, such as God of War or Darksiders kinda, I recommend purchasing either DMC3 or 4 instead of this steaming pile of demon-angel♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oh yeah that's right, this game also hops on the nephilim edgelord preteen angst bandwagon.Overall Rating: 4/10			"

												Devilishly good game. The controls are the best I've used out of any DMC series. They make sense with the story and are smooth as butter with syncing combos together. The weapons are also cool, allowing you to get creative with your attack. I also loved the soundtrack, which went well with the game. I'd strongly suggest picking up a controller and using that instead of a keyboard. At first I didn't get the game because I didn't like the look of Dante, but trust me, there's other skins  and the game is always just so damn fun. It was so good that I was kinda sad when it was over, because I just wanted to play more. I'd definitely recommend this, even for first time DMC players.			"

												Looking through my reviews I noticed this one and realized it was not very good. I only offered a few of the many issues I had with the game. I feel as though I can do better explaining my issues with this game now.---As a fan of this series I was quite heavily disappointed by this game. As a stand alone it would've been okay, at least tolerable. There was no reason to slap Devil May Cry onto the game. Leaving such big shoes to fill and then completely failing to fulfill expectations is like a punch to the face.Story and Characters:The DMC story and lore is quite interesting. It is a world where one of the strongest Demons, Sparda forced all demons back to their world and then seperated the two worlds with his power. In the process he lost his powers and even then continued to fight for justice for humanity until his eventual death. Before his death, having two sons- Vergil and Dante.This reboot throws that interesting story out of the window. DmC took one of the most important characters and ruined him. Sparda in this story is a wimpy demon who had kids with an angel. When Mundus finds out he locks up and humiliates Sparda for the rest of eternity. How could Ninja Theory do this? This is such a huge shift in character and a major issue. In the previous games Dante had the power to take on Mundus because his relation to Sparda and the power he had. However this wimpy Sparda could never hope to stand up to Mundus. Where does DmC Dante get the power to defeat Mundus? Don't try to say that his demon/angel combination of blood made him stronger. Because even if that were true there would be nothing special about Sparda's blood if he's so utterly weaker than Mundus. There is really no reason for Dante to be strong other than Ninja Theory just stating that ""Nephilim are strong"". No setup as to why Nephilim are so great, it's just stated.DmC Dante is another character issue. Ninja Theory went complete opposite of DMC Dante. DMC Dante was fun loving, wild, witty, and over the top. DmC Dante is what happens when game devs ask what a 10 year old CoD player thinks is cool. Edgy, vulgar and boring. Most dialogue goes as follows: ""♥♥♥♥ you"" ""No, ♥♥♥♥ you"", repeat.Vergil is the worst part. Where as DMC Vergil is an honorable warrior who does not use firearms, never attacks from behind, and never fights dirty. Ninja Theory threw all that out the window. DmC Vergil does sniper rifle abortions from a hiding spot on demon mothers. Even after bargaining for peace. Really Ninja Theory? Really? Couldn't think of a way to get any edgier? So you moved to Vergil killing unborn demon babies? Kills me to see them do this to the series. Even if it is a reboot. Also that ending was really unexplained. Vergil suddenly loses it, says that he wants to rule over humanity in Mundus' place and then fights Dante. At least DMC3 explained why Vergil did all he did. Vergil suddenly does a 180 within the last 5 minutes of the game.Kat is Kat. The game would have been the same if she hadn't been in it, she brought almost nothing to the table but semi forced Dante romance and weird Vergil idolization.Mundus is the only decent character in the game. Biggest issue is him is that why is he trying to take over the world using economics and brainwashing? Why doesn't he use his extremely powerful demon powers to force everyone and everything to his will. Really absurd.Dialogue is terrifying, almost as if it was written by a really edgy preteen. Dropping vulgarities like it's going out of style does not make a game cool. Really fun drinking game- take a shot every time Dante or someone else curses. Proceed to die of alcohol poisoning.Gameplay:Extremely important aspect of a third person hack and slash, also the key point of the entire DMC series. DMC gameplay has always been smooth, combo oriented, style heavy, and complex.DmC is none of this. Combos are often broken up by angel/demon enemies. These enemies require you to use angel/demon weapons on them. You'll be in a combo fighting an enemy and suddenly one of these guys will jump in front of you, you'll hit them with the wrong weapon since you're in the middle of doing a move against the original standard enemy and your combo will break. In a game about combos this is not good. It breaks the flow of combat to be required to use a specific weapon against a specific enemy.Combat has been ""dumbed down"". Lack of a lock on contributes. Ninja Theory expected that just hitting the nearest enemy would be good enough and that lock on wouldn't be necessary. Ha ha ha ha... Yeah... No... Achieving high style levels are easier than ever. In prior DMC games you had to introduce variety to your combos in order to get high ranks. You couldn't spam ""YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY+"" to get SSS. But you bet you can do that in DmC, I tried. It worked. Got to SSS by spamming standard attack.DT is also extremely silly. In old DMC games DT changed the characters appearance, made their attacks stronger and faster, evasive moves more effective while maintaining the enemy's strength. DmC DT just nerfs the enemy. It doesn't buff you, make your attacks stronger or faster. It stops time and throws the enemies into the air making them defenseless. How is that a challenge or fun? When DT'd in DMC you still had to keep an eye out for enemies because no matter how awesome DT made you, the enemies were still putting up a fight.Where are the projectile weapons? All you get are Ebony+Ivory. Where's my shotgun? Where's Pandora?No Turbo mode is just depressing. Don't tell me to buy Definitive Edition because it contains all the garbage that should've been in the original game. Funny how Definitive Edition adds mechanics that DMC games had. HMMMMMMMM.....?This game is just so easy. Even the hardest difficulty of DmC barely touches Dante Must Die or normal mode in the other DMC games. Boss fights were the most disappointing part, they barely put up a fight.Optimization:Game worked fine, looked fine and even had beautiful backgrounds in some places. That's the only compliment I can give this game. Looks beautiful in places. Shame the story and gameplay sours it.Overall:Ninja Theory searched for ways to be drastically different from the old DMC games and in their pursuit to be drastically different they forgot the reason the other games were so great. They lost sight of the original material and made a mess of this reboot. I'd be completely okay if I never saw a sequel for this game.I recommend no fan of the DMC series purchase this game. This is not for you.I'd give this game a 1/10.			"

												Enjoyed this game, I like the fact you get to know more about Dante past in the story. Just like the good old Devil may cry games Dante is still the same cocky guy, The combat sytem is amazing you can really have some good fun making your own combos. The Weapons are quite over power considering you get them very soon in the game but getting the upgrades for them are really easy unlike the old devil may cry games.  Do recomend it for the comdey, action and the fun of it.			"

												I love the original Devil may cry games, especially the first three, grew up on them and i know there not the greatest, but i always thought they had a lot of potentional if done right. This however, is by far not what i had in mind, there where certain aspects of it that where nice design and game play wise, but thats as far as it goes. To consider this a true devil may cry game would be a utter joke, and the game was so bad I had to fight myself just to not turn off the game every time i forced myself to play it, in the hopes it would get better, which it only ever got worse very quickly. Please, be smart and dont waist your money. There can be a great Devil may cry game, but its not this, in any way shape or form.			"

												If you don't read plot, can't speak any language the game offers, have never played the DMC series before, think the previous DMC games are too hard, hate Dante, hate Vergil even more, or hate mtn dew, then this is the game for you.Props to its optimization and graphics/environment design. Very smooth to play and some scenes are really cool. But still.***Edit: I want to take some time to recommend DMC4 (SE) here. If you are like me, who read reviews of all games in a series and usually end up getting the one with highest review, you will probably end up getting DmC, which has the best review, but hardly seen as the best game in the series.Now, DmC gets better review than DMC3, DMC4, and DMC4SE on Steam, because 1. DMC3 PC port is actually pretty bad, even though it is arguably the best game of the series, 2. DMC4 players would recommend DMC4SE, which has more content, and 3. DMC4SE's extra content is relatively thin, and old fans don't appreciate that. None of these are actually game issues. DmC, on the other hand, doesn't have these issues, and is an above average ACT game if you compare it to the market. But the plot is just so bad and the gameplay is way under par for a DMC game. I finished it because I'm a DMC fan, and I can't recommend it because I'm a DMC fan.			"

												Okay so let us get right down to it. I bought this game for a friend so that they could play it on my computer when they come over. I never had any intention on playing this game myself. However I did finally end up playing it.Things I like;-Simple combat system once you know the controls, although depending on who is playing they may not like it because all you have to do is mash a few buttons until everything is dead.-The story is fine, I have yet to finish the game I still don't mind the story that much.-The frame rate, a game that doesn't have a locked frame rate will always make me a little happier. My GTX 970 runs the game at a respectable 150-200 FPS.-The music, might be a turn off for some, but doesn't bother me.Things I don't like;-The camera, it has a weird tendency to just stop moving and get stuck in one place at random times, happens in combat a lot.-The hit boxes are extremly large and I also noticed that you don't actually touch the floor.-The stock controls. Now this may just be my copy that for some reason had weird controls or just the fact that I am used to WASD, but that was not the control scheme once I had first intalled the game.-The enemies, they just recycle models and change some small things like colours and what they can do.-The story telling can sometimes be a bit compy.So over all reading those lists some of them are pretty small things like the enemies' models. However things like the camera getting stuck in combat and the jumps sometimes be difficult to land (Could be just me). These are things that break a game for me. Well no the game itself is not the most broken game every, many others have that honour. The game itself is just not very playable for me. I will still continue to play the game until I finish and it is certainly a good time waster, however unless you get the game on sale I personally just don't think that it is worth 34.99$			"

Visually appealing, yet some game design choices make the game suffer as a wholeGame was good, until you start fighting enemies that need to be DAMAGED and KILLED with only specific weapons, and most of the time you get multiple enemies with different ""weaknesses"". Breaks the game flow completely and makes a fun game frustrating with it's poor enemy design choices. Flying enemies with shields I can forgive, but something that fundamentally undermines why DmC is fun in the first place (combat flow), I just can't bring myself to finish the game, because those damn elemental enemies kill the extremely fun combat the game had before introducing one of the worst game design choices EVER.PROS:- Sleek visuals- Great combat flow (until you start meeting ""elemental"" enemies)- Vergil- Interesting take on a story with lots of social commentary on modern society- Quality level design- Replay valueCONS: - Elemental enemies- Dante is uninteresting and lacks his charm from previous games. His new look didn't bother me.- Soundtrack is a very mixed bag. Mostly just annoying dubsteb with a little bit of metal in-between- Too much emphasis on the weird pull/get pulled hook mechanic.- Easy bossesConclusion:It's definitely not as bad, as the series ""fans"" make it to be, however there's lots of justifiable hatred towards it, especially when it comes to the enemy design. I really liked the game, until those freaking elemental enemies just killed my interest in this game. What a shame.			"

												I like the game, it has an atractive look and the story, it's however not without flaw.  The combat could have been smoother with the character stuttering between combos, especially the dodge roll.  I also feel the combat was needlessly complex splitting what could have easilly been a couple weapons/tools into multiple weapons that required constant switching durring the game notably havving two grappling hooks... why did there need to be litteraly two or more of each wapon type?  The games combat mechanics encourgae the player to avoid speciallizing in any one combat style and instead use every weapon available on a rotation, which I found to be clumsy and anoying, breaking my imersion in the fight while I desperatly tried to remember the different combos of each weapon and how best to use them.  The game goes for something similar to God of War in it's play style but misses the mark in a painful way.  If you are a fan of the DMC series you'll probably like this game, but for me I think I would say wait for a sale before jumping in to this reboot.			"

												Unfortunately I can't recommend this, coming from someone who loved DMC3, 4, and Bayonetta, so I'm no newcomer to the franchise.I'll keep it brief. The biggest issue getting in the way of enjoyment is that there is NO. MANUAL. TARGETING. This leads to incredibly frustrating and unwieldy combat, and makes something as basic as target prioritization nearly impossible with more than a handful of enemies on screen.There was a newer version released for consoles which added a manual targeting mode, but which unfortunately never made its way to PC. Being forced to reduce difficulty due to a sloppy control scheme which is a huge step back makes this game very disappointing overall. Very disappointing experience for a series veteran.			"

												It has always been a worry of mine whenever a different dev takes over one of my favorite game series. I'll start out by saying, even though there were a few things taken out in this DmC game that are unlike other DmC games, you still have a very nice and fun DmC experience. The combos feel very satisfying to nail and they look absolutely great. They feel great, they look absolutely stunning, and they give you a very very satisfying feel. The combos that are even tougher to hit are the ones that feel even better when you actually do get them. The style of the game is great as well. Just like the various other DmC games, this one really hit the nail on the spot when capturing the same style that other titles had. The world is very convincing, and the visuals within the world are amazing. The graphics are superb and the controls feel very nice and responsive as well. But the upgrade system that allows you to get further combos are still there. The game is shorter compared to the others in the series, and although this is no Devil May Cry 4, it is still a compelling experience. There is also no lock on feature, at least from what i've seen. Which is kind of a shame but still, It is a ton of fun to jump into and start killing some baddies, and even though the new Dante is a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you play the game you start to see his more sensitive side and you can kind of become more attached to him.TLDR; +Sick combos+Superb style+Spectacular visuals-No lock-on-Campaign is a little shortOverall:8.9/10			"

												Well Well what do we have here? Devil may Cry short DMCLots of action, kinda reminds me of some hack´n slay games. It follows a straight story line. Dante has to save the world from the super evil demon king guy xD Graphics are good. The music rocks all the time. Dante is one of those guys who are badass as ♥♥♥♥ with some lame l´jokes along the way xD The level design is a bit like running through corridors but it kind of fits in with the rest :3It is alot of fun!---Giving 8 out of 10 Pina Points!

												Huge fan of the DMC series and I have to say I have never understood the hate for this game. What this was advertised as was a reboot, and one that would make some stylistic changes so that a new company didn't try to just replicate an old formula. My favorite DMC game was the first, and the darker side of this game felt more in line with that. I love the level design, the combat system is fun, and the boss fights were varied enough that they never felt the same. I would definetely recommend this to anyone who can look past its differences and just enjoy the game.			"

I don't know why this game got so much hate. Personally i think the ne Dante is better. I played all the other Dmc's loads when i was younger. Dmc 1 was the first Ps2 game i had but i think this Dmc is the best out of them all.			"

												80 % of the game you will go from A to B using series of predefined grappling points and hit stuff on walls for in game currency, while you bump into cinematics more often than not which just completely breaks the game flow. On top of it most of these are absolute cringe-worthy ones. The main character is, as other reviewers described well, a rebellious little brat who tries to act tough, cool and edgy all the time. The amount of cliche you will be drowned in is incredible. From the villain to dantes family to dante himself.Occasionally you also fight a few enemies. And the only challenging thing about them is the extremely annoying shield that forces you to pick a particular weapon to break it before being able to damage them. They made individual enemies just excessively complex whereas the older DMCs would throw a lot of them at you, but with more freedom in your choice on how to deal with them, catering to your own demands for particular combat styles. Some had weaknesses towards a particular firearm, but they wouldn't just interrupt your flow so abruptly if you tried to hit them with something else.			"

												Better then all the other DMC games combined. Treat yourself to one of the best action games of the decade.The Stage design is bar none the best I have EVER seen.The action leaves me wanting for nothing.Turn your speakers up cause the music is fricking awesome.The story is good for an action game.I just can't think of anything to mention that would detract from the game.With each passing stage it gets uppped a notch and just gets better and better.\Some of the best and original boss fights I have ever had the privilege of playing.I like this Dante. He is just a punk kid.Not the bebop super cheesy guy from number 3.If you havent figured it out this is one of the best games I have EVER played.HAVE FUN!			"

												This is a great game if you're looking for something that has no difficulty. Once you get the Aquila, you can just use the move round trip to spam infinites. The axe makes any other weapon useless since it outputs too much damage, and once you get the grenade gun, there's never a reason to use any other gun. The game has 2 dodge buttons instead of one dodge, and one lock on. This was fixed in the definitive edition.... which is console only, so that doesn't apply for the PC version. The story is a blatant ripoff of They Live. Do yourself a favor and watch that instead. The dialog from all of the characters in this game is just cringey, and Dante comes off as creepy in some parts.Overall, I'd give the game a 4/10. Play DMC1, DMC3, DMC4, Bayonetta 1, Bayonetta 2, Nier: Automata. Even Bayonetta on PS3 is more worth it than playing DmC.			"

												Although Dante may have changed apearance, this game has all the making of a DMC game. Although there are more jumping puzzles than normal, the combat and story definitly make up for that flaw. The major letdown is that this title seems to be a step down on difficulty. Older fans of the series might be a bit dissapointed with the characters aswell but I feel this is mainly because of the weight the former versions had behind them.			"

												This is my very first review of a game on steam.... so please dont criticize,Now with that being said, coming from a sports game which i only played on console; i never really got into story games deeply. My favorite game for story would have been Batman Arkham City, but that my friends has changed. I knew of DMC from previous games and watched the anime which definitely sparked alot of interest. Wanted to try this game and man if every dmc game was like this i would stop playing madden lol.Havent finished the game yet so i wont give full review but dang this game is amazing. Lots of action and humor, but thats not what keeps me into it. Its the story, this game could be a potential movie if they wanted to...even character models are spot on.Again ill give a full review once im done but from this....YOU GOTTA BUY THIS GAME GUYS LOL			"

												I must start by saying that I thought I would like it more than I did just because I was expecting it to be a bit more open/fresh.  That being said, I did however have a pretty good time with the 7 hour single player game.Its main drawback is that it really didn't grow since the previous Devil May Cry games.  The game length, gameplay, combat, and map design are all the same basic idea/concept.  The only major changes are in the graphics, story line, and voiceacting.  The actors/charactors say a lot of cliche things but it still comes out as funny and cheeky.The basic idea - go through short, straight stages while collecting items from monsters and the enviroment.  You use the items to unlock doors or purchase upgrades.  There is a ton of weapons and upgrades... so many weapons to upgrade you get them through the whole game and some near the end of the game.  Most of the upgrades are not major but noticable.With so many mechanics and weapon juggling - it can get a bit confusing at times.  Using a Xbox360 controller I would suggest as a requirement.I had a good time and kept thinking... I'll just play one more stage and ended up playing three more.  I'd recommend it to folks who love third person beat em up games.			"

												DMC was a fresh reboot of an old series, I like the modern feel with metal dubstep and the punk feel of dante. However with that parts of original DMC got left behind with having cinematics be a major focus in the new game, too much running scenes and i really wish they would of kept running on walls. it felt more trapped with non reactive enviroment. overall though i enjoyed it. good spin on story but i like the darker ancient feel of the old games			"

												In my opinion, this is a fun take on the traditional hack-and-slash. While very much unlike the original Devil May Cry's, Ninja Theory provided an eyeful graphics wise while CombiChrist and Noisia give your ears plenty of chew on. Cheesy lines abound, the story in this game is engaging (if not one we may have heard before in other games). The Son of Sparda has an actual conscience in this game. Goths rejoice at the soundtrack, graphics. Take yourself back to the time when you enjoyed going to the underground clubs because this will definitely do that for you. Low, mid or high settings! It doesn't matter. It all looks good, in my opinion. If you are like me, however, the replayability is somewhat low unless you absolutely must do the challenges which are fun in their own right. Otherwise, you can play it once and come back later to remember why you enjoyed this game.Second time I've played through this game and I love it still.			"

												As much as people slam this game, and as different the plot and setting is, it still does DMC as DMC should be done, and a crazy fun time, even if you cannot stand new Dante and want the old fun one back.			"

An entertaining hack-and-slash game.You're a demon/angel hybrid that fights demons to try and avenge your family.The music keeps the fighting intense as it plays screamo music, with an insane amount of moves, weapons, and perfect gameplay mechanics that give you freedom to move and kill in the way you want much like Kingdom Hearts.The reason why this DmC game is so hard is that your health does not regenerate. Unless you either beat the level entirely, buy potions (which affect your score AND get more expensive every purchase), or finding a RARE red skull for one bar of health. So not taking any damage is key which makes it very challenging.Being sucked into limbo and fighting the same things over and over does get very tedious though. Still, it is a fun game.8/10 "

												If you're not buying this classic cause the main character doesn't have white hair than you're an idiot. This game does so much justise for the dying series that it blows my mind the feedback it received due to Dante having black hair (Angry Joe logic). Capcom's community is too stubborn already. It's sad this game didn't get the amazing respect it deserved for it's refined combat, and awesome boss fights. Not to mention their is actually a story this time in the series that's perfect for a hack 'n slash game like this. In general if you're looking for probably the BEST hack 'n slash game on steam currently it's hand's down DMC. (For me anyways since I've searched constantly for a better hack 'n slash game that can be on the same level as DMC & Metal Gear Rising for steam) It's pretty upsetting that this masterpiece will never get the sequel it deserves. Atleast Ninja Theory is still kicking and working on other games.			"

												The refreshed Devil May Cry game is back and better than ever in my opinion. It is a hack'n slash game with rpg elements and 20 missions. During missions there are a lot of hidden items (lost solus, secret keys and doors) to be found for achievements and rewards. You get style points during combat, the nore badass you are the more points you get. At the end of a mission your final score is calculated and uploaded to the leaderboard. Secret missoins are only available if you find the hidden keys and doors. Enemies are diverse, and sometimes difficult to defeat. Boss fight are excellent. Recommended game for players who like hack and slash games. 8/10.			"

												This game is both a blessing and a curse, and here's why.First of all, let me say that this is ""Devil May Cry"" for casual gamers. This is basically how DMC2 was, and is probably a lot of the reason behind the hate for this game. You will earn style easily by spamming a couple of moves or even by shooting, there is not much freedom of style later on due to specific enemies all having to die with specific movesets/grabs in specific ways, it's slow, and it all sort of falls apart from there. This is its curse.Don't even get me started on the platforming, the simplified bosses, and that god awful camera.Now before you !TRIGGER! and hit that NO button, please read further first.From all the crap that they smashed together and ended up making another DMC2/Darksiders with, there is some diamond within the ashes. First of all, the combat is definitely more cinematic. I'm not talking about the bosses. I'm talking about when you're finished killing someone, the scene closes up on (Vergil/Dante) quickly glancing behind him, and bam, more demons. Cinematic transitions like that are just awesome. While the acting behind basically every main character was virtually garbage, the cutscenes were actually pretty great. The city felt fleshed out, the antagonist (both of them) did things in rather creative ways, and it was a breath of fresh air from the ""Demon becomes God, then dies"" plot that virtually every other DMC had.The DLC (Vergil's Downfall) was a nice ""return to roots"" with a lot of the old Vergil's moveset, refining itself so well that even Capcom couldn't deny it when they used a lot of it for DMC4:SE's Vergil. ♥♥♥♥ Devil Mode, though.As much as I hate this game and its cushiony, casual feel to it, I'm still going to recommend it for the same reason I'd recommend someone to play DMC2. It's not a gem in the series, but the mechanics implemented bring a lot of ideas that have and will evolve later entries, and it's worth taking a look at it for that reason.Also because Combichrist is in it.7/10. For anyone that is well aware of how difficult DMC games are and wants to start somewhere easier.			"

Sometimes during bootup or in the menu but most of the time during the battle and that's just awful.I tried all available fixes that are available and nothing helped. "

												The hardest thing about replaying the game on higher difficulties settings is the boredom. So many unskippable scenes! There's also parts where the game caps your running speed because shame on you for trying run away from dialogue you've heard before!In addition to unskippable scenes, the game has the ridiculous habit of letting things ""go on"" as you wait for your screen to return from black. Repeatedly on mission 10, I kept coming out the cutscene only to find Danta having walked off a ledge. I don't know how they let that in. To a new player, it'd feel like they'd spawned you only to kill you. As to a single playhrough, the voice acting or writing is just painfully awful at parts. (Things are either over-acted or have a unnatural word choice for a modern setting). The platforming is also a very annoying chore since Dante doesn't have much ups for being part angel, and his grapples (Demonic Pull/Angelic Lift) have odd targeting delays as you try to chain grapple movements together during platforming.The controls on keyboard+mouse do not feel good, and the default gamepad controls go against the ""standard"" in actions games. (The left button is your gun instead of your standard melee, and the top button is basic melee instead of alt melee. Also, there's two evade buttons, down on the D-pad does nothing by default, and  the Angelic mode (LT) vs Demonic (RT) mode mechanic does not feel as well implemented as that of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow's Light mode vs Dark mode, which is a game that came earlier than this one.)As for the combat, it's alright; not terrible, but it's no where close to the most fun I've ever had. The enemy desigin is a bit boring since a lot of enemies are re-skins of others and have a broken doll motif; (it's very lackluster for a game where demons and angels are real.) Mentioned earlier, the binary mode mechanic feels better done in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. As for how the game fits in the action-adventure genre, I would recommend Castlevania: Lords of Shadow or God of War over this.UPDATE: Got all the achievements in the Vergil's Downfall DLC. It's even less fun than the main game since: ■ There's a bug where Vergil can't perform a regular rising strike. ■ His Devil Triggers offer less security than Dante's Devil Trigger.■ The targetting on his projectiles is subpar since it can literally pick the wrong platform to materialize during platforming.■ On the subject of platforming, Vergil doesn't have a regular double jump; (he still has a way to get high, but I don't know why they made it less intuitive).■ A lot of his attack animations are slow and long compared to Dante equivalents; (it's especially bad for his standard melee).■ His dodging is just awful compared to Dante's. The immunity window seems even shorter than Dante's regular dodge, and Vergil's dodge can be cut short if there's an enemy in his path.■ You will take hits from enemies outside of your view. This happens sometimes in the main game (especially against harpies), but it's more common in Vergil's downfail since there's more harpies and enemies that like perfoming 2-hit combos.■ The main boss fight in the DLC (mission 5), is a lot cheaper than any of the bosses in the main game. He has 2 attacks that are extremely hard to dodge; projectile swords which you can't destroy with your projectiles, and a dive bomb kick that interrupts Vergil's dodge and forces Vergil to take damage. There's also this annoying bit where he teleports away and you need to repeatedly have great timing in dodge a ring of projectile swords; it's a lot less forgiving than anything in the main game.

												Take my playtime with a grain of salt, I was initially playing a nonsteam version of the game.Prejudice kept me from playing this game for 2 years.I love the ""Stylin' Dante"" of the old games, but my god was I being a ♥♥♥♥ing numbskull. ""New Dante"" or ""Edgy Dante"" shouldn't really be compared to Stylin' Dante because he's much, much younger. This Dante isn't sure who he is yet, so many of his jokes fall flat or come off like he's trying too hard. I feel that was intentional.They also reworked the design for him based on fan feedback, which makes the poor sales of this game even sadder in my opinion. Its clear Ninja Theory adores the original franchise, as so much of this plays like a love letter to those games. They listened to the fans as much as they could, and people still bash this game without even playing it.Admittedly, I was the same way until a good friend promised me I would like it, so I ""borrowed"" it, and was blown away. The story is better than folks say, and is decently engaging. I found the reason the world viewed Dante as a threat far more interesting than the previous games, and the visuals are very different than any urbanesque game I had played before. It shares the feeling of Brutal Legend ""Am I playing through an Album Cover?""I felt that a lot of events in this game kept me guessing, either through new enemy types of plot twists. Overall it was just a really fun experience.Recommended Price - 15-25 dollarsOverall Story - 7/10Gameplay - 9/10Visuals -  10/10Writing - 6/10 (-2 points for judicious use of ♥♥♥♥ you instead of clever quips)Enemy Variety - 10/10Vergil's Downfall Review - Its alright.

												I was expecting to hate this. I've heard about how on rails it is, I've heard about how little choice there is.Screw that.This is an amazing game - it's like an interactive movie.It's a rarity that a game does this well on the empowerment fantasy.I felt like a badass almost every step of the way, from mission 1 to the end, I felt like I was kickass, nothing could stop me, and all the baddies could do was slow me down (which they did).I played on easy mode, because my goal was to have fun, and fun was to be had!I never had to resort to a guide for the next step - it's not a puzzle oriented game, although you could immerse for more time hunting down achievements, of whcih there are plenty.Good, old fashioned smash the baddies fun.No guilt tripping.Great game, solid graphics, corfe mechanics are well executed.(The DLC is kind of meh - Dante(main game) has a depth of tools and fighting styles that makes him fun. Virgil(DLC) lacks that depth, he requires a lot more finesse to do well with, but I finished both and don't regret the purchases.)			"

												20% spiderman + 20%portal + 50% hack'n slash + 10% capcom = DmCthe gameplay is cool , but the story isn't but i like its idea a little bit  , this is the easiest DMC game i've ever played , i've finished it in 9 hours ( nephilim mode ) .. they removed the style changing system and replaced it with a demon and angel mode which gives options to new combos . the secret missions are now accessible just from the main menu , you just need to visit them in-level for the first time and they are repetetive , they just differ in the level/atmosphere/ennemies unlike the secret missions in the original  games , this is one of the reasons why i think its the easiest devil may cry game ....the graphics are beautiful , the soundtrack fits with its scene/moment ingame , and it also offers a new mode : the training mode , where you can train combos in it  without entering a mission , also , i liked the idea about letting you : trying a move before upgrading/buying it from the shop , so see if you like/dislike it and to avoid some cases like if you find it difficult to be inputed :)7.5/10			"

												Got a controller? Buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥It's not necessarily a long game, and the replay value is totally dependant on how much you can play through a game without getting bored..But out of the sheer level of polish in the combat and platforming, a great aesthetic consistency between Limbo and the real world, and some.. surprisingly tolerable character development, this game is pretty damned good.Also, the final boss-fight alone makes this game worth a buy. Do it!Or don't. It's your money. Summer sale's soon, anyways.			"

												Was looking forward to getting this game after playing DMC3 and DMC4.The description of this purchase is very misleading. This is not a game, this is a lightly interactive story,For every 5 minutes you play you get 10 minutes of cutscenes. Oh and you can't skip the cinematics either.The final fight is 1v1 with about 5 cutscenes if not more.I've played this game through I got bored with it in between and quit it a few times. I really don't recommend it.			"

												Well first off it's poorly optimized, I have a brand new PC and could only run the game on low settings without getting FPS drops and lagging/stuttering, secondly it's next to impossible to play this with a PS4 controller. It claims that it offers ""Full Controller Support"" but I had an impossible time re-binding the keys to the PS4 controller in-game, whenever I had them re-binded they wouldn't stay and would automatically reset to default. For example the jump button was binded to the square button and the shoot button was binded to the circle button, if I tried binding the jump button to the cross button it wouldn't stick.It seems I'm part of a small majority as most people didn't have trouble with the controllers or the game, not sure if it's my processor or what. I've heard some games run poorly if you have certain processors, but my MAIN issue was the HORRIBLE CONTROLS, ""Full Controller Support"" my butt. Though it seems that the error lies with me since most people didn't seem to have a problem playing the game, either way the controls in the game are terribly optimized and the game itself seems poorly optimized as well. And another thing I noticed is the controller sensitive was entirely too high, I couldn't navigate menus properly because the sensitivity was set so high it'd skip over certain options if I moved the control stick.

												From the little I've played so far I can see it's still an edge filled hack and slash. While it is a little bit of a bummer that Dante's appearance has been radically altered, it's not so bad if you approach it as a spin-off or re-imagining.The gameplay has been fluid and the cutscenes still over the top.Slaughtering hordes as the new FallOutBoyFan69 Dante is much more satisfying than playing as Nero ever will be.Why didn't you just make him look the same Capcom?..

												Ah, DMC.  First of all, let's just get this out of the way.  This game should not have been called DMC or Devil May Cry.  If it wasn't, it probably would have sold more and wouldn't have gotten such bad press.I could see this working if this was more of a side story to DMC, but by rebooting the series and taking it into this direction I can clearly see why the fanbase went ballistic.  Dante looks TERRIBLE (in my opinion) and just way to EMO!  Virgil, Dante's brother is also just... out of place from the original.  BUT! Ignoring all that, the game is quite solid.  I will admit it is fun to play and it runs like a dream on a PC due to having that smooth 60FPS action.  The keyboard and mouse work quite favorably as does using a joypad.I recommend this game more for its gameplay rather then story.  If you can just ignore the fact that it's supposed to be a DMC game you may find it enjoyable.  It really didn't help that the designer of this game (Tameemi Antoniades) insulted the fan base.  Hopefully Capcom/Ninja Theory will be a little wiser with their PR in the future.			"

												Best DmC game to date. The gameplay is just fantastic and deeper than the previous installments of the franchise. They have also got rid of the anime wannabe Dante and replaced him with the much cooler ""Donte"". THe story reminds me alot of classic drama like Othello or Hamlet, very Shakespearean. I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys good games and are not lame nerds. Donte out.			"

												DMC: Devil May Cry is a reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise, following an original storyline, with essentially a similar cast of characters and general premise. The game is an action slash and shoot style game where you will spend the majority of your time in senseless combat. The combat system in this game is actually quite good, there are several weapons which can be used and you can toggle between them almost instantly for insane combos. The combat feels fluid and the controls are solid when you are using a controller, yet the keyboard and mouse controls are less than stellar. There is however almost too much variety and you will sometimes struggle to perform the correct action as you fly from button to button mid combat. The cinematics are actually well done, and although the story is poorly written and predictable at best, the cinematics give it a movie-esque feel. The game is relatively short but offers a decent amount of gameplay and variety of enemies. Overall it is a decent buy if purchased on sale, and one of the better DMC games.			"

												 This is one of the best Devil May Cry games available. The criticism against it mostly centers on Capcom's decision to transform the iconic character of Dante. I promise, it's just a cosmetic change. No, he does not look like a gothic anime villain and he does not spend his time hunting demons in medieval castles. Aside from that, he's the same Dante he's been since DMC 3. Yes, he has attitude, but it's not as over-the-top as it used to beThis game is seriously so good. I wanna rub my whole body with this game. I fell in love with this game from the very start and im really glad i bought it Worth every penny			"

												Probably the best hack and slash I've ever played. Killing demons is an absolute joy! As a big fan of DMC4, this definitely made it into my top all time favourites.The good:+ Superb, amazing combat!+ Dante is actually pretty cool and fun.+ Platforming is solid and doesn't get boring.+ Other characters and villians do their roles really well.+ Soundtrack is beast!+ Runs splendidly, even on weaker PCs.+ Story is pretty decent and engaging.+ Replay value with Bloody Palace, DLC and harder (unlockable) story modes.+ Have a bad day? Best stress reliever ever.+ New to hack and slash games or DMC? Good game to start.+ Funny lol. Dante and Vergil make a good duo.The not-so-good:- Butt hurt Devil May Cry fanboys who don't want give the reboot a chance may ruin your mood.- First play through maybe a little on the easy side for the really hardcore players.Rating: 9.5/10			"

												I can belive this what the Japanese think the Americans want. Too bad Steam doesn't have a return polocy. The game is too over the top, storyline seems stupid. Why does The Devil look like Michael Chicklas from ""The Shield""? Why are my controles 90 degrese off of what the game is telling me. Why does Dante live in a trailer by the Beach like Jenifer Garner's Dad in ""The Rockford Files"". James Rockford was a womanizer in the 70s but not nearly as bad of a doushe as Dante in the first opening movie.			"

												This game is kinda reflects my world view I believe in.Other than that, it's a perfect game. Never played the previous DMC's, but this one got me when I first saw it's trailer. And why do I think it's perfect?-The combat system is exemplary, no other similar game can reach this quality and fluency. Tons of weapons, even more combos, and it's so badass I can't even compare to other games. -The graphic, design and details are amazing. There are more ideas and creativity in this game than in all the CoD and Battlefield series together.-11-15 hours isn't that long, but the story keeps some twists and definitely worth your attention. -Never faced any bugs. -The fights are challenging, I started on hard (nephilim) but had to change back to an easier mode during two bossfights. And there are many other hard and ultra hard modes for the hardcore.- This game was built for re-playability. There are secret rooms on the first maps what you can only open with unique weapons you'll get later in the game.  You can't unlock many comcept arts simply because you can't kill enough through one walkthrough. And I must mention those certain achievements as well. F*** all the haters, this game is absolutely great, go buy it now!			"

												Second worst game bearing the devil may cry name, a series has a certain established standard that intentionally wasn't met with the gameplay, Don't like saying it, but dumbed down would explain it perfectly, pre patch was full of glitches and easily abusable ranks in combat and that led into easily obtainable SSS ranks for missions. Only one of those things was fixed in a patch and it was the glitch that enabled massive breaks. Game is too easy on any difficulty.  3/10 would not bang.			"

												Even if some people may say the new dante is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I highly prefer this one. But this is not what makes this game a stand alone from all the others Hack and Slash. This game's combat is incredibly fun. Offering many differant combos and tons of upgrades. The soundtracks of this game are simply amazing enough to keep you into the action until the end. The story line is very well interprated. The voice acting is amazing. The graphics look gorgeous. The only thing that I find bad about this game is that you would prefer playing with a controller instead of a keyboard but it is still manageble with the keyboard nevertheless.Overall review: 9/10 Buy it if you hitch for a good Hack and Slash game. This game really stands out.			"

												DmC: Devil May Cry is a reboot of the famous Devil May Cry series. It stars Dante, son of Sparda, who is the son of a demonic father and an angelic mother. You will see how demons and angels merge as the story progresses. Dante’s lifestyle is that of a playboy, living a life of booze, parties, and sex. The story centers around two other characters: Kat, the psychic, and Vergil, Dante’s brother. The story truly evolves when Kat and Vergil meet up with Dante in place called Limbo.The combat in the game is generally about the use of melee weapons and your ability to use combos against the various demons. The combat is entertaining enough that it makes DmC: Devil May Cry a fun reboot in the aggregate. You begin to learn the basics of melee combat with the Rebellion sword. Melee turns into learning so many different moves so that you can score style points under the game’s scoring system. Eventually, other melee weapons come into play and they are demon based as wells as angel based. This is when combat becomes even more important since some demons are vulnerable only to demonic weapons and other demons are vulnerable only to angelic weapons.The story includes world domination, evil, love and conspiracy theories. The characters are pretty good because their voiceovers are excellent. The cutscenes display drama and the characters tend to walk a fine line between good and evil as the plot is well detailed.The missions are quite linear, but they are never boring since they are diverse enough and lack tedium. In one mission you are fighting demon hordes in a city that appears to be crumbling. In another mission you are inside the offices of a TV network where you must face groups of demons as you go from one office to another. The melee weapons eventually include a Rebellion and Osiris. The Rebellion is a demonic axe with plenty of power, but at the expense of speed. The Osiris is an angelic weapon with plenty of speed. Both weapons can be used to lift demons in the air and you can jump into the air to score major chain combos for the most style points. The idea of the scoring system is to vary your attacks, chain your combos, and finish off the demons in short order. The style points are displayed on the screen while you are in the heat of battle with SSS being the highest possible grade for your combat performance. I used the mouse/keyboard controls throughout the game and they were smooth. I got used to the controls pretty quickly, but it takes time to master the moves, including platforming. There is a lot of jumping from platform to platform and that includes angel lifts and angel boosts. Angel lifting is the jumping from platform to platform using Dante’s grappling hook on blue circles. Angel boosting is jumping and flying/boosting above large gaps to reach a faraway platform. One interesting weapon that Dante acquires later in the game is the Aquila, an angelic weapon that can be used for melee and can be thrown to cut through vines.Completionists will always find something to do in each mission. To complete 100% of each mission you will have to return to a mission to collect keys that will open doors to secret missions and free lost souls waiting to be liberated. The secret missions require keys that reflect the difficulty of each secret mission. Copper keys are keys that open doors to the easiest secret missions. Argent keys open doors to more challenging secret missions. Gold keys are for the hardest secret missions. The secret missions are short and can help you practice your moves. I learned from the secret missions that Dante’s combat moves are easy to learn, hard to master. Some challenges include killing all demons without taking a hit and scoring hits only by using demon evade, a well-timed way of evading demon attacks while armed only with a demonic weapon such as the Arbiter.The boss fights are entertaining in their own right, although they are formulaic. You fight bosses while learning their moves so that you figure out how to defeat them. One boss near the end of the story, Mundus, is quite convincing as a mean monster since the voiceover is superb. The one minor problem with combat against either bosses or other demons is that sometimes the camera angles can get in the way, preventing you from seeing everything in the spur of the moment. However, this problem is so minor it doesn’t take much away from the entertainment value of the combat. I think DmC: Devil May Cry is worth your time since the combat is well choreographed and the controls are excellent. If there are problems with combat it is usually because the timing of the combos is not right. It takes plenty of practice to master the different combos. The varied missions are entertaining and will never bore you. The game has more replay value if you decide to play Vergil’s Downfall DLC, which stars Dante’s brother Vergil.			"

												A great game that's just begging to be a franchise. A badass tone mixed with killer combat makes this title feel unique.BreakdownGameplay: 9/10. There's a surprising amount of depth, and learning and testing new combos is always fun.Graphics and Art Style: 10/10. It looks fantastic, and the whole game seems to have this sort of punk-fantasy fusion that is just epic.Music and Sound Design: 7/10. Nothing really stands out, but without fail the metal track in the background makes fghts that much more exciting.Writing: 8/10. Aside from a cheesy line here and there, the dialogue is pretty solid, as is the plot.Stability and Glitch Control: 10/10. The game is smooth as butter, and I never encountered one bug.Overall score: 8.8/10.As a newcomer to the franchise, this game is a great base to make a few good sequels. I've got my eye on you, Ninja Theory.			"

												Out of all the DMC games I would say that this one is my second favourite underneathe the first original game on PS2. I think the reboot is a nice, modern, western take on a very cool and mythical story. The new characters a very likeable, the graphics are great, and on PC the frame rate is a non-issue (some people disliked the console version being locked to 30 fps, though having played this game on both consoles and PC I can safely say that while 60 fps+ is the better experience, 30 fps is still enjoyable).No multiplayer to speak of but a satisfying, decently sized single player campaign with a decent story and addictingly fun combat with good controls (keyboard & mouse do just fine but a gamepad is more preferable in my personal opinion) make this game worth it in my opinion. I'd definitely recommend this to people who like hack & slash games.			"

												Played nearly every game this year that was high rated, none comes close to the visual feast that this game provides, if you like skillshot hack and slash then this game is the best of its kind. One of my top picks for 2013 and a game that is so underrated its not funny. i played it with a controller and it was a blast, when you start to link together complex combos the feeling of satisfaction that you will gain is immense. this game is an amazing hidden gem.Story - 9Gameplay - 10Visuals - 10Replay - 9A solid game, much better than its predecessors and a game worthy of being titled best in its class and also one of the best releases of 2013.Ed Note-I understand the community is split over this game, half think this game is too easy, combos are to easy and pretty much hate it, the other half loves it. Well, heres my opinion as someone who played all games, the previous dmc games wernt that good, backtracking, horrid story, cheesy dialogue and overtly japanese themes. Yes, they had a great combat system, but thats what the game was known for anyway, This reboot helps to streamline combat and fix up the obvious lackings of the previous series. Consider this game an americanized reboot, i think its much better.			"

If is not broken, DON'T fix itthe gameplay is amazing! and controls are great in many aspectsBut NOTHING can make up for that story!the worse protagonist ever to be playable,  the characters are relatable as stepping on poo, you don't want to be the one and don't want to help who have, the over use of swearing was intended to make the characters more human, but only made them more jerks than anyone in any game, for an @$$hole, DONTE only needs an apple, and all the great things about the original game were completely lost, no longer the classic trip through the entire castle just to open a door, all we do here is jump some plateaus and fight our way to a portal; I could accept this game if were just a gauntlet with no more than 10 cut-scenes in total, like the original game, the gameplay alone worth buying this game, but anything else, either sound, graphics, dialog, environment, and anything that makes a game, this game don't have.

It's not a good DMC game, but it's not the worst DMC game.  It is however the best western action game available.			"

DmC Devil May Cry may not have lived up to the hopes from a lot of long time fans of the series but the reboot in my honest opinion is still a fantastic game. There are some problems with the gameplay but overall the game is fantastic and is a must own in anyone's library.DmC is a combo based Hack and Slash, Action Adventure game that is a reboot of the long running series Devil May Cry. In this game you play as Dante, a half demon/half angel Nephilim that while learning about his origins fights his way through demons to get to the demon king. As stated since DmC is a hack and slash combo game you must master combos of various weapons in order to kill waves of demons and get a higher combo score. This Combo score is scored on a lettering system which is in the order of Dirty, Cruel, Brutal, Anarchic, Savage!, SSadistic!! and SSSensational!!!. The higher the combo score the more XP you get in order to upgrade Dante's weapons which include his sword, Rebellion, his demon weapons Arbiter (Axe) and Eryx (Gloves), his angel weapons Osiris (Scythe) and Aquila (Shuriken) and his ranged weapons Ebony & Ivory, Revenant and Kablooey. Along with upgrading these weapons you have the ability to unlock new combos that you can use to more effectively kill demons and get a higher combo score. In order to get a higher combo score you must mix up combos and weapons without getting hit by an enemy. Despite it being a bit complex it is nowhere near the complexity of the original Devil May Cry games which is a big reason a lot of long time fans were not happy about the reboot. Along with the dumbing down of the combat it is also a lot easier to get a SSS rank which takes a lot of the challenge out of a hack and slash combo game. Another quirk that was a problem with this game was the color coded enemies. This severely limited your options of what weapons you could use against an enemy. Though it added a little layer of complexity to the combat it was more of an irritant that something enjoyable. Otherwise the combat was a lot of fun and I got a huge satisfaction of killing enemies and using various combos while fighting.One more thing to add is that in the original Devil May Cry series, the player was forced to go through very monotonous jumping puzzles that really served no purpose being in the game. DmC improved on this greatly and despite it still having the jumping puzzles they are a lot more satisfying. For example, at one point you are in limbo mode while Vergil and Kat are in the real world. All during this time the world around you is falling apart and while jumping around and fighting enemies you have to help them avoid obstructions that would kill them. Just seeing the world crumble and try to defeat you itself is fascinating and a lot more fun than the puzzles in the original series. As I mentioned before you play as Dante, a half demon/half angel Nephilim, who was pulled into a Limbo one day after he met Kat. Limbo is a parallel world to the real world where the demons live. This is the only place that Dante can actively fight the demons and use his powers to stop them. After his initial fight he is brought before Vergil who informs him that he is a Nephilim and that Vergil is his twin brother who runs an organization called ""The Order"". Vergil explains that their ultimate goal is to bring down the demons ore more specifically the Demon King Mundus who has been searching for Dante because he knew Dante was a Nephilim. The reboot did a great job of bringing back the characters and giving them a whole different spin. In the original series Dante was an egocentric maniac that was overconfident and used to fighting demons. In the reboot, they show him in his younger more naive state that is just learning about his origins and what it means to him to be a Nephilim. I found the story absolutely fascinating and was quite engaging especially the character development of Dante himself. He started out as someone who only cared about himself, drank and partied all the time and changed into someone that began to find compassion for his friends and for others.  Now this game being a couple years old doesn't have the best graphics but they are still very good. On top of that, Ninja Theory did an absolutely fantastic job differentiating between the living world and Limbo. When you are out in the living world, it is very dull, dark, grey and boring. It represents how many in the living world are stuck doing the same monotonous tasks over and over again because they have been under control the entire time. When you play in Limbo the world is colorful, unique, full of amazing looking scenery and level designs.  You can really feel the passion that went into making Limbo as great looking as they can.On top of that the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. It has a great mix of electronic, rock, classical and many other genres that just compliment each level and scenario you are playing in. A soundtrack can absolutely make or break a game/movie. You watch Star Wars without any of the background music from John Williams and you lose a lot of emotional appeal of what is going on, especially that scene where Luke finds his Aunt and Uncle dead.  It just complimented the scene so well and the soundtrack in DmC does the same. Along with the music the voice acting is also superb. They really made it sound like their characters were engaged and made them more believable.  Overall, DmC is one of my favorite games and a must play in my opinion. The gameplay may have been dumbed down from the original series but that isn't to say it isn't still a lot of fun to just destroy the various demons. It helps that Ninja Theory wrote a great story and did a fantastic job with differentiating between the two worlds. The game may be a single player game however it isn't without a bit of replay value thanks to unlocking new game+ and being able to go back and get all the collectables.Story - 8Gameplay - 7Presentation - 9Music/Sound - 9Fun - 9Replay Value - 7 "

												Are the people at Ninja Theory all sad 30-something hipsters that cling desperately to their twenties, because the protagonist gives me that vibe. DMC is an okay game. It's a bad Devil May Cry game, previous DMC(DMC3) games offered a deeper combat system and far more aggressive and punishing combat. The Hitler Youth style haircut on new Dante also knocks off points. Grow up Ninja Theory, and make better games.			"

												I personally like this games mechanics and battle style, but i cant recommend it to anybody who has played any previous devil may cry games, such as me. This main reason can only be described by a video title that i dont care enough to link. its called ""why DmC's dante is a terrible dante"" and it pretty much breaks down the fact that a lot of it was forced as♥♥♥♥♥♥and they changed DmC's Dante a lot even though the lead developer flat out said he didnt give a ♥♥♥♥ whether we liked him or not. Another reason i cant recommend this game is that after the first initial playthrough, its boring as ♥♥♥♥ and i wanted to uninstall it immediately after trying the bloody palace gamemode, in which you have to BEAT THE CRINGEWORTHY STORY TO PLAY.yep thats pretty much it.P.S. i would ♥♥♥♥ vergil if he didnt think humans were useless			"

												The game itself is not bad.If you like action game,you may will enjoy it.But these are some personal reasons I do not recommend this game:1.The colour.I assume the developers do it on purpose.The colours are so intense and it is unhealthy to my eyes.And one level is shining all the time ....2.The weapons.At first.It was fun and easy.But once you entered the SOS mode or DMD mode you might find some serious problems.Because the angel monsters and demon monsters are all over the place.You have to change the weapons ...maybe all the time and it is not cool for a action game.That means I must slay this monster by these weapons and those monsters I have to slay them by other particular weapons.That's very grounded in my opinion.Even I have 3 guns 1 sword 2 angel weapons 2demon weapons and I can pull the trigger slay them all by ignoring the particular types..Still ...not much freedom.By the way the skills of the weapons are limited too..3.The BossesIf you play action games a lot or just a few you may find out this situation:It was fun to fight a boss as the same size as you or twice or triple at least there are many spaces when both of you on the fighting area.If the boss is too big or captures the whole screen.At first it is cool and amazing,after that it only remains boring...Because we can't feel the movement just like we are fighting against a  wall...4.The unskipped scenariosI know how to skip the animation but in this game some scenarios you have to actually do it by yourself and it can not skip.A total waste of time.And I dont know why the developers do it this way .It just walk and destroy the walls by pull the sign on it....Still this game has some good arts and scenery designs.But there are some good action games out there better than this .

												Whatever some may say about the reboot, gameplay wise it's damn solid and the mechanics are excellent. Young Dante might seem a bit obnoxious at times, but the story is well crafted and the character goes through enough transformation that you could see how he could become the person we know and love from the original series.If you like action games and you haven't tried this yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.

												""You are dead to me."" This quote came from a friend at work when I informed him I was playing Devil May Cry 2013. Why did he feel so strongly? Because he, like many others, thought the new look of Dante was somehow sacriligious to past Devil May Cry games. Well after finishing the game, all I can say is he and the others are missing out. DMC is everything that is great about the series only with a fresh coat of paint. Let's examine what this game is. This is a reboot of an origin story for a very bad♥♥♥♥♥character.I won't lie and say I am a die hard fan. I have only played DMC 1 and 4.DMC 1 was good but did not have a lasting impact on me. DMC 4 was the first game I purchased for my PS3 years ago and I thouroughly enjoyed the (at the time) stunning visuals and breakneck gameplay. The opening sequence was what hooked me and the gameplay was spectacular. Thanks to the many amazing games on the PS3 (and so little time), DMC 2013 came and past without a purchase and I thought it would be just one more DMC game I would never play.Fast forward to October 2014 steam sale in which I purchased my first gaming laptop and saw DMC 2013 for $17.00. DMC 4 had been a worthwhile purchase back on the PS3 so I bought DMC 2013 and I am very pleased that I did. Let's talk about that fresh coat of paint. This is a modern twist on the DMC formula. The story gives us a look at a young Dante and his transformation from a selfish punk to the world's hope amongst the demons. This story will not apeal to everyone, but it is well writtenand I laughed a few times at Dante's sense of humor. The characters are very likeable (a special nod to Virgil) including Dante by the end of the tale. What about the gameplay you ask? After all this is the real reason someone would play any game. I am happy to report this is the DMC action we all know and love. The gameplay is fun and chaotic. The levels are beautiful and makes exploring a pleasure. Keep in mind this is DMC so don't use too much time exploring unless you want a lower rating. On the default normal difficulty, the game is challenging but not cheap. Every time I died it was my own fault for getting carried away hacking at an enemy. The enemies get re-used but in different configurations over the course of the game. Two minor gripes would be the camera angle sometimes gets in the way and how deep the combo system can be. The problem I have with the combo system is that it can be difficult in the heat of battle to remember all the diffirent attacks you can do. This is not a deal breaker though because it also makes for some very exciting battles. I will finally also mention one of the most underrated aspects of gaming these days and that is the excellent checkpoint system. Again this is my own opinion, but a good checkpoint system is really important (losing loads of progress when you have so little time to play is not ideal).So in conclusion, despite my untimely death in the eyes of my co-worker, this game is completely worth your attention. Despite the reboot menatlity (Dante's new look, the modern setting, the backstory) and the few flaws (wonky camera at times, overwhelming combo system) this game is amazing. I would highly recommend that any action game or Devil May Cry enthusiast check it out. I had such a good time with this game and I am happy that it was my first game I purchased and beat on my new laptop. "

												This is probably one of the best games I've ever played.This was the first game I bought that was more of a meelee fighting game and damn I really liked it. Even though my PC wasnt the best, and I still wanted to play in high res., it was a bit laggy/buggy, however in the game as a whole, it was a great experience.Storyline: in my opinion, storyline is a really big thing. Not a good storyline =♥♥♥♥♥♥game.This a really good one, as you play as Dante, who is a skilled fighter etc. You automaticly get into the storyline, as you early understand it, and in the second mission you actually get Dante's backround and the other side characters.(spoiler alert)Characters: I find all the characters really interesting, Dante as a whole, is a great guy and fun to play as. Vergil is the one I found really cool, as he always seems calm, smart and skilled. Although you never truly gets his backround, which I find is one of the worst things, you dont loose any interest. Kat is the ""main"" side character as she does alot of brave stuff. She is REALLY interesting as you dont get her backstory untill a bit later into the game. Which is kind of great, as if you get bored of Dante, you will imediately get into what she's all about.Enemies: you will encounter new enemies later into the game, but it is usually all the same. The first one you meet, is weak and easy to kill. The later enemies, which are harder to kill, brings a bit of variation into the game. Boss fights are allright, not too great, but not entirely bad. They are easy once you figure out what they do and counter it.Combat styles: as it was the first game I played I expected the controls to be♥♥♥♥♥♥ Like, how could they be good? But I was wrong. It was easy to learn, all of the controls made sense, easy to do combos etc.Bad: not alot to write, but the number one thing is pretty clear: enemies. They only varies if you get really far into the game. It can take alot of time, which I find annoying. The witches is the most annoying. They're easy to take if they're alone, but with other enemies they are so hard to kill. If you focus her, the other enemies will damage you, if you focus the enemies, she shields them. They are just there to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, and they do good.But a solid 8/10, great combat, interesting story. Only gets dragged down by the enemies.			"

												DmC:DMC is the reboot of the Devil May Cry games that I really like so I must of course like the reboot, no...I could make a 6 paragraph review on why I hate this game but that requires effort and me being able to write cohesive sentences so I'm just going to bullet point my issues.♥♥♥♥♥♥story that is both edgy and boring at the same time♥♥♥♥♥♥controls that feel uncomfortable thanks to how you switch between weapons-Annoying enemies-Annoying enemies that can only take damage from one type of weapon-No hard lock-on system so you'll sometimes grab the enemy you don't want to and end up taking damage in the process-Easy combat-Boring bosses-THE WORST CAMERA I'VE SEEN IN A GAME LIKE THISAnd that's only half of my complaints. Now most of these were actually fixed in the re-release(DmC:DMC Definetive edition) and those fixes actually make the game waaaaaaay better almost at an above average level... but that's not on PC even though most high skilled players of the series play on PC.I might rewrite if I have more energy and better writing skills but in short, bad game, don't buy it, go play DMC4SE.

While I believe I may still be able to claim a refund based on hours played, I would rather the devs just fixed the game.As such, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game has been out for a while now and if the devs haven't already fixed it, they are unlikely to any time soon.			"

												Before I start my review for this game I would to like to say that Devil May Cry is one of my favourite's franchise ever, one of the most stylish, cool, and entertaining title ever made. DmC as you should know it's a reboot from the franchise, it made alot of people argue and complain about it, the reason ? Dante new look, yes ... young and reckless Dante. I completly understand it, Dante is the coolest character ever made imo. But is not a good reason to say the game is bad, in fact the game is REALLY well done, apart from the dante look. The gameplay is awesome and makes you enjoy and merge into the action. Cool weapons, moves, even to story is good. Absolutely no reason to say the game is bad. I've finished more than 4x times on XBOX 360. Now playing on PC port once again !The reboot was necessary because the franchise was moving torwards to an end, with Dante getting old and no more story to be add. But now things are different, the reboot brings alot of new possibilities to the game. New powers, creatures, characters, will give tons of story to be told.Carrying the DmC title is not an easy task, but Ninja Theory did a good job, and I believe that my beloved DmC is in good hands. Forget those haters that says the game is this and that, they know nothing... DmC was always about it's stylish and coold gameplay. Which DmC still have that essence and feeling. "

												Platforming is beyond garbage as you lose momentum from swinging and jumping. The times I thought I could make a jump  just throws me off the edge. These sections look nice, but moving through them is a nightmare. The game's autolock forcefully changes your camera to look at the enemy if not looking at them. Collectables are fine in a DMC game, but having it as a way to rank your missions is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Orbs kinda made sense, but collectables still confuse me. Why?Combat is alright. Weapon matching against enemies is god awful and annoying. Devil trigger sucks and the grappling hooks feels kinda ""cheesy"" to use during combat.If this game was called something else, then it would be an ""average"" game I could probably recommend. But because it is ""related"" to this series, all my inputs from the older games sneaks its way into my brain and my nostalgia just brings it down  yeah, I know its bad	7/10 too much ♥♥♥♥ you			"

												I played through the first half of the game on the highest difficulty without getting hit by any enemies, but the camera is so horrible that I couldn't get past the forced pseudo-quick action platforming segment with my controller without switching back to keyboard and mouse, because it was a constant struggle between pressing 5 different triggers and readjusting the camera with the right analog stick.Also, this game has some of the strangest framerate issues I've ever seen. If you die, don't choose continue, just restart the game, otherwise you'll lose about 10-20 FPS for every time you die. On my first playthrough I remember having to quit the final boss fight because I died 3 times and my framerate dropped to 5 FPS.Emo Dante isn't as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as I thought, and the gameplay is solid, but the platforming brings me pain that reminds me of chemotherapy.

												In this retelling of Dante's origin story which is set against a contemporary backdrop, DmC Devil May Cry™ retains the stylish action, fluid combat and self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series but inject a more brutal and visceral edge.The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or indeed society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment group called “The Order”, Dante is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement. For DmC Capcom has teamed up with UK development studio, Ninja Theory, renown for delivering action titles with compelling characters and narrative coupled with high production values. The combination of Ninja Theory’s expertise and Capcom’s unrivalled heritage in producing combat focused action titles will ensure that this latest addition to the over 11-million selling series will remain true to the Devil May Cry DNA so cherished by the fans, while bringing a new level of cinematic quality to the title.

												Basically a HD Remix of DMC3. Seems like for every one thing this game does right there are two things it does wrong. No lock-on button? Inexcusable. Two buttons that do the same thing? Why? Story and writing: Terrible.  Not that it matters, but don't tell me the game has Shakespearean feel/elements to it when it's just pulling concepts from todays popular Shonen mangas. The music is fitting and some of the set pieces for the action are fun. Sad that you have to play through the game on a dumbed down difficulty before you can actually start to enjoy the game. The move list for the weapons is lacking to say the least, but at least they have all the basics covered. If NT gets their head out of their♥♥♥♥♥and stop writing jokes that are basically a giant '♥♥♥♥ You' to the fans of the game maybe they can get something right with a sequel (if they're allowed to).If only DMC and DmC could co-exist, I'd be ok with that. But if this is what we're stuck with, RIP Dante. I can always revisit you on my PS2.			"

												I don't understand how this game got such high praise. Maybe it's because the keyboard controls suck and I'm not great with a controller, maybe it's some problem with my PC, or maybe it's just something that doesn't line up with my personal tastes. But this game is so damn boring. The controls are unresponsive, the camera is terrible, the characters are dull and uninteresting carboard cutouts. I'm going to try it a couple more times, see if something clicks. But damn. I don't get it.Update Jan 13: So I've now played the game enough that I have the controls figured out. It's still just not fun. I've just beat chapter ten, and appearently there's twenty, so I'm giving up on it. I find that there's a lot of weird animation delay issues. There have been a couple of times where I would hit the dodge button, get hit, and then the dodge goes off after the hit animation. The difficulty is weird, where I feel like I'm constantly ♥♥♥♥ing up, but I'm also never really afraid I'm going to fail. It just doesn't feel good to play the game.It it's benefit, the combat is varied, the sound effects are good. It has some cool design choices, like the big floating angry words. It's compitent. It's just not fun. It's a chore. Eh.			"

												The combat is fun, it never gets stale because you are consistently given new ways to open up your combos. The scoring system is fair and gives you a fantastic sense of achievement when you get that SSS rank. The highlight of the game for me was everything surrounding the gameplay however. The characters' facial animations are spot on and the voice acting is some of the best in modern gaming. Topped off by a fantastic script, the characters and their motivations seem refreshingly believable. The humour is subtle, not forced, which made it that much funnier. There are numerous references to other games, films, and real people which are quite amusing. You WILL enjoy this game if you haven't played it before.			"

												Great game, its a fine reboot to the Devil May Cry series. It's not what some may have expected and that's fine, its still worthy of playing. It has what you'd expect, sound hack and slash mechanics, good combo system and steller soundtrack. Tons of replay value too. Trust me you'll love it so much you'll want to replay it on the harder difficulties. It strikes a fine balance between appealing to the casual fanbase and the more hardcore fanbase which I think is what this series needed.			"

												This was my first experience with the Devil May Cry series, and to be honest, I found myself to be almost bored playing. The game looks absolutely gorgeous but I really don't like the whole combo-style game play.  The platforming adventure style jump puzzles and swinging really grew tedious at times. Normally I am a huge fan of 3rd person action/adventure games but I couldn't find myself getting immersed in this as much as other games. I wouldn't personally recommend this but I can see why people may enjoy it.			"

												""This game has some bad bits, but even Dante was half demon""The Devil May Cry series first released on the PS2  more than a decade ago. The series was a great collection of action games (though Devil May Cry 2 fell far short of the other three games) and have influenced other games since then. For the fifth game however, Capcom decided it was time to start over, and so we get this reboot from a different developer. The new Dante has a different attitude and tell anyone willing to fight him ""**** you"".  It got a bit of flack from fans of the series, but since I was gifted this, I decided to give it a try and see how it compared. StoryRight, even here has a number of changes. At the start of the game, Dante is someone who just doesn't really give a damn for others. Later, he will get closer to people fighting against the demons and will help them free the humans from their control. His brother makes a return as well, this time as an ally and someone else working to help the humans. The story is decent enough, even if I didn't like the cursing that was common in some parts of the story. PresentationThe game looks nice. While the reboot resulted in character redesigns, the important characters and the random enemies you will fight look pretty good. I'm not a big fan of the changes here, but they aren't ugly. The music is suitable for the action. Can't say much more about it. Nothing really memorable. It does what it needs to. Sound effects are suitable for what is happening. It works. The voice acting is much the same. Its there, its okay, but I'm not really impressed by it. ControlsA gamepad is the preferred choice of control for this game. While the keyboard can be used, I didn't find it as nice to use for certain actions as I did with a gamepad. Still, if you are someone unwilling to buy a gamepad for whatever reason, you can still play the game, your experience just won't be as smooth. GameplayI'm mixed on the gameplay. I miss some of the combat options from previous games, like the Styles and classic Devil Trigger. However, the combat is still great, and Dante now has access to grappling using angelic or demonic weapons, which allows some other combat methods. It is impressive enough to keep you busy through the 20 missions that make the game. You will be smashing enemies away, pulling them back to you, sending them into the air to pull of a chain of hits and finishing them with a slam into the ground. You have access to several different weapons once your collection is complete, and can easily switch between them in moments, rather than being restricted to only a couple. Each of them have certain enemies they are best suited for, but other than a handful of enemies that can only be harmed by only one type of weapon, you can play with your favourites all you like. The Devil Trigger is no longer as impressive. In this game, you won't be changing into another form with extra combat abilities, you instead just get a period of time where your health regenerates and you can beat on the enemies suspended in the air. I only rarely used this ability myself, though if you have trouble with mobs, this would allow you to beat on them for a short while your health builds back up. Outside of combat, you will be running around locations, using your various talents to move around the dangerous areas that make the world of Devil May Cry. You will frequently be flying through the air grappling to items and pulling others out of your way, or gliding across pits. And you might jump up a few ledges. LifespanThere are a number of features to keep you busy with the game after beating the story. Each of the levels contains a number of secrets to find, including Lost Souls which drop more souls for buying items, and a number of hidden keys and doors. Each door unlocks an area with a special challenge to complete it. Each challenge will give you an upgrade item, so finding these will enhance your chances of surviving the enemies ahead. As well as that, there are a number of difficulty settings to unlock, as well as attempting to get a SSS rank in each of the levels for each difficulty, and you could be playing this game for a very long time. The free Bloody Palace arena combat DLC should also add a significant amount of time to your gameplay. The last bit to extend the gameplay is a paid DLC which gives a bit of post game story for Virgil, though I found this less impressive than the main game, as Virgil has access to less combat options, though his Devil Trigger ability is more impressive, since it calls a doppelganger to help you fight enemies. Still, if you can get it cheap, it adds 6 more missions to beat as well as some different combat to try out. All in all, I can only say this is an okay game. The combat in the older games was more fun, and that is the main focus of the Devil May Cry games. However, it is still a suitable game for the series, and even if I prefer most of the classic games over this, I can't just say its the worst of the series either. It still comes ahead of Devil May Cry 2. Thats something. Last note, the original title I had planned for this review was ""Dante says **** You"". But then decided to not put a spoiler in the title. 7 / 10			"

												not even mildly entertaining. I could take a railroad spike through the head several times and still wouldn't be stupid enough to fall for the poorly-linked unnecesary and predictable combat scenes attempting to hide the complete lack of story. The only thing ""difficult"" about this game is remembering which key to hold down while randomly striking the mouse to take down different types of enemies. Not a single puzzle or task of any variety, just mindless, unengaging combat against a pathetic AI. The only thing that impresses me about this disgusting, half♥♥♥♥♥reboot of a series that should have stayed dead is that the devs managed to make the UNSKIPPABLE AND UNECCASARY cutscenes look EVEN WORSE than the foggy, cloudy gameplay itself. Rather than induce eye-socket bleeding by trudging through a gameplay vid just to see how bad it is, imagine this:      paul blart mall cop 3: taco bell, in which Kevin James literally ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the walls, floor, and ceiling, but first over the camera, so you just see feces while listening to Kevin James defacing a public restroom for hours on end. Then realize that to 100% this game, you need to beat it at least 4 times. I would rather film my version of mall cop 3 than play another minute of this mockery of Demonology riddled with nont-so-subtle anti-wallstreet commentary.""we're gonna need a lower scale""/10That said, don't let me stop you. Seriously, go ahead- the bleach industry could use a bump in sales.			"

And boy that was not the only thing they ♥♥♥♥ed up at.There is NO LOCK ON method. You are stuck with whatever the game tells you that you need to lock on to. There is NO real way of switching targets, I mean there is a button which will randomly select another ""Ranged"" target.. But.. Forget about stoping an enemy charging up outside of your view field quickly and effectively.Jumps? in a hack and slash? WHY? they comprise at least a THIRD of the gameplay.. and they are BROKEN as♥♥♥♥♥♥I am not GREAT at platforming, but most jumps are just broken, and make no sense in a game of this genre.I ♥♥♥♥ING HATED it even MORE that the weapon system needs to be changed by the D PAD...

												Terrible soundtrack, awful writing, and just all around not worth your time. The only redeeming feature of this bland action game is the set pieces in which the color coded fights take place. It's clear ninja theory doesn't really have any idea what makes a game fun and have some very backwards ideas about what constitutes a ""cool"" character. Between the dumbed down combat which as mentioned before is just matching the colors of your weapons to the colors of the enemies and the constant barrage of edgy ""adult"" themes this game borderlines as a parody of the genre from which it came. The most offending part is that while the color matching combat is at least serviceable for lower skilled players to mash their way through the game, it limits player's ability to create combos by mixing up what weapons they want to use and when. This creates a very low and shallow experience that seasoned players will come to find themselves bored of quickly and then have to suffer through what amounts to some teenager's fan fiction tier story writing. The highpoint of this game is a few platforming areas that are actually quite decent. In fact the only value this game has comes from the pretty scenery you can explore in between boring waves of recolored enemies. The world around you will shift into a demon land and alter itself in fairly surprising ways. What was once just a roadway will break apart and become an interesting segment where you must use your abilities and equipment to move from place to place. This is a welcome distraction from the terrible combat and story. Speaking of story, here's the worst part of this game by far. No exaggeration, this game has a scene in which one character shoots a pregnant woman through the stomach killing her child and then they shoot her. This is played out as a good thing as said woman and child were demons; however, as this scene takes place neither are in any way portrayed as such. Now these characters are a boss fight in the game, but this scene isn't in anyway connected to this boss fight and it amounts to a distasteful scene of a pregnant woman being shot. The main character even taunts the final boss about it after they ask why it was done. It's this tone deaf writing throughout this game that shows how little ninja theory understand what it takes to make a compelling story/character. I'd say pick this game up only to laugh at as it is basically garbage in electronic form.PROS:It's unintentionally funny. BONUS: Has a Spanish language mod that increases how hilarious it is.Decent platformingExcellent set pieces and scenery.Competent developers from Capcom did try to fix this mess with the definitive edition. So there are some tweaks improving it such as 60fps and more.CONS:Terrible soundtrackTerrible writingWeak combatIf you don't want to read this review the entire game can be summed up with this video.
