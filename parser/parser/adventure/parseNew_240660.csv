												Basically it's a side-scrolling Devil May Cry. It features 2 characters with 2 distinct combat styles (think of Dante and Vergil; in fact, Shang could be Vergil’s distant cousin from China — his Kee swords bear great resemblance to Summoned Swords), style-based combat system, and great visuals. Sadly, translation is atrocious, there are many typos and in some instances English text doesn't even remotely correspond to Chinese audio. Also, story is somewhat basic and clichéd. But the gameplay is great, combat is satisfying, so if you're a fan of hack and slash games (like me), Mirage is a must have. If you're not, well, at least give it a try.P.S. Oh, and don't be fooled by “Local co-op” label on Steam — Mirage has only “Duel” mode available from the start. In order to unlock “Boss Rush” and “Tower” (Bloody Palace) modes you have to finish the story first. There's no co-op for story mode…			"

												A hidden shiny gem made by a chinese team. This game is fusion between Muramasa the Demon Blade + Devil May Cry series, which are two of my favourite games. You got 2 main characters that basically are Dante & Vergil , their gameplay style and even a bit their personality are similar to our sons of sparda. It really feels like you are playing DMC on a plataform 2D style, and there is where it also feels like playing Muramasa.So it is a pretty cool fun hack'n'slash stylish game. Which I gladly reccomend it to everyone. The sad thing is that the publisher ruined it, the game didn't sell well and the team moved out to mobiles. I wish one day they release new games and sequences that already exist on PC verson as well. "

												Wow. If you can get past the bad translation in the early parts of the game, you are in for one hell of a fun action game. The gameplay is mad crazy once you hit your stride in the higher difficulties.Evade-counters that can kill enemies in one hit? Check.Two playable characters that can be swapped in and out a la Marvel vs Capcom? Check.One of them is a teleporting ninja and the other is a psychic swordsman, both with vastly different playstyles? Check.The harder the game becomes, the more badass it is, and it punishes button-mashing hardcore? Who needs more convincing? If you enjoy 2D action games at all, you need to buy this game. For $15 at most, you can't go wrong.			"

												Developed by a group  of chinese developers. This is one of those very much underrated game out there. Maybe coz it is developed by a relatively unknown company that not much people is playing it. But it is definitely one of the best  hack n slash game. You can use two different characters with totally two different skill sets. Certain boss are best defeated by one of the characters and you are allowed to switch to the one during in game fighting. Definitely highly recommended. A pity developers bail out from creating part 2 due to lack of sales ... Great game.			"

												Rain Blood Chronicles: Mirage is best described as a 2D Devil May Cry with co-op capabilities (although its kind of wasted). It features a very solid combat system and some good ways for stylish play. The two characters play like Dante and Vergil with unique movesets and combo capabilities and can be switched between, ammounting to something akin to ""styles"". For a company that never did an action game before Rain Blood is a really solid game and better than any other recent offering in this genreUnfortunately it has issues and is held back by some little annoyances like wonky hit-/hurtboxes and physics that can make you drop combos sometimes. Additionally being able to ""merge"" your sprite with the enemy (the players sprite occupying the same space as the enemy) creates problems in positioning, especially in the air where the enemy can just float through your barrage of attacks that start their hitbox far in front of the player. The style meter has also this anoying tendency to be weighted towards parries, ultras and air combos and not towards actual variety of moves. It compounds the problem of upgrading your characters abilities and items since the rewards for defeating enemies are proportionally based on the style meter. Once you hit S rank (which is hard in of itself without hitting an ultra or parry) every hit you land is converted into gold currency which can be used to buy upgrade items. However sustaining or reaching S rank is hard without constant air combos, no matter how cool you think your ground combo-streak actually is or was. After you beat the game's story on normal or hard your characters will potentially not even have all their skills unlocked. The unlocked Endless Tower mode helps to grind out the currency to upgrade but its kind of a waste that the player is potentially not allowed to use all their moves in Story Mode.Another flaw are a few relatively boring bosses with very predictable move-sets with annoying stun-locks thatbreak the flow of a battle if you get caught. Especially the first boss you encounter Sword Addict has some annoying launcher move that goes on for at least 15 seconds. It doesnt do much damage, even on Hard or Very Hard, its just a very long and boring animation to watch.The game also has a few problems in that regard on higher difficulties and higher floors of Endless Tower where you fight multiple boss-type enemies at the same time. The coding does not take into account that depending on RNG attack patterns even the basic enemies can infinitely stunlock you without recourse (until you unlock an expensive accessory which makes switched characters invulnerable for a very brief moment).Other bad design decision are buff-enemies that produce an invulnerability-shield after a certain amount of damage has been done to them, probably to prevent the player from ending a fight too quickly. This makes for boring encounters where the player is forced into a cycle of waiting and attacking instead of being stylish and skillful.I would wager that the only ""proper"" and interesting boss in the entire game is the endboss which has three separate phases and a very large variety of moves that requires you to pay close attention to positioning and timing.Unfortunately I did not encounter this boss once in Endless Tower, even after Floor 30.On another note Endless Tower does not let you save your progress even if you do not get killed on a floor, making reaching higher floors very time-consuming and exhausting as you always start at Floor 1. Or if there are Floor checkpoints I did not find them even after 30+ floors which took close to an hour.In conclusion Rain Blood Chronicles is highly recomended for fans of the cuhrayze even if it is flawed in some regards. I hope the company will make a sequel (as the game does end on a cliffhanger) and continues to improve on the concept.			"

												Solid beatemup game. The very beginning is misleading with the seemingly low quality because the game is actually very well put together. Decently challenging, but heavily rewards skillful play. Missions are longer than they should be for the DMC-style ability unlock system, and achievements don't seem to be working correctly, but I fully recommend this super cool chinese game of killing mans.

												A very deep combat system brings Mirage's old-school roots to the forefront. Beatiful 2D art and animation seal the deal, despite the terrible translation of a story that wan't that good to begin with. If you like a game that rewards mastery over button mashing, and enjoy some eastern art prettyness, this comes very highly recomended. Just don't expect a deep tale or compelling character development.The Best:-- Distinct character mechanics-- Excellent combat system-- Gorgeous 2D artThe Worst:-- Horrible story-- Terrible translation-- Only partial controller support.References: Muramasa: Demon Blade; Devil May Cry			"

Ah, a Chinese game, treat for the eyes and ears but pain for the brainRain Blood Chronicles: Mirage is a hack'n slash/ platformer game . It offers a beautiful art, great soundtrack but lacks a bit in gameplay.  Characters Apart from the art and OST, game offers and well made characters with their own personality and fighting style. Soul Soul isn't the brightest person on the world and often uses his muscles to think. His special ability is to turn into cloud of smoke to dodge attacks or move faster which makes him the mobile one from the 2 protagonists. Shang He is the brain but also and the damage dealer from the 2. His speciality ability is to summon up to 4 blades that he can use to do double jump or make bigger combos.You can switch between them during the game but they is a cooldown so you must be careful. Also they got their own currency and you need to master them both in order to beat the game on high difficulty Story Story is nothing impressive : 2 students looking for its mentor and trying to reveal the truth about an evil force. There are the expect twists but one thing worth noticing is that  THE STORY IS INCOMPLETE  . It seems that the devs stopped working on the sequel duo to low sales .Also the english translations are kinda weird at times and make no sense but nothing game/immersion - breaking. Combat Since most of the game will be spent fighting, you expect the combat to be top notch? Sadly it doesnt really happen here. Still its fun and most combos are easy to execute but only in some combos you are able to change the direction of the attack and at times there is no collision between the models so you may end up slashing the air for a second or two .Another problem I notice is that lack of ""down-attack"" . While you can attack left/right/up there is no down-attack so if you crouch and try to hit their knees, you might end up disappointed.Though the game offers 18combos per character with 2 different styles , having the down attack could easily add another 2-3 combos which could be useful for air-ground attacks. Enemies and Boss Fights The basic variety of enemies is quite small to it increases with 1 per passed stage. Still every stage adds an unique elements to their attacks which offers quite some challenge on the road to the boss.Now bosses are serious bussiness. Though its easy to notice what attacks they are going to do, you need to be quick on your feet to dodge it. If you are able to get good with your 2 characters you should be able to beat them with an ease but else you gonna have tough time. Character Progression The progression is there just to be.... there . You can equip and upgrade items on yourself and unlock/upgrade skills. Nothing else, nothing more. Though it offers some customization it also makes the game feel ""grindy"" if you want to upgrade the items/skills you love to use. Controls Before you start the game, you better check the default controls and see are they comfortable for you. Tutorials in the game use default keys regardless what you changed in the settings.Also the game offer controller support but you have to manual set the controls though the game detects that you have a controller in the main menu, if you dont change the in-game controls, you will stay on 1 spot. Modes The game offers 5 modes(sadly no online co-op) : Story, Duel and Training are opened at the start but once you complete the story you will unlock : Boss Rush and Infinite Tower .Story and Train are solo only, Boss Rush and Infinite Tower are for 1 or 2 players and for Duel you need 2 players . Overall Its a good game but nothing too impressive in it. If you enjoy 2d hack'n slash combat go ahead and give it at try. If you are in for the story you might end up disappointed .Note: for achievment hunters - at the moment achievment system is bugged and cant be unlocked .Edit : Achievments can be unlocked with a manual patch that you can download from  here [mirage-game.com] . Credits to Whiteswart.			"

												A solid 2D hack'n slash game. It's basically Devil May Cry in 2D. BUT! The game is abandoned, leaving bugs unfixed. The developer went on to work on their next game. Talk about irresponsible. It is still worth to get when on sale however.Should be fixed;- Random frame/sound lag spikes and slow down. - Game Crashes 3 times during my first play through- Occasionally both my character or enemies cannot be seen. - Inconsistent sound effect. Some sound clips are not recorded well. I can hear sound crackling. Also, there is one enemy that is way louder than the rest when killed, not sure if it's ""Pyre Alchemist"" or ""Enhanced Machinist"". - Voice setting only affects cutscenes, not during gameplay.Rests annoying things;- Bad Translation. Story is hard to follow due to translation, and some dialogues are insanely fast. - Chinese sounds like it is dubbed in the 80s.- Only partial cutscenes can be skipped. Annoying after 1st play through.- The ending. I understand the game want to end on a cliffhanger, but it feels sudden. Also, after the final stage, there is a very long black screen before the credit start rolling. I thought the game crashed. - Foreground and boss health bar (when 2 bosses appear at the same time) block the action on occasion.- Achievement patch needs to be installed manually.			"

												For $10 i'm so glad I picked this game up. This game is an awesome hack and slash especially if you're into chineese fiction.Story is actually somewhat interesting. You play 2 different characters, both have pretty distinct movesets as well as unlockable skills. The combat itself most people will probably think it's just ""okay"". But after learning the characters you can do some neat combos and tricks. The enemies aren't too difficult really, (at least on normal difficulty) but they do throw quite a bit of mini bosses into the levels that keep it interesting.The boss fights are definetly where most of the game shines, they all are pretty unique and have different layouts from what I can tell.A couple typos in the dialogue, but it's easy to figure out what the characters are saying. The voices are actually in chineese which is very cool in my opinion.Also the achievments seemed to be bugged unfortunately :(Need to play it for yourself! Check it out!			"

Rain Blood Chronicles: MirageQuick Review: (Scroll past this paragraph for a full review.) Rain Blood Chronicles: Mirage is a Chinese developed side-scrolling hack-'n-slash.  The story is a bit confusing, the music is nice but not memorable, and the graphics are dark but beautiful. The developers are absent from Steam, so there will likely never be any bug fixes or patches. The fast, skill-based combo system will appeal to fans of the genre, but it's not for casuals or those with very slow reflexes. Rating: 7/10; worth playing. Full Review: The story focuses on two warriors, Soul and Shang, who go on a quest to... Who are searching for... Who have to face thousands of...Yeah, okay...  I have no real idea what the story is about.  It's partly my fault, I haven't been paying very much attention.  But the reason for my inattention is because of the way the story is told.  It's not very cohesive; it feels like the developers expected people to already be familiar with the game world and it's characters. For example, random bits of information about different factions within the world are given during load screens, but there's no context.  They're all historical facts without reason to care what they mean or why they matter.  Whether the story is the way it is because of sloppy writing, bad translation, or the nature of wuxia stories (which I know next to nothing about) I have no idea.  I can tell you that it takes place in a world reminiscent of ancient China, where different factions are warring with each other. Two warriors - Soul and Shang - are on a mission to find their missing master, Jade. The artstyle in Rain Blood Chronicles is very beautiful, but also quite dark.  It's a nice change of pace, since most hack-'n-slash games have bright, colorful graphics, but it can also feel a bit oppressive and gloomy.  The music isn't anything special, but it fits well with both the shadowy environments and fast paced action. Voice acting during cut scenes is in Chinese, while the text is (sometimes badly translated) English.Combat-wise, the game is like a side-scrolling Devil May Cry, which is a very awesome thing.  The combos are fast, easy to learn but hard to master, and as stylish as anything Dante can pull off. On the fly switching between two characters is a nice addition to the game:  Each fighter has a very different play-style, insuring that cutting down hordes of enemies will never get stale. Characters don't share experience points, which are required to level up combos, but it's actually well balanced.  The game is meant to be played using both Soul and Shang - two warriors fighting as one.Soul is the faster, easier to play character:  He excels at dodging attacks and countering from behind, luring and assassinating.  He has a few defensive moves as well, in the unlikely event that he gets cornered. Shang, while more technical and difficult to play, is also more fun once you get the hang of him. He's able to create energy swords which can unleash a barrage of attacks on enemies. While it's possible to beat the game using a single character, it's not recommended. You'll miss out on the badass feeling you get when you teleport behind a enemy as Soul, switch to Shang, and trigger a devastating multi-hit combo.  The combat and rewards system is all skill based: The better you fight, the faster you'll earn points for new combos and accessories.  It encourages you to keep improving your skills, keep trying new tactics and styles, keep playing.  The down side to the skill based rewards is if you struggle to trigger combos and get high ranks, earning points for upgrades and money for items will be a slow and grindy process. I admittedly suck at combo-based games - I've never had the reflexes to be great at them -  but I honestly wouldn't have the rewards system any other way.  I can see how it might frustrate some people, but I get tired of being heavily rewarded for doing very little in games. I want to be challenged to do better. The game doesn't completely lack hand-holding: There are 4 difficulty levels, the easiest of which is nearly impossible to die in, unless you stand still and let the baddies slowly kill you. This setting is great for newcomers to hone their skills, almost like a practice mode.  The hardest difficulty will kill you.  A lot. But you'll like it.The game doesn't have co-op in the main campaign, which is a shame since this would be a blast to play with a friend. But finishing the story unlocks a boss rush mode and ""bloody palace"" type mode, both of which can be played co-op. The developers are not active on Steam, so future updates and patches are highly unlikely. This too is unfortunate: With a little more polish and care, this game could be truly great.I picked up Blood Rain Chronicles for 99 cents when it was on sale (it's back up to $9.99 now).  While it's not my favorite game ever, it is the best single dollar I've ever spent on a Steam game.  I wouldn't say it's for everyone, but if a fast paced, skill based hack-'n-slash sounds like something you'd enjoy, I highly recommend it.Now if only someone would develop a side-scrolling Onimusha...

												I liked the game and hated it at the same time, mostly due to missed potential.Gameplay: The playstyles of the two characters are complementary and the active switch between them makes things interesting. The combos are good, and if you find your rhythm you're in for a treat. Unfortunately, this becomes hard to lack of collisions with the enemies and the inability to turn unless you completely stop attacking. For me this made the game un-enjoyable.VIsuals: Great aesthetics and artistic direction here, the entire storyboard could be printed and sold as a comic book or be turned into posters. The characters / background / enemies are distinct and the visual effects sit on top of them without the screen feeling clustered, just action-packed :)Audio: Absolutely great. From emotional to inspiring to combat music they hit it spot on.Story: I only reached about one fourth of the game, but so far it's been a kid's story for better or for worse - the plot is nothing interesting and you've heard the same story a thousand times just with different heroes / objective. The characters have some personality which makes things better though. And of course, the whole experience becomes like a B-Movie due to the mediocre translation.Unless you're willing to work past some gameplay inconveniences and bad translation I wouldn't recommend this game. And that's sad because it's missing two things which could have very easily been prevented.			"

Also, I hope 'Chronicles' in the title means there MAY be more installments of Rain Blood in the future.  Happy gaming!  Oh, I paid .99c for this game during a weekend sale.

												Mirage has an excellent combat system that should appeal to fans of Devil May Cry (from which it draws on heavily, right down to specific moves) and other intense, Japanese-style action games. I have a few small gripes with the combat, such as the lack of air-teching and not being able to attack enemies that have been knocked down, but overall the system is very fluid and free, allowing you to get very creative. The unique mechanics in the game, such as swapping out characters on the fly, are also great. As a combat-driven game, Mirage is very satisfying and well-worth the price. The difficulty options also make it appropriate for people who aren't veterans; you don't necessarily have to pull off advanced, technical stuff to get by. Outside of the gameplay, Mirage leaves a lot to be desired. The translation sucks, so the story can be hard to follow, and it can be hard to figure out things like upgrade descriptions. The item system is also kind of convuluted regardless fo translation issues. There are certain key moves you need to unlock to really open up the combat, so it's worth replaying some missions as you progress (it's not really a grind, though). I didn't have any issues getting the game to recognize my 360 controller, and I was able to map inputs to my liking.			"

												IF this game runs at full speed it is a blast. It is kind of like playing a devil may cry game in 2D. Sadly the framerate is all over the place and there are also random stutters on my end that tend to eat up inputs. It is just a shame, since the development studio does not support this game anymore to make it at least playable for everyone. I cannot reccomend this to anyone since there is no hope of ever getting this game fixed. Save the money for other action games!!!!			"

												Ah, RainBlood Chronicles: Mirage… a Chinese game that tells the story of two heroes, Soul and Shang. The purpose as well as the story of the game revolves on finding their mentor, Jade, and discovering the secrets of their world. Upon starting the game, the game presents a quick tutorial with pop-up messages that are way too fast to read. Apply those messages with poor English translations and it all goes downhill. It gets even worse when the learning curve is steep. Furthermore, the story failed to grab the attention of the player and makes it a chore to continue playing the game. However, despite its shortcoming, it does offer a great hack’n slash experience. The combat is solid and the artwork is beautiful. The ability to switch between both characters and play against another player is one of the game’s strengths. In addition, the method to wrack up combos is very innovative.When I first looked at this game, I had high hopes for it, but unfortunately, it failed to meet those expectations. The lack of updates and disappearance of the developer should have already cautioned me. Regardless, this is a game that has its merits, but failed through its execution. Coupled with partial controller support, sluggish keyboard controls, poor translations, horrible story, and beautiful artwork, the game’s disadvantages exceeds its advantages. Rating: 2.2/10 (22%)Achievements: 0/102 (0%) - Apply a Patch for Achievements to WorkGame Done.			"

												I got this for .99 when it was on sale, and for that price I'd say it's alright. I definitely wouldn't pay any more. This game feels like it's got a lot of potential, but overall falls short. The gameplay, while designed to be fast and smooth, feels much too stiff. You more often than not get hit not because of poor reflexes, but because almost every attack freezes you in place for way too long. The long white haired character is especially guilty of this. He has no dodge ability which makes him incredibly hard to use. He relies on a block which can only work if you have a sword out, and those swords go away as you attack. This means that you're probably going to be hit a lot.TLDR: Stiff combat, feels half finished, not worth full price.			"

												My initial experience after spending first 30min into this game are the same as the review from [FR] CXZman. Here is the break down for those too lazy to look it up:+ Gorgeous art, game style, great ideas+ Game seems fluid in its own right, animations are well done+ Swapping between 2 characters with different fighting styles is a cool idea and adds another aspect to the fighting strategy- There is no learning curve you are thrown into the deep water immediately. The ""tutorial"" which serves also as a prologue is a joke. Little messages that pop up are shown for exactly 1s, by the time you noticed them they are gone, and you are left to dig through the menus and learn what keys apply to what, how and where.- Controls are absolutely horrendous. This is by far my biggest gripe. There are 2 attack buttons, one special action, one super action, jump button and directional controls. Now to navigate 80% of the level you need to double jump. Depending on your character its either JUMP + Shadeshift + Direction (3 buttons to jump that must be comboed correctly every single damn time) or even worse Summon Sword (Special + 2nd Attack) THEN jump + jump. Heavy attack seems to follow no timing with light attacks and all you end up doing is mashing your keyboard or keypad trying to make your character do something.- The story is so convoluted and opaque that it might as well have been left with chinese audio as is, with subtitles turned off. - The platforms on which you walk/jump on blend in with the background making it stupidly easily to mistake are you going to fall off screen or land on a platform.2/10I wanted to get into this so much, but with every played minute I was more disgusted. Once I painfully reached the first boss all I got was my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me and I was done. I might revisit the game just to see if it helps any on the 2nd pass, but right now I am thoroughly dissapointed. Proper tutorial, much slower and gradual introduction. Giving the player a chance to learn the moves, combos and game mechanics would have made a huge difference. As it is now, its just a pretty piece of crap.Edit: On second attempt, I made it to the 2nd big boss just barely, and my opinion is still the same. The game is unplayable to me and deeply frustrating, uninstall and going into the trash pile.			"

												In fact, Rain Blood Mirage is the one of those games which give you ambivalence, and you really think there should be a gray limbo ""in between""marker for those.As an object of art, Rain Blood Mirage is surely a decent one approach. It can also attain some gameplay interest from fans of shinobi-like slashers.But in general, it is much more an animated story with chinese fleur, than a good slasher game. Why? For lack of solid coder in that indie developer team. Without that, obviously, comes bugs. Like the one with blocked achievements (was partially fixed, but not on Steam, you need to upload patch manually from dev's site, mirage-game(dot)com).Or bug with health of your heroes. For some reason, after I bought some health perks, that should in theory, give me more time between deaths, it worked only for one of my heroes, Shang, the one I like less. And another hero, Soul, after application of those perks became a glass ninja, one-hit-to-death guy (even weaker than was). Weird.Okay, I'll summarise:pros:1) Interesting setting, of chinese mythical super-powered warriors, ""just like in the famous Hong Kong movies"". Well, in fact it looks more like RZA's ""the Man with the Iron Fists"", than ""Once Upon a Time in China"", but nonetheless, it's a good point.2) As a game of 2-d side scrolling hack n slash ala Shinobi or Strider, it has many interesting features, based on the concept of two main characters with different skills, what can be chained in some devastating combos, which is surely looking good.contra:1) After 2-3 hours of playing I found that the magic eye, torn from orbit of former tutor of our heroes, which they using to calculate enemies strength... could as well be my own eye. Really, that game using cinematics which may look good in short movie ala Xiao Xiao, but torturing your eyes and brain in big doses. To put it politely, game's visual part are questionable for prolonged playing sessions.2) As for gameplay sessions... not sure if they would be that entertaining, as you could think reading about Rain Blood Mirage as of ""Devil May Cry: Sidescrolling edition"". Sorry, it's not even a quarter of really good slasher like Shinobi or even Shank. All those combos and special movements aren't giving you feeling of untouchability, there are many blind areas like not-so-good aerial attacks and absence of top down strikes. And I'm not really start talking about weird bugs yet...Now, the main quiestion: Is it a game you should buy?Do you successfully proceed with checks of interest to side-scrollers and chinese cartoons? You have some spare time to play not-so-great games with moderate scores like 6 out of 10? You don't care about your achievement status (for I doubt you're gonna finish this game on gold)?Or maybe you simply wanna donate some money for indie developer with interesting approach so they can hire a good coder for their next project?Well, go on then.For me, I'm done with it.

												I was so excited about this game by the trailers. Then I found out it did not sell well, and now after actually playing it, I can say I am quite happy this game made no money and was a bust, it didn't deserve to sell. Lets start with positives. The art direction is good, and it can be fun to chain combos and attacks together. The japanese feel is nice. There is level variety and a ton of boss fights. Now all the bads. First off, lets start with enemies. The game recycles the game enemy types but with different reskins through different levels and then calls them something different, when reality they just changed the same model from blue to green. Need more enemy variety. Levels are long, but usually only because the game makes the side scrolling mistake of having you stop on a specific screen and fight waves and waves of the same guys to progress, so levels aren't actually that big, it just overuses this annoying mechanic. Saving is the worst I have ever seen in a game. You can only save after each level. This means if the game bug/freezes or your comp shuts down, you have to redo the entire 20-30 min level. Yup for some reason it can't save your progress in checkpoints. The checkpoints are pretty bad and you never know when you hit one, sometimes forcing you to replay entire 5-10 min fights/sections. Then there is the restart system. You start off with 20 gems that you can revive in the middle of where you are, losing no progress, which are quite helpful in boss fights. The other option is to restart from the checkpoint. The problem is the game doesn't tell you where that checkpoint was, or how long ago, and because there are no physical checkpoints you see you usually have no idea. It is annoying how you basically never get any gems to restore your stock, meaning you need to somehow budget them knowing how many you will need for a 4 hour game. Then there is healing. There are no healing potions, are chests with health, or health that drops from guys. You just lose health and then every once in a while you randomly will get one as a drop, but it's almost never. This makes fighting large groups of guys and bosses annoying because you just continually lose health and have no hope. Why a fighting game would do this makes no sense to me. Then there is the item system. It is super confusing and poorly done. You pick up souls, gold, silver, and objects. Each one is used for a different thing. The problem is, the objects are used for everything. So if you want abilities you use souls, but then if you want to upgrade and ability or buy an object (which uses silver) and you have enough, you won't have enough items. Why would they have different currency for different things, but then use an additional currency for everything, making it impossible to get much? There is gold which lets you buy more souls and items such as revives, but everything costs 1000-3000, and you usually get like 100-150 per level, which must be the dumbest thing I've ever heard of. So every like 2 levels you can buy a tiny 1 object or something for all your gold, and things usually take 2-4 objects, so its worthless. Oh and there is co-op which is a cool idea, but in the dumbest design decision ever, you can't play it until you've ALREADY BEATEN THE GAME, which then you'll not want to play it again. There are abilities, but those are annoying too. You can usually buy 1 ability/upgrade every 1-2 levels. But most of them are just increasing damage of your combos, not gaining new ones. You gain a few new abilities. But the problem is is every single possible combo is its own thing you have to buy. Instead of upgrading damage of light strikes, which makes sense, you have to upgrade a combo of 3 light strikes, which is seperate from 4 light strikes. It is so dumb meaning you only ever make tiny incremental changes. Then there is the worst part of all, which should be the best in a game like this, the combat. I have never played a game with more inconsistent combat. Let’s start with hitboxes, as they are fu cked. You will use your dodge ability and be past someone, and they will attack and you will still get hit from the side of them or behind them. Guys attacking the ground would hit me in the air. When I would dodge far away from a guy it would still count his attack as hitting me. When I was in my teleportation move I would still get hit somehow. Then there is the enemy attacks. Some bosses can attack the entire screen and have undodgeable attacks. And since you can’t block (in a fighting game?) even though every enemy can, you can’t do anything. Only one of 2 playable characters can dodge. There would be boss attacks where they would be on the other side of the screen and a magic ball would just suddenly teleport to where I was, dodging or not, and I would be hit. Bosses and enemies can continuously juggle you and hit you in the air and when you are on the ground, meaning you can lose half your health and do nothing. When enemies hit you they can always knock you over or interrupt you. On the other hand, sometimes you can knock people up in the air and combo them, and then other times, on the same guy you just juggled, you will be attacking them and they can just start attacking you in the middle of getting hit, or won’t go in the air if you use the launch move. This inconsistency means you never know if while attacking someone if they will be affected or if they can just interrupt you beating them up by attacking you back, which is really annoying, since you can’t interrupt their combos. Sometimes you can attack the guys on the ground and they take damage, and then other times for no reason your attacks don’t count as hitting them.Trying the play the game on hard doesn’t work, because you get continually combo’d, attacked wherever on screen, and interrupted while attacking. You will have to use tons of revive stones. So when I made it to the final boss I only had a few left because on  a few levels I had to use 4-5 on a boss and certain guys, thankfully you can change difficulty each level, and medium isn’t too bad. But then there are guys like the final boss. Most bosses have around 5-7 health bars, which is super annoying, which is why you will have to use revive stones. I fought the final boss, who had 3 forms, of about 5-7 bars, meaning I had to kill around 20 large bars of health while I only had 1 that would not refill from any health. There was no checkpoints either between forms. So once I lost, because of his ability to combo me for half my health, hit my anywhere on screen, be able to not be affected by my attacks sometimes, interrupt me mid juggle by hitting me, and having 20 bars, I lost all my stones and died. Well I had to restart, before him, but guess what, for some reason all my stones are gone. This means I have no more revives, and no way to get any, which means the game is unbeatable. Also at the area before him you can’t change difficulty so I would have to go back basically 2 levels to do so. And there’s nothing I can do because he has no patterns to learn, or anything to dodge or exploit.  And the fight, like a few other bosses, is just stupid and unfair. Bosses in games like DMC or bloodrayne betrayal are actually fair and make sense, and the combat is consistent. This game is just frustrating and poorly made from head to toe. Sorry not sorry but you deserve to lose money. 4/10.			"

												I can't recommend this game, yet I can't suggest any better similar beat'em all. If you like the setting and the mood, do try Mark of the ninjas (it's more of a stealth game though), and if you want a good beat'em all, stick to Castle crashers.There are great things in the game. The character animation is totally decent and the art is good enough. Controlls feel pretty tight, at least for combat. Yet, here is another game that doesn't explain itself right!Tutorial message are way too fast to read and apply, storytelling (which is pretty bad) doesn't get to the point at all. You never really know where and why you're still going. You get bonus and malus to every other stat and NEVER get a CLEAR explanation of how does what into who because of... ?What is very clear, though, is that you can beat the hell out of your ennemies. I guess that's something...The menus are done the wrong way, jumps and platforms are unclear at best, localization is bad. The game is not really smart in any way and doesn't exactly compel to go on with it.If you're reaaaally into teenage cheesy-badass-looking sword masters with an asian twist to it, and you're not so picky with games in general, go for it. Else, don't but it.			"

												I consider this game it bit of a hidden gem, I mean, it's one those games that gets buried in over time, you're not even aware it's there and I just happened to stubble onto this game by chance and it has been highly enjoyable with some lovely sprites.It's your 2D hack and slash game with an upgrading system and something of a DMC like combat style, in the sense that you learn more moves and find ways to use to rack up your combat rating, but instead of getting different weapons you have two unique characters with their own play styles which I like to think of as Soul is more for a casual style and Shang for a more advanced style of play, but it doesn't matter since you swap between them on the fly.The game might have some minor problems, say like the achievements won't unlock unless you manually install the patch but it's definitely worth giving this game ago.

												I cant stress enough how much I like this game. I also can't stress enugh howmany reviewers are complaining about things that they just plain dont understand. A lot of what this revolves around is the vergil analogue in this game who can summon light swords. There are a few ""unfair"" attacks in the game that connot be dodged. this is a common complaint that I see about the game. People use Soul, the easier charactor with a ton of invincibility frames, to solo the game, however, the game was designed with the intent for you to use both charactors. Shang is a very hard charactor to learn. Shang can summon and manipulate light swords to aid him PASSIVELY which means that shang can be doing one action while you can tell his swords to do another. Shang can use his swords to create a barrier around him that can absorb as many hits as he has swords. Because yopu can sheild yourself passively, you can attack while sheilded. This means that shang is your go to charactor for ""unavoidable unfair attacks"" on to the actual reveiw.  This game looks and sounds amazing. you can get a feel for that just by looking at it. the backgrounds and enemy designs look very good and the sound track kept me pumped throughout the game. I cant really say much more about the presentation.  The mechanics behind this game are top notch. It plays like a 2d devil may cry with 2 charactors you can use on the fly. Soul uses shadow and darkness to amplify his abilities to activate phatom slashes and turning himself into mist. Soul excells at widespread attacks and speed along with dodging and attacking at the same time. Shang on the other hand manipulates light into ghostly sword familiars that he can passively use to aid him. Shang excells at maintaining arial juggles and controlling enemies from afar. Shang cannot dodge but he can manipulate his swords into a barrier that can stay up infinately as long as he as swords to keep it up. You can switch between these two charactors at any time, even mid combo, to deal with enemies as you see fit.   This is where my first critisism comes in. Shang is very technical and hard to learn to use. Too much so. The game doesnt give you a clear idea of shang's potential and that creates situations like my opining statement. Shang is by a large margin the best charactor of the two, but he has a really high learning curve to be good with him due to having to control him as well as his swords. The game could do a better job convaying Shang's strengths.  Bosses are the meat of the game and any humanoid boss can be juggled infinately till death, but it requires good execution. it isnt easy to juggle bosses to death and it shouldnt be.  Like devil may cry, the game has a combo rating system that maxes out at SSS rank. once you hit S rank, the screen blurrs(not to the point where you cant see but it is a cool effect) and continuing hits will give you money. Also some skills and passive abilities do not activate unless you are at an S rank combo which is an interesting and unique mechanic.  The story is hit and miss. I think it is very interesting but a lot is told to you through in game resources than shown to you. The game also feels like you are missing out on previous games.....which you are, but only one is in english and they arnt sidescrolling beat em ups. It shows that this is a prequal though because there is a lot that is alluded to and there is a lot that isnt answered in this game. i feel the game could have done a better job conveying a stand alone story.  now for the bad. the devs have basically abandoned this game. there are a couple of bad glitches here and there, some or even all acheivements may not unlock, and boss rush mode soft locks when completed. Co-op is also gated off untill you beat the game and its just a boss rush gauntlet type thing.  all and all this is my top underated gem on steam and i highly suggest that fans of devil may cry or similar action games give this game a shot. ive sunk plenty of time into this game for fun and i find new things all the time.final score 8/10			"
