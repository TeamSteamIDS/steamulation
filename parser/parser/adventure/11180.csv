												Stay away. This is pixel-hunting at its worst, clumped with a dull story and re-used puzzles. If you want a Sherlock Holmes Hidden Object game, check out the Hound of the Baskervilles.			"

												Godawful. Terrible terrible terrible. ""Find-the-object"" puzzles where you need to find, literally, a strand of hair in a complicated scene. Or, in another instance, a trace of dust that's barely a shade lighter than the ground it's resting on. And then the puzzle that broke me, and made me stop playing and delete the game from my computer: it instructed me to recreate a tatoo that a suspect had. Helpfully, it told me I could visit the suspect's file to refresh my memory of what the tattoo looked like. However, **there is no way to revisit a suspect's file in the game!***			"

												I believe most of the negative reviews are based on the assumption that this is a point-n-click adventure but make no mistake, this is a hidden object game. But a nice one at that, so if you like that kind of game, you might find it enjoyable.There are two major faults though. First, the game is rather short. It took me about 2 hours to finish, and 10€, I expected more. Second, the writing (or rather the translation) is pretty bad at certain points.Still, if you like hidden object games and if it's on sale (or you get the collection), then it's a fine game.			"

												Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Persian Carpet doesn't have an individual Wikipedia entry unlike almost all of Frogware's Sherlock Holmes games. This is because the game is nothing but a horrid mutant sibling that the family kept locked in the basement out of the eyes of the world. For $10, you'd expect it to be at least similar to the other Sherlock Holmes games. Wrong.The game was designed to be a casual take on the Sherlock Holmes games. Given the price and tedious gameplay, this game wouldn't even suit mobile phones. It feels more like a forgetable flash game that you found on the internet but with a price tag. It is nothing but a shallow attempt to emulate the classic Sherlock Holmes stories. The story is simple. A painter was found dead and wrapped up in an expensive Persian Carpet and the Holmes/Watson duo must solve the mystery. The story is however minimal.  At the beginning of each level, Holmes explains to a mostly silent Watson that they need to look around somewhere to get closer to solving the case. Watson, we need to check the theatre. Watson, we need to look at the garden again. That's it. The story is told through the witness testimonies and clues you find across the game. But you don't get to take a second look at most of the clues and if you try to critically think about the crime, you'll soon enough forget it due to the incredibly frustrating gameplay. Don't worry. There is no bad ending. The final puzzle will explain it all.The gameplay of The Persian Carpet is made up of two parts. The first is the puzzles which are fairly challenging and enjoyable. There are unfortunately a few frustrating ones that you can use your limited ""Skip Puzzle"" tokens to get through. One such puzzle was stroking water over a picture and then sponge it to reveal the image. The cursor doesn't read well and you have to spend minutes having to stroke every square until the game decides ""Good enough"" and finishes it for you. The second part is the most infuriating element of the game. You're sent to a room where you have to play I Spy for clues. But I Spy is fun. Many clues are either camoflagued with the environment or almost the size of a grain of sand. Even in my years of experience with all kinds of adventure games, this game has the most infuriating pixel hunts I've ever seen. I spent 30 minutes in a room trying to find this door plate that turned out to be the same color as the floor and that I came across by rapid clicking.  The game is thankfully short, only 1-2 hours in length. It doesn't help that the entry price was $10, the same price as most of the Sherlock Holmes games on Steam. Just after finishing the game, I went on to  Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silver Earring (thankfully a much better game). But I soon discovered that some of the scenes were used for the Persian Carpet game. It turns out that Mystery of the Persian Carpet is not only shallow but lazy, stitched together with images from other games like a braindead Frankenstein monstrosity. It's very disappointing to see The Mystery of Persian Carpet worth the same price as the Case of the Silver Earring. The Case of the Silver Earring has great voice acting, great graphics, less pixel hunt frustration and a much more interesting story. The Case of the Silver Earring came out in 2004. The Mystery of the Persian Carpet came out in 2008. The opening cutscene of The Case of the Silver Earring alone is much better than the entire Persian Carpet game. How did this mess happen? Perhaps I should send a letter to 221b Baker Street to have them investigate how such a terrible game was made and sold at equal price among its superior siblings.			"

												Skip to the bottom for TL;DR summary.I took a chance on this game despite the mostly negative ratings, since many of those ratings seemed based on the fact that it's a Hidden Object style game instead of the usual Point-and-Click style Holmes games that Frogwares puts out.  Since I like the hidden object genre as much as I like P&C games, I grabbed it (on sale, just in case).In short, it's terrible.  Not because the game is in a different style that the other Holmes games, but because it has made every error that a developer could possibly make for the HO genre.The most egregious of these is the setup of the hidden objects; they are tiny, sometimes blend in perfectly with the backdrop, and many (if not all) require a great deal of pixel-hunting to find.  While it's great for a scene to have difficult-to-find objects, there's a difference between ""cunningly hidden"" and ""so ridiculously hidden that no normal person could find it without using a hint"" where these games are concerned.  I love a challenge; I don't love having my time wasted with nonsense.On the topic of hints, there is a limit (seven hints per ""level"" with no way to acquire more).  This means that while you're desperately trying to find the miniscule-and-seemingly-invisible objects, you also have to try to budget hints.  I found this both baffling and irritating.  The combination of limited hints and impossible objects made the game complete torture to finish.  I had to find a walkthrough for when I ran out of hints, and I generally pride myself on not using hints at ALL in these types of games.  You are also limited on skips for minigames (only seven per the entire game) so if they're not your favorite thing, be careful where you use your skips.By the time I got to the end, I didn't even care who commited the crime anymore.  There was very little dialogue in this game (and none whatsoever was voice acted), which took away from the plot.  There was very little tying the player into the game and drawing interest.  It was just ""find this stuff for some reason, not sure why.""The deduction board that is familiar from the other Holmes games is present and does help tie things together, but it is handled so badly and is so tedious that I simply couldn't bring myself to care once I finally solved the case.  There is more dialogue at the end, summarizing your findings and tying the ends together, than in the entire rest of the game.Also at full price of $9.99 it's WAY WAY too expensive for 2 hours of gameplay.  I'd be full-on angry had I not gotten it in a good sale with a lot of GOOD games.If you like the HO genre, go look up The Hound of the Baskervilles on Steam, which is much much better.  If you're looking for point-and-click, just grab the other Frogwares Holmes games; the ones I've played are quite good.TL;DR:  It's horrible, don't do it.  Not because it's a hidden object game but because it's the worse possible example of a badly made hidden object game.  Expensive and tedious.  Spare yourself.			"

												I installed this game hoping to enjoy it.  A ""casual"" game should have been enjoyable:  moderately challenging without being impossible.  Unfortunately, two major issues prevent me from recommending this game.  The first, and most frustrating one, is that many of the items we're supposed to find are extremely difficult to find.  Some are difficult because they're so small; others blend into the background.  I had to use most of my limited, non-renewable hints to find those items.  The other deal breaker for me is the difficulty of the puzzles and the deduction board.  Instructions are unclear and incomplete, so I often had a hard time figuring out just what I was supposed to be doing.If there were a way to replenish hints, the game might have been more enjoyable.  As it was, I ended up giving up mid-game because I used all my hints and couldn't figure out how to finish the deduction board.Overall a disappointing game.			"

												Just Awful.Heres a shocker, I dont actually mind Hidden Object titles. I know! The world will now end and fire will rain down from the sky!That said however, I dispise this title. Why? Its commits a multitide of lazy 'Casual' game sins. Firstly having a soundtrack that seems to consist of the same one or two short tunes played on a repeated loop. Secondly is putting in no support for anything other than a small screen, anything large and giant black bars throw themselves across both sides of the screen.Much worse however is the game design, the hidden object scenes are dull and often involve hunting for things that are half masked or blended in by the background. The puzzles too are equally dull and involve such 'Fun' activities as dabbing water over every spot of a painting to reveal another painting (which takes a blummin age).Essentially its dull dull dull. If you want a good HOG title, find Mumbo Jumbo or take one of the other Frogware ones on Steam, dont take this.			"

												Six hours is all what is needed to find all the hidden objects and solve the puzzles in the most difficult ""adventure"" mode. The hidden objects challenge is relaxing for a few minutes but not really interesting. About 12 of the puzzles are valuable though and despite a specific interface to repeat them, they are not properly renewed. The lack of voice acting makes it a sad and unsavory story. On the other hand, the locations are brilliantly illustrated. The main problem is: even after solving the murder, it is only when Holmes is explaining the course of events that you understand what's going on, or at least you don't need to understand anything to complete the game, since there are not enough intermediate check-up or summaries like in the following games of the series.

Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Persian Carpet		* 6/10I think I bought this game on sale because I was after every Frogware title, so I definitely wasn't expecting a ""Hidden Object"" game...Anyways, there's not much to say about this title, it's a hidden object game, so as usual you'll see a static ambience picture and you need to find the items requested. Of course everything is in Sherlock Holmes style, so there will be riddles here and there that will keep you busy, suspect to examine, and almost every item or clue you find in places or on suspects will be analyzable on Sherlock's desk, then you'll have to find links between suspects, clues, places and victim, and at the very end you'll find out who's guilty. Everything is in function of the story, the murder of an artist whose corpse was found enrolled into a Persian Carpet (hence, the title).For those who are not new to the saga the soundtrack will feature the classic usual tunes from the previous titles, and various ambients and props are made of older models or sections reused and rendered here. There won't be any animated cutscene, Holmes and Watson will ""speak"" through captons only.It was a relatively short adventure but I guess it's just me, as I'm not used to this genre.All in all I appreciated the game though, The Sherlock atmosphere with classic tunes and purpose (investigate a crime), and the game presented some interesting puzzles, some tough puzzles and an interesting suspect-clue-victim linking system.+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. To be precise I wasn't impressed by the ""hidden object"" mechanics, but by everything else, including puzzles, riddles and especially the suspect-clue-victim linking system.---CONs--- DURATION. It barely took me 4 hours to finish it. "

												This should NOT be a Sherlock Holmes game.  The Master detective is in a rare form here.  Bad.   Not just a bad game, but a bad use of the license and a bad experience all around.  It'd be really easy to call it a hidden object game, and call it a day.  But the issues are so much deeper.   First we should talk about it being a Hidden object game.  This is in the lineage of some excellent point and click adventures.  Frogwares has made 6 Sherlock holmes games by this point.    I mean the game right before this was about THE Jack the Ripper.. so following that up with a hidden object game?  Disgraceful. Now I did not have sound for some reason, but from the sound of it, I was lucky.  There is apparently no voice acting and only clicks and a violin playing music according to youtube videos.  No voice acting, even though there's a minimal amount of dialog. It also makes the world's greatest detective reduced to someone who just clicks around a screen, listens to witness' statements at face value, and not much else.  The fact is there's not much challenge to this game, and I blazed through it in 2 and a half hours.  150 minutes, for a game that costs 10 dollars?  Oh hell no!   And I don't know if I even really played the whole time. In addition there's ""LEVELS"" not days, not times, but levels.  Each level is the same, you go to different rooms (all forced, you can't choose where you go out of order).  Find all the objects, sometimes complete some weak puzzles (the only one I had trouble doing was a game like unblock cars, a sliding block puzzle which I was able to skip with 0 penalty.   You CAN only skip 3 puzzles, but with 12 puzzles and none that challenging, you'll save them until it's too late. The hidden objects range for well done, to total horror in the same screen..  There's usually one or two objects that are not apparent in the game where you have to just click around until you stop on and get lucky.  As the game progresses, you'll reach puzzles which only are hard because the camera angle is fixed, and the objects you're hunting blend it.  Dull.   You also get 5 hints per ""level"".  This is weak because as you play you have to gauge should you use a hint now, or should you save it for if you get stuck later.  It'd be better to see a 10 minute timer on hints, than 5 free hints, that you can accidently hit even when you know what to do. One thing that really got me annoyed was the reuse.  At least three out of eight locations were directly from the Silver Earring.  And one puzzle.  I can only imagine all the other locations were from other parts of that game, or others. (Sadly due to a lost save I didn't see all of that game).  The difference is Silver Earring was an interactive game, and this is a find the spot. The Analysis table is utterly simplified... as long as you know what to do (hint put the bowl on the burner when you're stumped, nothing tells you to do that, but that's what it wants).   On the other hand the deduction board is the ONLY part of the game that's fleshed out to be even slightly interesting.  After collecting clues, analysing them you need to piece it all together.   Even here there's little obtuse pieces, but it does work  if you understand the goal.  The only real issue is the end of the game, after you got all the clues, the deduction board wants you to do one more thing, which again it doesn't tell you.  You need to ""Solve the case"" find the location, and person where the crime was committed. By the end of the game, you don't care about the crime, you don't care about the murder, you just want to be done with it.  It's a game that can't even keep a player's interest for 2 hours, that's... ouch. But the thing is even if this was one dollar, nothing was really good here.  Hidden Object games ARE fun, Persian Carpet is not.  Sherlock Holmes is a great character,  he's horrible here.  10 dollars is too much for this game.  And Frogwares is a FAR better company than this as seen by their other games.  Save your money, skip this game.			"

												Sherlock Holmes: The hunt for the hidden pixelIf you enjoy trying to find a small white dot in a large room buy this game and don't think twice. Otherwise keep looking.

This Willis who was meAs I had noted before, most every HOG will have a ""Very Positive"" rating on steam. Ever wondered just how terrible a game would have to be to merit a ""Mostly Negative"" consensus? About this terrible, yeah.To begin with, the game is ineptly translated from... something or another. It's borderline impossible to google info such as ""where and when was this game made"" in the 30 seconds I have allotted to this task. One of the puzzles uses Russian playing cards, but Russian is not one of the language options, so I don't even know. Thus, you get linguistic pearls like ""this Willis who was me"" and all kinds of other awkwardness. When the game (ever so rarely) condescends to explain what you're supposed to do, it's even odds that the translation will mislead you. For instance: ""reconstruct [Suspect's] tattoo. You can refer back to the suspect's file to examine the tattoo"" (you can't). ""Rearrange the tumblers in order, from 1 to 10"" (10 to 1, actually).It doesn't have voice acting, which is unfortunate. I can only imagine the sort of crowning achievement to my ""Quality HOG voice acting"" series this game would have been otherwise. So half the time you're stumbling along blind, trying to arrange clues and deductions without actually having a solid grasp on what they are and why they work / don't work. The deductions are probably the closest thing the game has to a working mechanic you might expect in a Sherlock Holmes game - connecting clues found on the body and crime scene to crap you find as you wander around HOS' (we'll get to those in a moment). The game never bothers to tell you why one satin ribbon (for instance) cannot be connected to the satin ribbon found at the crime scene, while the other is an obvious clue, but it's still dangerously close to interesting. Though - all of the items you need are already scattered around the dozen or so scenes you'll keep revisiting in order to gather new sets of objects, so the game basically tells you that Sherlock is ♥♥♥♥ at spotting relevant clues. The real Sherlock would have just opened the hidden safe to begin with, and skipped the game entirely (for which we would all envy him)Not so the chemical analysis that every piece of material evidence has to undergo. Every bit of fabric has to have a strand cut off and tweezered apart. Every smudge of grease or speck of paint has to be thrown onto your Bunsen burner and smother with ""solution"". As far as I can tell, this is a complete and utter waste of time. You pick up a ""nice green fabric"" at the scene, and you match it to the nice green fabric of Cockneylad Scoundrel's pants, without ever checking out the exact composition of the fabric strands. You pick up ""mechanical grease"" and match it to grease oozing out of Chamuferloys Lindsquire's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ without ever checking into the exact chemical reactions that have influenced said grease. Pure pointless busywork that has nothing to do with anything.But let's get to the actual ""meat"" of an HOG: HOS' and puzzles. Puzzles are... fine, as far that goes (with a certain caveat). HOS', on the other hand, are freaking terrible. Just look at the screenshots above. The game plays very badly with widescreen resolutions, not using most of the available screen space, and more importantly - you are looking for tiny objects ranging from specks of paint to hair follicles, intentionally obscured, often resting in shadows or mostly covered up by other objects, on a tiny screen screen, in a flat, same-colored 3d environment that blands and blends everything together. It's freaking terrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and probably the worst HOG I've played based on this aspect alone. And the crowning achievement? The piece de resistance? The dingleberry atop a cake of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t?You get a limited number of hints. Tired of hunting for the most obscure hidden objects ever, or trying to skip particularly obnoxious puzzles? Have fun restarting the game.Not recommended.			"

												A man is found murdered and tucked away in an expensive Persian carpet and Sherlock Holmes takes the case too find the murderer.Was.. was that it? I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in game, mostly beacuse the others in this series have been so good (minus Mystery of the Mummy, but that was the first, so it gets some leeway). I tried to check if this was extremly old compared to the other games in the series, but no; it came out after the quality game Nemesis (vs Arsene Lupin). There is no voice acting, the locations are still-images ripped from the earlier game 'Silver Earring', the hidden objects are some times rediculously tiny and iirc there is no hotspot other than for items you have to use on other items (find item: Male hair, in this detailed carpet).There's no voice acting, the use of 'analysing table' is extremly boring; 90% is -use scalpel - use tweezers - done. The game also annoyingly has a blinking alert in the top of the screen whenever you discover a new suspect/location and does not go away until you clicked in every room of the new location/looked at suspect back at the police station, which gives you the choice of leaving in the middle of the location you are at or have the incessant blinking up there until you are done. So if yu're like me and can't stand having stuff blink, you're going to have a bad time. Luckily (heh) the game is short. I have mixed feelings about the 'deduction board' where you match items from one scene/person to another to find evidence to build your case. The idea is good, but 'no, this pink fabric is not identical to this other pink fabric' and 'this weapon is not a weapon' and small things with it annoyed me. The puzzles were pretty meh, mostly because most have been ripped from earlier games. It did have a couple new interesting ones, but not enough to pull it into positive.I admit I didn't read all the story as it didn't interest me at all in the end, and I couldn't care less who murdered who and why. PLAY ON EASY MODE unless you're masochistic. It gives you more hints; 7 per scene, and let's you skip all puzzles. There are no achievement and really no reason to play another mode, as nothing else changes and you don't have to use the hints you are given if you're feeling particularily tryhard. Use up all your hints (per scene) and there is no way to get any more. That full price is ridiculous. Do not buy. Should only be in your library if part of the Sherlock bundle.TL;DR: Play Hound of the Baskervilles instead if you want a Sherlock Holmes HO game. Much higher quility and much more content, completely new locations and fully voice acted.			"

I found myself just clicking all over to get past certain screens.  The puzzles ranged from ok to down right difficult.  After awhile, I lost interest and deleted it from my computer.

												This game could be summarized as Myopia simulator. The game consists of hidden object scenes and puzzles. The puzzles are nothing to write home about, while the hidden object scenes are horrendous. Unless you would like to find a dark grey shoe print in the shadows in low quality textures (the game is a bit dated) or brown petals on a wooden floor, avoid this.

												This was so far off of how the other games in the Frogwares Sherlock series run that it made the whole thing just feel like a step backwards. I actually thought that this was an older game than ""Silver Earring"", until I actually looked up the publishing dates and was shocked to see that it wasn't. Additionally, the deduction boards were very frustrating - not enough instruction for what you were expected to do, which left you just sort of randomly clicking things until something connected, and then wondering WHY those things connected.

												Persian Carpet is by far the worst game in the Sherlock Holmes series. Unlike the adventure games of the rest of the series, this title is a casual hidden object hunt. The environments and music are 100% recycled from The Secret of the Silver Earring, which came out years earlier. The pixel hunting is so extreme that you might as well be finding a needle in a haystack--from outer space. Seriously. The scenes are all zoomed out views of an entire room and the clues are things like ""strand of hair"" and ""fingernail."" I wish I was exaggerating. There's only one case and it's short and boring. The only somewhat interesting feature is the deduction board, where Holmes makes connections between different pieces of evidence, but it's so clunky and poorly formed that it loses all value. In fact, when I solved the mystery I actually thought I was stuck in a glitch until I randomly clicked the right thing to trigger the ending. And for reasons unknown, the ending fanfare music is ""The 12 Days of Christmas.""I would honestly love to see a well-made and substantial hidden object game added to this series, but Persian Carpet is not it.

 Summary A hidden object game with a reasonable story, but with little to bring it to life. Seriously flawed HOG sections, but reasonable minigames. Not really worth it, particularly at the current 9.99€ asking price.  Story You play as Sherlock Holmes trying to solve a murder of an artist. The story is the strongest point of the game, a reasonably nice investigation, though that’s not to say it’s spectacular. Moreover, there is no voice acting to bring the story alive, leaving it a bit stale. Puzzles The mini-games are fine or even good I would say (except the very first which is awful). The object finding sections are ridiculous however. While I appreciate that you are actually looking for objects that would be of interest in a crime investigation (hair, blood, foot prints etc.), the objects are tiny and blend into the background. This would be fine if there was some way to zoom in, but there is not (some exceptions), thus forcing you to use hints. This is coupled with a rather bland deduction system that seems to have do very little to actually progress the story (almost all of the matches you make are to match people to places that you already know they were at… like their office or dressing room).  Length and Misc Took me about 4.8 hours on the highest difficulty, trying to avoid using hints as much as possible.			"

												The game is a weak casual adventure or better said, puzzle game. It has nice locations, that is a plus. But most of the other things are either mediocre or plain boring. The puzzles inside range from simple to middle difficulty, some of them are based on pure luck (like the ten digit mastermind safe puzzle). The story is shallow at best, and it is lacking the inspiration that is normaly associated with the name ""Sherlock Holmes"".One of the weakest games in playability. The sound and graphics are ok, so if you can get this game cheap, you might give it a try but it isn't worth full priced.			"

												Very bad hidden object game. And even these objects are very obscure. E.g. barely visible foot prints that are just very slightly darker than the background. Or things hidden in almost black shadows.The puzzles range from good to bad. Worst one: Guess a sequence of 10 random digits (from 0-9) in 5 tries. If you reset, the sequence is randomized again. Garbage.			"

												There are many great Sherlock Holmes games created by Frogwares, Jack the Ripper, The Awakened, Nemisis, etc. But this game, Sherlock Holmes and The Persian Carpet is nothing like any of those. Though there are some good points in this game, there are numerous bad ones.I would like to be able to comment on the storyline in the game, but I was too distracted by the terrible gameplay to even notice what was happening. The storyline isn't even crucial to complete the game. The deduction board is where you put clues together, but the story has nothing to do with this, you are merely connecting one object to another.There are three different modes that you can play in, first being, 'causal mode', this mode is a perfect fit for the game, it's annoying and cruisy. The second mode is 'detective mode', this being almost as bad, but instead the puzzles are slightly harder and more pretentious. And last, but certainly not least, 'adventure mode', this is the only tolerable mode in the entire game! It doesn't make the game great, but it makes it bearable. Adventure mode gives you more freedom to go to places, even if you have no business there, and it lets you replay the puzzles, if you have enjoyed at least one of them. In both causal mode and detective mode you cannot revisit any places that you have finished up with, just mentioning that.The dialogue between the characters of Watson and Holmes is almost cringeworthy, when at 221b Baker Street you see them talking, when one character talks an image is shown of that character, these images look terrible in quality and ruin the mood of the converstation. There is no voice acting, that has never been a decider for the quality of story, but it would have aided the dialogue to have some sort of voice speaking over the drowning, looped music. There was an absurd method of leveling, that I can still not determine what it really does. When ever you would level up, a text box would appear on screen and provide you with the information that you have just leveled up, and also provide you with an extra thing to click on. This infamous box also would appear whenever you had investigated all of an area, with the patronising text of Watson apparently speaking to you beyond the grave, or wherever he's at, with him spewing out annoying compliments.While progressing through the game, you realise that this game is a hidden objects game. There's nothing wrong with hidden objects games, but this game went about it all wrong. Instead of having the pleasure to observe the environment carefully and make clever deductions, based not only on object, but thought, and thus incorporating the thought into the gameplay, you click on objects and move on.There were some good things about this game, everything has positive and negative points to it. When you were made to inspect people with a magnifying glass, you had to collect data from very miniscule things, such as fingernails, paint and hair. This making the game feel a bit more thought provoking than clicking on objects with a cursor. This game made heavy reference to cigar or cigarette ash, this was very pleasing, in that the old Sherlock Holmes books mentioned a few times that Sherlock could tell the diffrence between diffrent types of cigarette and cigar ash. Though some of the puzzles in this game were either childish, or impossibly difficult, having little to none puzzles that were enjoyable. There were a few puzzles that challenged me without making me feel a fool, or a child.The deduction board had much potential. At first glance it looked quite fun, but turned out to be a massive hassle. It is purely based on looking at two objects that look alike, or look connected and putting one line to another. It turned out to be so simple Watson could do it! In the end you don't need to complete the whole deduction board, just connect all the lines for the murderer, this manner of completion is nothing in the spirit of the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories, where Sherlock would hardly care for who did it, but rather, all the little observations that are entwined within the case. And I can safely say, there are no interesting, little observations entwined with this game, it is more causal based than it is thought provoking, or in the slightest bit interesting.These are the main things that are distinct in the game. I am not saying that you shouldn't buy this game, I am just not recommending that you buy it. Some people like games that are easy and mindless to play. If you enjoy hidden objects games, or causal games, you would love this game, for it repersents every bit of that. But if you prefer something much more intriguing and pleasurable, I suggest that you go and play the other Sherlock Holmes games, Jack The Ripper, The Awakened, Nemesis or The Testament Of Sherlock Holmes.

												I am playing and reviewing each of Frogware's Sherlock Holmes adventure games in chronological order. This game was released as a casual game after Sherlock Holmes versus Arséne Lupin. And this game is just disappointing. Even though this game is made by Frogware they did not use the voice acting which was common for the previous games had. Sherlock Holmes: Mystery of the Mummy HAD voice acting. And that game is almost unplayable. This game makes that game look good. Even though the focus of the game is to be a Sherlock Holmes Mystery game with Hidden Object instead of Point and Click Adventure the combination would have been fantastic but unfortunatly it falls flat on its face. All of the objects and scenery are just reused by previous installments. Although strangely missing the Mystery of the Mummy which I would have loved to have seen gone back to. I found myself bored with the story and deductions. I litterally finished the game without really caring to read all the text because I was too bored and frustrated with the puzzles. The story is really generic and not at all intresting. The characters are all just one still frame which is disappointing. If they just had a few different poses and some voice acting, the game might have been salvaged.Just to be clear, all of the puzzles can be done without a walkthrough. I managed to beat the hardest puzzle without any help. But I did use a walkthrough to find the dark objects on a dark background. If I have to click around randomly to find the last objects while saving my limited number of hints to finish the deduction at the end, the game failed to be fun. Do not feel bad for me for playing such a poor game, I got this game dirt cheap in a bundle with the other better Sherlock Holmes games so I considered this game to be a free additon which was disappointing. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I hope Sherlock Holmes and the Hound of the Baskervilles game will be better.			"

												Not worthy of a review, but I REALLY wanted to downvote this, because of how blatant a money grab it is. Backgrounds and assets from other Frogwares Holmes games are reused to dress a horrible hidden object game with abysmally bad puzzles and 30 seconds worth of music looping in the background (reused music of course). It can literally not have taken them more than a week to put this piece of trash together. I'm a big Holmes fan and even with the TV on I literally had to force myself through this abomination. Zero redeeming elements. If someone gifts this to you, refuse to accept it.			"

												""A few puzzles were decent, but the rest of the game is soooo awful. Don't waste your time.""Seems the old review was disliked by people, probably because it was too short hence full version:2/10 I finished the game ONLY because i play a lot of HO/P&C don't like to start a game without finish ingit, but i was irritated even after i completely gave up and started using walktrough. Don't do this to yourself.+ A few challenging puzzles that were logical- Barely any story even though it's an adaptation of a novel- You are left clueless, no hints to help- Hidden object scenes are ridiculous, most of them are made so everything blends completely to the background and you have to notice slightest brightness/colour change to find stuff you're looking for, also click a milimeter away from the object and you won't get it- Expect to look for hidden objects as you move, and yes, they are just as blended as in the HO scenes- Puzzles are very hard to solve and it would be ok, IF they at least told you what is the goal youre expected to achieve- Too much trial and error instead of logical thinking- Graphics look dated even for a game in this genre- No music/sounds			"

												Terrible music. So boring I fell asleep playing it resulting in the long play time. No character audio. Just reading text and then mainly doing hidden item games in about 8 different locations and then going back over them again for more items. You may need to turn your brightness up to even see some of the items. You get hints which can be used to find hidden items if you are stuck. There are also some puzzles in the game which you can do or skip if you cant be bothered. My experience with this game; Get bored, Fall asleep, Play some more just because I cant leave the game unfinished, Get drowsey (music is sending me to sleep again), Fight through sleepy piano music to finish the game and find out in a cluedo like fashion that it was colnol mustard in the dining room with the spork!!!!Will probably leave most people disapointed but if you like hidden item games with some tricky puzzles it may be for you.2/10			"

												As usual it would be nice to have more than thumbs up or thumbs down for recommendations. This is a very casual point and click/hidden object adventure game.    As advertised, you take on the role of legendary supersleuth, Sherlock Holmes, and point and click your way around old London solving a crime.   The gameplay takes the form of a hidden object phase followed by a puzzle phase, assembling torn up notes or erasing a painting to see what was underneath.   The gameplay here is a little like popping bubblewrap. Graphics and artwork aren't terrible, but you're pillarboxed if you own a widescreen monitor, despite having support for 4K monitors, which is a bit weird.     If you like point and click, and you have a 15 year old monitor, go for it.  Otherwise the weird pillarboxing and too, too casual gameplay stops this one from getting over the line.			"

												An all-too-budget addition to Frogwares' portfolio, The Mystery of the Persian Carpet is a mix of hidden object game and a puzzle game, graphically made out of bits and pieces of The Secret of the Silver Earring and The Awakened, and sound's likely borrowed too. What little there is. The puzzles are mostly rehashed fare from their ""major"" adventure game titles as well... if you play the game after those two, it will just be too easy, and, for the experienced adventure gamer, even without that. Well, apart from the one thing that it probably inherited from the first game of the series - the stupidly frustrating pixel hunting, even for the genre - some hidden objects are very, very well hidden, and tiny. Not a game for the visually even slightly impaired really. The story is an afterthought really, uninspiring and dull... making even the ""for kids"" aspect irrelevant in my opinion - as I'll introduce my kids to the subject with more competent titles. There is a strange clues & suspects scheme (""deduction tree""), which is partly trial & error, raising the amount of useless clicking in the game to an even higher level.Even though you get all the puzzles in one place, to replay after you're done with them should you wish so, the game has 0 replay value in my opinion, and none of them is intriguing enough to warrant a visit again. Visually dated now, uninspired & uninspiring, I can't recommend it as there are so many much better takes on the genre nowadays (including The Hound of The Baskervilles from the same series) . But, chances are that you'll just get it in a bundle, like me... then just don't bother with it unless you've run out of other games to play, or if you have played all the other games in the series, and really want to play this one too.

Ever vigilant Sherlock Holmes ignores murder until it involves fancy foreign floor decorations.  Puzzles and hidden objects abound while unraveling this devious mystery.The setup is compelling but the implementation is rough and leaves the gameplay feel stunted.  The crime themed setting requires players to find multiple piles of dust and dirt which are as difficult to pick out as they are boring to do so.  The puzzles themselves are very simple requiring busy work over critical thinking, draining the drive to dig deeper into the meta mystery.			"

However, it's not impossible.  Now, if you're going for something nice and shiny and new, I wouldn't recommend you get this.

												First off this  is  a hidden object game and not a point and click adventure. just to clarify. I still couldn't enjoy it cause its completly text based. There are no animations, more like screenshots with sometimes different overlays. That's why its just feels very static in 2016. Since there is no voice acting involved and the graphics are not good and i'm not a fan of reading, this game is a no go. Its maybe worth 2 euros but not 10 at all.

It follows the logic of adventure games from a *long* time ago, with puzzles which take a lot of time but just because of the many steps you have to take to complete them.The deduction board seems the only interesting and ""sherlockian"" thing in the game, and you don't use it that much.Not worth your money nor your time.Plus: IT'S FREAKING BUGGED. There's this pipes puzzle from which you cannot advance by completing it, so unless you skip it (and you have only a few skips you can use) you really just can't advance.			"

												After playing some of the Sherlock Holmes PC games that came before this one, it made me sad that this game is completely different, yet the same..  it's different in that it's all 2D pictures, whereas previous games were 3D & animated & some even had 1st person view.  it's also different in that there's NO voice acting at all.  only music & sound effects.what makes me the saddest is that it's the same as previous games, because those 2D scene pictures are all basically screenshots from areas in previous SH games..  some scenes have been altered a bit with some objects removed or added, but they're still the same areas.  also, most, if not all, of the puzzles were taken from the previous games..  the story was still pretty good though, which I was happy about.  I played it on the ""hardest"" difficulty which was Adventure Mode, because it had ""Difficult Puzzles"" (which were still easy), and it was the only mode with ""Freedom of Investigation"".  the other modes were ""Guided, Linear Investigation.""  still finished the game in around 3 hours.  the only thing I really liked was examining each person's picture for clues & them linking them to locations to find out who was where & eventually find out whodunit.I'll recommend this game for the story & for the suspect's picture investigations & linking clues.
