												This game is an absolute delight! It's pretty much a must buy, especially at this price. It's about a 4-5 hour game that will continuously make you smile. Where some of the frustration coming from the gameplay is mediated immediately by the hilarious characters and overall lighthearted feel of the game. It's like playing a comedy act, in a sense. It has an amazing artstyle, unique and very pretty. ""So much art... such beauty"" to paraphrase a certain seagull. The printscreens really doesn't do the game justice.The gameplay consists of a mixture between platforming, point and click and stealth. It's fine, nothing incredible, but it does it's job. It isn't too hard to progress. It does suffer from having the game be in the way of everything else, where you just want to get past these annoying stealth sessions to get to the good/fun part. The writing and voice acting shined a lot brighter than the gameplay did. This made the mood go down a bit when if you're a complete ♥♥♥♥-up you will be stuck at a few points for a while, but as said before, the game will make it up to you with it's intelligent writing, more or less hilarious humor, artstyle, new and intriguing situations. Buy this game, now, please. Go do it. It's the most I've laughed in a game since Psychonauts and it's really something everyone should play. It's a game with personality, a personality you will like, and that's sort of rare. Have fun.			"

												Damn, Stick It To The Man is just wonderful. The graphics reminded me of Psychonauts, another great game. That's also where the comparison (mostly) stops. Because this game is charming, fun and original, and it manages to do all that all on its own, without the need to copy from other popular games. You play as Ray and early on in the story you manage to get an arm sticking out of your head. Not just an arm, it's actually an alien that makes use of your body. With this arm you can read the minds of other people to get hints on what to do next, but some of the people will also be reminded or think of certain events and that way items can be created.The game plays like a platformer, but the gameplay itself is similar to that of a point-and-click adventure. Minus the frustrating, boring puzzles those games usually have.The voices are done very well, with plenty of variety as far as characters go.It's just a shame that this game is so short. A playthrough will last around 4 hours, which is enough, but it's not enough for a wonderful game like this. I enjoyed it all the way through and never got frustrated. That's partly the reason why I hoped it would last longer. Maybe for a possible sequel (the game does hint at one after all). A game like this should be a critical and financial success. It truly deserves to be. But I seriously doubt that will happen...Anyway, let's wrap this up. My verdict: Stick It To The Man is a must-play and must-own for any serious gamer ![Rating: 88/100]			"

Well I did find one problem while playing through the game there was a glitch where the hand would break and fly out to the direction I was looking and become unusable. But I did enjoy the game and I would give it on a rating 9/10			"

												8/10+ nice presentation, great soundrack, good voice acting+ interesting, humorous story, unique atmosphere+ original gameplay, mix of platforming (basic platforming to be specific) and adventuring (solving puzzles by reading minds and placing stickers that you find in the environment, trying to avoid some bad guys at the same time)- light game in general, not much to do gameplay wise, it's more about finishing it for the story- short in duration, can be finished in 1-2 sessions- reminds me of psychonauts (mostly because of the design) but psychonauts is way better			"

It’s a rare gift to deliver an absurd and sparkling but logical (in its own way) story.It’s about:	how is it to be Mel Gibson from What Women Want but in video game;	reading NPC’s minds and helping them to solve their problems;	checking that your “condition was in”;	laughing a lot.Why you should play this:	the atmosphere of total insanity in sauce of jokes about Smoking Man from X-files, pirates, Peter Pen, Moby-D.ck, nurses and doctors (incl. your favourite - psychiatrists), Big-Foot, Santa Claus, Walking Dead (game or TV show – have no idea, but it was certainly about it), they even refer on old comedy “Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot” with Stallone...	stylish “flat” graphic;	vivid main character; 	the game brings forgotten feeling of enjoying playing – not working, not suffering, not nervous trying to beat a hard level, not ""push X to win"" – just pure entertainment.Why you may not like it:	it’s short – will take 5…6 hours, not more and maybe 1…2 additional hours to get all achievements, but through the fact that it is a game where humor plays main part it’s quite long;	unfortunately, there’s no such thing as replay ability – it’s great only for one time as any good joke. Great parody – unique thing in computer games. And do not look screenshots: you will be just poisoned with spoilers. "

Note: video review embedded below.Stick It To The Man’s unabashed insanity is its saving grace.Though it took trudging through a serviceable yet tedious adventure game adjoined to an awkward platformer, developer Zoink’s oddball game about a dude who suddenly finds he can read people’s minds is so consistently amusing and clever that I found I rarely cared that I was only playing for the writing.In a lot of ways Stick It To The Man is really refreshing. Few games venture into the realm of comedy, but Zoink jumps in head first with no reservations. Every line and character is progressively more absurd than the last, with each joke zipping by so fast you might miss it if you aren’t paying attention but making it easy to enjoy the ride due to having little time to actually dissect what’s going on.stick it to the man pic 1If you were to break it down I doubt Stick It To The Man would elicit much more than a chuckle, but it’s how fully embedded it is in its ridiculous plot and satirical commentary that makes it all work. Every time I started the game it would take a moment to adjust to its outrageous style of humor, but a few minutes later I’d be sticking stickers all over things they don’t belong on and having an immensely good time watching the chaos unfold. Stick It To The Man is like a roller coaster that only goes up, with the stakes and quality of gags getting more and more insane the longer the game goes on even as you’re waiting for it to all come falling apart.That’s not to imply Stick It To The Man is a particularly long game, clocking in around 3-4 hours, but it’s so densely packed that I think that’s all I could realistically take. It often felt like I’d been playing longer than I actually had simply do to how much stuff was always happening and continuing to happen even while I was trying to comprehend the scene before. It’s frankly a little exhausting to play, but in a way that makes you glad for its brevity because it ends right when you want it to.There’s undeniably a lot of Stick It To The Man that’s little more than functional boredom, whether it’s the dull and obtuse puzzle designs or the few aggravating times you come across an enemy and have to manage the clumsy platforming controls to avoid them. There are only a few instances of this sprinkled throughout the game yet each always longer and worse than the last time you came across one. These scenes might work on a technical level, but there’s never any need for them to have been included.But then everything circles around again to how delightfully written Stick It To The Man is even at its worst moments, and how that was more than enough to counteract its mechanical deficiencies for me. It’s as stupid as it is clever and delivered with enough style to make even the most cringeworthy joke work. Even though I can’t say I had a lot of fun playing Stick It To The Man, I was more than happy to spend some time reading the minds of its terrible, oh so entertaining hooligans.

												If you like a sense of humor in your games, this is a great little puzzle platforming adventure.  It feels like an old Tim Schafer point and click game.  The puzzles are never very tough and the platforming is never tricky, but the humor and the top notch voice acting carry this game.  Easily some of the best characters I've seen in a game recently.  Just be aware that there are only 10 chapters which take about half an hour each to complete.  I picked it up on sale for around $5 which is a great deal, but I wouldn't have a problem if I paid $15 for it - I know I'll replay it at some point, it's too funny not to.			"

												It's not THE Psychonauts sequel we've all been waiting for, but it's got nice art style (2D in 3D graphics) and good writing that both look and feel like they were lifted from DoubleFine's concept room. Gameplay is a platformer-stealth-puzzle mix that is quite relaxed most of the time, platforming is a bit sloppy, puzzles are not always logical (but are solvable anyway because of a limited number of possible interactions), stealth is jaringly uneven, but i like setting, art, story and voice acting. If you loved Psychonauts (and who didn't?), you are likely to like 'Stick it to The Man!' Now, if only developers bothered with a demo...			"

 Stick It To The Man  is a colourful platform/puzzle game where you use stickers on objects to progress in the game. The art style is cartoony with cardboard figures and looks special in a positive way. Story U play as Ray, an average guy that one day gets a mysterious tentacle on his head that grants him the ability to read minds, and so a crazy journey begins to find out why this happened to him. My thoughts about the game I had a great time with this game reading peoples minds, and often there was funny dialogue among the different characters u meet in game. I liked the art and colours in this game, and that the objects u pick up is different stickers for different purposes.The game is sometimes challenging with platform sections, that could be frustrating to some people (including me), but its not a hard portion of the game to master.I recommend this game to all that like puzzle/platformers with a different art style and funny dialogues.

												Played so far only 24 minutes as I started this well in the night, made it just a little into the game.  I simply can't leave this game uncommented even after only this little amount of time - here I'm sitting, listening to the menu music 4th time in a row. I actually listened it once in the menu before starting the game, it's so awesome (Just Dropped In by Kenny Rogers) The game is really promising - intresting paper world with lots of fourth wall breaking (Ray noticing about how absurd that he has to jump a lot to get to home during a tutorialish first level, checkpoints are photocopiers what prints you as respawning), really well-written and witty dialogues with puns, jokes, and don't forget about the great voice-acting! The game itself is a little weird, it reminds me to some cartoons of the 90s in terms of graphics that's borderline bizarre and weird, but this also gives the game some uniqueness - speaking about being unique, don't forget the ""giant pink spaghetti hand"". So far platforming mechanics are solid and controls of the character, including the arm are easy to get used to - the mindreading is a great idea, I'm really looking forward for some good laughs and creative problem-solving using this tool.I'm really looking forward to continue to play this game, but first I really need some sleep, I'll update the review probably after the completion the game and/or getting all achievements :)EDIT: Finally finished - 15.8 hours, with lots of afk/desktop running. I would say people are quite right when they say the game is ~ 5-6 hours long , but it really depends on you listening to every single person, or just skip it.The game was fantastic, intresting and I'm especially happy that the story stayed just as solid at the end as it was at it's beginning. I've found quite a few instresting sentences, dialogues, pictures that made me laugh - I even got to save Santa! :)The final level was outstandingly creative - don't want to spoil anyone's joy of exploration - I'll just say it can be hard with mothers  ;) Stick It To The Man! was maybe the most unique game I've played in the past months, along with Jazzpunk.  This game was really a joy to play, always staying curious about what madness the developers put into the next scene.  Achievements are also not overbearing, quite easy to do because of the chapter select, plus they encourage interaction and exploration ( Most of achivements are tied to listening to certain thoughts)			"

												A short, but very stylish platformer with a few point & click elements thrown in.The story is functional and maybe the weakest point of the game next to it's length. It makes up for it though by not taking itself seriously at all, with a nice and sometimes nicely twisted humour.While the game is not particularly difficult, it has some tricky passages and minor puzzles. It's overall presentation is very polished: the graphics are done in the style of cardboard popups, playing with depth of focus to further improve it's look, making it a joy to look at; the voiceovers are fun to listen to, with a fair amount of dark humour; the controls are very precise, so in that respect the game never gets unfair.Definitely worth playing if you like the genre, but because of it's length of maybe 5 hours I'd recommend waiting for a sale to pick it up.

												Tim Schafer didn't make this, but he could have. If you like Double Fine's games like Psychonauts or old LucasArts adventure games, you'll probably enjoy this. It's a 2.5D side-scrolling action platformer with enemies that you need to be quick to avoid, and also a strongly characterized humourous adventure game where you collect items (in sticker form, of course) to solve ridiculous puzzles and advance the storyline.The protagonist is Ray - a hapless yutz that exists in a world made of paper. Through an accident, he involuntarily gains telepathic/telekinetic powers. Because of his new abilities, he is pursued by The Man responsible for his fate for the rest of the game.Takes about 5 hours to play all the way through, and works very well with a keyboard and mouse - though the in-game instructions are primarily focused on the use of a controller.

												One of the better indie games out there. An interesting title that does things differently.What not to expect:- combat- platforming- a challengeWhat to expect:- cool sound track (Jazz like I think)- Surreal art style- Funny story and dialogue- An interesting game mechanic (you basically can mind read people, steal their thoughts, ""stick"" them somewhere else and use it to grab high ledges)- logical ""puzzles""Synopsis: You are Ray, Ray has a spaghetti arm growing out of his head with which he can do the aforementioned things. Reading people's minds will unlock the ""puzzles"", which are mainly get A to B to progress. Sounds boring, but the challenge is not what makes the game appealing. It's the art style, the humour, the semi-professional voice acting and the chilled sound track.It's definitely worth picking up for about 10 dollars or so and can be beaten in about 5-6 hours I'd say. There is NO replay value, however, so maybe you want to pick this up during a sale. I found it entertaining enough and got it via summer sale.Definitely recommended, just for NOT being an indie platformer, FPS or roguelike game, which is apparently all the indie scene has to offer, which doesn't suck. Oh and some sim games I guess...			"

It took me about 4 hours to complete but to me that's perfect because if the game was longer it would get tiresome. The puzzles are simple trial and error on where to put what and the platforming is never hard. I found the game way too easy but I really enjoyed the story and the sense of humor throughout.			"

												A very good game.  The humor and seemingly simplistic 2D papercraft art is a welcome change from games of this type.I think this game would have sold better at $10, especially since there is little to no re-playability once you have completed it.  However, you're not likely to regret this purchase even if you cannot wait for a Steam sale or 3rd party bundle.  Buy it and play it!But do yourself a huge favor if you plan to get all the achievements - especially the most tedious one ""A mind is a terrible thing to waste"" - spend the time to scan all brains (excluding the thugs) before and after events within their area.If you do miss one or two chapters that's not too bad.  But, it sucks to miss one or two scans in 4 chapters like I did because you have to go back through those chapters and keep checking from the main menu to see if you have completed all scans in a particular chapter.It would have been nice if the devs had coded the map dots to change color fully or partially so you could identify the missing brain scans.Update: 2017/03/08:  When this review was written the game was still being sold for $20.  Some time later the price was dropped to $15 and has remained so.			"

												Witty, charismatic, point-and-click adventure / puzzle AND -platformer- game that is story-based with an amazing soundtrack which fit the scenes and atmosphere perfectly. Unique, funny storyline with a lot of dark humour, and creative graphics! The entire world is made out of cardboard / paper.  I enjoyed the strangeness of it all and found myself giggling many times. ;P  I'd love to explain the premise, but I wouldn't know how to do so since it is so (pleasantly) bizzare!  In summary.. you have many abilities; one of which is to read people's minds. Your main goal, thanks to being able to read their minds, is to help those in need with an 'extra' arm/hand that grew out of your head (weird, I know~!).  In order to help them resolve their issues, you have to swing around on different platforms with that extra arm; pick objects up, and subsequently stick those new objects onto other places or onto people to solve puzzles. Weird? ..Absolutely! Fun? ..Definitely!  Underrated? ..me thinks so. I highly recommended it if you're into a game that is deeply story-based, with humour and creative visuals.  ..Orrrrr if you're suffering from nostalgia from those classic point-and-click adventure games like I am. Keep in mind, however, that it is ALSO a platformer! :)  All in all, me likey!			"

""Stick It To The Man"" is a really interesting adventure platformer. Developed by indie studio Zoink Games and published by Ripstone, this game was quite a surprise for me. It tells the story of a mediocre guy named Ray, who gains the ability to read people's minds. He gets into a pretty 'sticky' (god, forgive me) situation, as the reason for his telepathic abilities is something which is highly sought after. The game introduces the antagonist and his minions, who you have to avoid at all cost, seeing as you are still in the body of an average dude. As you can probably guess - the aforementioned abilities are the key to this. The story is written in a very funny way and I found the dialogues to be insanely enjoyable. I can say that the story made me laugh several times.The gameplay is pretty interesting, as you have to gather items to proceed. This makes you explore the world, which is adorable and full with stories. The only quirk that the game has are the little points in levels, where you meet the baddies. You have some cool techniques to avoid them, but sometimes those scenes are a bit frustrating to manoeuvre through. Since they are not that many and the game unlocks a kind of ""fast travel system"", it is easy to forgive that. The puzzles are really innovative and fun.The art-style is somehow gorgeous. Yes, the figures are really ugly, but this kind of grotesque depiction really makes them amicable. The world has a Little-Big-Planet-kind-of-look, since everything seems to be made out of cardboard. The music is perfect, the cool jazz tunes don't make you hurry up your gameplay. The only thing is that sometimes the dialouge gets a bit messed up, but it hasn't been anything all too tragic. You can turn on subtitles anyway.As a whole, I have to say that this game was a nice experience. It is very comparable to Psychonauts, but with a heavier focus on the adventure, than on the platforming. A definite recommendation on my part!			"

												This game was a pleasant surprise, the humour and voice acting were excellent. It's the sort of quirky game that could only really exist as an indie title and it's a great showcase for what a small studio can do, others should take notes. It wasn't very challenging to play, but the game would have lost it's impact if the puzzles were too obscure or there was too much grind. It is also a fairly simple game to get all the achievements on, but credit to the creators for not making the achievements story related or awarding them just for showing up. You could just about finish the whole game without getting any achievements.			"

												I heard this game was pretty short and even though I'm the kinda person that tries to get everything out of a game before I finish it and I was quite surprised how fast I got through it (getting to the halfway point can take you about 20 mins). Despite its length, Stick It To The Man! is a really fun game. The artstyle which is a mix between cardboard environments and 2D-paper-like characters looks great, it fits the design and personality of the charcters so well. As far as gameplay goes, you could totally replace the platforming with a traditional point'n'click and it could've have been identical to what I played. The puzzles don't get much more complicated beyond give ""X sticker to Y person"". If the game had more of an open setting it could've been something even better but what I played was just fine.			"

												Primarily this game is an extremely entertaining and fun story very reminiscent of Psychonauts, with witty writing, a great jazz soundtrack and an interesting look. Secondarily this is a game with some basic point and click puzzling and some basic platforming. You don't play it for the gameplay elements though, you play it for the story and the characters and the all around charm it's bursting with.So if you are looking for great gameplay, look somewhere else, if you are looking for 4-5 hours of hilarious weirdness with only minimal gameplay, do yourself a favour and stick it to The Man!

												Fun Puzzle Platformer.Stick it to the man is a puzzle platformer that reminds me somewhat of scribblenauts. You can pick up objects or even thoughts from characters and then you slap them onto the level or into character's minds to solve a series of puzzles that allow you to finish the level. This is pretty good on its own but that's not what this game is about.This game is like an early 90's Nickleodeon cartoon, with incredible visuals and fun script.

												I was sold by the Kenny Rogers theme song upon startup but it turns out that this game is incredibly funny and charming. The paper art style is really amazing and the characters you meet along the way all fit the crazy and stylized look. Mechanics enhance the 2D platforming and support the humor of the diologue.This is a truly funny game (if you like this kind of bizarre comedy) which is something that not many games can say about themselves. If you liked Psychonauts at all, you will like this game. It has similar themes, style, humor, and even a similar name for the main character. The game is somewhat nostalgic with the paper/cardboard art and is very fun to play (if you don't mind being stopped to hear some minor characters engage in a bit of banter every two minutes).			"

												Personal Rating: 6.5 of 10This is indeed a bizzare platformer. It is basically a 2.5D puzzle platformer that requires you to solve a series of quest by reading and fulfilling what is on people's mind by grabbing and placing stickers. This is fairly easy as they were logical and it was meant to be relaxing and funny I guess.Sometimes, in order to get to the other area, you need proper planning, timing, good reflex and precision. Sounds complicated? Well, it the entire map is sometimes separated by a small maze platforms with enemies which you need to avoid. You can read their mind to get stickers use these stickers to plan your moves. These parts can be frustrating because you cannot see beyond the area and usually you need grab a tack, which can appear anywhere, to pass the area while getting chased. If you missed the tack or fail to find it like within a second you need to restart the area. Anything frustrating thing when you try to stick a sleeping sticker to the enemy and he just happened to be standing in front of a tack you will grab the tack and fly towards the enemy instead. This happens 100% of the time. However, these areas are usually small and restarting is fairly quick. Character movement may take a little adjustment to get used to but menial matter.The art style is very good and keeps thing interesting. Game design is great as everything is presented to you straight to the point. Controls is solid and so is the voice acting. Music is catchy and gels with the game nicely.			"

												78%Stick it to the Man is being hailed as a ""spiritual successor to Psychonauts"", a title that I have a few problems with. Sure, it deals with similar subject material and has a similar design aesthetic, but that's like saying ""EVE Online is a spiritual successor to Galaga"". The games are barely similar, the matching artstyle is the closest you're going to get.SITTM plays more like a graphic novel with limited adventure game puzzle solving mechanics. You'll get that nice rewarding feeling from putting the right item into the right slot, but the majority of your time will be spent patiently listening to every mind-reading audio file, regardless of whether or not the puzzle is already solved. You will feel a compulsive need to read EVERY mind you come across, even if it's unnecessary, and you probably should because there's an achievement for it. Ultimately, while having the game come to a stop every 30 seconds so you can read a new mind does indeed break good, natural gameplay flow into splintery pieces, I immediately forgive it. The game is never boring, and no amount of dialogue could stop be from being impressed by the beautiful design.Well... I SAY that, but I never actually finished the game :/.The game plays in 2.5D, and I have to say, I've played with better platforming controls. The protagonist can swing to designated areas and manipulate certain pieces of backdrop, but regular jumping to certin platforms is finnicky, and you will find yourself slipping off quite often if you didn't jump PERFECTLY.I would have rated this game way lower, but it's rare to find a game that makes me laugh so damn hard. The game is genuinely enjoyable, and gets a high reccomendation.			"

												It's a pretty awesome and funny game, I really liked it.Some of the dialogues are hilarious, also graphics can make you laugh sometimes. Basic platforming skills needed, but overall it seems to me like an adventure/puzzle game. The characters have their own personality, mostly Ray has the funniest character, but many secondary characters are also extremely funny.I would play this again at some point. You may die sometimes, but also, going for 100% achievements will make you replay some chapters of the game, but overall it was easy. One could complete this game in 2-3 sessions, it took me 3, with another session for the reamaining achievements. Total of about 8 hours for me.I recommend this game. First played it on PS4, but never actually got to finish it back then, I did it now and I don't regret it. Not really worth $15, but you may be happy to get it on sale for 75% less.			"

												""Stick it to the Man"" is a darn good game.  It took me about 12 hours to complete it, so if you can buy it for less than $12, it's worth the cost.  It's a cross between a fairly easy platformer and a point-and-click puzzler.  Platformers aren't my forte, but even so, it was fun to play.  The paper cutout look added quite a bit of charm to the game.  The only technical issues I had were minor ones at the startup screen:  the resolutions offered didn't quite match my monitor, my chosen resolution didn't always stick across sessions, and the Windowed selection didn't seem to work.  There was nothing that led to any problems with gameplay, though.  A fun game.  Recommended.			"

												""Stick it to the Man"" is hands down one of the most hilarious and original games I have played this year. Poor Ray, a bit of a shlub, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, ends up with a telekinetic/telepathic alien stuck inside his head. On the run from a shady government organization he has to use his new found powers to read the minds of everyone around him, steal the thoughts from their minds and then use them to solve the obstacles between him and safety. The writing is some of the best I've seen in a long time, even just eavesdropping on people who have no relevance to your current obstacle is well worth the laughter it brings. There is a trailer. Go watch it, then go buy the game. The kind of cleverness and creativity on display here puts me in mind of Double Fine at their finest. If you miss out on this, your world is a sadder and darker place and I pity you.			"

												This game was one of the best adventure games I've ever played. The jokes were close by, each of them funny and punchy. The music was fun - most of it wasn't memorable at all, yet it fit perfectly, but the title song was magic. The art was unique, original, fun, and throughout the game world are little background and foreground jokes that add a bit of spice to an already fantastic looking game. Characters were lively, silly, voiced EXCELLENTLY, their inner thoughts giving way to some very good jokes - it's little homages to gaming were tasty icing to naturally good comedy - that actually handle scat humour with real wit. You learned to love our little protagonist and his head... thing. While the puzzles were strange, they made sense, and the wonderful thing about this game that they were solved simply by curiously peeking into peoples thoughts everywhere you went, and you wouldn't play this game if you didn't want to do that. And, like many other people, the game is actually fun for the brief sections where you run from the guards. Those parts get harder with a proper curve, and are fun, and briefly exhilirating. It was a nice way to counter balance the slow puzzling. And the length? It had a story to tell, and it told it quickly. This kind of game was more like a movie than anything else, and the running gag can only last so long. So, by not making looong pointless areas, they condensed everything to a perfectly proportioned pie of funny and pictures and visual stimuli, with a quick, fun story. I wouldn't want it longer, because everything they did felt good. I didn't feel like I wanted more - was satisfied, and laughing. And that, with good voice acting, art style, jokes, pacing, gameplay, game mechanincs, characters, music, and identity, is really, all you can ask for, isn't it? And this game had all of that in SPADES. LARGE SPADES. SHOVELS, EVEN.10/10, Liked It, 5 Stars, *****. And it's not satanically expensive! Buy it!Buy it now! Give it to your friends that don't normally play games! Give it to the ones that do! PAINT RAY'S FACE ONTO YOUR OWN AND GET MOBBED BY CROWDS OF PEOPLE FOR BEING BEAUTIFUL.			"

												A very fun game with a rich sense of humor.  It's not a very long game and easy to complete all the achievements but just long enough to not wear out it's welcome. The game mechanics are simple but at times can be a little fussy when it comes time to selecting which item to grab. I knew I was in for a treat when the first thing I hear when I boot up the game is Just Dropped In by Kenny Rogers & The First Edition. From there you find a world that looks like it's crafted from paper and cardboard, a very unique style. From the bits where you are knocked out and fight out of your own subconscious to reading people's minds to find out what they need or what they are about the story as a whole is light-hearted and funny. The game-play is part adventure game and part platformer, reading people's thoughts and finding exactly what they need in a multi-layered areas so you get what you need to move the story forward. A unique experience I highly recommend.			"

Though it's short,it has a lot to offer from the plot to the character designs and finally the dialouge.DEAR GOD THE DIALOUGE IS HILARIOUS.Think of this game as the lovechild of Psychonauts andbasically anything Double Fine or LucasArts from the 90s,the mechanics of Super Paper Mario:Sticker Star and the charm of such shows as Rocko's Modern Life or any 90s Nick shows.the puzzles do feel less challenging and more ""do this do that"" or are just to obvious or frustratingly boring,not often but once in a while.Then again it's only because this game wants you to actually use your imagination with the stircker based problems if it ever gets difficult.And if it's TOO easy ,then like I said before ,enjoy it for the concept and art .

												Stick it to The Man is a great little puzzle platformer that is all physical and all about the mental. The style of the game looks super realistically like a cardboard diarama and your job is to utilize stickers and pull back paper to solve the puzzles.

												I really enjoy playing this game.  It's very reminiscent of Psychonauts in it's look and comedy (which is a great thing), but not in gameplay.  This is not an openish world to explore, it's a sequence of platformer levels where you get a particular sticker for a particular person several times until everyone is satisfied/helped and the way to the next area/level becomes unlocked.  It's not too terribly challenging/tricky, but there are a few points now and again where it becomes unclear what exactly you're supposed to do next and it'll either take a while of back and forths trying various things or finding access to a new section, or seeking out a walkthrough.

												For the record, I have no clue why this game is called ""Stick it to The Man"" even if you don't end up sticking anything to him throughout the entire game and the titular ""man"" doesn't become a promint figure until the final chapter. But I think ""Weird Wavy Purple Hand Sticking out of Head and sticking various stickers onto other objects and backgrounds"" would have been too long of a title.Anyway, this is my first time really reviewing a game (I'm mostly a film reviewer, so I'm sorry if I seem a bit out of touch and this review itself being all over the place) and I figured it would be of one I got during the big sale recently and thought was worth talking about. I never heard of this game until the sale and even then, I did it mostly because it was cheap and thought it looked cute enough. ""Stick it to The Man"" tells the story of Ray, a guy who lives in a world made up entirely out of paper materiel and stickers. After getting hit on the head, he suddenly wakes up with a big purple hand sticking out of his head and now has the ability to read minds and pull down various objects in the backgrounds and foregrounds. It's pretty straight forward in terms of gameplay: grab objects, stick them to others, run, jump, read minds of anyone to figure out what thing to stick on them, etc and etc. Oh, and you also must avoid being caught by henchmen of ""The Man"" in these small segments that appear every now and then in chapters, along with using your purple hand to grab onto thumbtacks as a grappling hook. It's decently done and kept me playing, but it's nothing I doubt many familiar with adventure games or platformers will think is breaking any new grounds. Puzzles are fairly easy to figure out (but still rather fun to do so) and for the most part, the levels go by in a snap if you know what you need to do with certain stickers and characters.In the grand scheme of things, Gameplay doesn't really seem to main focus of the team behind this. The main focus seems to be mostly on the various types of quirky characters and very odd scenarios/solutions for puzzles and see how many laughs they can get out of the player. I can't really say this game is flat out hilarious or even THAT much nuanced to the weird comedy genre, but there's something oddly charming about it.The art direction looks like ""The Simpsons"" meets ""Psychonauts"" with this odd cardboard and paper aesthetic that's equal parts fun to look at and very bizarre, along with the soundtrack, which is pretty fun too (give ""Get me a Shrink!"" a listen to if you're in the mood for some funky jazz)The writing in general kept me consistently chuckling and laughing through, but I dunno, it all feels.......token? Like, I've felt like I've seen these types of punchlines before but I can't put my finger on where exactly (it could be Matt Groening, Tim Schafer, or Dan Povenmire, but it could be something else entirely), but they're still funny and it made me want to see where it would go next. Voice acting is pretty solid across the broad, but there's some moments (mostly during jokes) that the timing of the punchlines feel a bit off, which for a comedy game is a pretty big fail, but it doesn't happen as often as I was dreading. The weird characters you meet throughout the journey are pretty interesting to watch in the ""what the hell is going to be the outcome for him/her?"" sorta way and the game itself ends on a fairly nice punchline. If there's any other issue in regards to gameplay, I would say the segments with the henchmen get pretty tedious after awhile and it's often annoying to be reading the mind of one, only to then have them walk out of the frame you can do so as they charge over to you, with a small delay between moments of getting in control again.I would say as well it's A BIT over priced (?) for four hours of standard Adventure Game stuff if that's what you're looking for, but if you're looking for a breezy, simple, and charming little time killer, stick this one into your chart.7/10			"

												Stick it to The Man! is a thoroughly enjoyable adventure game with a bold identity. The mind reading, platforming, adventure, stealth and paper tearing mechanics take chances and fit great together. Add funny writing, great voice acting, memorable characters, a great style and a superb soundtrack and its a wholly fun time. A minus point is that some of the puzzles verge on moon logic and some items don't work when they feel they should. For instance, near the beginning of the game there are two puzzles that revolve around teeth going on at the same time, so which solution fit where was a bit confusing. These issues are common in many excellent adventure games though (Grim Fandango for example) and in this case don't distract from the many, many great things this game has to offer.  I'm the kind of person who exhausts every dialogue tree in an adventure game so I really enjoyed reading minds and learning about the misfits who inhabit this crazy paper world. Great stuff, I'm happy I grabbed it on Chrono.gg when it was on sale!			"

												I really enjoy playing this game.  It's very reminiscent of Psychonauts in it's look and comedy (which is a great thing), but not in gameplay.  This is not an openish world to explore, it's a sequence of platformer levels where you get a particular sticker for a particular person several times until everyone is satisfied/helped and the way to the next area/level becomes unlocked.  It's not too terribly challenging/tricky, but there are a few points now and again where it becomes unclear what exactly you're supposed to do next and it'll either take a while of back and forths trying various things or finding access to a new section, or seeking out a walkthrough.

												The 2D spiritual successor to Psychonauts. Incredibly offbeat 2D adventure/platformer with a surreal (psycho-nauts-esque) cardboard-cutout/puppet aesthetic, insane NPC's and a script written by people on drugs. About 6 hours long.Highly recommended.			"

												Stick it to the Man! is an adventure game, using 2D puzzle-platforming as the vehicle for its clumsy humor. You'll solve puzzles by reading people's minds, and manipulating them into thinking about a certain item that you can use somewhere else on the chapter. It's certainly not a hard game, with it nicely structured levels, always subtly guiding your way, never proving frustrating.It's been said to be ""Psychonauts"" spiritual successor. While I have not played Psychonauts, I've played other Double Fine games, and the influence is clear! While the game mechanics don't seem to take the spotlight, they're very well conceived, and fit very well with the game's theme and aesthetics. It was one of the more enjoyable games I've recently played!PresentationThis is probably the highlight in this game. Everything from the visuals, to the music and the voice acting is awesome!It's a very colorful game, done in 2.5D. This is achieved by making every sprite like a cardboard cutout. The levels are then set in layers. While the game is mostly 2D, you can sometimes walk back and forth, discovering some charming details that would otherwise be blurred.The character design is also great. While everyone looks silly, their designs clearly shows their personality, coupled with the problems you'll solve and the voice acting... It's good.The music is mostly jazz (it reminded me of the bebop soundtrack in Grim Fandango, maybe a bit silly at times) with a bit of sci-fi synth thrown in, at times. I really liked it, and it's certainly something that not only fit the game, but it's also something I'll listen to after I'm finished with the it! (You can get it here: http://stickittotheman.bandcamp.com/releases with a PayWhatYouWant model)The sound-effects Also fit well with the cartoony style. Never felt out of place, so that's good.The voice-acting was also great! Reinforcing the characters and the overall feel of the game, and was mostly well done! There were a few characters that felt a bit inconsistent, but nothing too major. Also, you can rewind and fastforward their speech, making the voices even sillier, with a higher tone, if you're in a hurry. It's these details that make this game so enjoyable, honestly!The game's writing is great as well! It's not anything deep, as you can imagine (although it does hint at some major issues, in a very lighthearted way), but it's certainly funny, if you're into this kind of humor.General StructureThe game's divided by chapters, each with its theme, set of characters and puzzles. You can always go back to previous chapters through the menu, so you don't need to worry about missing an objective and being blocked from going back. This is something I very much appreciate! I hate being blocked for apparently no reason. Most of the chapters also have some achievements. Most of them are just a guide to silly characters that were more well hidden. It's a good use of them, to be honest! There are a couple of them that were more skill-based, if you're into that. But the Stick it to the Man! is a very laid-back game, and it never really tests your skills or patience.Each level has lots of checkpoints, and you'll never lose any progress. The worst that can happen is you being sent a few meters back, but you never lose items or conversations.Each level is about 20-40 minutes long. It felt just the right length for me. I played each chapter in one sitting, sometimes 2, and it never felt too short or to drag on. Also, since the levels can be fairly long, walking back would be a pain. As such, they've implemented a sort of fast travel system. Once you reach a certain point, a pipe open up, and you can go back instantly (and go forward once again).It's a very comfortable game to play, as weird as it sounds. It's never frustrating, you're unlikely to walk around back and forth pointlessly, it's not punishing... just a nice, funny experience, overall.MechanicsBasically, you're hit on the head, and an alien just happens to casually get into your brain. When that happens, a giant floppy pink hand grows out of your head, which only you can see. Nah, of course you're not crazy! It's alieeeens. Anyway. This giant hand gives you the ability of reading people's minds, and materialize their thoughts. As freeing as it sounds, it's a very ""linear"" game. They'll only think of things you need, of course.When you encounter a character, you'll learn about their problems, and then have to find the solution, somewhere. The game's is very similar to a point n' click. However, while the solution aren't too obvious, at first (since they're very non-sensical -- in a good way!), you can easily find everything by walking around and getting more items. If you have more than one, you'll store them, and can switch between them with the mouse-wheel.If you stay put, your character will also say something about the item, leading you in a general direction. There are also very subtle environmental hints, so I doubt you'll get stuck.So yeah. You'll walk around the level, speaking to the characters and reading their thoughts, often leading to some very peculiar situations, as you solve their problem in funny ways.Again, it's not a game you'd play for the mechanics, but they're still very well put together! They fit with the theme, and even amplify it, never proving a nuisance, unlike other games in a similar style. It's very well designed!It's pretty hard for me to get more to talk about. The game is very good, but it doesn't seem to do anything that jumps out at you. Everything just seems to fit together brilliantly, to me.For an adventure game, the 2D platforming certainly helped, against the traditional Point n' Click styleUsually, games like this opt for the point n' click genre, rather than 2D platforming. As a result, their movement system is also very clunky and slow, going around the screens, taking seconds of waiting at a time. Stick it to the Man! avoids that entirely, by giving you total control at all times!It makes the game incredibly better, in my eyes. It's not that I have anything against Pn'C games, but I usually find myself frustrated when I have to walk back and forth very slowly, simply to try a random combination of items.This game, however, makes movement faster, and every scene seems to have some little detail that makes the walking around even more enjoyable.Lack of punishmentThere are games that benefit from being punishing and challenging. This is not one of them, and the developers recognized it very well. It's not that there isn't any challenge. There certainly is (mostly by being chased around the guards -- which people didn't enjoy very much!), but even if you ""fail"", you don't lose progress, and the more challenging sections are short, just keeping things varied. The puzzles keep moving you forwardLast point I want to make. You rarely have to backtrack to solve a puzzle, at least to the point of annoyance. You'll usually gather items as you go, and use them either very near the place, or further ahead. On the times you do have to go back, the solution are clear, and there's usually an easy game to get back. Again, the point of the game is to present you with a silly story and character interactions, and it does that very well!ConclusionI don't have anything else to say, honestly. I really, really enjoyed the whole way through. It's on the short side, but it's certainly worth it. If you like Double Fine's games (the Stacking and Grim Fandango particularly coming to mind -- And Psychonauts for most people), give this one a go! I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Even if you don't... if the description sounds appealing, I still recommend it. It's just a very good game!			"

Once you have completed the game, thats it,.. sure you can have another go, but its like watching a comedy show where you already know all the punchlines.If you're the type that would rather spend 5-8 hours on an absolutely great game, than a small eternity playing just to kill time, this is the game for you!

												An overall decent platformer that'll keep you entertained for a few hours. The few stealth passages are, however, more annoying than challenging, as it is pretty much impossible to figure out a suitable route and you just end up running around hoping you don't get caught. The main selling point of this game is the original art, storyline and sense of humor, so if those are  thethings you're looking for in a game I have to recommend this title!			"

												Stick it to The Man! is a thoroughly enjoyable adventure game with a bold identity. The mind reading, platforming, adventure, stealth and paper tearing mechanics take chances and fit great together. Add funny writing, great voice acting, memorable characters, a great style and a superb soundtrack and its a wholly fun time. A minus point is that some of the puzzles verge on moon logic and some items don't work when they feel they should. For instance, near the beginning of the game there are two puzzles that revolve around teeth going on at the same time, so which solution fit where was a bit confusing.

For $15 (unless its on sale) it is still a great buy and I would snatch it up in a second.I played with an xb360 controller - the controls with the controller felt very natural and it was clearly written for a controller to be used with it (I believe this was a ps3/4 game to begin with?  no?) ...

												Stick It To The Man is a platformer with puzzle elements. The player controls the main character Ray, who has a glowing purple space spaghetti thing sticking out of his head. Ray uses this to read the minds of other characters. In pursuit of his own goals Ray must help other characters fix their life problems which are usually quite humorous (though sometimes I found them pretty sad). Most of the gameplay consists of simple platforming in the pursuit of various items and characters. There are sections where Ray must avoid enemy agents. These sections can be pretty tough in the last couple sections, but death just results in you being printed out of a nearby Mr. Copy so its not that frustrating.The game looks and sounds amazing. The soundtrack has a lot of jazz numbers with sprinkles of other stuff like disco or Mickey Newberry's ""What Condition My Condition Is In"". It all fits well with the environments and mood of the game. The paper cut-out look works great and is bright and colorful. Also this game could run on a toaster. I was downsampling from 4K and it was still running at 80 fps.Where this game really shines is the writing and humor. All the characters, even the most minor ones have a real personality to them. I was laughing within the first minute and proceeded to do so for the entire game. There were even some moments that found a way to be funny, sweet, and sad all at the same time. That and a heavy dose of self-awareness make a really compelling experience.I clocked in around 4.5 hours for my playthrough but it is definetly worth it for the price.			"

												A severely overlooked game - it seems like it has a really small amount of players across all of its platforms; and yet I imagine that there is a really large amount of people who would enjoy this game so much!Now, the first thing that I will say is that the game is pretty short and can be completed (100%) in 5 hours, or probably under that. However, I did not regret my purchase of this game at all. Worst case scenario for you: Just buy it on sale, and you should have no issues.This game is so unique and drew me in much more than I expected. The story, from a high-level perspective, is a bit cheesy, and the villain of the game is also somewhat annoying and lacks thrill, BUT that is intentional to fit with the overall style of the game. It is really off-the-wall, filled with random silly jokes and a good bit of dark humor (a couple of places are surprisingly dark), but it all flowed together, in an intentionally messy way.The art is in this paper and sticker format, which actually was done in such a way that I enjoyed it very much. It was not tacky at all. Everything is very well drawn, and a good amount of the level design and characters have this interesting sort of dreary, grimy look. Some items, buildings, people, and so on, are brighter and stand out from everything else that has a background tone or shading, but the background itself is really detailed and by all means should be looked at just as much as the stuff with which you interact.The theme song of the game was a very good pick, and the sounds and music as you play are pretty simple in most places, but also enjoyable. I did not have a problem with anything that I heard in the game. Then you have the voice acting, which was amazing. So many characters voiced by a small amount of people, and they were definitely unique as well. I didn't notice any characters sounding too close to each other.The game itself is split into chapters, or essentially levels, and you must explore the levels and solve small puzzles where other characters are wanting specific objects. You must find the objects either lying around somewhere, or by obtaining them from other characters. As you help certain characters out, they will sometimes do things like break/open doors for you to continue on in the level, or end up giving you another item that you will have to figure out how to use. While the general idea is simple or not necessarily exciting, the game really benefits from its style as mentioned above, as well as the actual gameplay of how you will do the puzzle-solving.Your character, Ray, has an accident and ends up with a weird arm sticking out of his head, which in and of itself allows for the gameplay. The game is an interesting mix of platforming and point-and-click, where you use your mouse to control the arm and grab objects that you need, as well as do something stranger: read other characters' minds. When you read their minds, you will sometimes just hear thoughts and jokes, while other times will give you hints about what to currently do in a level (e.g., what a character might be looking for), or even end up having a character release a thought cloud which contains an item that you can grab and carry with you.Don't worry, though: You shouldn't get bored by the above, as the level design and characters are very interesting (as I know I have said multiple times so far), and just about every time you give an item to someone, a cutscene will occur showing some wacky events happening that will very likely make you laugh (assuming you enjoy the humor of the game). Hence, I had fun every single minute of the game, running around and figuring out what to do with so many weird items and people you encounter.Again, I will say that the game surprised me. I watched some of the trailers and thought it seemed really odd, and maybe funny, but I didn't go in with any fancy expectations. It turned out to be a lot more than what I felt while watching the trailers. So, unless you absolutely hate the scenes in the trailers, I would say to give the game a chance, even if you are on the fence or somewhat unsure. I expect that you will also be surprised like I was. I really recommend this game.			"

												Just finished this game.I wish it was longer, but sometimes games aren't meant to be long, they're meant to be joyful, unique and amazing experience, and this was one of them.I wasn't expecting anything when I bought this one, the artstyle and the title of the game got me curious so I bought it.I can tell you that the overall story, the jokes and the gameplay are simply awesome. Ray, Ted and all the other characters will stay with you a long time even after you finished the game.It's weird, quirky, and just pure awesome.A must-buy if you like plateforming, point and click games and funny, absurd stories.

												Although it may say that i have 9 hours on record i was idle for the most part of that and takes only 4 hours at the most to compleate. Stick it to the man is a 2.5D side scrolling puzzle game, with asthetic pleasing to the eye and personality bursting out of evey orifice. Unfortunatly most of the characters you come across are as forgetable as the next trying to be humorus only your nan and grandad would titter at. The puzzles are mediocre at best and dosent take a genius to work out - sure you may get stuck a few times thats only probably you didnt talk to someone properly thus not giving you the prompt to read thier minds.Overall its a good game with art style to be in awe of for a few hours. although i do recommend this game but not at this price - wait until a steam sale appears and sure enough this will be in there.

												A short, psychedelic platformer from indie Swedish developer Zoink that actively encourages the exploration and use of thoughts, psychical characteristics or any other object that your mental spaghetti hand can rip off and apply  as stickerized solutions to aptly Stick it to the Man! It's greatest strength and flaw is its commitment into offering a nonstop experience, that from start to finish, is one long 8 mile trip into a paperized sky. The characters never outlast their welcome or initial joke and controls for this game are exceptionally ported to PC mouse and keyboard. While USD 14.99 may be a bit too much for a game that even I could beat in less than 6 hours, at its current discount it’s an absolute steal. "

												Stick it to The Man! is... strange. It's a puzzle platformer that's more of a point-and-click, but neither of those facets of the game aren't super successful.The main mechanics of Stick it to the Man! are reading people's minds to gather information and manipulating the world by peeling off stickers and placing them on other things to solve problems, all while avoiding government agents out to get you. The mind reading part is tedious. The voice acting is great, but some characters speak very slowly and by the time you finish reading the subtitiles, the character is only halfway through his or her speech. Dialogue cannot be skipped in pieces or scrolled through, only sped up or skipped entirely. The puzzles themselves aren't anything special. One of the recurring ""puzzles"" (if you may call it that) is escaping the agents trying to get you. I didn't enjoy any of these segments. I'm assuming the game expects you to cleverly sneak around the enemies, placing stickers on them to make them fall asleep or distract them. However, this is usually impossible to do as you can't see all the agents on the screen at once and you have only a few seconds before they notice you and start chasing you around. It's much easier to just run to the other side than trying to spend time sticking stickers on people and getting caught.Stick it to the Man's strongest element is its art style. The character design is amazing as every character looks unique with a different personality. Everything has a cardboard or paper-y texture, but it's different than, say, Paper Mario. It's almost as if the game would be stronger as a cartoon instead of a video game, or maybe if the focus was more on a point-and-click style than a platformer.Overall, I don't think I can recommend this game as a game, but, if you like art and design, it might be worth it to at least try it.

												Initially the game struck me as stylistically reminiscent of Psychonauts, but the more I played the more I kept getting reminded of Rocko's Modern Life, so I guess if you take those two, mash 'em together, and then put them in the context of a 2.5D point'n'click (move'n'stick?) adventure, this is what you get.The gameplay is relatively simple; you grab read people's thoughts, grab stickers, and then stick those stickers in the proper spots to solve the various puzzles, all while avoiding getting caught by the various thugs sprinkled as obstacles throughout the game. There are some platforming challenges involved, but calling them ""challenges"" is really stretching the definition of the word. The whole thing definitely leans on the casual side of the gaming fence, but what it lacks in challenge it more than makes up for with a great soundtrack, stylized and attractive visuals, and writing/voice acting that at the least got me to smirk for most of my playthrough if not made me laugh out loud a few times.A short but thoroughly enjoyable experience and a game I'd highly recommend giving a shot.

												When I first started looking at this game, I was expecting a point-and-click adventure game, and I am not a massive fan of those. However I was taken by surprise. This is not a point and click adventure game - it's a platformer and a damn good one at that!There are some really tricky platforming challenges throughout the 9 chapters. You will be swinging and jumping from platform to platform to out run the bad guys. The actual puzzles in the game are more trial and error, there were moments where I was absolutely stuck and couldn't work out what to do next,  and had to result to just spam clicking each object in hope something happened.Control wise, very simple. I used the Xbox controller and had absolutely no problems at all. I can imagine it would be a little more difficult with keyboard and mouse, but name me a platformer that isn't like that.The story is actually quite enthralling as well.  I didn't really think that such a simple looking game would have such a fulfilling story.  I couldn't wait to find out how the game ended. There are plenty of little ""side stories"" which all come with some sort of value to the puzzles as a whole.The games definite strong point is the humor in the writing. I was laughing throughout the whole playthrough and if you like a good laugh while playing a video game, you will not be disappointed here.			"

												A terrific atmosphere brought about through a unique art style with clever, dark, sarcastic humor throughout. The style of humor is VERY much like that in Psychonauts, transformed into a 2D puzzle platformer. Use your characters newfound powers to read people's minds and get at their deepest, darkest secrets - even if that means crashing your notions of beauty, gender, religion, and the scientific method! So far, the puzzles aren't particularly challenging, but the amazing voice acting and memorable characters make this short indie game a must play. If the game had more replayability through additional secrets/collectibles or some more challenging puzzles, it would be PERFECT. As it is - still 9/10			"

												There are things I like about this game, and there are things which frustrate me a lot in this game. I enjoyed my time, but I can only recommend the game if you like a style and bizzare sense of humor (it's a pretty short game, you need 4-5 hours to finish it on your first playthorugh).I like a style and a humor, and first couple of levels are very-very fun. Cut-scenes are fun and the game doesn't show you the same cut-scene if you die. If you replay some level, press backspace for 5 seconds to skip.Voice acting is very good, and most of the dialogs are funny. And you can hold 'd' to speed up the speech if you are bored.However, there are a lot of things I didn't like: it can be a problem with my PC, but controls feel clunky to me. I spend a lot of time retrying jumps of moving platforms. And I am not a new person to the platformers genre. Controls aren't rebindable (at least from the menus). Sometimes you think you can make the jump, but the platform is a bit far away. This won't be a problem, but you have goons in this game.First two or three encounters with goons are good. However, after some time goons are not fun anymore. I just hoped it's the last goon on this level. Good thing you are not forced to do the same section more than once, developers provides you short cuts after you beat the section.And the last thing: I liked some quests, but a lot of them are illogical. I finished a lot of the puzzles with brute force, and  sometimes, couldn't get a logic even after finish.			"

												Great quirky adventure game, managed to avoid the pitfalls that many others fall prey to. You didn't feel bogged down by overly absurd, obscure puzzle solutions, like so often happens in these types of games. The characters, voice acting, and art complimented the game in a way I too rarely see. Very entertaining overall.The downside, it's short. I mean 5 hours max. I had played it for 3.5-4 hours, put it down. Started to play again the next day, and was disappointed to find that I was already at the end. It leaves you wanting more. A satisfying experience overall though. I would give it a 8/10, if it were longer it would probably hit 9/10.			"

												This is a fun puzzle-platformer remincent of games like The Cave, and BattleBlock Theater. The twist or gimmick here is you use thoughts and stickers of the characters around you. Each solution is simiple enough and will usually cause a domino effect giving you the solution for another puzzle in the process within a level. The biggest problem with the game though is when you try to read someones mind, the controls don't work correctly and it takes several tries to the the mind of the character and its not throughly explained. Its a real pain when you need to read the minds of the guards in order to advance. Other than that, its a well made story, and brillant puzzles that will keep you coming back for more.			"

												""The arm is sticking out of my head"" Played the game in one sitting, took me 7 hours. I couldn't stop. Essentially your character is visited by a brainsluggish alien, giving you the super powers of (albeit limited) psychokinesis, mind reading and ... erm altering peoples thoughts into stickers for later use (in the same manner some comic books uses their speech bubbles as an actual part of the world).Art direction is excellent, voice acting is super. Puzzles not so much. It's more or less a casual adventure platformer with wacky characters in which you combine  stickers to fix a problem and your ""mind-hand"" to get further down the path and story. Gameplay feels slick (only used a 360-pad though), a bit like Bionic Commando, but again the emphasis lies with the story and fun exploring nature. tl;dr Fry from Futurama in a jazzy noir Paper Mario-world, drenched in a bucket of Psychonauts.

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. ONE ON ITS KIND!.This is a very rare game, indeed, but not a boring rare game (as VOID or alike), just a full of originality and humor game that it's playable and delivers tons of fun.Put in a coctel shaker a tad of Grim Fandango, a tad of Jim Earth Worm, a tad of Toejam and Earl, a tad of South Park, a tad of LSD, shake it all with attitude and you get this game.At a first glance, graphics can seem kiddy and un-exciting but, has South Park bad graphics and story or, they are just different and you end loving them?. Same here. All scenarios and characters are carefully designed and, the overall ambientation is really well made.Easy at the beginning, goes harder step by step.There are some crazy puzzles, well, sort of!. You usually have to get something to continue the story but, to get that you need to solve a chain of little puzzles in a row first, with no other clues than what your brain-readings say to you  but, not that hard. I was stuck just a couple of times.A drop of platform, a drop of adventure, a drop of puzzle-solving, a drop  of humor, a drop of everything fills a cup of fun and originality.While there are some rare games that come with some original idea, some doesn't work and are really boring as VOID or alike and, some are really exciting, as PAPO AND ME or just this one.Giving the bunch of originality and humor, you can find it short.I think the overall sensation is to be starring some cartoon film, ala South Park. Really funny.Just a warning: BE SURE TO HAVE AN XBOX CONTROLLER ON HAND. I was unable to make this game to work with just keyboard and mouse and, there is no way to re-assign the keys or mouse functions. To me, THIS IS ITS ONLY FLAW.I WISH A SECOND PART COMES SOON !!!It was a pleasure to play this game.			"

The writing is pretty hit or miss, and the puzzles are very simplistic. There are unavoidable stealth sections that are very tedious and awkward because of the clunky platformer mechanics. Ultimately the pros weren't enough to outweigh the cons for me. If you think you'll like an easy, quirky adventure game that can be frustrating at times then go ahead and buy it on sale if it's cheap. Even if you don't get it, definitely check out the great soundtrack!			"

												Humor is a difficult thing to do in any medium, let alone videogames. If your timing isn't just right or the player is not paying attention to the right thing or if the player played something out of order things can fall flat. Unfortunately, Stick it to The Man just fails to successfully hit the notes it needs too. Kudos for an interesting art style and high quality voice acting but what can I say to a game that bases it's hopes on making me laugh when it merely got a single half-hearted chuckle.It's fairly short and clearly the designers wanted to make a grander game since it wraps up pretty abitrarily fast at the end there. None of the puzzles were challenging, I felt like I was simply going through the paces and putting item a in slot b.But hey, I liked that title song when I heard it in The Big Lebowski so there's that.

												Another week, another episode of Was It Worth It? But this isn’t just any episode … this is our super special tenth episode! Okay, fine, it really is just any episode. We promise it’s a good one, though! This week, we played Stick it to The Man, a dark and goofy point-and-click adventure platformer that felt almost like a direct homage to some of Double Fine Productions’ offerings, namely Psychonauts. This game was hilarious and had a charming style that we both enjoyed, although there were a number of problems, ranging from repetition to plain old joke murdering.

												A groanworthy sense of humor and plodding, repetitive gameplay distract from the beautiful animation and interesting story that this game has to offer - having to stop every 10-15 seconds to hear one-dimensional psuedo-tongue-in-cheek dialogue might be your idea of fun, but it's not mine.

												This is a ""Don't get me wrong"" review, because, don't get me wrong, this is a fun and somewhat addictive game, but when you look at it properly it doesn't have enough in it for me to recommend this game. Stick it to The Man! is an alternative graphic style game which is pulled off really well, (As well as the protagonist pulls walls off buildings) and I mean really, really well. The music is nice and fitting as well, and the voice acting is of good quality, but that's as far as this game goes. The storyline, I honestly believe they just made it up as they went along, and the dialogue is often cheap, (I'm willing to forgive them for that though, they had to include some cheap dialogue to have as many jokes as what they did (and they had a lot, mostly irony and dark humour, but some satire against popular culture as well) prepare to be pun'd) but the most disapointing part of the game is the gameplay itself, it is literally just a combination of zelda style item collecting / trading, and hostile encounters that pretend to add gameplay, but aren't very well expanded on. This game isn't a puzzler, it's a storyline grind without a storyline, and for that reason I give it a thumbs down, but if it were the free online flash game that it is meant to be, then even if the graphical fidelity wouldn't be nearly as amazing, it would do really well. If you are buying games full price; avoid this game.[EDIT] I forgot to mention, this game does work extremely well with a gamepad, so if you can, then use one.			"

												I gave this game a fighting chance, but in my opinion it's really difficult to enjoy.It's an adventure/platformer with a huge Little Big Planet feel. You play as a dude who has an alien in his brain, which gives him mind reading powers and, since the alien is basically a stretchy arm, the ability to jump between platforms and grab things like stickers. There is a lot of dialog, which might not be unusual for an adventure game, but I feel like I'm never really playing the game. I was unexpectedly shuffled out of a level without being able to finish all of the tasks, because there was no indication to which tasks were the important ones. The game is full of strangers in the city that you have to help, as you run from some bad guys trying to catch you because of the alien attached to your brain. To find out what each stranger needs, you have to read their minds with the sticky arm, which is a really cool, unique feature. But like I said, it slows down the game play so much and a lot of the tasks feel really pointless. The graphics are awesome as well, and I love the paper world feel. But the platforms are easy to jump between, or just frustrating when you've got identical bad guys chasing you so that rather than enjoy the new area you just discovered, you have to instead rush through it to get away. I really want to love this game, but it's almost impossible. Also, the adventure puzzles are really easy to solve. Once you read everyone's minds, it's really easy to see that you just visit a bunch of places in order and grab the stickers from them and put them elsewhere. And this one is really just my opinion, but the characters are so overly dramatic and cliche that I find it grating. I realize they're probably like this on purpose, but for a game with more adult themes it's weird how cartoonish and childish the cast is. If you really want to experience this game, maybe wait for it to go on sale. Who knows? You might really like it. It's not a horrible game, but definitely not one I would recommend to buy at full price.			"

												Stick it to the Man! is a really humorous game. It's kind of a puzzle-platformer combined with a point-and-click adventure game. I myself am no big fan of P&Cs in general, but still I liked the game. It manages to stand out with its distinctive ""papercut/sticker book"" artstyle. The voice-acting is brilliant. The story is kinda serviceable in a not-very-realistic-at-all way, but of course the humour is the selling point. I found the puzzles to be fair in difficulty. I actually played this 9 months back, so can't recall exactly but I think I managed to complete it without consulting any guides. Or may just once time. Thing is, I am not a P&C gamer so if you are used to playing stuff like that, this shouldn't be a problem. Length wise, I'd say the game should be around 5 - 7 hours long, depending on how fast you solve the puzzles of course. I'd say Stick it to the Man! is a one-of-a-kind game. Surely, if you either love humour, or puzzle-platformers or P&Cs (better still if you love two or more of them!), you need to get this game!			"

												Stick it to The Man is a fun, puzzle sloving game with some very simple jumping aspects.  You are equipped with a pink hand that extends from the top of your head.  This hand is used to read the minds of those around you and grab onto surrounding pegs for increased mobility.  Most of the game consists of completing tasks that progress you to the next chapter.  The game is on the short side; I completed it in about three hours.  There is little replayability, unless you want to go through and get all of the Steam achievements.  The puzzles are pretty simple and most could even be solved with trial and error, so if you're looking for a challenging game, this isn't it.  The real appeal for me was the dialogue.  The characters and dialogue are hilarious.  I thought the voice acting was really well done.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.			"

												Stick it to The Man! is a very creative adventure/casual game, your purpose being to collect and place stickers to advance forward through the levels. Although this game is fun and at times challenging its not something i can seee myself putting hours into, it's just not quite diverse enough. It would be nice if it wasnt so linear, maybe more toward scribblenaut's sanbox style, being able to place stickers not just where you are supposed to but other places to open alternate routes or just to have fun would be a nice touch. All in all a good game, i'll be keeping an eye open for future offering from this developer.			"

The story sometimes tried too hard to be funny, and due to the nonsensical nature of the game, the puzzles felt more like just trying and seeing what worked rather than applying any kind of logical reasoning.

The adventure game aspect set's a nice standard for other developers and the platforming aspects fit in very well with it.  An overall all around well done game.  8.0 final score.			"

The gameplay is like a classic point and click mixed with a platformer due to the benefit of being able to control the movements of central character Ray. The story is mental but engaging, especially owing to the stellar voiceover work. Overall a thorougly enjoyable, hilarious romp!			"

YouTube™ Video: Stick it to The Man review 

			Views: 23		

			My opinion on the innovative game, Stick it to the man.		

Point and click has been a genre that has struggled the last ten years, With the market peaking in the 90’s with games like, Monkey Island, and ever since then the genre has struggled to find a foothold with the rise of counsels. Point and Click was hard to do on a counsel because you will, point and click.  There have been attempts to revive the genre, but not much has happened with it except for re- releases and re-makes. Until now, Stick it to the man is a game that advertises as an action platformer, but its really a point and click game in disguise, it also a game very much about comedy.  Here Let me give you a basic plot description, The Main Character Has Psychic powers, can read peoples minds to help solve their problems, its has a unique artstyle and sense of humor. There is also platforming and puzzle solving.Now if you know anything about good games your mind should instantly think of Psychonauts, and if you don’t know Psychonauts, 1st you should, and second go watch the Zero punctuation review on it or something, but if you’re to even do that then ill explain, Psychonauts, is an action platformer, puzzle solver, with unique art style and sense of humor, The main character also can read minds.So now that i’ve gotten that comparison out of the way, I’ll talk more about this game, The art style of the game is a mixture between the weirdness of psychonauts, and the Cardboard of tearaway. The game also has a depth to it, you can move up and down the foreground, and background like in little big planet, but  the game never uses this to its advantage, i can only remember using it one time and that was when i discover i could even do it.The Music in the game is repetitive unfortunately, every time you run into an enemy it plays the same music until you’ve successfully escaped, its always the same no variation of bad guy music.The Gameplay of the game is centered around one central gimmick, your mind arm, Your mind arm is somthing you get in the very beginning of the game, and its what makes this game. It is your  cursor, its what you use to interact with the world, It's what lets you read minds to solve problems, it helps you platform acting like a grappling hook. Its what manages your inventory, and tears off stickers. Sticker by the way are exactly what they sound like they are parts of the world that have been highlighted that you can rip off and stick to other things using your mind arm. You can get stickers by finding highlighted things in the world, or by reading someone's mind see what they are thinking of the literally ripping the thought out of their mind as a sticker. Stickers are the items used to solve the puzzles the game presents you with and you can have more than one at a time, this is where the inventory comes in. The inventory is just the d-pad left and right on the controller, it keeps it simple and easy. The Control of the mind arm is… not so great. It you use the right analog stick to aim the arm, then it has an auto lock on to objects, the auto lock works but its also a problem. When there is more than one character next to another (which happens a lot by the way) it becomes hard to lock on to who you want to read  the mind of sometimes only allowing certain angles. The platforming is also floaty, it just doesn't feel super responsive, some of that may be attributed to the artstyle, but at some points especially when around enemies, you just don't feel like you have the amount of control you should.Floaty Controls aside, its the story and style that makes a point and click game, and boy does it have it in spades. This game is funny, thats hard to find in games now a days, you either have absurd humor, like goat simulator, or good character dialog like in borderlands. This game does both surprisingly well. Ill give you an example of one of the puzzles, in one portion of the game you are tasked with escaping an insane asylum on and island. You meet tons of crazy characters each with different personalities and goals, You meet a captain who says he’s slain a great whale, you eventually find this whale decomposing, you also meet a taxidermist in the asylum, you bring her to the what and she sows it up, you then meet a man who is hyperventilating into a bag, you take this mans you take this man to the whale and he blows into the bowl hole filling it with air, you now have a raft made out of a dead whale that you use to escape the island. If dead whale raft isn't funny to you, then something's wrong with you, or your an animal rights activist who doesn't like video games. The entire game is filled with over the top moments like that.This does bring up some points negative though, almost all point and clicks suffer from this, and that is convoluted puzzles, you know when you just don't know what to do so you have to try everything with everything else, yah that moment. Fortunately it doesn't happen that often but when it happens it really slow the games pace down. The game also has a lot of backtracking, like most point and clicks . Most of the game takes place on large maps that you have to fully explore to solve the puzzles, and get to the next area, but the backtracking isn't that bad and there are some parts in the game that will let you do a quick travel to certain areas.Although this game definitely suffers from all the problems that have always plagued Point and clicks, it works well and is definitely the benchmark for a counsel point and click game, so if soul successor to Psychonauts sounds good to you, dont hesitate to buy.

If dead whale raft isn't funny to you, then something's wrong with you, or your an animal rights activist who doesn't like video games. The entire game is filled with over the top moments like that.This does bring up some points negative though, almost all point and clicks suffer from this, and that is convoluted puzzles, you know when you just don't know what to do so you have to try everything with everything else, yah that moment. Fortunately it doesn't happen that often but when it happens it really slow the games pace down. The game also has a lot of backtracking, like most point and clicks . Most of the game takes place on large maps that you have to fully explore to solve the puzzles, and get to the next area, but the backtracking isn't that bad and there are some parts in the game that will let you do a quick travel to certain areas.Although this game definitely suffers from all the problems that have always plagued Point and clicks, it works well and is definitely the benchmark for a counsel point and click game, so if soul successor to Psychonauts sounds good to you, dont hesitate to buy.

												In a spectacular world made entirely of paper, Stick It to the Man provides an opportunity for reliving your childhood dream of slapping stickers on everything. Well, perhaps not everything.The game opens with Ray, the player character, whose job is testing hard-hats. The symbolism behind Ray’s career is soon apparent when an accident occurs that leaves him with severe head trauma. The moral? Wear a hard-hat on construction sites, literally. While not offering a great deal of difficulty with its platform-style mechanics, Stick It presents gamers with something refreshingly unique in a video game – a comedic look at the tragic effect of a decadent society on the mental health of its members. Ray’s ability to read minds and the obstacles that follow as the result of the accident become a constant, subconscious reminder to always keep your head, i.e. mental health, protected.When Ray wakes up, he a notices that there is a neon-pink arm sticking out of his head. This chimerical arm is your best friend. The arm gives Ray the ability to read minds and navigate the game space. It also serves to help Ray rip stickers (in traditional puzzle solvers these would be the “items” in your inventory) out of the game world as well as NPC minds, and stick them in different places to solve puzzles. Ray, however, finds the protuberance alarming and sets off to find a way to get rid of it. As no one else can see it but himself, Ray’s first plan is to head to a psychiatrist who, we soon see, needs more help than he does. The game is divided into ten chapters in which Ray is faced with several obstacles to moving on to the next stage. Ray gets around these hindrances by helping other characters with their troubles – and a colourful cast of oddballs it is who require Ray’s help. From a suicidal taxi driver who wants a new set of teeth to a woman with an abandonment complex who prefers her pets taxidermied, Stick It leaves no allusions to obsessive compulsions or mental ailments untouched. The game does not stop there. The social stigma that accompanies those with mental disorders is also represented by a cast of mental institution staff and law enforcement officials who are constantly chasing Ray and locking up those who are deemed unfit.Stick It does not suggest slapping stickers on, what are serious problems in real life, as a solution. That would be all too easy. What Stick It does do, is create a turbulent backdrop of a modern city with the imaginative use of art and colour in order to present, and make you think about, a tragic social problem. More importantly, it does so in a game that is packaged with distinct style, charming characters, comedic dialogue and a genuine, if naïve, notion that love will conquer all. I say play it. "

The art style and concept are truely unique, which makes the game that much better, this is a truly fun game. Enjoy.			"

												Very quirky and cleaverly written game! The style and humor reminds me so much of psychonauts, which on it's own was enough of an incentive for me to try this game out; luckly the games mechanics and gameplay are just as enjoyable (^-^) The story itself is simple but still quite enjoyable, and the characters are freaken awesome and a joy to interact with. Hell, the voice actor for Ray does OVER 10 OF THE CHARACTER VOICES FOR THIS GAME ALONE. Now THAT is impressive, especially since some of the ones that he does sound nothing alike. The only real downside to the game is its length, which for me clocked at around 8 hours but only because I scoured for every brain I could read and tried to get a majority of the acheivements; if you aren't a major completionist, you could probably get through the story at around 5-6 hours. Despite that though, I'm glad I bought this game, and I definately encourage others who are fans of psychonauts sense of style and humor or who are just fans of simple scrollers with quirky dialouge to try it out.

												Worth fifteen Dollars? no. I got about 4 hours of play time out of this. It was VERY fun but not enough to warrent fifteen dollars from my Wallet. I loved the humor and the straight forward logic puzzles with stickers combined with platforming to what to me seemed like a Little Big planet Mash up with a Parody game of psychonauts.But If you like story driven puzzle games all i can say is this will be OK. But if you want a better one (story wise and less platformer) go to Grim Fandango. Its alot more...uhhh drawing? like sucks you in and keeps you there like a crazy sadistic serial killer keeping you from leaving his basement. oh well as far as indi games and hilarious puzzle platformers go8/10Special mention to the art.

												Stick It To The Man has quickly cemented itself as my absolutely favorite video game of all time ever since I played it a year ago on the Vita. The writing, art design, voices, and the story itself have this charm that I for one consider a breath of fresh air in what is quickly becoming a stale industry full of grays and browns and scruffy guys with even scruffier voices (and guns, lots and lots of guns).This game does have some faults like every game has; it's much shorter than you'd expect and there's a small glitch near the end that pretty much makes it impossible to dieWait...are those the only faults I could find? Oh shoot that's not badDespite its short game time, Stick It is a very satisfying and hilarious experience that'll make you fall in love with the characters and come back for more (Stick It sequel perhaps? Hmmmmm?). I totally recommend buying this if you're a fan of quirky, well written, and overall well made video games			"

												This game is just full of charm. Its storyline was very silly, what with the alien mind-reading, sticky arm being in Ray's mind. But that was the beauty of it. With this arm, the puzzles were fun to do, and the reading of the characters' minds which was in itself a fun concept to toy around with. The game is dialogue-rich so that contributed to its charm as well.10/10, no more, no less.			"

												This was a fun game, and a great concept. Your character is able to read people's minds thanks to an alien creature inside his head. The art is fantastic, with everything (including the characters) made out of cardboard or paper like a diorama. You can even see the bits of corrugation in the cardboard from the side! You can use your mental powers to find stickers all over the world that you can use to accomplish different tasks. For example, you can read someone's thoughts so they start thinking about something, which appears as a sticker in a thought balloon, which you can now place on them to put them to sleep! It's kind of like a 2.5-D puzzle-platformer (more like 2.75-D, since you can occasionally move in the third dimension), but with true 3D depth in the scenery. Attention to detail is amazing. My only problem is that the game is too short (it took me about 4 hours, including lots of wandering around trying to find things that I had overlooked).			"

I was way too lazy to try my other two gamepads - which i am certain at least one would work with the game correctly. I did play with mouse and keyboard and it was just fine - i guess even better than pad considering you can aim ""the spagethi"" with a mouse.Overall i realy like this game.

												This is a pretty fun game.  It's a 2-D puzzle platformer, which I'm usually not too fond of, but in this case, I didn't mind it.  The main draw of this game is its sense of humor.  The $15 price tag is a bit high, but then again I say that about 90% of the games I play.The game plays fairly nice.  There's a bit of platforming, but it really isn't that challenging.  Some of the sections with enemies can be a bit tricky, but after a few attempts you can develop a strategy to get around them.  There are also puzzles which revolve around reading people's minds and moving stickers to manipulate the world around you.  The puzzles are really easy, as long as you're careful when exploring the levels.The story's pretty good.  You're a guy named Ray, who got hit on the head after returning from work.  When you wake up, you realize that you have a hand sticking out of your head.  This hand can be used to grab stickers, pins, and read other people's minds, all of which are used to solve puzzles.  The story is unique, the dialogue is quite funny, and the voice acting is pretty nice.If I had to make one complaint, it’s that the game is rather short.  It only lasted about 5 hours for me, and I even got all of the achievements.  What the game has is fine, but a little more wouldn’t hurt.Overall, I would suggest picking this game up.  It will make you laugh, plus the achievements aren't too bad to 100%.  I just wish it was a little bit longer.			"

												A thouroughly delightful game. Reminded me a bit of Psychonauts in its oddity, though it never grew as difficult (which was nice.) I truly enjoyed it, though it only took three hours to beat. Still entirely worth the cost.			"

												This is one of the most fun games I have ever played. It actually pulls the comedy off really well. The mechanics work amazingly with the story of the game and the puzzles are so funny and interesting that you want to solve everyone of them before you move on to the next level. It reminded me a lot of Psychonauts (because it delt with minds and well the art) one of my favorite games of all time. So yeah could be a little biased.			"

												Quite possibly one of the best games I've ever played. It's an instant favorite. The writing style is very similar to Psychonauts, and has just the same amount of ""what"" to the humor and storyline. The characters are great and the gimmick of the game doesn't get old. It's my favorite puzzle/platformer since Portal 2. It's something just about anyone can pick up and play, while still maintaining a decent challenge and making you think.			"

												Stick it to the Man is a quirky, hilariously fantastic puzzle platformer that draws inspiration from the comedic giants at Double Fine Productions. It's fairly short, and there are a few areas where the controls are frustrating, but those small flaws barely mar the experience at all; the length is appropriate, and so are the controls for 95% of the game. Do yourself a favor and get this game. It's hilarious.			"

												It can be difficult to put into words exactly how I feel about this, but here goes my best...I am a serious lover of DoubleFine Production games, they always seem to catch the right kind of amount of humor, adventure, and intrigue that I look for in a game. The craft put into their storytelling is always amazing.'But Brock,' you say, 'this game is not by DoubleFine at all! Explain yourself!' Well, as I prefaced, this game is a difficult one to pinpoint in my brain, but the one withstanding element throughout the whole thing was this constant reminder of the humor and stylization that DoubleFine creates in their game Psychonauts.While the story is somewhat lackluster for me in Stick it to the Man, it easily is made up for the sheer volume of interesting character background and stories therein. This game allows the player to enter the mind of most any biological being, dead or alive, and therein the game shines!There's rich little mini-stories that are perfectly done, and I almost believe that the writers knew about their main story as being straight-forward, so they decided to sprinkle the whole thing with entertaining sub-plots throughout, making an entertaining ride. Anyone who is a fan of DoubleFine-style imagery, give this guy a try!			"

												Stick it to The Man! is a very creative adventure/casual game, your purpose being to collect and place stickers to advance forward through the levels. Although this game is fun and at times challenging its not something i can seee myself putting hours into, it's just not quite diverse enough. It would be nice if it wasnt so linear, maybe more toward scribblenaut's sanbox style, being able to place stickers not just where you are supposed to but other places to open alternate routes or just to have fun would be a nice touch. All in all a good game, i'll be keeping an eye open for future offering from this developer.			"

												This is an interesting concept for a game. Basically a man named Ray get's hit on the head and brain slug possesses his mind, giving him the ability to read other peoples thoughts and rip them out to convenience himself. The game plays like a fast paced point and click game where you wander through the levels reading minds and taking their thoughts and using the objects taken to get others help you get through each chapter. The humor goes from dark to self aware, but always keeps this upbeat additude that makes  anything dark hilarious. Like a chef who wants to flavor his stew, and requires the tears of a broken heart for flavor, and then pulls a severed human arm out to taste test the stew. You also have to contend with a mysterious organization that wants the brain slug back and the become an obstacle in Ray way and slowly becoming the big threat in the game. As far as replayablity goes, it's pretty much non-existant save for getting any achivements you haven't gotten. The games charm comes from interacting all the characters and their quirks and once you beat the game, and complete the puzzles  these points become pointless and you can pretty much beat the game in a third of the time in a second playthrough. because of this, the 14.99 price tag seems steep, so i would recommend getting it when it goes on sale. But, either wayit's an enjoyable experience the first go through, and you could always get someone else to playthrough the game and watch.			"

												Clever point-and-click fetch game with platformer elements. Plagued by problems common to p&c games; puzzles with either nonsensiscal or painfully obvious combinations of items to overcome, much backtracking back and forh on your keycard/fetch quests. Very little thinking required on the player's part. Simply run all over the map and use everything on everything. Anything you can interact with is highlighted leaving all the guesswork out.Still, a charming game with obvious LucasArts/Double Fine influences. The levels are small enough that the puzzling and platforming back and forth does not get too tedious. The voice-acting is lacking at times, but the quirkly humor and art style make up for it.On a scale of Full Throttle to Psychonauts, I give it a Grim Fandango.			"

												Simple, refreshing and humorous. The mood is light, platforming is stress free and the puzzles are rather simple, designed to put a smile on your face, rather than pose serious problems. People looking for a more serious mental exercise should probably pass this one up.The game has really excellent voice acting. Many other outspoken modern titles manage to do a lot less with a lot more resources in this regard, while SITTM characters are imbued with actual character thanks to the actors. This being said, some characters speak a bit slowly so they're king of a chore, however you'll promptly realize you can control voice pitch with A and D keys. Which provides even more fun potential.I recommend not rushing through the chatter, there's fun to be had with the dialogue (which for the better part is actually monologue.)Hadn't had any stability issues, the game ran perfect. The only thing worth mentioning is the fact it has an iffy resolution support and since my screen's native resolution wasn't on the list, I dialed it down a bit and turned on the windowed mode. Which worked out well enough.I guess I'd rate this one with a solid eight out of ten.			"

												In essence, it's a puzzle platformer with mind reading and stickers. Imagine Paper Mario Sticker Star if it was actually a good game. My biggest complaint that I can make is it may be possible to get the same amount of enjoyment from watching as from playing, but the quirky humor is what won me over. I've only played through the first level, but so far, I've witnessed a man getting broken up with, used his tears to aid a crazy cannibal chef, took a human arm and used it to coax an alligator out of hiding, took the alligator's teeth and gave them to a dog to ward off some kidnappers, used a portable hole to free a man from a trunk near the kidnappers so the man can win a dancing contest which causes another man to swallow his teeth which I then gave to a man to prevent himself from commiting suicide because his girlfriend is incredibly shallow and only cares about shiny teeth. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go see a shrink, but first I need to give a ghost legs and steal a smile off of a proud father's face.			"

												It's a fun, uncommon game with some twisted humour squeezed in. Set up in a paper world (which reminds me Little Big Planet a little), enables new possibilities - like ripping off some loose paper to uncover what's beneath, or using the stickers to change what's going on around. Also, the story and riddles are enjoyable.I must say that I was first dragged to this game by ""Just dropped in (to see what condition my condition was in)"" song by Kenny Rogers, which in my mind is strongly connected with ""The Big Lebowski"" movie - so I expected that the game will remind me it somehow. Well... one may say that there's some similar sense of humour - and it could remind a trippy dream of the Dude, which was accompanied with the song.For a short puzzle platformer - it's very strong position, which I would strongly suggest you to play.

												Every now and then I’ll encounter a game that completely flies under my radar due to the amount of triple-A titles that demand my attention. I was introduced to Stick it to the Man after a friend showed me his copy on PS4, and after watching a few minutes of gameplay I knew right away that this was an adventure that I needed to track down.In most aspects, Stick it to the Man is heavily influenced by Double Fine studios, and the art, humor, and platforming style invokes Psychonauts heavily throughout. There are actually a few easter eggs sprinkled in the game that reference Double Fine (such as a stuffed doll of Double Fine’s double-headed logo), but it doesn’t feel as if this title is stealing too much from the larger company. I very much enjoyed the concept of the game, living in a sort-of shadow box world with cardboard cutouts and interactive stickers, and the level design is varied and unique. Game difficulty isn’t an issue, although I did encounter odd bugs once or twice which prevented me from making forward progress (namely, sticker mounting points would not immediately appear next to important characters or locations). Also, when several interaction points are clustered near each other, your controls can get squirrelly as the game attempts to snap to context-sensitive areas (and this happens quite frequently).The story is nonsensical and lighthearted, which I found to be a refreshing change of pace with so many games recently sticking to dark and brooding or sardonic main characters. Ray, the protagonist, is very sweet and helpful to everyone he interacts with, including Ted, the goofy and forgetful alien taking residence in his brain. This isn’t an award-winning story, but it’s wholly entertaining for about five or six hours, though a second playthrough isn’t really needed, save for achievement cleanup.Stick it to the Man is short and sweet, and I’m very happy that I picked up this platformer when I had the chance. Recommended for most – it’s often listed at a cheap price digitally and is worth a single playthrough.			"

												Stick it to The Man.Although the game is relatively short (for me it took less than five hours to complete), it has charm and is a fun little spectacle to wade through over a weekend.The game is basically about a guy who aquires the abilities to read minds and such after getting hit on the head by an alien spaceship. Throughout the journey the player is treated to different set pieces and many colorful characters along the way. There's a lot of comedy in the game but like all comedy it may not appeal to certain demographics; I found a few chuckles in my playthrough but I could see some might not enjoy the jokes as much as me.As far as gameplay goes the player basically has to grab stuff and stick it to other stuff in hopes of advancing the plot, and along the way one's treated to interesting thoughts they can read. It's mostly a simple platformer puzzler with relatively easy puzzles, so it's not the most challenging game in the world. Most of the entertainment comes from the jokes and character interactions.I'd say it's worth the money if you catch it on sale or on the Humble Bundle like I did.			"

												Stick it to The Man! tries to be an offbeat and funny sidescrolling platformer, and it mostly succeeds.You start the game by getting hit on the head and developing a superpower which lets you read other people's minds and conjure/manipulate objects in the world (which are called stickers). With the help of these stickers you solve all the ""puzzles"" in the game. I put puzzles in quotations because they're not real puzzles, there is basically no thinking involved, you just try sticking every sticker where it is possible and you solve it, that's all there is to it.Similarly, there is no difficulty involved with the platforming in the game. And sadly the same goes for avoiding the enemies. They move in predictable patterns and it's easy to lose them even if you get spotted, that means that you're just going thorugh the motions most of the time.Despite all that the story, dialogue and art style are here to save the game. It's hard to do humour in video games and Stick it to The Man! manages just that quite often. I am not talking about laugh out loud moments, but I was most certainly entertained throughout the game, even if there is a bit too much of listening to oneliners when you're reading people's minds. Finally, the art style alone is worth checking out, it gives the illusion of everything being made from paper or carboard and it achieves a very nice effect which doesn't get old until  the end.I couldn't recommend the game based on the gameplay alone, however the style of the game is absolutely worth checking out.6½ / 10			"

												I think it's been a year since I played this game and it has stuck with me (pun intended).Only 4 hours spent in a game- yet gives an impression that lasts this long? For sure this indicates something. It's a good game. Would recommend. Plot is decent, and graphics/gameplay is gorgeous and inspiring. Not a super actiony game- but hey as a casual gamer it suited me.			"

Overall, it is extremely polished and if you are looking for something different to add to your collection, this is it. I would highly recommend this game, especially if it is ever on a Steam sale.

												I absolutely love this game. The grimy, corrupt city feels like a 1970s caricature of New York, with all the necessary absurdities including disco, organized crime and sewer gators. A flat world of paper and stickers is vindicated by colorful themes, creative implementation and a great soundtrack, things I often feel the AAA titles are lacking. Emphasis on mind reading, psychology and the mind itself feel reminiscent of Psychonauts by Double Fine.If anything, my only complaint would be play time. With only two hours played I appear to already be close to 1/3 of the way to the end. Despite this, 6 hours of stimulation that far exceeds the enjoyment of any movie I've seen in theaters this year makes the $15 investment well worth the cost.			"

												Ok boyos, (and girlies too I suppose), this game is totally rad. Absurd, rather odd, and perhaps just a bit deserving of the mad house at times, but completely worth it. Especially the bit where you play through the mad house. In all honesty, I did get frustrated at times because that one miner guy didn't seem reachable, but I really do think that it is worth playing. Stick it to The Man! was an impulse buy for me, and I enjoyed it more than any game since Voodoo Vince on the original Xbox. That includes my fave games, the Portals. It is clean cut, ship shape, and ready to turn your socks into stickers so it can steal them with all of the wonderfully written dialogue, enjoyable plot elements, and interesting twists on the standard platform jumping idea. I played it twice back to back, thought it was stellar twice, and have already shared it with all my friends IRL. Now I am sharing it here, so stop reading this thing, buy the game, and play it already!			"

												Every now and then I’ll encounter a game that completely flies under my radar due to the amount of triple-A titles that demand my attention. I was introduced to Stick it to the Man after a friend showed me his copy on PS4, and after watching a few minutes of gameplay I knew right away that this was an adventure that I needed to track down.In most aspects, Stick it to the Man is heavily influenced by Double Fine studios, and the art, humor, and platforming style invokes Psychonauts heavily throughout. There are actually a few easter eggs sprinkled in the game that reference Double Fine (such as a stuffed doll of Double Fine’s double-headed logo), but it doesn’t feel as if this title is stealing too much from the larger company. I very much enjoyed the concept of the game, living in a sort-of shadow box world with cardboard cutouts and interactive stickers, and the level design is varied and unique. Game difficulty isn’t an issue, although I did encounter odd bugs once or twice which prevented me from making forward progress (namely, sticker mounting points would not immediately appear next to important characters or locations). Also, when several interaction points are clustered near each other, your controls can get squirrelly as the game attempts to snap to context-sensitive areas (and this happens quite frequently).The story is nonsensical and lighthearted, which I found to be a refreshing change of pace with so many games recently sticking to dark and brooding or sardonic main characters. Ray, the protagonist, is very sweet and helpful to everyone he interacts with, including Ted, the goofy and forgetful alien taking residence in his brain. This isn’t an award-winning story, but it’s wholly entertaining for about five or six hours, though a second playthrough isn’t really needed, save for achievement cleanup.Stick it to the Man is short and sweet, and I’m very happy that I picked up this platformer when I had the chance. Recommended for most – it’s often listed at a cheap price digitally and is worth a single playthrough.			"

												It can be difficult to put into words exactly how I feel about this, but here goes my best...I am a serious lover of DoubleFine Production games, they always seem to catch the right kind of amount of humor, adventure, and intrigue that I look for in a game. The craft put into their storytelling is always amazing.'But Brock,' you say, 'this game is not by DoubleFine at all! Explain yourself!' Well, as I prefaced, this game is a difficult one to pinpoint in my brain, but the one withstanding element throughout the whole thing was this constant reminder of the humor and stylization that DoubleFine creates in their game Psychonauts.While the story is somewhat lackluster for me in Stick it to the Man, it easily is made up for the sheer volume of interesting character background and stories therein. This game allows the player to enter the mind of most any biological being, dead or alive, and therein the game shines!There's rich little mini-stories that are perfectly done, and I almost believe that the writers knew about their main story as being straight-forward, so they decided to sprinkle the whole thing with entertaining sub-plots throughout, making an entertaining ride. Anyone who is a fan of DoubleFine-style imagery, give this guy a try!			"

I loved the humor and the straight forward logic puzzles with stickers combined with platforming to what to me seemed like a Little Big planet Mash up with a Parody game of psychonauts.But If you like story driven puzzle games all i can say is this will be OK. But if you want a better one (story wise and less platformer) go to Grim Fandango. Its alot more...uhhh drawing? like sucks you in and keeps you there like a crazy sadistic serial killer keeping you from leaving his basement. oh well as far as indi games and hilarious puzzle platformers go8/10Special mention to the art.

												Worth a look if bundled or on sale, but flawed and such an aquired taste that I would not seek it out. Occasionally succumbs to the rub-x-on-y-and-pray syndrom in later levels due to its surreal thought process. You are expected to replay levels to read all the minds, but once the puzzle is solved there is no satisfaction and unskippable cutscenes and long inner monologues make the endeavor a trial in patience.Protips: Controls are never stated so I had to look up that middle mouse-scroll switches stickers. Listening to peoples thoughts can drag on and 'D' will speed up narration into more entertaining chipmunk voices. Avoid-Enemy puzzles are often more easily ran-through than solved especialy since 'respawning' after failure is quick and painless.			"

												This game is ridiculously fun and funny, for a number of reasons. One of my favourite things about it would have to be the characters. There are many characters whom you'd expect not to see more than once, that they'd come on screen, think their quirky thought, and then practically die of screen. But instead you see more than one situation progress throughout the game that doesn't follow the main story. It really does do a great job with it's writing. The gameplay it self is very simple, and not amazing, but still very fun.  My only major complaint is I wish they had made the game longer. However, it's better to have an amazing game that lasts 5 hours than a decent game that lasts 100 hours. Still, there's enough replay value in it to give it a couple more plays.			"

												*Work in Progress*tldr; So to sum up, you should buy this game, it is alot of fun and certainly worth its full price :)One of the rare occasions when a game that tries to be funny and revolve around humour actually IS funny.And it is really funny for the most part. Sure there is some over the top stuff or stuff that is so flat it is just not funny, but for most of the time you will actually at leats be amused by the game.Don't expect to laugh, just see it as scrolling 9gag and seeing a post you find funny, know that feeling? Yeah? Well THAT feeling.Not much to say about the gameplay...it is basically a sort of point and click but using a controller and slightly different mechanics. You find and collect certain items at certain palces and then find the paklces where you have to use them.Well in this game you have the addition of walking around liek a plattformer instead of clicking and waiting, doesn't make it greater but also not worse.The art style is quite nice in my opinion and also quite unique, I really liked the world and character designs!One personal ""ear""candy for me is that the Voiceactors for an indie production are REALLY good and just enjoyable to listen to.So to sum up, you should buy this game, it is alot of fun and certainly worth its full price :)			"

												This was a fun game, and a great concept. Your character is able to read people's minds thanks to an alien creature inside his head. The art is fantastic, with everything (including the characters) made out of cardboard or paper like a diorama. You can even see the bits of corrugation in the cardboard from the side! You can use your mental powers to find stickers all over the world that you can use to accomplish different tasks. For example, you can read someone's thoughts so they start thinking about something, which appears as a sticker in a thought balloon, which you can now place on them to put them to sleep! It's kind of like a 2.5-D puzzle-platformer (more like 2.75-D, since you can occasionally move in the third dimension), but with true 3D depth in the scenery. Attention to detail is amazing. My only problem is that the game is too short (it took me about 4 hours, including lots of wandering around trying to find things that I had overlooked).			"

												This game is great. The art style and soundtrack are immediately appealing. The story is humorous, weird, and actually pretty dark at times; but it tells it's story without ever taking itself too seriously.The gameplay itself is also fun and interesting. It's mostly split into two catergories: stealth/eluding segments and exploration puzzle solving segments. The stealth segments are fun, with you grappling around with your sticky mind hand to elude guards. The exploration is my favorite part though. It's extremely satisfying going around solving people's problems in order to help yourself get further. There's nver a dull moment, and characters always have something interesting to say.I'd recommend this game. In terms of length, it's pretty short. So if you want to play this game, but feel like 5 hours of game isn't worth the price, wait till it goes on sale. You won't regret it.			"

The game is dialogue-rich so that contributed to its charm as well.10/10, no more, no less.			"

												I liked this game. It's about 4 hours of gameplay, puzzles aren't much challenging, but solutions to them are rather logical (at least in the context of story and narrative style) which is something I personally like very much.Colorful characters, and funny dialogs are also a plus.			"

												This game is ridiculously fun and funny, for a number of reasons. One of my favourite things about it would have to be the characters. There are many characters whom you'd expect not to see more than once, that they'd come on screen, think their quirky thought, and then practically die of screen. But instead you see more than one situation progress throughout the game that doesn't follow the main story. It really does do a great job with it's writing. The gameplay it self is very simple, and not amazing, but still very fun.  My only major complaint is I wish they had made the game longer. However, it's better to have an amazing game that lasts 5 hours than a decent game that lasts 100 hours. Still, there's enough replay value in it to give it a couple more plays.			"

												This game is great. The art style and soundtrack are immediately appealing. The story is humorous, weird, and actually pretty dark at times; but it tells it's story without ever taking itself too seriously.The gameplay itself is also fun and interesting. It's mostly split into two catergories: stealth/eluding segments and exploration puzzle solving segments. The stealth segments are fun, with you grappling around with your sticky mind hand to elude guards. The exploration is my favorite part though. It's extremely satisfying going around solving people's problems in order to help yourself get further. There's nver a dull moment, and characters always have something interesting to say.I'd recommend this game. In terms of length, it's pretty short. So if you want to play this game, but feel like 5 hours of game isn't worth the price, wait till it goes on sale. You won't regret it.			"

												This game is just full of charm. Its storyline was very silly, what with the alien mind-reading, sticky arm being in Ray's mind. But that was the beauty of it. With this arm, the puzzles were fun to do, and the reading of the characters' minds which was in itself a fun concept to toy around with. The game is dialogue-rich so that contributed to its charm as well.10/10, no more, no less.			"

To make a long story short, if ""Psychonauts"" and ""Edna & Harvey: The Breakout"" were to have a spiritual love child, it would be ""Stick it to The Man!""; not to mention the game's art style which is a pure eye candy. However, bear in mind that this is a simple story without any complex plot twists and the game itself isn't very challenging.			"

												Stick it to The Man is a fun, puzzle sloving game with some very simple jumping aspects.  You are equipped with a pink hand that extends from the top of your head.  This hand is used to read the minds of those around you and grab onto surrounding pegs for increased mobility.  Most of the game consists of completing tasks that progress you to the next chapter.  The game is on the short side; I completed it in about three hours.  There is little replayability, unless you want to go through and get all of the Steam achievements.  The puzzles are pretty simple and most could even be solved with trial and error, so if you're looking for a challenging game, this isn't it.  The real appeal for me was the dialogue.  The characters and dialogue are hilarious.  I thought the voice acting was really well done.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.			"

												The only bad thing I have to say about this game is it's too short! I keep wanting to play it days after I've beaten it. The style, voice acting, script, everything is awesome.I do have to say I ran into two bugs. One when the voices would turn off, and another where I couldn't jump when I hit space.			"

												A charming and humorous romp through an imaginative paper world, this little adventure is great if you're a fan of Psychonauts.  The characters are funny an endearing, while the world they live in is quirky and charming. The game isn't all too challenging, just the right amount of brainteasing little puzzles and fun little stealth portions. DEFINATELY worth the $9 it's going for until the 20th!			"

												Stick it to The Man! is a very creative adventure/casual game, your purpose being to collect and place stickers to advance forward through the levels. Although this game is fun and at times challenging its not something i can seee myself putting hours into, it's just not quite diverse enough. It would be nice if it wasnt so linear, maybe more toward scribblenaut's sanbox style, being able to place stickers not just where you are supposed to but other places to open alternate routes or just to have fun would be a nice touch. All in all a good game, i'll be keeping an eye open for future offering from this developer.			"

												Stick It To The Man is a hilarious adventure game first, but it also contains elements of platforming and stealth, and it's what I imagine what would look like if Beetlejuice-era Tim Burton made a stage play.  You play as Ray, a regular man with a regular life who by accident is suddenly merged with an alien entity named Ted, who confers him telepathy and telekinesis via a giant purple hand that sticks out of his head.  On the run from a shady organization with evil plans, Ray must find a way to return to normal while also stopping the organization, all the while using his newfound powers to help people around him.I've been interested in this game since its release, but I've put off its purchase for a long time.  I instantly regretted that once I started playing.  This game is easily worth its full price.  Following the storyline and getting every achievement will net you between 4 to 5 hours of playtime, which is the perfect spot for the price while still mantaining the novelty of the gameplay.It's a really easy game (though, like in all adventure games, you're bound to get stuck for a bit at least once), it's more about the experience than the challenge.  Outlandish characters, fourth-wall breaking, and overall funny dialogue are the meat of the game.  Gameplay-wise, the majority consists of using your abilities to solve puzzles, by both reading minds and make use of stickers to change around the environment.  There's also some light platforming and a few stealth sections, but they're there just to add some variety and they're mostly a means to an end.  They're not by any means bad, they're just the least interesting part of the experience.What else can I say?  Buy this game now, you won't regret it.			"

												Great game!! Stick It to the Man is one of the funniest games I've ever played -- enjoy it as a comedy! In terms of gameplay, it draws from several styles without truly sticking to one -- it's part platformer, part stealth game, part point 'n click adventure, but it's not *really* any of those. It's kind of unique, you gotta play it to see! Great voice acting, comedic visuals to go along with the funny story, this one's a winner!			"

												I played and finished Stick it to The Man, and it's real good.It's got a nice art style reminiscent of Psychonauts, which was a game I fell in love with because of the character design and art. The writing is quirky and funny and pokes fun at mentality and the psyche, which I've always been interested in. As limited an amount of voice actors they had, the characters were really interesting, likeable, and had a good delivery on their lines when they expressed. Gameplay is like stealth/puzzle/platformer which is fun and can be challenging without being frustrating. I also enjoyed the music and it's jazzy feel during earlier chapters. Although short, it's definitely a fun ride that I truly enjoyed. I only ever had one glitch happen once, but it wasn't gamebreaking. It did softlock the game and make me reload my save, though it was minor compared to the fun experience I had.			"

												I recommend this game because it was very funny. The dialog is well written and the voice acting performance did a great job pulling it off. Overall, it can be compared to a 2D Psychonauts because of the art style and the theme of reading minds. Though, the gameplay can be better compared to a point and click adventure game because essentially, you are going around, obtaining items, and taking them to the right spot to progress further. Honestly, the gameplay isn't even that good. There are two types of gameplay segments. Segments that you are collecting items, like I mentioned already, as well as segments that you are trying to platform passed enemies without them catching you. Neither are particularly fun. Though, the game is just funny enough that I continued playing though. Also, it's not that long. Took me about 4 hours to beat the game.			"

												This game seems a lot like Psuchonauts, down to even the art style. Not that it's a bad thing. The game is fairly short and the puzzles are pretty simple but I enjoyed my time with it. The humor kind of reminded me of Rocko's Modern Life. If you are looking for a cartoony game that's casual and has a lot of personality, you could do a lot worse than this one.			"

												This is a  great little game (~5hrs)  that felt like a cross between The Cave and Psychonauts. The story is light, but the characters are all highly likable and funny. The acting is great and the humor caught me off guard and made me laugh out loud a few times. I love the art style and the game's self awareness of it as well. The gameplay is simple but some places still have an enjoyable level of difficulty. Achievements are pretty easy to get as well. I definitely loved this game.			"
