												Papers, Please has no right to be as fun as it is. Papers, Please has no right to be as poignant as it is. Papers, Please has no right to be possibly the best PC game of 2013 I've played. Papers, Please is all of these things.The gameplay of Papers, Please is more or less a tedium simulator. It's Paperwork: The Game. And yet, you know that you need to process as many of these poor people as you can so that your family won't starve. You know that the old lady who you just denied will probably never see her son again; you know the young man you just let through has less than glorious ambitions in your city. Will you support the rebels? Will you toe the party line? Will you let the young lady through, even though her passport is clearly fake, because her fiance was just before her and bribed you to do so? The choice in this game is staggering, and the simplicity of the game itself allows for complete assimilation of your mind into the mind of your character. You feel bad when your child gets sick, but you know that food is sometimes more important than heat.Papers, Please is a work of video game brilliance - a work of art. I give it seven out of seven stars.			"

												I had no idea what I was getting into with this game. From what I'd heard you just sit at a border checkpoint and decide if people are allowed to enter the country or not. And that's exactly what I got, but Papers, Please is so much more than that. It's not just a job simulation, it's a story of moral choices and corrupt government. It's not just about a border guard, it's about a man who struggles to provide for his family, who must work for the smallest of wages to make some of the toughest choices. You sit in your little checkpoint booth. A man comes up and hands you his passport. You skim over the information and stamp a big green ""APPROVED"" for him. He thanks you and starts to walk away, but before he does he says, ""my wife is right behind me, please be nice to her."" Sure enough, up steps a nice young woman. There's her passport. You look down and see an expiration date of last month. ""This document is expired"" you say. She stares at you, eyes wide and pleading: ""Please, if I go back to my country they will kill me. Please let me in."" What do you do? Do you risk losing your paycheck and therefore leave yourself unable to buy medicine for your sick son? Or do you abandon all morality and turn the woman away?Papers, Please is not an easy game, nor is it free of consequences. Not only does it become insanely difficult to reivew piles of papers and make sure every little details is accrate and correct, but every choice you make determines who you are and the path you take. Will you work tirelessly for the glory of Arstotzka, or will you join the Order and be a part of the uprising against the tyrannical, corrupt government?			"

 East Grestin, 1982Here comes that weird guy again. The one in the red sweater and with the crooked smile always plastered on his face. It's the third time already, this month.I look at him through the glass as he waves at me in an oddly familiar way that makes me feel a little bit awkward.«Old friend, hello! I am back again! This time everything set!». His voice is loud and cheerful, and I just can't help but wonder what the heck is wrong with him. There's nothing to be so happy about in this rotten place, you old geezer.«Papers, please» I simply say, ignoring his greetings. He grins while handing me his brand new passport. I chuckle. Definitely better than the last one, at least this one is not pre-approved.«So this time you're from Obristan, I see, Mr... Jorji Costava? Is this even your real name?».His grin grows even wider and he starts laughing again.«You a funny guy. I didn't like Cobrastan that much anymore. Obristan sure is a better country». He speaks with a tick foreign accent that makes me wonder where he is really from. «Cobrastan isn't even a real country, in the first place» I point out matter-of-factly. «Where's your entry ticket?».His smile fades a little. «Arstotzka so great, we don't need an entry ticket!». «This is the same thing you said last time about passports. I'm sorry, an entry ticket is required». I hand his passport back.«Wow, you run very strict border here». He puts his paper back in the pocket of his trousers, shrugging. «That is good. Do job right. I look for entry thing and come back».Before leaving the booth, he stares intensely at me.«You a good guy, but I have business in Arstotzka. I see you soon». He waves me goodbye and then disappears in the crowd, with that big careless smile on his face.                                                                                            *I keep staring at the ceiling of my bedroom. In the end, it seems I can't really sleep at all tonight.I can hear my wife coughing weakly beside me. The doctor said it's just a cold, but she's getting worse day after day. I'm slightly worried.Our son is sleeping in the next room, the only one lit by the sun in the morning. He is turning 7 next week. I'd really want to buy him a special present for his birthday.We are currently living in a small apartment provided by the Ministry of Admission, here in East Grestin. The rooms are small and the heather doesn't work half the time. On top of that, our neighbours are awfully nosy. Living here is not that great, but there's really nothing I can do about it.                                                                                            *A week has passed since Jorji Costava last showed up. Maybe he is having a hard time finding a fake entry permit. Maybe he just gave up. Quite unlikely.The siren's ringing, another day of work is starting. A tall figure silently enters the booth. He's wearing a green hood and his face is hidden behind a grey mask. I'm about to call the security, but he gently slides a paper note under the window and stares at me.«There's no much time, be quick please». His voice sounds young- he's probably younger than me- and unusually relaxed.My hands are shaking and I don't even know why.There's an odd symbol drawn on top of the card, a star-shaped one. I slowly open the note and start reading. I can feel the masked guy's staring gaze on me.   ARSTOTZKA IS GREAT COUNTRY POISONED BY CORRUPT LEADERSWAR HAS MADE GOV'T GREEDY AND PARANOID - YOU HAVE SEEN FOR YOURSELFHELP US FREE ARSTOTZKA FROM ITS SHACKLES+ THE ORDER OF THE EZIC STAR  I'm in a cold sweat.I look up at the masked guy, I'm at a loss for words.«Our agents are ready», he helds out his hand, eyeing the card. «Starting tomorrow. Let them pass». In Papers, Please you play as an immigration inspector working for the Ministry of Admission of Arstotzka in East Grestin. Your job is to check on people trying to enter Arstotzka and decide who can pass through the border and who has to be denied or even arrested.Most of the time, your decisions will lead to a different ending (not always a good one!).Choose wisely, the destiny of Arstotzka, your family and many other people is in your hands. Pros: -Well written dystopian settings-20 different endings-Lovely retro graphics-Jorji Costava-Great plot and sub-plots-Shooting terrorists from your inspection booth since 1982-Did I already mention Jorji Costava? Cons:-Maybe old school graphics are not everyone's cup of tea (I personally love it though)-Stamping visas and check out papers will probably sound boring to someone-There's no ""Escape to Obristan with your newfound best friend Jorji"" endingPapers, Please is hands-down one of my favorite games. Be sure to give it a try, you definitely won't regret it.			"

""Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?"" - Joseph StalinCongratulations! You've won the lottery and earned the ""right"" to become a nameless, faceless little bureaucrat who is responsible from the border station of a fictional socialist country in 1980s, alongside countless entrants and their tons of paperwork. Glory to Arstotzka!Before describing any kind of gameplay, I'd like to warn you: Papers, Please is a highly political satire that parodies Stalin's Russia, or any oppressive totalitarian regime in human history. The humor of the game is comedy noir: cold, immediate and careless with an appropriate dose of existentialism, presenting some genuine examples of your good old-fashioned political dystopia. If you like your sarcasm served cold, and patient enough to go through a simulation of routine banality to observe a comment on the dynamics of government, keep reading. The game manages to set the mood for it perfectly.Papers, Please doesn't even closely resemble any game that I've played so far. It is a basic simulation that lets you try and decide whomever is eligible to enter the country, and whomever is not. And guess what? The rules change daily, always getting more and more complicated until the point you cannot possibly ""not"" hate the government. Endless political conflicts between the government, the neighboring countries and terrorist groups that are ever present don't make things easier or even safer. You live, work and try to earn enough to feed your family, but life is impossible for the honest as always. So things start to get interesting both financially and politically for our bureaucrat as the scenario progresses.The game has 20 or so ending, which presents huge replayability and contains some hidden achievements to hunt for. As a plus, the game takes each save file for each day separately, so it is real easy to load a specific day and replay for the achievement or ending needed.As the last call: I really liked the game, and probably gonna try to achievement hunt for a while. I advise the game for the curious, the bitter and the know-it-all. The graphic lovers won't find anything satisfactory though.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

General Thoughts / ReviewEvery once in a while an indie game comes along that, to me, is not a clear like or dislike.  I started playing Papers, Please and go to day eight before quitting the first time.  I thought to myself, ""Who the hell wants to play a game based on stamping visas?  I can't wait to get done working for the day at my REAL job!""Two days later I found myself thinking about the game.  I wanted to know what happened to the people I approved or denied.  Was it better to deny them entry, or to be a tyrant and detain them?  I mean, who doesn't know that their visa information is incorrect.  LIAR!  YOU ARE A CRIMINAL!It is just a game though, why do I care?  I did not, really.  I played again, anyway.The game kept my enthusiasm up as the difficulty ramped up, money was tight, and I seemed to be responsible for the lives of so many more pixel people than I anticiapted.  I enjoyed it up until the very end.  Good job, author.Pros Amazingly enough, makes stamping visas intriguing if you are the type of player that can get immersed in pixels. The save system is AWESOME.  Almost like a source code repository, if you start playing at an existing day, you create a branch at that day and continue playing in a parallel universe. Many different endings depending on choices made throughout the game.  Reminiscent of Chrono Trigger, you do not have to get to the last day to trigger some endings. Even though simple and interactions are quick, you can feel sympathy or opposed to certain characters.Cons Replayability was low for me.  The game has very varied endings, but I found that after I meta-gamed the Steam Achievements out, I was not inclined to go back through and try to get the endings for which there are no achievements for. Certain things feel pointless in the game - although that might have been the developers intent. Can be frustrating and wig out your OCD.RecommendationI would recommend Papers, Please if you are type of gamer who does not need flashy graphics or rapid game play to be entertained.  If you are a fan of indie game development, Papers, Please is an enjoyable title that may grow on you as it has grown on me.			"

												Papers, Please is one unique snowflake in the massive ammount of Indie Games that is turning up lately on Steam. If you get to pick one Indie game to play, make it this one.While playing it you will not only be confronted with moral dilemmas and unexpected inspections, you might also be encouraged to think about oppressive regimes and what they mean for the people that have to live in them. Bonus points to you if you start pondering about what a state should do for its citizens and what not.And even if you are unable to grasp the deeper facettes of this game, you will have still a great time stamping ""Denied"" or ""Approved"" into Visa markings.The game gets more and more complex the longer you play it. Discovering all the endings and unlocking Achievements also add to the fun. I also enjoyed the music in this game, its suprisingly nice.You should plan your next holiday in Arstotzka, make sure you get your Papers in time.Glory to Arstotzka!.			"

												Two years ago I was detained on my way into America. I was taken away from the line, seperated from my passport and dumped in a bleak empty room filled with lines of chairs and people in various states of distress. Nobody told me what was happening. Occasionally an agent would appear at the back of the room and give passports to some of the people waiting, who left quickly and quietly. At one point an elderly man went up to the desk and begged to be let through, to be met with ice-cold condescension.After about half an hour I was called through into the back room. There I was told to sit down in front of a man called Keane, on a desk filled with papers. Keane never looked at me. He asked where I was going and why I was going there. When I said I was visiting my girlfriend he leered and asked me if it was ""true love"". When I asked him whether I'd been pulled out of the line for a reason or if it was a random check, he told me it ""wasn't random"". When I asked him if I would make my flight in 20 minutes, he told me that it depended how fast I could run.Eventually Keane gave me my passport back and told me to ""lift my heels up"". I missed my flight by minutes. I waited for an hour for the next flight and then another hour on the plane for it to take off.This game made me feel sorry for Keane.10/10, would feel empathy against my will again			"

												Well first off let me start by saying Kolechians might be reading this review, if you are, please seek the nearest police officer and turn yourself in for being a terrorist. That being said, I'm very proud to have the Ministry of Admission let me review this amazing and impeccable game. The graphics are amazing, lifelike even! The controls are fantastic, you can really feel the despair joy in your character's eyes as you march to work and fufill your duty to glorious Arstotzka. I've never seen such a game before. If you can afford this game with the MoA's meager generous paycheck, I'd say pick up this gem.			"

												Papers Please is just awesome. It's a game where you play an immigration inspector. No, that's not meant sarcastically. I know it sounds dull, but let me tell you that it is absolutely not. It's challenging and interesting, even if the game lasts just a few hours. With every level you play new challenges are unlocked and near the end of the game you have to take into consideration the many aspects of an inspection.There are many moral choices to be made and in total there are 20 endings so there's also more than enough replayabily. An endless mode is also included so this game is neverending. You could play this game your whole life and not get bored. Ok, maybe after a few years you'd get bored, but theoretically you could just go on and on.The graphics have a retro Russian vibe that really impressed me. And the soundtrack isn't very long, but what's there is very good. The song that was played during the credits was actually great.In the end Papers Please was a delight to play. If only more games had gameplay this fun and an idea this original. Get this as soon as you have some money.Glory to Arstotzka ![Rating: 90/100]			"

												Few jobs are more soul-sucking than sitting at a cramped desk and shuffling paperwork for hours on end. Now imagine doing that in an Eastern Bloc country during the height of the Cold War, with low pay, bleak conditions and the constant threat of being fired - or worse - if you screw up. Tedious, boring and stressful. Ideal subject matter for a video game, no?And yet Papers, Please is an unforgettable experience. It's been dubbed a ""paperwork simulator"" - and that's not entirely inaccurate - but it's truly a game about freedom, power and how fleeting and illusory each can be.An independent game designed by former Naughty Dog programmer Lucas Pope Papers, Please casts players as a border checkpoint officer in the fictional communist country of Arstotzka. Your job is simple, at least in concept: examine the documents of people who are trying to get into the country, and determine whether they're eligible for entry or should be turned away.At first it's as easy as checking criteria like passport expiry dates, and rejecting paperwork that's invalid or forged. But before long, Papers, Please becomes a tension-filled juggling act, as you're cross-referencing work permits with identity cards, making sure the applicant's weight matches the value on their entry papers, checking fingerprint records and sometimes doing full-body scans for drugs and weapons.Every new day adds new rules to follow and new layers of complexity, from making sure applicants' vaccinations are up to date to applying a draconian extra level of inspection for citizens of a rival nation. And every time you let mess up, you lose the money you'd have earned for properly processing that batch of paperwork.To give the game a sense of grim consequence, your wages are tallied up at the end of each day, from which you must pay for rent, food, heat and medicine for your family. There's almost never enough money for everything... do you let your family go hungry in order to keep the heat on? When both your wife and son are sick and you can only afford medicine for one, who gets it?Despite the retro-flavoured visuals, the act of shuffling virtual papers is actually surprisingly tactile, and spotting a discrepancy and slamming the ""denied"" stamp down on a person's passport imparts an odd thrill of power.But not all decisions are clear-cut, and the game has 20 different endings depending on how things unfold. Do you let a man's pleading wife into the country, even though her paperwork isn't valid and the money it will cost you may mean you can't feed your family that night? Do you deny passage to the man who you suspect is a human trafficker, even though all his documents are in order? Who is behind the enigmatic organization that wants to overthrow the government, and do you dare get involved with their cause?With a deluge of big-budget, high-profile games on the horizon, it might be easy to overlook a quiet, unusual game like Papers, Please. But don't do that, comrade. The consequences would be dire.			"

 Papers, Please Papers, Please is a one of a kind game. It has a concept I have never seen before, and I doubt I will ever see it again.Despite the pixelated graphics, the game manages to very strongly portray a dark, dystopian world. The borders between two enemy soviet states, Kolechia, and Arstotzka, have opened up for the first time in years, and as a border inspector, it is your job to watch for terrorists, smugglers, illegal immigrants, wanted criminals, and people with a quarantined disease, it is very easy in this game to forget something, and let in, or keep out, someone who should have stayed in / out. Stats Papers, Please contains:  13 Steam achievements A ""30 day"" Story mode 20 different possible endings to story mode 5 family members to look after with soviet wage Pros  Interesting, retro graphics Good soundtrack Increasingly challenging as the game progresses An interesting story, filled with the options of corruption, or loyalty, deceit, or truth. Multiple endings In over 20 hours of gameplay, I have never found a bug Cons  Game can eventually begin to feel repetative A few things are timed poorly, and give not as big an impact as they could if done properly Some of the most exciting things mentioned in the papers never influence the main storyline Although an amazing game, it is the kind of game that takes a while to get into. It does not start out the most fun game. TL;DR Papers, Please is a one of a kind game, with a lot of different factors that must be taken into account when playing, a combination of planned events and random ones, even in the main storyline makes the story replayable. However, this game is  not  going to be everyone's cup of tea; may be boring to some. Overall, I reccommend this game. Overall rating  7/10  "

												Papers, Please is a puzzle, simulation game focused on the emotional task of working as an immigration officers, deciding who you let in and who you deny entry of. The game is based in a fictional country called Arstotzka. The game play focuses around the work life of an immigration inspect at a boarder checkpoint. Players will inspect documents and using a selection of different tools to work out whether the papers meet all of the criteria to warrant access to crossing the boarder. When you do find a problem with the paper work presented to you, there is also the option to interrogate the applicant, which may result in the need for further information such as a full body scan or finger printers.  Once you have worked out all of the paper work and questions being asked, you have to make a choice whether to Accept or deny entry, and then call the next person in line. Only then are you told any mistakes that you have made in the form of a warning slip.On top of wading your way through all the paper work, you also have a time limit for the day in which you have to process as many applicants as possible.  At the end of each working shift, you will earn money based on how many people have been processed, bribes collected, as well as deductions for any penalties you accrued.  Then you must decided how to spend this money with your families budget, spending it on rent, food, heat and other necessities such as medicine or upgrades to your working environment. Paper, Please has a very prominent sound track, which starts as a slow marching rhythm made by bass to represent flow of entrants in the line of applicants and how tired and depressed they are. Although the technical side of the music is basic, it is probably one of the most memorable soundtracks you will hear from a game. The game is only as difficult as you make it; if you pay attention to every little detail, you shouldn't fail. Only if you missing key bits of information or just not paying attention in general will your warnings pile up, and you will start to get less and less money, which results in your bills not being paid, which then results in having to start all over. The game took me a little over twenty hours to complete one run, there is just a huge amount of content to go through, although some of the applicants are scripted such as terrorists or smugglers, along with plot characters, a lot of the others are randomly generated which means no run should ever be the same. Technically, I had no issues what so ever. It's a very technically simple game which can be played in Windows mode without problems either.Papers, Please will certainly not be for everybody, but if you want to try something different from the regular shooting and spell casting games we are drowning in today, pick this up. I got over twenty hours of game play out of this awesome £6,99 title. Glory to Arstotzka! If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Papers, Please is an amazing game with an immersive story, fine music and great minimalistic art. This game wasn't made for killing time.This game can and will kill you if you're not careful.It builds tension, it makes you question your morals, it makes you genuinely feel bad for your mistakes.It has the perfect atmosphere. You're in the shoes of a miserable inspector, checking miserable travellers, and the game will make you feel miserable just like them. It actually feels like having a job. And at the end of each day, you're happy that you made it through and that your son is still alive. It can't get more immersive than that, in my opinion.The learning curve is steep, and I should say that for the less organized and less prepared players, it would take you a few restarts to learn a system to work it out. I know it did for me. But I wouldn't regret buying this game, it's great.If what you want is a game that will make you suffer, get this.			"

												WOW what a game.  I will admit I was so hesitant to buy this game because I judged it by its looks and the little gameplay it looked like it had.  Boy I would have made the biggest mistake of my gaming life.  Its hard for me to describe what makes this game my Game of the Year, and one of my favourite games of all time, but I can say you most certainly not be dissopointed.  Its got humor, saddness, happieness, and its all by your decisions.  As a border checkpoint worker you decide the fate of civilians, immigrants, even your family.  All these choices and how good you do your job is a real challenge especially further into the game.  Now im only speaking for myself how great this game is, but it simply must be experienced.  And for it to be created by only one person Lucas Pope is incredible.Glory to Arstotzka			"

												Papers, Please is one of those games where you go in expecting to not like it. The graphics are retro (terrible compared to most other games available today), the controls overly simplistic, the music very repetitive. There are no voice actors; every conversation is shown by moving text bubbles. Finally, there is only one setting and you are completely stationary. Put all of the above together and you would think that this is one of the most terrible games of the decade. But you would be wrong. Despite its simplicity, despite its repetitiveness, this is one of the most in depth, thought provoking games I've played in years. And with 20 different endings, there is plenty of replayability.If you haven't played this game, you're missing out.			"

												""Papers, Please"" fulfills the promise of indie game development as something original in both genre and execution, challenging the way other games have taught you to play, surprising you at various turns and involving you emotionally when you were least expecting it.The game is short and while I'm not completely comfortable recommending it at full price, it's just too good to NOT recommend. If anything I've said in the previous paragraph intrigues you even a little, you should definitely give this one a go.			"

												This game actually made me break down in tears of sorrow. So much meaningful commentary on life. When I talk about meaningful games, this is always at or near the top of the list. It's hard for me to play, not only because the gameplay is actually challenging, but because of the human element. The things you have to do to continue the game, the decisions you're faced with, are all difficult and challenging. I really think everyone should play this game.			"

												Many people will cal this game ""boring, or not fun."" But what they don't realize is the story that was put into it. In order to fully understand what this game is trying to get at you have to look around, read the newspaper, and possibly look up some of the history of the berlin wall. Overall I'd give this game a solid 10/10 for the most intriguing game I have played in awhile... (Excluding INSIDE). For those who are interested in action packed game I wouldn't necessarilly recommend becasuse at points it can become a tad bit slow. Please give this review a thumbs up if you found it helpful, all thumbs are much appreciated!			"

												Welcome to Arstotzka, a country that has recently opened its border after a war with Kolechia and thanks to the labor lottery, you are the newest immigration inspector in this tumultuous region. Bluntly stated, 'Papers, Please' is a job simulator that has you checking for discrepancies between information. You'll look over permits, IDs and passports. Reading to what the people say vs what is in the information. After you look over everything, you will either approve or deny them. If you find anything questionable, you can have the game check for dependencies, by clicking on two specific things, such as their photo doesn't match their face and then ask them about it. Later in the game, you will unlock things such as searching people and finger printing them.Each day will have a new issue that you need to check for. Another layer that you look for. The game first starts out by only letting your own citizens back into your country. Then opening the borders to everyone with a ticket, then people need a permit, then a work permit for those working and an ID for your own citizens. You'll see the issuing city that you'll need to check your rulebook to see if its really an issuing city, a gender that you'll get to search their gender even if it looks like a woman, they could be a man, detain people with contraband, question identities and fingerprint them, look at the date of entry vs the expiration date of their passport, look at when their work permit says they'll leave vs how long they told you they'll be in the country vs what they told you. Eventually, forgeries will happen that will force you to see correct official seals are there. It is a lot of information you need to look over.The major controls are just mouse clicks and drags. You have a rulebook that you can click and drag onto your desk. All information you are given from people needs to be click and dragged into your work desk to look over. Then approving or denying requires you to click to take out your stampers, then move the passport into place and click the approve or deny, then give everything back to the person, by clicking and dragging it back to them. Once you've approved or denied them, then its time to click the speaker to call up the next person in line. Its a very click heavy game, but as time goes on you can purchase booth upgrades that lets you click space or tab to call up things you'd normally just click and drag.Each person that you process earns you $5. If you make mistakes and approve or deny someone that you shouldn't you will receive no penalty the first two or three times. After that, you start losing $5. Why does money matter? You have 4 people at home with you, your wife, your son, your mother in law and your uncle. You spend money on rent, heat, food and medicine. If you don't have enough money you have to start sacrificing things. If you don't have heat, your family will start getting sick and need medicine. If you don't have food, eventually your family will die. When your family dies its game over. You need to be both thorough and efficient in the game, because you only have so much time in a day. Some days get stopped short with unavoidable terrorist attacks and bombings that cause new rules such as searching every Kolechian.There are other game over states, like doing something incorrect in front of the wrong person. If you get a game over, you can restart from any previous day. This makes the game pretty forgiving. As the days go on, a stories will unfold and you'll be responsible for the course of mini stories. You'll meet interesting characters such as diplomats, soldiers with bribes, inspectors, angry people cursing you out, human trafficers, secret agents, mysterious men.In all, this is a very unique game if not job simulator with a good story, good art style and music that matches the game and back story. I can understand if this game isn't for everyone, but if you can get into it, Papers, Please will keep your attention in a lot of ways. Once you get endless mode unlocked, you have 3 categories: timed, perfect and endless complete with leader boards.			"

Papers, Please, is an indie game published in 2013 by Lucas Pope, which sees the player take control of an immigration officer at the border of the fictional country of Arstotzka, a country based on the slew of authoritarian dictatorships that popped up in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. Set in 1982 after the conclusion of a six-year conflict between Arstotzka and neighboring Kolechia, the player, an immigration officer for Arsotzka, has to decide based on varying rules who is or isn't allowed to enter Arstotzka.Throughout the game, the player will be faced with tasks largely based around morality: Should this poor old woman be allowed to enter despite her expired passport? Should this refugee be allowed despite his criminal record? Is Cobrastan a real country? The game isn't vague with things and makes it clear the differences presented to the player: Money or Morality? With a family of five (and a sixth possible to adopt) to feed, shelter, and heat, the stakes are much higher and less personal and more interpersonal; it becomes logical to deny the masses illegally trying to enter Arstotzka as long as you're able to keep your family alive.The rules for who can get into the country tend to change daily in the story mode, and the game makes sure to not keep the player too tired or too familiar with a single rule setup; One day people from the  United Federation will be barred due to a Polio outbreak there, another day they'll be allowed in as long as they bring a certificate that they were vaccinated. The game keeps the player on full alert, and tosses in new mechanics (terrorist attacks and rifles players can use to stop them, armed revolutionary groups willing to sneak through the border to overthrow the regime, etc) to keep the player both on edge and entertained, not allowing itself to fall flat or get boring during the 31 days the game has as its story mode.In addition to story mode, there exists an endless mode which allows the player to compete against others internationally via Steam in regard to how many people they can get across in a period of time or other factors, such as how quick they can get through people correctly.The game is a masterpiece in storytelling and narrative, and provides a great deal of stress and emotional impact with the player, along with excellent gameplay which is sure to keep your brain on high alert for a period of time after you finish up. I strongly suggest you buy this game if you enjoy 1984-esque worlds, or if you enjoy puzzle games in general.			"

												You're working in the booth one day, and you receive a note.The note tells you that there's a serial killer in line today, and that he's killed a man's son.That man is line behind him.The note implores you to let this killer into the country, so that the man can find him and take revenge for his son.Or, you can detain the killer and have him taken by the police. However, on top of all this, you have a sick family at home. Your own son is very ill and you need money for food and medicine. You could be seriously penalized for letting EITHER of these men through if they don't have proper paperwork.Hell, do you even know if the man will be able to CATCH this killer? What if he fails? You'll have let a murderer walk freely into the country. You have to make a decision quickly because any time you waste means less money for your family.This is the kind of scenario you deal with in this game. At first it feels like just the bleak observational game where you just look at paperwork and allow/deny access. But as the game goes on, you'll be presented with these moral quandries that really test you. Any decision you make, be it morally good or bad, saintly or selfish, could have a range of consequences. Which winds up making the game incredibly curious and makes you want to keep going to see what happens.			"

												This is a testament to the power of games as a medium. It manages to be, all at once, an intellectual stimulation, an escape from reality, and social commentary. It is art, entertainment and work rolled into one. As the player, you are presented with a task that is very much like a lot of paper-pushing jobs out there. Yet here it becomes an intellectual challenge; a test of your mettle and attention. And somehow it is still fun. This is quite an accomplishment in terms of gameplay.The story, meanwhile, is at once Orwellian and Kafkaesque. It is a kind of social commentary, but not on-the-nose; it is subtle, humourous, nuanced. The recurring characters, with very brief screen time, manage to be interesting and memorable. The Soviet aesthetic is superbly done in terms of design and graphics. The mechanics can be constraining sometimes, but that's part of its charm and challenge.Above all, this is a game that is sui generis, its own beast. There are games with similar micromanagement mechanics, but the aesthetic and the pacing of Papers, Please make it unique.			"

												A concept that is basically running immigration for an eastern-bloc country during the cold war. Sounds boring as hell, right? So deceitful it is then, because few things are more addicting. While playing, I kept finding myself thinking ""Just one more day, one more then off to bed"". Five hours later, it's 5AM and I'm due at work in three hours. No regrets here, either. The gameplay is simple but deep, and the story branches like a visual novel. Plus it's the only game I've ever played to truly make me actually feel -BAD- for doing what the game tells me to. Video game history teaches us that morality is black and white. Papers reveals how evoke it with more gray area than I ever thought a game could, and it's crazy how easily it does so.There's a reason this game was voted GoTY by so many publications, and touted as simply amazing by gamers far and wide. Quirky, fun, addictive - you owe it to yourself to play this gem. GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!			"

												Papers, Please is yet another example of why the widespread notion that games “should first and foremost just be fun” is not only antiquated, but categorically false. Is a game that’s not “fun” bad? Of course not, we just need to expand our vocabularies a bit. Because Papers, Please simply isn’t fun at all and yet it’s a genuinely good game.Papers, Please is a bureaucratic simulation game in which the player takes over the role of a customs official of a pseudo Eastern Bloc country at the end of 1982. After a long time, the borders are open once more and it is your job to make sure that the flood of people pouring in have all the necessary documents. Not only that, but you need to make sure that the passports haven’t expired, that the information provided checks out across multiple documents and so on. Rules change regularly due to domestic and international events such as terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks which constantly keeps you on your toes. You will also be provided with bulletins informing you about wanted criminals.It is as laborious, mundane and monotonous as it sounds. And yet it’s incredibly compelling due to everything around it. You want to do a good job because you get financially penalized for multiple mistakes. Also, the more people you process, the more money you get. And you need that money because your family depends on you for rent, heating and food. But there are desperate people with insufficient or forged documents begging you to let them pass for various reasons. Some people will try to bribe you. Rebel organizations trying to bring down the government will seek your aid. All the while the government will be bearing down on you to do your job in accordance to the strict, but not always fair, rules.And that’s what’s so brilliant about Papers, Please. You really get a feel of what it’s like, you get into the role and you start to think as if you’re really there and not just playing a game. Why wouldn’t I want to help these guys out? What has my government done for me aside from oppressing and threatening me? But what about my family? What will happen to them? So you juggle all of these thoughts and simply try to do what you feel is best in each particular situation. But there’s simply no way to do everything right, something always has to give.You go through the story campaign day by day. There are 31 full days to play. To illustrate the many different ways your choices impact the game is the fact that the game has 20 different endings that can occur during various situations within that period. While the game does a really good job to convey its grim and bleak mood, the writing leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the dialogue is just unconvincing and unnatural. Also, for some reason, the game uses a bit of Soviet-esque broken English, but at the same time it uses some silly and very American colloquialisms. Apart from the story mode, there’s also the endless mode which you unlock when you get a certain ending, but by the time that you’ve seen most of what the story has to offer, chances are slim that you’ll be interested in more.Papers, Please is a brave and wholly original game that deliberately offers mundane gameplay and wraps it up into a surprisingly compelling and profoundly affecting whole.7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)			"

												My opinion: Papers, Please was a game I really enjoyed, but is definitely not for everyone.These types of games really captivate me, and when it was announced I was really intrigued. I love games that go beyond today's formula, game's that seek to push and explore new boundaries, even if they might fail. This game is certainly one of them.But that same thing also hurts it, and some people might find this incredibly boring. You play as an immigration officer at a checkpoint in a fictional communist state, and you process people entering the country. As you can imagine, immigration officers don't have the most exciting job. It consists of checking to make sure their passports and papers are authentic, and if so, admitting them into the country. The gameplay is virtually the same throughout the game, but somehow it manages to captivate me, and clearly tons of others as well.The gameplay, as I said before, is largely the same. In fact, it's almost entirely scripted for the most part. On day three a certain event happens, on day eleven another does, and there's no changing it. Despite that, however, there is still an incredible chance for a diverse experience. In fact, Papers, Please has 20 endings, each occurs as a result of you doing things a certain way, and there are still a lot of choices in this linear story. One thing I really enjoyed is how the game allows you to explore all those options. The game is set to have 31 days of work (there is an endless mode for those who complete the story) and once complete a day, you are allowed to start a semi-new game from that day and make a different decision. When each day takes around 15 minutes to complete, this was a brilliant addition that removed monotonous repeats that would've made me lose interest in a flash.Want to continue reading for a more in depth review?

												It's not as flashy as some 3D games, but it's beautiful. It isn't as loud as other games, but it's sensational. It's not as verbose as other story-focused games, yet it's very emotional, and managed to tell a story through your actions. Who knew that taking on the role of an immigration inspector could be so nerve-wracking, yet so rewarding at the same time. You just spend your time behind the desk; you approve or deny visas, and wish that at the end of the day, you've got enough money to feed your family some bread.With your role as an inspector, you get to choose the fate of the immigrants and the country. People desperately want to get inside, and they'll do absolutely anything for an approval. Sometimes, more extreme solutions come into the minds of people, and they'll just climb over the border to be shot by guards. If you fail your duties, the country temporarily goes into a state of disarray, and employs tighter security measures which makes your job harder. A harder job means more papers. More papers means more time observing discrepancies. More time observing discrepancies means that the immigration line moves slower - and a slow line doesn't pay the bills. Don't be surprised if, by the end of the day, your family died of hunger just because you didn't work harder for the country.It's very interesting to see how something so minimal, could be so powerful. The player works a mere desk job, yet becomes judge and protector of this fictional country. You connect entrants with their loved ones; you give immigrants better lives; you give people a new start - all with a single stamp. It's storytelling at one of its finest moments, and Papers, Please showed what the medium is truly capable of.And there you have it.			"

												At first I wrote a silly review because this game just struck me as a silly throw back that's addicting yet worth the money. Now after having logging more hours I feel obligated to leave a more accurate and in-depth review:This game really ♥♥♥♥ed me up emotionally - and I mean that in a good way. For me it's really rare when media (book, movies, games, whatever) really leaves any lasting impact for more than a few hours however I found myself simply dwelling on Papers Please at idle times days afterwards. The game has a really transforming effect much more powerful than you would ever expect especially given the media it’s presented by and the presentation style itself. In spite of being a pixilated arcade style game, once you get into it – you lose yourself.I found myself really filling out the role like so few games have had me doing. It’s so easy to succumb to mind numbing bureaucracy and transform into a robot: after a while you’re not even reading the dialogue or looking at people other than to match their faces with their pictures similar to T-800 terminator. Similarly you can lost in people’s stories as they shuffle past you wanting so desperately to help people or do some good (greater good or for personal gain) but being constantly bound by government regulations and your need to support your family and not be sent to the Gulags. Yet still it’s you can find yourself invigorated with power wanting either to obstruct and detain people out of spite or rather allow key players to operate and undermine the very bureaucracy employing you.Than you stop and go to the bathroom or take a phone call and realize you are playing a videogame with a fairly simple midi-style sound track and SNES era graphics. Nonetheless 2 days later on your lunch break you can’t help but wonder what would have happened if you had let that one revolutionist through, or your bosses lover, or denied that one terrorist, and you have to play again to find out.All in all the game has 20 endings. It seems like a lot but I wish there were 100. A proper run though can take you anywhere from maybe 3-10 hours. It’s extremely addicting in my opinion not because of (rather in spite of) the amazingly retro arcade play style – rather because of how engrossing and thoroughly intriguing the characters and setting are.Hey dev, I want more!************************************old review below***********************************This game is an exercise in fury. I have never been so ♥♥♥♥ing annoyed. Why am I still playing. Oh god I'm still playing! Why can't I stop playing!?			"

												Papers, Please is a unique game that has done something only few games have done. it will test your moral compass as close to the limits as possible, it'll test your humanity, trouble solving ability and quick time reactions. Papers, Please also manages to take something that at first glance would seem a boring task, playing as  an immigration inspector in a border checkpoint, to a work of art.That's a solid 10/10. A must with or without a sale.			"

												I was amazed at how much fun I had actually ""working"".   It's kind of an old school graphics game,so if high end graphics is all you're into, this game is probably not for you. In this game it's  all about noticing the detail and staying on your toes. The actual story of the game does not last all that long but it can be some trial and error figuring out how to get things done correctly and learning how to make things quicker for yourself so you can make more money.  It also helps to memorize things as well.  You also have some moral decisions to make to either help someone or make life easier for yourself. I have nearly 54 hours logged on this game although some of the time is AFK time. I also have all the achievements as well, it's not too difficult to get them all.			"

												The game really puts you in the right mindset once you've got the hang of it. The way it controls, with the dialog, the items, the choices, you really feel like you're there at a desk, sighing before starting work and sighing at peoples pointless chatter and sigh at peoples obviously wrong documents, 'I'm just doing my job here, you're wasting my time with that out of date passport'. In that way, it's a very realistic job simulator.And later, you start to feel the importance of your work. It is not just stamping documents, It is determining peoples future, the safety of those you work with and your country, secret agencies.. And your family. Which, if you suck, will die much like Oregon Trail. It has a very organic measure of how well you're doing and how.And all of that, mixed with the plotlines, the worry behind every decision, constantly balacing on a knifes' edge, the moments you need to pull the trigger, the sense of dissappointment if you miss a crucial detail and it ends up costing peoples lifes.. Makes it very fun. Or, something.It is something.try it out			"

												I just finished Papers, Please a few minutes ago, and it's left quite an impact. For a game made by a single guy, this is outstanding work. The concept of having to face a constant struggle of economic issues, terrorism, forgery, and even keeping your family healthy and well fed is innovative, and it keeps the GOOD bit of Pheonix Wright. The world of Papers, Please is absorbing, and makes you feel as if you are genuinely affecting the lives of the peopl who you Deny, and Accept. There were many, many moments in Papers, Please where I was conflicted on whether to Accept or Deny someones Passport, as sometimes it would essentially ruin their entire life if you denied it, or accepted it. Although I do adore this game, if you're not quick with your fingers, I personally wouldn't reccomend it. The game, from my playthrough, requires fast movements and a keen eye, as some of the ""forgery"" is just a single letter in a name, or an extra +3 to the weight of the passport holder. If however, you're looking for a fun, innovative and absorbing game, buy Papers, Please. You will not regret it.			"

												A ""Paperwork simulator"" sounds like a hard sell, but it's encouraging to see that word-of-mouth is getting people to try this wonderful little game out. It's refreshing to have something different for a change rather than another FPS, platformer or suchlike.Your job is to give or refuse permission to enter your country to various people who come to your customs booth...... it is a hard sell, isn't it?Okay then, your job is made more difficult in several ways. First of all, your bureaucratic government implements more and more rules as time goes on which means you have to be quicker and quicker at processing, without letting accuracy fall. Secondly, you have certain moral choices to make - you have to feed and warm your own family and that can only be done by processing people as quickly as possible. Well, unless they bribe you to let them in, or the guards bribe you to detain them or... and of course, there's always the risk of forged documentation [which you are punished for if you miss] or terrorist attack [which curtails the day].This game is deeply engrossing. It's straightforward to begin with, but the difficulty curve is just right, adding complexity day by day - just as you master the rules something else comes along which you have to keep an eye out for. Added to the fact that there are MANY, MANY different possible endings will lead you to replay this several times in order to see what happens.Well worth a try!			"

												This game is all about speed and attention, if you lack one of those then you might be in trouble.Papers please puts you to verify passports, it may sound boring but it turns out to be really nice. At first you can approve only people from your country, after a day you can approve anyone that shows eligible to enter but there's a thing there, you need to verify discrepancies such as gender, emission date, etc. You earn money for every person you get it right, allowing to enter or denying it's passage will earn you money if you get it right but if you make a mistake you will be penalized for it, the money is used to pay your apartment rent and to buy food for your family, yes you have a family in this game. This is where speed and attention comes to play, if you lack speed then you won't attend to many ""costumers"", making you earn less money and if you lack attention and don't detect the discrepancies then you will get penalized for the people that either enters without being allowed or deny the ones that are clear to pass, easy, right?Each day the game will get harder and harder but it will offer you new ways to deal with those people, just calm yourself down to do a good job and pay attention to every detail, and remember, glory to Arstotzka.

												When I first saw the trailer for Papers, Please, I thought it was a joke. ""How can sorting through papers be fun,"" I asked myself. The only reason I got it was becaues it was on sale. To my surprise, it ended up being one of my favorite indie games I own.Yes, there actually is a story behind you approving and denying passports, a rather deep and compelling story. You work a job to provide for you and your family. As you work, things happen and your job slowly gets complicated. The game boils down to how quickly you can correctly sort documents and detect frauds amung the people who pass through your checkpoint. If you mess up, you get a pink slip, and slowly lose money if you mess up too much. If you can't afford to provide for your family, they slowly die, and as you need to live as well, there are plenty of choices to be made.There isn't much else to say about Papers, Please except for it is an indie gem. With a good story and enjoyable gameplay, this is a must have and a must play; would pay full price for game.			"

												The gameplay is border control tedious paperwork. Verifying if different entries are coherent, checking for frauds or typos, asking people to provide more information. And then deciding if you let them through or not.I have very little empathy to pixels, so I thought this was going to be easy. I would just accept people whose papers are fine, and then refuse people whose papers are not right even if they are dying and need an organ transplant.But then the game got to me. There is so much more going on than just the little story of the person that comes to meet you. One person will tell you about another. Will give you something for another. Will try to bribe you, and you need the money to keep your own family afloat. There are events going on in the game's world, and it is subtly told through short sequences or short news reports.I have to give a file to a spy. Someone else comes, and tells me that he is also a spy, and the next person looking for the file is a bad guy. He gives me another file so I can switch for the fake. Which file do I choose to give, who do I trust? And then I start to care. A girl tells me that her abusive boyfriend that beats her up and might end up killing her is coming. His papers are alright, but I still refuse to let him enter, and get a salary sanction for my decision. The game won, I was not just proceeding as if they were pixels and I started to make moral choices and get invested in my role.This game is not exactly ""fun"", but it is Art and worth trying to anyone that wants to see maturity in the video games medium. Very original, meaningful, and really well crafted.			"

												At the time of writing, I've played all the game's 30 days and got the main ending and some other possible endings. I have not changed my mind from the first draft of this review. In fact, I liked it even more.This is one of those unique indie games that surprise even old gamers like me. The game world is quite convincing, the gameplay is very different and, even though it feels a bit like work and a bit repetive at times, the game has a nice challenge that makes me want to see what's next, with different variations added every day.It's also worth noting that the fact that you also need to earn money to survive and to feed everyone at home also makes you think about how you spend/make your money and have difficult moral choices. After playing the game for so many hours, though, if you make the right choices, you won't have to worry about money (tip: never move to another apartment, unless you really want the achievements).Hope you guys can play it and enjoy it as much as I did. Glory to ""name your state capitalism country here""!			"

The game mainly focuses on you looking at documents and trying to find incorrect information. The game becomes more complex with new types of documents and rules changing throughout the story due do the politics.

												This game is a social commentary about life as a border agent in a communist dictatorship/oligarchy. It can show you the struggle that people can go through when they live in an area that is oppressive. This game is not for people that want variety in their gameplay, it has 0 variety. This is a linear game that hardly changes from start to finish. There are many different paths, and depending on how you go through the game, can change in length a lot. I enjoyed this game myself, but you should only buy it if you wish to view social commentary of this type, and not for variety or flamboyant things in the gameplay. I think this is a great game that many people can enjoy.			"

 You were contacted by resistance. They threatened to kill you, if you don't let their operative through border. The contact left a cryptic note to you. You couldn't figure out the message in the note. So afraid of getting killed you randomly let couple people go through the border. One of these people happened to be a terrorist with backpack full of explosives. He detonated explosives after passing your checkpoint. One of the border guards got killed. You were glad you weren't fired. After day of work you barely get enough money to buy food for your family or heat for your apartment.Papers please is a memory game, where you need to go through people's passports and other documents. Then you figure out, if you let them through border or not. The game starts with simple rules to remember to check, but difficulty advances over time.  You start to get multiple rules to remember and gameplay can become really hectic. The game has two modes. The first mode is a story mode. In the story mode you live through events, which of some are scripted and some randomised. You have some choices while story advances.  Occasionally people can come to ask for your help. You can either be rewarded or being penalised for helping them. The story is limited to certain length and has multiple endings depending on choices you make. The other mode is called endless. It's completely randomised. Also time is not limited in this mode. You unlock this mode after playing story.Overall the game captures really well grim atmosphere of cold war era communistic country.Glory to Arstotzka! "

Great and addictive game!Papers, Please is a point & click game in which you are an immigration inspector at Grestin border checkpoint in the communist state of Arstotzka.You must check the documents of people who want to cross through the ckeckpoint.If you notice that the document(s) contain invalid information(or if they don't provide a necessary document),you must inform the person by highlighting the discrepancy with the inspection tool,then clicking on the interrogate option.Then,depending on the case,you can either deny access or detain them.Or if they have valid papers,you can allow them in the country.The game is divided into 31 days.After you finish a day,you must manage your home expenses(like rent,food,heat,medicine and some booth upgrades).At home you have your wife,son,mother-in-law,uncle,and niece(if adopted later in the game).They get cold,hungry,ill,or die, if not provided with the above home expenses.The game has 20 different endings,which can be achieved by making choices like helping/ignoring a mysterious organization,working dutifully,and other ones that I don't want to spoil.During the game you'll also be required to do some moral decisions,for example denying or allowing in the country a mother with invalid papers who is excited to see her son.Pros Good soundtrack Addictive gameplay Nice pixel-graphics Many outcomes based on choicesCons Multiple playthroughs can be repetitive "

												You are a clerk at a border checkpoint in the ficticious country of Arstotzka. At first your job is simple: people with the correct documents can enter, the others are denied. Just we weary of fraudsters! Your job gets more complicated as the game progresses. The more people you process correctly, the more you get payed. Your family back home depends on it.You might think there is not much room for interpretation, that life at the border is simple: you grant admittance, or deny it, in accordance with the rules. However, life at the border is not simple and you have to ask yourself: ""Am I an uncorruptable bureaucrat or can I bend the rules a little? Am I the villain or the good guy? Or am I all of the above?"" "

												I must congratulate Lucas Pope for being able to turn a mundane task into an entertaining experience. Never in my life I would have guessed I'd someday enjoy to examine passports and permits. However, I am probably one of the few people not able to see a deeper message to this game. Ok yeah, dictatorship sucks, but we all know that. It doesn't really give you another point of view in the matter. Also, I did not feel some sort of conflict. If I deny someone, so what? There's one point in the game where you know that if you deny the woman ahead of you, she will be killed in her country. That's the only time you may feel a dilemma. I never thought I'd say that and I'm really sorry to do so, but the problem here is the graphics. There's just a bunch of pixels in front of me, not displaying any emotion whatsoever. I don't know what's wrong with me since everyone seem to be able to feel empathy toward those characters, but I really didn't care about her. It was a spoiled opportunity to make me infringe the strict rules of my country. Also, the other side of the dilemma is supposed to be your family. If you don't do well your job, like if you accept someone that you shouldn't, you won't provide enough money to make them survive. This would be great if I felt attachment toward my family. The thing is that the only time you ""see"" your family is between two days, on a static screen that displays ""Mother-in-law"", ""Uncle"", ""Wife"" and ""Son"". Yeah, you don't get to see them, and you don't even know their name. So what if ""Uncle"" die? Will I grieve?As much as I love minimalism and believe graphics are not what make a game good, this game really would have benefit from better aesthetics. Regarding its emotional impact and its political statements, there is room to improvement. In the end, I still recommend it because I love it very much as a GAME; sadly, it will not be more than that for me.			"

*As a small disclaimer, my experience with this title expands to previous ventures, before I had owned it on Steam. My apologies to those feeling mislead by my hours count.It's brutal. It's meticulous. It's Papers, Please. This well-known Indie gem became an instant favorite of mine upon finishing the first mission, and is one I both love and dread to play; love because of how fantastic it feels, dread because of how long I spend at one time playing. Thanks to Chaplainissar for purchasing this fantastic game for me (and to LockeProposal and Carsh who preread this review), I was able to play this cut-throat title about doing paperwork in an allotted time. Why, you may ask, would a game about forced desk labor be anywhere close to pleasurable to play? Here are just a few reasons I chose to deliberate on personally:The Tutorial System - Why is the word “tutorial” in italics? Because this game does not have a tutorial. Papers, Please is a click-based game in which clients present their papers to a security checkpoint-the one you are stationed-to be cleared or denied for entry into the glorious Arstotzka. As the game progresses, various scenarios add vital components to the game’s management system. * Spoiler from Day 2 ahead. It’s not too major nor far in, but blacking out to be safe.* For example, from Day 2-onward, foreign entrants must have a passport and Inspection Mode is presented to denote discrepancies in client filing. This is where the tutorial system kicks in: the first entrant you meet each day is usually a ‘Denied’ entrant, mainly due to that day’s clause, which teaches the player throughout the game to maintain the new ruling set by the Arstotzka command. Of course, some of these rules dissipate or change, but as new features are added or story checkpoints occur, the game instructs the player how to react to said changes with the first entrant of each day; to me, this is a masterful way to teach the player without the need to add more content for them to read.Storytelling - Though the title is not the first to implement this style of storytelling, Papers, Please utilizes text-newspaper clippings and work noticed-to organize the ever-changing themes and rulings that occur during each day’s shift. For example (and I will not say which of these are spoilers because some of these may occur and some may not) you may read the news before walking to work to find that a convicted killer escaped his holding cell and may attempt to enter Arstoztka, or that a man with a brown jacket carrying a large amount of firepower may attempt to enter the city to ‘liberate’ the citizens from Arstoztka rule. Regardless of the scenario, the game hints the supposed rendezvous with the said individual, which may or may not occur within the next given days.Freedom of Choice - A man, succeeding his brother in-law and wife to your security checkpoint, expresses his elation for ultimately becoming free from his previous home country and of the new life that his wife, brother in-law, and he shall have in the glorious of Arstoztka! The wife and brother in-law were accepted after no deliberation required. The husband’s passport expired the day before, and Arstoztka law prevents anyone with an expired passport, whatever the reason, from passage to the country. The man pleads for you to authorize his entry permit, but you had earned two citations from prior mistakes; one more will prevent you from earning enough to feed your family. What would you do? There are several moments in the game similar to this that obligate the player to establish a decision. Day 1, I had chosen to follow Arstozta law no matter the consequences, but found myself quoting the unchanging phrase, “What have I done?”Overall Feel - Papers, Please is, to put it plainly, a grey title. The graphics, audio, and clients are bleakly designed to create an impression of oppression from the Arstoztka government. Even when the unnamed protagonist asked for each entrants’ paperwork-requesting their documents with the line, “Papers, please”-they do so with an ominous tone as if the phrase is ingrained as a rehearsed statement. The color palette of Papers, Please is as described: nearly colorless, with only specific objects retaining any tone of life. The clients you meet at the front gate hold a rigid design as well, seen here[pilki42.files.wordpress.com]. TL:DR - In this society of right and wrong, justice and devotion, pride and dignity, how you play this dismal title is completely up to you. It’s a game about questions. It’s a game about truth. It’s a game about pride in country. Papers, Please suggests a simulation fashion of action combined with the immersion of the protagonist as yourself. The game becomes less about simply doing your job, and more of who you plan to save and leave behind with the government of a questionably oppressive nation breathing down your neck, prodding you with symbols that question each action you make. Thanks for reading.Disclaimer: Image not owned by myself.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	.			"

												I like it a lot, felt invested in my family despite them just being names on a board.  Was legitimately shocked at pretty much each terrorist attack. The story keeps you engaged and I liked the moral choices.I didn’t like some of the format.  I’m sure its intentional, but the UI is so cramped and annoying that I can’t check everything in a decent amount of time.  I’d also maybe prefer a better clock because I had some difficulty keeping track of time.I played it as basically just somebody trying to survive.  I min/maxed my warnings and people going through because I don’t give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ its a job and I need money for my family.  I’d also take bribes, especially after we got money confiscated because I couldn’t handle my family being sick or hungry.Also supporting the order.  Let agents through because I’m sick of the government and how they treat me, was willing to kill somebody I never met who was going to kill more people for the government, but wasn’t willing to expose myself and put the order above my own life.  Really, the game makes it amazingly simple to see why people might suddenly turn on their government.  It starts as apathy, then bitterness, then somebody comes in and offers a better life or change and you suddenly see yourself actively working against the regime in slowly more questionable ways.So, in short, I can see why it won game of the year on many people’s lists.

												Do I recommend this game?   Does the pope♥♥♥♥♥♥in the woods??  I got this for my daughter, mainly, expecting crap.  In fact, I'd had it for quite some time but nobody has ever bothered with the game....after all, how good can a game that cost (probably) about £100 to create be? Well, me and my daughter fired this up tonight. We'd just put my lad to bed, at 9pm, after playing LEGO Marvel and was looking through what I had installed, so I could give my daughter the same amount of time on the PC as he did, to make it fair.  I suggested she try it out as there was no point putting on a massive game for the sake of 60 minutes.  Holy 'nards, was I wrong??  Before we knew it, and even bothered to look, it was 11:45pm.  The time, literally, flew by.  I'm disabled and I was stood up at the time, (wife took all furniture when she left), because I have very limited seating, at the moment, that can cater to my needs and am usually getting fed up about 15-20 minutes of not being sat down with agony in my back as well as my legs.  Admittedly I gobbed a high dose of morphine first but I didn't even get fed up of standing.  I was stood over her shoulder watching her play and it ended up with us both doing it, asking each other to choose option A or option B or just to arrest the scumbags that were trying to get through!!  10/10 DEFINITELY recommend this game.  I expected fossilized mammoth crap and was rewarded with the Hope Diamond.....So much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed fun!!			"

												Really amazing and fun Indie typish game, The game is very easy to play and learn, it will get harder tho the more days you make but that doesn't really matter because it is easy to learn it and use the new things, also this game has some parts where there are people coming to ur booth and asking u to do them a favor or etc. or let them pass etc. and its up to you to make the decision to let them pass and risk getting a strike or deny them, this game gets ur feelings tho, because some choices are hard.But anyways i would highly recommend this game :)!, REALLY FUN and AMAZING :)! Definitely worth Playing.10/10 GLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRYYYY TO ARSTOTZKA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Who knew playing a Checkpoint Charlie officer in a fictional Eastern Bloc state could be so much fun?  Despite a solitary and very simplistic 8-bit gameplay screen, your encounters with various characters are deep enough to occasionally play on your conscience, and there are a surprising number of choice-based story-arcs to keep the game interesting for numerous play-throughs.

												Next! Review, stamp, search, allow/reject... and next! Rinse and repeat from morning to night, day after day after day.Such is the daily grind that is Papers, Please. At first glance it seems repetitive, boring even - but a closer look at the various unfolding events reveals a plethora of ethical dilemmas and moral choices, each with their own unique (even unexpected) consequences.At first glance the game and its setting seem oddly removed from modern society with all its comforts, but in marrying a seemingly-repetitive daily grind with complex decisionmaking, Papers, Please creates an unforgettable and haunting experience of contemplation.What does work mean to you? What truly matters to you in life... and why?			"

												So first off, i'd like to just say this isn't a ""Border Patrol Simulator"" as many might judge just by looking at it. This game teaches you that either you become a loyal and honest citizen of your country, or try to make a diffrence when the oppertunity arises. It gives you choice without just throwing options at you. You decide how you want to handle the situation, but you can't help everyone. So who are you going to save? Sounds a lot more than what ya think huh? I very highly recommend this game.Also, before you give into the negitive reviews saying ""This game sucks! It's so repetitive"" Or ""I can't understand it"" You just haven't played/understood it enough to fully grasp what the game offers you. There is no tutorial. There are no hints. ""Except in the bulletin you're given."" And the rules change on a day to day basis. But that's to keep the intensity and change the aspect of the game to keep it from getting repetitive. Just like in real life, you are expected to understand your job even if you don't fully grasp how it goes. Adapt yourself and stop relying on mechanics to pop infront of your face. This game is certainly not for everyone, but i'd say give it a chance. You can always refund it. That is if you haven't been sucked in like I have.**Also there are 20 endings.**			"

												9/10+ it's actually a paperwork simulator, but with charm and very deep gameplay mechanics and moral dilemmas. your goal is to check the papers in order to let people pass through the country and you have to do it right in order to get paid and help your family don't starve+ starts easy and progressively becomes more complex, you have to check every little detail, most people will try to fool you, others will raise moral dilemmas, very immersive game!+ basic presentation which works great with the gameplay+ incredible soundtrack+ multiple endings, great replayability+ that's what indie is about, creativity. there's no other game like that. the developer is definitely a special guy (or the team behind it)- presentation might not appeal to some, i'm also not fond of retro style games, but here it works- might be difficult and random at times, as far as the result of your actions is concerned			"

Posted: June 30, 2016
												Many people like to argue about how ""fun"" a game is, whenever they rate it. It is, in my opinion, a foolish concept of game criticism, as the ""level of fun"" a game has is purely determined by subjectivity.However, I can definitely say that most people out there wouldn't find Papers, Please fun. And my response to that is... that isn't the point.I know not everyone on Steam is an adult, but if you grew up with video games, I'd certainly hope your tastes have matured. I have some conversations with 30-year-old men who still can't stop gushing about how great Super Mario Bros. is, even thought it's simply just a fun game, and nothing more. It has nothing to say about humanity, it has no high artistic value, but it is still a fun game.But fun isn't what makes a game. I love Spec Ops: The Line, and that game made me feel like I had swallowed gravel.Papers, Please hasn't made me feel like I've swallowed any gravel, but it has made me walk away with a new perspective on the world around me and about how video games, as a whole, can be narrated.On the surface, Papers, Please is a relatively simple game in concept: you work for a border, check travelers' passes, and either let them enter Arstotzka, or deny then entry depending on their documentation. But it's how the game continues to expand on this gameplay and on its simple story, that things start to get more... interesting, as the game goes on.The game, as many critics have complained, is indeed monotonous at times. I know checking the details of someone's passport to see if it matches their access pass doesn't appeal to many people, but if you ever wanted to simulate the life of a border inspector, this is a regular thing they would have to do. And it helps settle in that feeling of living in a lifeless country, where the only excitement you get it from the occasional denial of entry.I get the same satisfaction from playing Papers, Please that I get from my day job: a box office cashier. Sure, my job isn't as detailed as the one in Papers, Please, but after processing hundreds of people to see the same movie over and over and over again, I always get some maniacal joy from telling spoiled families, ""Sorry, this showing is sold out."" Deep down, I grin menacingly, as I watch the passive mother turn sour, and ask if I'm joking. Like I'd bloody joke about a showing being sold out, you whiny b****.Dark, intimate feelings aside, Papers, Please also offers a healthy dose of self-reflection on your own morality, by posing a lofty question: what would you do at your job if _____? Think of anything to fill in there, and the game throws it at you. Lovers being separated by the border, vigilantes seeking the murderer of their children, and people physically bribing you to let them in. It constantly makes you wonder where your loyality truly lies. Do you find morality in yourself? Perhaps in altruism? Or is it to the government, who gives you your daily pay, from which your family would not survive?See, you can't just pass over every person carelessly, or accept every pass, because you'll receive citations. The first two of the day are just warnings, but after three starts pay dock. And you earn money from each person you process, so inspection is key. I've heard some friends complain about how hard the game is, but I only had my pay docked twice. I'm a very thorough inspector.The design of the game's screens even enforces this feeling of isolation and dull monotony. Every day, you see your nonexistent family, read the paper, and walk to the same screen of work. However, the color palette isn't limited to just grey and brown. There's still some color variation in the people themselves, which is a unique design choice, as a man who appreciates aesthetic design.I'm sure you can tell I really enjoyed Papers, Please. For a long time, I hailed The Last of Us as the best game of 2013... but now I'm beginning to have second doubts. I certainly wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to have ""fun"" (whatever that is), but I do recommend it to anyone who wants to play something totally new. This is a fine addition to my new favorites list, and I'm giving Papers, Please a well-deserved 10/10.			"

												This is not just a game, it's a morality lesson.Myself, as an immigrant, has gotten to hate the person behind the glass, the one checking on my documents. I have never been turned down though, but have been treated in not the best of ways. Now I get the chance of putting myself in the border guard's shoes and can tell you, I have learned a lot.The checking on the documents is mere formalism, the real lesson starts on whether or not to let a person with an expired passport or a missing document cross the border and enter your country after he has told you ""please, if I come back to my country I will be killed"". If you let that person pass, you will be fined with 5 credits, which don't seem much at first, but it will allow you to buy the medicine your son so much needs. It's the end of the Cold War, you have a family to mantain and every penny is needed. Sometimes you'll be given the opportunity to accept bribes, or detain people just to earn some money. Will you detain an innocent person just for earning a couple of credits? Will you accept bribes of criminals that want to cross the border? All it needs is a seal in a passport, whether it's green or red it's all up to you.			"

												The reactions people have to this game puzzle me.You apparently are a border officer for what most people call an unfair communist style state, with reviewers often comparing it to the brexit or trumps wall or some nonesenseBut..-2 terrorist attacks in a week AT THE BORDER and the border remains open and even lets people from the offending country in with increased security. -The searches on these people (Who almost ALL have controband or weapons on them) Stop simply because another nation asked nicely (Now that is just stupid)-The worker (you) can make two BIG MISTAKES daily with just warnings (How many jobs do you know of where you can screw up badly twice a day and no one cares?) -A massive nationwide fingerprint database is kept just in case your passport has bad info, so you can get in even with a misprint as long as your identity is confirmed.How in the name of heck is this unfair or wrong?  You Millenials are Reeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaly backwards and idealistic yanno. Ok, im done poking fun at the stupidity of most modern gamers, now that youve flamingly downvoted this for not going along with what the gaming society thinks, lets talk about the game! Its great! A puzzler about trying to check as many pieces of info as you can while compromising (Because you need to make enough money to stay alive at the end of every day) and keeping in mind, you get two mistakes daily before losing money, so if you have a desire to be charitable and take bribes, you can do it twice scot free, as long as you dont screw up anything else on that day, meaning perfection is something to chase as long as you possibly can (Because a 5 dollar bribe may have saved your son, but if its your third mistake, it will only pay for the citation you just earned) Also, not often mentioned, this game is not a ""play once, die, repeat"", you can go back to any previous day to retry it or retry your current day if you are messing up alot, its not ""permadeath"" A great way to stay sharp and give you some moral choices to think about.

A Questioning of MoralsA fantastic idea for a game that was beautifully executed. From the drab hue of colors and overwhelming sense of desolation of the immigration booth that is your life, you are doing much more than just stamping passports. It is an endless cycle of looking for mismatch information, but all the while there are bits of other information to keep your interest yearning for more story. The constant tug of morals is ever present in the game as people from war-torn countries tell their sob stories and you have your own family to worry about in the process. Will you accept that bribe so your son can get that medicine he so desperatley needs? With so many choices and routes, the game offers 20 different endings, so the replay value is fantastic. For a mere 9.99, it is worth the purchase.			"

												Absolutely unique and amazing gem of a game. Despite the gameplay being tedious, which perfectly simulates the job being done by the player, it gives a huge sense of reward when everything goes smooth and let's your fret every time you have to take a decision. The graphics, the music and the UI are all studied to be simple and spartan, and to give the sense of oppression and lack of freedom typical of the situation being represented. Everything seems perfectly fitting in place. Absolutely recommended. "

												Honest review no hype.I can't play this game. I can't play because I know I can do better each time. This game is mental suicide for perfectionists. the game allows you to redo a level and branch off, the only problem is that each branch has to be connected, so if you played level 1-9 and wanted to go back and do level 2 better, you'd have to start a new branch at 2 stemming from #1 and all progress would be on another save for 3-9. that's the old 3-9, you need to play a new one.For this reason I hate this game. But I love its style, I love it's story, I love Jorji, and I love to play it.I will never finish it, and that makes me angry.DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A PERFECTIONIST.GLORY TO ARSTOZKA, GLORY TO THE ARSTOZKA ARS KICKERS.

												Another really unique simulation game, unlike any other game I have played. As terrible and messed up as it is, it actually gives some serious insight into the dark side of corrupt government and border control. Also, it's fun.You will find yourself actually caring about the decisions you make: should you let in the person with incorrect documents who pleads with you to join her husband, and take the violation for it? Will you take bribes? What makes everything so much more fun and stressful is that you are extremely poor and your family is dying, so the bribes really do make a difference; and you also get paid based on how many people you get through in a day, which puts a lot of pressure on you to move through them quickly.A truly unique experience; major props to the creators of this game.

												Glory to Arstotzka.No, really, this game is actually something unique. And not unique in a bad way, nor is it unique in let's-try-to-be-unique-in-a-way-everyone-has-already-done-but-with-a-different-theme kind of different. COUGH EIGHTY PERCENT OF DAMN INDIE GAMES OUT THERE COUGH. Papers, Please is quite relaxing and, in my honest opinion, gives a really nice feel of the 80's dictatorship and misery of the Eastern Europe. The game is as short as maybe 3 hours per average run if you're not speed stamping, but there are so many choices to be made that it comes with 20 different endings and great replayability. Your choices also seem to matter, and there are a few unique events with sort of a background story.If you're able to get it really cheap and can also enjoy games like Solitaire without a need of killstreaks and car chases in it - just go for it.

												Very cool game with a unique concept: You are an immigration inspector.This game is so incredibly simple and clever. You can play the game entirely just with the mouse but most of the work is done with your brain. You need to verify immigrants' elligibility for entry in the glorious fictional country of Arstotzka and trust me, it should be verified.You'll need to make sure that everyone's papers are in order. What's interesting is that you have to physically manage the immigrant's papers and yours and your space is limited. You'll quickly realize that it's fairly easy to deny entry to someone after finding a blatant mistake (Names don't match, passport is expired, passport ID doesn't match, immigrant is clearly NOT female... Or is she?). However, what's the most worrisome is when you cannot find anything wrong, because chances are there is.You have a limited amount of time to pass as many immigrants as you can. Then, at the end of each day, you need to pay for rent, heat and food for your whole family. The game is rather cruel and you will most likely break even each day if you do alright... Otherwise you might not be able to afford heat and food, in which case your family will start starving and getting sick and eventually everybody will be dead.The game has a really cool and unique style and feeling, the music is very cool (although most of the gameplay is silent). You'll have a good amount of play time if you're going for full completion, there is a story and several choices and outcomes. You will most definitely improve and get a sense of progression as you play. Going back to the earlier days in the game is a joke once you've completed the game once.I would say that anyone who likes managing stuff, using their brain, Spot the difference games etc. should get this game, whether it's on sales or not.

												Quite a game. Everybody in the reviews is talking about the choices it puts you through, so I'll try to be a little different.The game is so simple, yet complex at the same time. As you advance you have more paperwork, more stuff to check, you have to pay attention to every tiny detail and you can still see that stupid paper coming on your desk saying ""oh you didn't verify that, it was incorrect"". You have to manage money and juggle with it if you can't be fast at going through the people in line.I really like how there are different outcomes, coming from your choices and everything you did. There is not really a story behind the game on its own. It's not about the inspector, not about the paperwork, not about the people in line. It's about it as a whole. As I've seen somewhere, very well pointed out, it can be compared to the Wall of Berlin.Anyway. If you come here expecting a lot of action, I will be pretty straight forward with you. There is not much action and the gameplay is slow-paced. I still recommend this, though, it is a nice game and really gets your concentration on point.			"

												A great game ! It not only plays in the 80's it also looks and sounds like a game from that era. You play a border-officer of a fictional Eastern Bloc country during the cold war. Your job is to check the passports of immigrants and to decide who to let in and who to refuse. What sounds pretty boring turns out to be a quite fun puzzle game mixed with some elements from adventure games. You have to compare travel documents with your regulations and look for failures. Over time not only the regulations become more complicated also you get more and more efficient in your job and learn what to look for. Everytime you find a deviation in somebody's documents you get some sense of achievement. When you make too many mistakes on the other hand  your salary will be cut short which will make your own survival and that of your family members harder. The whole experience lasts 30 in-game days and it is kept interesting while confronting you with a lot of decisions - not only who to refuse and who to let in. Some of the game's 8-Bit graphics and sounds are quite iconic - e.g. the sound of the bulletin you get when you make a mistake. All in all this game tries something new and was definitely an interesting experience for me. Recommended to all open-minded gamers !			"

--PROS--' Way more fun than I had anticipated. ' Replay value is quite high.' Great for those who want to focus.' Perfectly executed.' No glitches/bugs.' Requires a keen eye at all times.' Bulletin changes daily, so expect everything.' Decisions are hard to make, such as: money, working with EZIC, granting access or denial, and some others.' Music fits the atmosphere like a puzzle.' 20 different endings which require being careful/aware.' Terror attacks and checking those for weapons and/or contrabands. ' Wanted criminals add another element of alertness.--CONS--' The 'Unlimited' mode is extremely boring.' The only persuasive story was the man and his murdered daughter - everything else left no impact. 9.5/10.0			"

												This game is ingenious. It actually feels like you are working an increasingly tougher job, and it's really quite stressful. However, in terms of originality, and sheer innovation, it is a brilliant game. Much like a real job, Papers, Please is best played alongside a friend or two, and it helps to delegate inspection duties within the group. Do this, and you'll have some crazy times managing Arstotzka's border. It is a game full of surprises, and it nails the dystopian, Orwellian atmosphere perfectly. The art style fits well There is a real sense of immersion, right from the start, as you start learning the things you NEED to know, to do your job. And of course, just learning your job is not enough, as things constantly change, making your job harder and less bearable. Again, just like real life!You'll want to start by learning the game's geography: neighbouring countries, and the major cities within each one. And since everything here is fictional and fantasy, you NEED to pay attention. There are things to learn, and you really need to organise yourself to work effectively. Otherwise you soon find yourself unable to buy medicine for your child, and your mother-in-law won't like you anymore (not sure she ever did, tbh). The game is quite frankly, amazing. It feels like hard work, and it feels just as rewarding...and sometimes just as punishing...Either way, you'll always have a memorable experience whenever you play this.			"

												I often think about what games can do that other forms of art can't. Is there actually any added value in interaction? After playing Papers, Please, the answer is a million times yes. This is a game where you're tasked with running a border checkpoint. You check passports, verify personal information, and follow a routine set of rules to make sure a person's paperwork is in order. That might sound boring, but it's incredibly challenging as more and more rules are passed down to you along the way.But what's so great here is how this tackles a real world issue. This is a game about immigration, which aims to make the player understand the complexity of the situation. Every day, you're tasked with emotionally intense situations. In my first hour or so with the game, I found myself continually staring at the screen upset and dumbfounded as to how I was supposed to handle certain things. Was I going to have to break up a family? How could I admit a known sex offender, but turn away so many others? It's heavy, but I think that's where its strength reveals itself. We can read about immigration all day and debate about it like we're experts. But very few of us will actually ever be in a situation where we have to deal with the gravity of it. Papers, Please gives players a chance to go into the role and see how it feels to bear those responsibilities. Is this a perfect substitute for actually working in immigration? Obviously not. But that level of interaction makes it more effective than a movie in many regards.But it's not simply good for the statement it makes. The core mechanic at play here is brilliant, turning paperwork into a difficult puzzle game. And while this could have been a quick 3 hour, 1-play game, it's packed with a surprising amount of replayability. Within an hour, I actually restarted the game entirely because I wasn't satisfied with my decisions. And even when I finished the game, I still felt like I could have done better. The game features 20 endings, and getting the best ones require a lot of skill and a sharp memory.I can't recommend this highly enough. This is, without a doubt, one of the best games I have ever played. It's bold, intelligent, emotionally engaging, and fun (when it's not completely crushing your soul). This is how gameplay can enrich our lives, rather than just serve as a fun distraction from them.(Note: I received this as a gift from a friend, though I would have bought this myself in a heartbeat.)

												Introduction:Paperwork, the worst kind of work you will ever face once you get a job, it's boring, tedious and can make a man/woman insane. So how can a game about paperwork be one of the BEST games I've ever played?!It's a game that requires a good eye for detail, patience and vigilance (no slacking!) This is a game that is both simple and complex at the same time.PROS:+ Immersive: - Unlike other games where you feel detached from the characters, Papers, Please will really really make you feel like you're there making a difference.+ Consequence based Story: - The story, if you look at it from a distance, is simple. Yet each and every decision you make affects the overall story. The morality system in this game is one of the best I've seen as of late.+ Simple but effective Artstyle: - It's pixel art but it does the job well in conveying it's message. Most people would appreciate its simplicity.+ Surprisingly complex mechanic: - The game is not a simple approve and reject kind of thing. Each and every aspect of the unique immigrants who tries to enter needs to be inspected (from the face, the name, the weight, height, place of origin etc.). The game WILL know if you missed something and promptly gives you a citation for it.CONS:- Story is a bit short: - It would have been best if the story was stretched out more than it did. Although an endless mode is unlocked, I still think more side stories, more in-game events and more time could have been added. It has a lengthy gameplay, don't get me wrong.- Needs more sound: - The base music in this game is good and does its job well. I do feel they should add a wee bit more. Not a whole orchestra, but an alternative to the usual thing.CONCLUSION:""Don't Judge a Game because of it's graphics"" is a phrase that would wholly apply to Papers, Please.It's a great game for a good price and a good re-playability and experience value.MUST HAVE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												English------------Deutsch""The penalty is death"" ..NEXT!Papers, Please is what you'd call a paperwork simulator or somehow a political satire that parodies eastern european-sounding names. No offense intended. You're a simple men, trying to pay his bills and feed his family. Who thought checking passports would be so much fun? And not only passports, entry and work permissions, ID cards, diplomatic authorizations and scanning people for drugs and weapons or to clear the gender confusion (sometimes troubling).

Glory to Arstotzka!++ one of the most simple, yet atmospheric games I've ever played.++ simple, but lovely retro graphics++ interesting gameplay and an enormous challenge as the law/rules change almost every day++ interesting and goofy characters++ sometimes/every day you feel like a racist++ different endings-- even with more rules it's repetitive as HELL-----------------------------------------------------------------------""The penalty is death"" ..NEXT!Papers, Please ist, wie ich und viele andere es bezeichnen würden, ein Paperwork Simulator oder je nachdem wie man es betrachtet eine politische Satire, die osteuropäisch klingende Namen parodiert.

Wer hätte gedacht dass Pässe kontrollieren so viel Spaß machen könnte? Und nicht nur Pässe, sondern auch Einreise sowie Arbeitsgenehmigungen, Personalausweise, diplomatische Dokumente usw. und dazu die Scannung von verdächtigen Personen nach versteckten Drogen und Waffen, oder um Ungereimtheiten beim Geschlecht zu klären (eindeutige Identifizierung ohne Hilfsmittel manchmal schwierig).

												I do recommend this game... If you're able to tell apart minute details.I have a sharp mind and it is so easy to miss one tiny detail.You sit in a claustrophobic office, with a tiny desk. Your job starts off easy. Arstotzkans only.Within a matter of in game days though... You get piled with countless pieces of paper. ID cards, fake information, work slips, entry tickets, contraband, the full vindaloo. And you have very little help. It's not big enough to fit everything on the desk and to even think about making it through a week.Then you have EZIC, your family, people desperate to get through, sob stories, aggressive people.. But you have no choice but to stamp a big red X on their passport, sending them to their doom or stay in their problematic county...Your family, food, heat, rent... Medicine if things get bad and death. The game is moral questioning and you really begin to feel the effects of what you're really doing. You can't slow down either, you need to keep pumping out those papers... Otherwise everyone suffers for it.This game is ultimately the definition of a hard life. Class 8 living, a family to care for, a busy border line and all you have is an acceptance and denial stamp to your name. This is meant to be depressing. And it definitely hits home.Glory to Arstotzka.			"

												Papers Please is a very unusual game. I’m not even sure how I can describe it effectively.You play as a dude who checks passports for a fictional communist country. Sounds boring right? But so much drama happens. People try to bribe you, they tell you their sob stories, they try to smuggle weapons and drugs, your superiors are eager to punish you for any mistake you make, terrorists ask you for your help in overthrowing the government (and you can!), and if you mess up, either your family will starve, you’ll be arrested, or you might just die in a terrorist attack. There’s tons of different endings, and all of your actions have far-reaching consequences.I used a walkthrough, because I didn’t find the gameplay very fun, I just wanted to experience the story. But I think the gameplay is supposed to NOT be fun. It’s supposed to be really stressful, and to put you in the shoes of the character you play. And maybe I cheapened the experience a bit by using that walkthrough. Oh well.Anyway! The story was intense! It makes you really think about what effect your actions will have on others and yourself.			"

												You might not believe it but Paper Please is one of the best game I have played. Let me tell you why.In the game you are a dude that has been assigned a job at the border. Your task is to check the people going in your country, and see whether or not their papers are in order. Simple enough eh? Yeah, that's what I thought at first too.The first day you will have to check passports only. Yeah, check the dude's face, see if matches the photo in the passport, check if the date of birth is valid and stuff like that.It will take time for you to check stuff and make sure you did not miss anything. And here is the whole game challenge: time management. You see, every dude you process gives you money. If you take too much time analyzing papers you will process less people so you get less money.At the end of the day you have to pay for the rent, for food and heat. Yeah, there is that side of the game too. Your child might get a cold so you will have to buy medecine. It costs a lot. So much that you will have to switch between a day with food and a day without, but with the heaters on. Sad but true.The game goes very deep in the story; there actually is a strong narrative. Between your family life that shows how poor your country is, you will read the newspaper at the beginning of the day. It gives mandatory information like which country is at war (so that means immigrants leaving that said country) and criminals that are unnacounted for (they could show up at your booth... eh who knows right?)The more you progress in the game, the more papers you will have to check. First passport then work permit. Yeah too many immigrants are ""stealing our jobs"" so the government tells you to check work permits too now. Oh but some countries don't need those, but just a coupon instead. Yeah, we also forgot diplomatic papers and vaccination crap. Oh, this country refuses to import our goods? Today we'll teach 'em a lesson: do not accept work permit from THIS country only. Oh yeah? Some people are trying to smuggle shït? Here, now you get a scanner. Check for weapons and drugs. Don't miss anything.""Hmmm sir, it is written here you are a woman...?""""Yes I am, as you can see.""""Uh, ok, please step into the scanner please.""[Bzzzzz] Scanner picture shows tïts and püssy.""Okay, si-I mean ma'am, all your papers are in order, have a good day.""""Thank you.""True story. However this scanner stuff takes TIME. So during this process you will quickly take the habit to process other papers. Yeah optimization man, I gotta feed my family man.Oh, you think that game's boring? Not at all. It's a challenge.To feed your family you will have to sometimes skip checks. Sometimes you will genuinely forget to check something, like is there day 31 in February...? Uhoh. You have a blame if you let someone in with wrong/forged papers, or if simply there was something weird but you did not ask the dude for precisions.Looking at that dude walking in the country, not being sure you checked everything. You feel like you missed something but you don't know what... dude is still walking... and... he passes. No warning, no blame. Looks like he was legit afterall. [Breath of relief]Too many warnings and you will have money penalty. Less money for your family. They will get sick, starve and die. Think about your kid, his birthday is coming very soon. You would like to buy him a present yeah? Then you gotta work faster. Stop looking into your help book if said city is really part of that country: learn it by heart. Same goes for the logos: learn them by heart so you won't waste time checking them in the help book.Indeed, your are provided with a small book that contains everything you need to know about countries surrounding yours and valid logos and stuff. My advice: learn everything by heart as this will prevent you from going back and forth clicking on the pages and checkings stuff out.Still seems boring to you? Gotta learn stuff by heart are you crazy man?Okay, my final argument: this game will improve you memory.Trust me at first you will be lost, you will not have work habits. But the more you play, the more efficient you will become. Grab that passport and directly put it right below the overhead stamp machine. So if the guy is okay, just stamp. It will go right on the right page. No need to fiddle the passport around to stamp it after you have checked it.Same goes for the information. Be fast but not TOO fast. Your brain will overdrive. Check the date... damn what's today's date? Yeah we are Friday, gotta remember dat. Damn, did he just say he wanted to work? I don't have the work permit. Oh shït no, today his country doesn't need a work permit but just a coupon... See now? Everything you will have to check will make your brain work.Remembering procedures that change everyday is tough. Nah, no coupon today. Yeah today we don't let those guys pass at all. Remember that. Hell, remember the people you've processed too.""Papers please.""""Oh hello. Have you seen my husband? He was a couple people before me in line...""""Uhoh ma'am, you are missing a stamp here, I can't let you in.""""PLEASE, please they will kill me if you don't let me in! It's war in my country!""""Yeah but... I go a family you see... I--""""I beg of you, let me pass, let me meet my husband on the other side. Please!""""....""What will you do? Will you help people? Is she, really his wife? Could be a whôre yeah? A terrorist? Wait I think she has the same last name as this ""husband"". Hmmm.Hard choices. Impossible decisions. Meeting people you see regulary at the border, having arrangements with gards to earn extra money. Taking bribes? Hmm risky...Remember, remember that dude. Remember dates, remember criminals, remember to check the name on the vaccination paper, remember to give that business card to engineer people, remember to give that other business card to construction worker... yeah that will give you extra bucks and is not illegal. But you gotta remember. Gotta remember a lot of things.The last levels of the game are... very hard. I just couldn't play more than a couple levels so overheated my brain was.Though choices to make, and many unofficial ""things"" to do at the same time. And, the clock's ticking. Work hard to save your family. Don't screw up and remember.Remember.Now I cannot tell you everything you will have to check and remember. Part of the game is to actually make mistakes and learn from them. Also there is a real story. I did spoil you a little bit with the dialogs above but it's nothing much.I really strongly recommend the game. It's art.			"

												Papers, Please. How appropriate for me to play this while I keep thinking of what's currentlly going on in the naiton. I feel like a punk denying poor innocent citizens trying to get in for a better llife. But hey! Wait a second! I have a family to feed and they need medication (for some reason about every night, or is that slang for booze) and heat! What a bunch of leechers! As a document border control agent, it is your job to exam papers immigraants and citizens bring in. The rules become increasingly more difficult and it almost begins to seem like you are literally working as a document controller. Next time I'm going through the airport I'll not only hand him my passport, but my vaccinations and lifestory.  And lets be real here, irl more than half of the population would be lying about their weight on that ID card. The game is addictive as are most chain games, but there is a story end (or 20 of them) depending on how you play. I definetly recommend it! "

												...Wow.This is like rapid-fire Phoenix Wright. You have to check dozens of immigrants for contradictions in their paperwork, and determine whether they’re accepted or rejected. You’re paid (poorly) for however many passports you stamp correctly. If you don’t perform well, your family will die of sickness or starvation, or you’ll get arrested for going into debt. (Yes, going into debt is illegal now.)But it’s a game that’s less about how well you check papers, and more about why you’re checking papers. You won’t get very far before the story starts getting really complicated, and you’ve got to start making some tough ethical decisions. Are you a true patriotic Arstotzkan, willing to uphold the law to the letter? Are you only in it for your family, willing to take juicy bribes from illegal smugglers? Or are you willing to help the shadow cult overthrow the Arstotzkan government? This game files in the face of everyone who’s ever said that story and gameplay can’t be the same thing. It really makes you feel like you’re shaping the fate of a nation, or succumbing to it, just by sitting in a booth and deciding who gets across the border.			"

												Have you ever fancied being a border inspector? Me neither. Papers, Please grants you a chance to try it anyway.The background is grim: you only got the job because of a lottery. Arstotzkan border is a busy place, all kinds of shady people trying to get into the country that gives out a communist vibe. You make sure their papers are in order by meticulously checking each bit of information for the smallest mistakes. You do this manually by eye. It doesn't help that each day the ministry announces new, subsequently more bizarre rules for you to follow.At first the user interface is confusing and it takes a while to get used to and see the logic behind. All the tutorial you'll get is in the instructions you're given each day. Interestingly, this adds to the all-encompassing dystopian feel that is well delivered by the pixelated graphics and ominous music.The story elements are brilliantly woven into the protagonist's role, served with dark humour: you often have to make moral choices by either admitting or denying desperate immigrants or whether you'll help the insurgents. You generally can't do everything because the salary comes from admitting immigrants and you are fined for mistakes.Keeping your family alive provides the motivation to keep doing a good job. Money is always tight and you have to manage your expenses after each day. Fortunately, being a border inspector in a corrupt country, you can make additional profit by accepting bribes and striking deals with the honest people you meet in your job.Each playthrough, one month of game time, lasts approximately 4 hours but to complete everything will require several playthroughs: there are three different ""winning"" endings and 20 different endings in total that depend on your choices and performance. Afterwards, there's the endless mode to pour hours into.Striking into a niche as small as it gets, Papers, Please does a tremendous job at providing an interesting and even amusing experience as a border inspector. If you have an eye for detail and fancy scrutiny and perfection, you'll probably love this game. Otherwise you might want to check some gameplay videos first - it is a niche game after all.			"

												Seeing this game pop up in Featured Games lately, I thought I'd write a review for everyone considering it.The game's concept is quite simple and a single playthrough takes just a few hours, most of the replayability comes from the many endings you can get depending on your actions through the ""month"".While the concept of the game may sound simple, the mechanics are challenging enough to make it hard to keep focus, often because of time constraints, but even more often because of routine and repetition, that will make you glance over ""minor"" details sooner or later if you're not careful.The storyline(s) will definitely make you want to complete the game more than once. Also, the atmosphere is quite convincing and immersive, great retro-style pixel art graphics too.All in all, definitely worth checking out.			"

Papers, please.What is the purpose of your trip?Probably, the most used phrase by border workers. Everyday they have to check the same documents and approve or deny them and this game gives you an opportunity to go through this experience.Overall, this game shows how border worked in USSR. Straightforward rules, cruel punishment for violating them and real life situations which makes you either break them or follow to the end.I've managed to complete this game in 4 hours and I really enjoyed it (it also have endless mode with leaderboard worldwide). Simple in style yet, it requires your full attention to detailes.Multiple choices with different endings, secret order of EZIC, sometimes shooting and a drop of humor making this game absolutely fantastic game experience I've ever had with an indie game. Totally worth it's price and time I've spent.Glory to Arstotzka! "

												""Papers, Please!"" is a weird game. At first you will say that the game is lame and boring. That developer wants you to work non-stop and just mocks you. But... ""The cowl does not make the monk"" as they say. If you try it, or watch a good review - you will see that the game is not only interesting, but helpful. It will test and train your attention, memory and managing of chaos. In small working area you must keep a bunch of different papers and find on them different errors. Know what city is in that country and how it is written, remember the rules. But don’t be afraid. The game is novice-friendly. You start with small and grow day by day. Game is in retro style and looks awful from the side, but it has some charm and an interesting and a branching story. You can finish the game with 20 different endings and a bunch of interesting meetings. Some moments can be funny, and some abusing. But still it can make you enjoy every single minute of gameplay.For Achievement lovers there are 13 of them, and they are not so hard to take. Store doesn’t says it, but game was updated with Collection Cards.I work in such direction and have enjoyed it. So I think you will enjoy it too. For me it’s a brilliant project. Have fun!			"

Papers, Please is a great little Indie game which doesn't take up much disk space and is actually very fun to play just to pass the time. The play style is almost casual, but there is also a story mode that can become quite difficult.My first impression of the game was mixed. I couldn't choose decisively if it was a good game or just decent game. I knew it had potential though and I did enjoy playing it. On the surface, Papers, Please may seem like an odd East-Berlin Checkpoint Guard Simulator, with pixel-styled graphics and nothing much more to do than stamp passports and analyze them. It seemed like it might be just one of those repetitive games that's fun to play every now and again...then I gave it a chance. Now, I must say that I do enjoy playing this game very much.As the story mode progresses, you'll begin to understand your role, equipment, and use of analytical skills more thoroughly. In addition to your job, at the end of the day when you collect your pay you must take care of your family by using a simple budget system of Rent, Food, and Medicine. If you cannot take care of your 4 family members (i.e they stay Cold, Sick, Hungry) they will die. Once you get a week or more into the story, this is when the real fun begins. Crazy things begin to happen at your checkpoint. From terrorist attacks to people trying to sneak in drugs to women whose passport says they're male (and they aren't lying). When it all started to get crazy, I decided that this game is not as simple as I first thought. It's a great game and it deserves a play from any Indie game fan.Pros:- A 'Story Mode' in addition to an 'Endless' Mode (Unlockable)- Doesn't take up much space on any computer (About 40 mb)- Interesting Pixel-style artwork- Incidents that happen randomly or according to the story- Use a range of given tools to perform interrogations (if necessary). These tools include a strip-search camera, discrepancy detectors, and the ever handy Newspaper & Rule Book.- Use the little money you make to keep your house heated and your family fed. If not, they'll starve and/or die. This is a fairly difficult objective considering your pay.- Addictive play- Fun story mode which will keep you wondering what the next day might bring.- 20 different possible endingsCons:- Some events in story mode will repeat themselves, but it helps to make to game flow along- The graphics were a turn off at first, but you get used to the style- There are only about 3 or 4 different sounds to represent the language (sounds like a mumbled mash of German and Russian). One of these sounds is ""Papers"" grumbled by your character.- A slight learning curve (which will dissapear after playing through the story mode for a few days)Verdict: - 6.5/10Papers, Please happens to be a really fun Indie jewel. There are various tools you use as a customs officer to help you identify or interrogate people whose documents, IDs, papers, etc. don't match. There's nothing much more I can add besides what I've written. I can safely recommend this game to people who are open minded, love indie games, or just like break from the usual high-graphic, PC melting games of the now.			"

												I knew nothing about this game beforehand except that you handle paperwork, which initially threw me off, as I can imagine happened with a lot of people. I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I read about it on a comment on Reddit talking about some of this game's immersive aspects and I had to check it out, it was on sale anyway. I was certainly not disappointed, though not as amazing and sandbox-like as I initially imagined from what I read, it's still top notch. The whole border inspector setup is a great storytelling device. You can for example purposefully incorrectly handle an immigrant, while the game doesn't specifically ask for you to do this, and notice the effects within the story, or notice it in the next day's newspaper. It's a branching story with 20! different endings. The story has both it's funny and serious moments, and keeps it well balanced. This game has a sense of humor within a dystopian setting, which I adore. Your 'health' in this game is basically your financial situation, being able to keep up with the bills and pay for food and your family's health. If they get sick, they need medicine, which costs money. There's no arbitrary bars or meters or anything, everything is explained within the story. This is what makes it immersive to me. The way you manage paperwork in this game is actually hilariously similar to real life. Real life shortcuts and organizational skills translate well into this game. I actually feel like being a border inspector at times, and it sounds weird to say that. XDStylistically, the pixel art represents the Soviet Union inspired architecture, iconography, typography, etc. really well with a fitting colorscheme.I recommend this game to anyone who is open minded towards new experimental gameplay ideas, as this is an interesting one. It certainly holds an aspect of challenge and rewards you for actually balancing accuracy and speed. The game becomes more challenging with time and the added challenge is explained within the story.In short: It's something different and innovating that's fun and challenging, quite immersive (if you still have your sense of imagination) and has a branching storyline that can both be funny (albeit often in a dark way) and serious at appropriate times.11/5 would buy again. Great example of a great indie game.			"

												I don't know why this game works, but it does. 14 hours of gameplay in two days speak for themselves. Never in my life did I think I'd say ""hey, I want to go play bureaucrat some more"". Yet I did.Papers, please interweaves an addictive and unique gameplay mechanic (find the error in the applicant's submission papers) with an equally original storyline about the struggles of a man in a hypothetical post-war soviet nation. Totalitarism, rebellion, family and morality become parts of this story that, at times, will force you to make very difficult decisions. Help the lady needing surgery or go by the rules? Let the father get revenge for his murdered child or face a penalty that would leave your son without food tonight?But more importantly, the moment comes where you must make a decision despite your desire of staying neutral: will you be part of a subjugating regime, or of the rebelious movement that dares stand against it?

												I'm not really sure what to say. This game has a shocking amount of content, despite its Atari appearance. You wouldn't expect more than fifteen minutes of ""Person who works at the DMV, yet occasionally shoots people"" simulation. (Okay, admittedly, I'd give that a try too.) Instead, you have not only moral choices, as you decide what foreign powers enter your country to affect your draconian government, but even difficult straight-forward ones. This game is very challenging late-game, due to the sheer amount of beuracracy you have to account for, even if you wanted to be a perfect citizen.Taking a leaf from Dwarf Fortress, the only choice you really have...is how you lose. :PI recommend playing this game in short, controlled bursts.

												One popular criticism of this game is that it is unbelievably boring.  These people are missing the point.Yes, this game is unlike many other video games because it is poignant and is attempting to make some very serious social commentary.Briefly, you are a customs agent for a country vaguely reminiscent of Cold War era Russia.  Your job is to check the paperwork of all people attempting to enter your country.  Those who check out are permitted to enter and the rest are either rejected or detained.Your job is only part of the story.  After work every day you struggle to provide food, heat, and medicine for your family.  You can make more money if you process paperwork faster but this often results in mistakes and fines threatening to send you into debt or worse.This game is not like a restaurant worker simulator because it has a clear message.  Well, even the restaurant simulators are maybe suggesting you have some empathy for overworked servers.This game makes a more serious point:  Border crossings are dehumanizing for both those attempting to cross as well as for the employees.  Those travelling are subject to invasive searches, embarassing questions, endless lines, and the potential for political violence against their persons.  The employees in turn begin to treat the travellers not as humans but as cattle or a meal ticket.  These workers must carry out the often arbitrary regulations of their country in a way that often divides famliers and destroys lives.This is not a game that one can play forever.  It is good for a couple play throughs and maybe a little exploration of the bonus modes.  It does not take very long to get to the heart of this game.  After a short time of playing you will start to feel hollow inside.  And that is the point.I cannot think of a game that has engaged the hearts and minds of players to contemplate very real political problems in this way.  In closing, the game is not fun.  The game is terrible.  And this is the point.			"

												For some reason I felt some sort of obligation to play this game. I wanted to play it, but almost because I felt like I was supposed to. So in some ways I wasn't really looking forward to the game itself, more like checking it off of some non-existent list. I'm unsure where this feeling came from, but considering the sale I figured I had to finally try it out. I'm glad I did.Papers, Please is described as a “A Dystopian Document Thriller"", which introduces the general setting but doesn't tell me much at all about how the game plays. Basically you are a new worker at a border checkpoint, responsible for maintaining security for your nation within the small role you have. At first you are just checking for minor discrepancies for incoming foreigners and returning natives, allowing those in who check out and turning those away who don't have everything in line. Meanwhile, you have a small family to bring home your wages to, making sure to keep on top of rent and heat and food so that they can at least survive in a not-ideal situation. The game is segmented into days over the course of a month, allowing for bite-size play sessions, and each serves as a savepoint from which you can retry in case you don't care for a certain outcome. However, for each day that passes, the layers of complexity multiply, at first slowly and then the gameplay becomes increasingly more complex as the month heads towards its conclusion. While the first and most obvious way this manifests itself is the degree to which you have to use the information (documents) available to identify good and bad immigrants, the underlying ""dystopian"" going-ons come further and further into the light until the game's sudden conclusion, which highly varies depending on your in-game decisions. Throughout the month you'll have to make moral judgments about whether to aid people who earnestly require you to bend the rules, or whether to take no nonsense and abide to the letter of the law while forsaking the goodwill (and generous bribes) of those you figuratively crush under your unrelenting bureaucratic boots. The end result is a lot of decision making, in which the right answer is not immediately obvious. It does allow you to roleplay to some degree, whether you make decisions as you yourself would, or whether you shoot for the fewest citations possible, or getting away with as many bribes as possible. Needless to say, the game suits itself to many, many replays.It's quite astonishing how quickly and strongly this game sucked me in. ""Just one more day"" became quite the excuse to keep playing regardless of how late it got or whether I originally intended to do something else. Before I knew it I had a couple family members sitting in front of the monitor, lending their eyeballs to double check what I might have missed "

												A fresh, new concept brought to you once again by the indy scene.  You work as an immigration checkpoint employee checking the legitimacy of people's legal documents before determining if they can pass, be denied or even detained.  You're expected to move people through the checkpoint as quickly as possible to achieve optimal pay to provide for your family, as well as make several tough moral choices along the way, bribes included, all the while the checkpoint policies change and expand almost daily.  It manages to be engaging while also making a point about the difficult, flawed and corrupt immigration system we see today, and how you choose to run your shifts each day will result in 1 of 20 different endings.  It's affordable and worth up to 10 hours of gameplay, so if you enjoy the point and click adventure type games, I would not pass this one up if I were you.			"

												I recommend this game because of its mechanics. It literly makes you feel like a cold person (atleast it did to me). As i played the game i had to go through lots of difficult choices that could alter my story line and others. I also had to continuously mantain my family (or not). The game did not go easy as it continued to get more and more difficult but it did not lack the example of a sensitive environment. A simple choice could have destroyed my life. It amused me to see people attempt to enter the country with lack of proper paperwork since i mostly ended up detaining them and screaming TERRORIST!!.

												Yah so you're probably thinking ah yes a new review. Wrong. This is just a random pavlova recipe cos you are probably hungry after surfing the reviews.Ingredients4 egg whites (5 if you are using small eggs)250g pure icing sugar or fine castor sugar, sifted½ teaspoon white vinegar1 tablespoon cornflour, siftedMethod1. Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius.2. Prepare a baking tray by placing baking paper on it. Put a little melted butter or vegetable oil spray on the tray so that the paper will stay in one place while you are spooning the pavlova mix on to it.3. Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites on a medium setting until soft peaks form.Once soft peaks appear, add the sugar all at once and beat the mixture for a minute or so on full speed. Do not stop the machine to add the sugar. It needs to be a continuous process to trap as much air as possible in the egg whites. You'll see the mixture change texture almost immediately, from loose, soft peaks to a more glossy, meringue-style mixture.4. Turn the mixer up to high until the mixture thickens and the sugar has completely dissolved. It needs to reach the ribbon stage – when a spoonful of the meringue mixture poured back into the bowl sits on the surface like a ribbon.5. Slow the machine, add the vinegar and let the beaters make three rotations, then remove the bowl from the mixer.6. Sprinkle the cornflour over the egg white mixture and, using a clean spatula, gently fold in the cornflour – no more than six folds.7. Spoon the mix on to the prepared tray and mould it into the shape you want. Kabboord prefers to leave it pretty heaped. Don't mess with the mix too much, though, as you want to get it in the oven quick smart. The other option is to use a preheated and lined tray. Speed is the key here.8. Place the tray in the middle of the oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 120 degrees Celsius. Don't use the fan.9. Cook for 80-90 minutes but don't let the pavlova colour. You may see a little sugar syrup seep out of the bottom but the crust should be firm. Inside, it will be soft and marshmallowy.10. Cool to room temperature and decorate using quark, Meredith goat's curd or mascarpone (cream is boring!) and your favourite toppings, such as chopped summer fruit or passionfruit custard.Enjoy! (And the game) "

												I recommend it to everyone. I also give the warning that this game doesn't really have ""play."" It just puts you behind a desk and demands that you do the same action over and over again. With growing levels of complexity. I dislike paperwork. I also dislike customer service. Papers, Please has both of these things. Also, it forces you to make difficult decisions. Every day. It's a game that I struggle quitting and a game that drains me of energy.  It forces you to pay attention and repeat the same action over and over again. It feels like it won't ever end. It's a game worth playing.  "

There are even story arcs with some characters or groups that come by every day.Balancing doing your job, making sure your family can eat, and not being a jerk is the real challenge. Do you let in the immigrant wanting to go to their husband and risk a fine, or do you block everyone with the wrong papers?THIS is what independent games are all about, you'll never see games like this from a big studio.

												Papers please is a communist border guard simulation game where the player must admit or deny civilians. Players must check and double check papers provided by the people seeking admittance.    The core gameplay of papers please relies on the players perception of the paperwork itself. Players must examine each paper to confirm authenticity of provided forms including, passports, work forms, entry permits and identifications. The player will have to keep a sharp eye out for things like forged documents, discrepancies in information, expired documents and potential smugglers.Papers please has an extremely rich story, with 20 different possible endings. These endings can be achieved depending on the players decisions in certain situations. The story revolves around a revolution brewing in the country and the player can choose to help or hinder said revolution in various ways. Papers please does a lot right:Fantastic storyEasy achievements Well designed gameplay Humble but effective art and sound designPapers please does a few things wrong: Can become boring Can be considered hard for some The game could end abruptly from one of the many endings Papers please is a fantastic story driven ""casual"" game. For the price of $10.99CND it's a good price to those gamers who enjoy a good story with solid but relaxed gameplay.			"

												At first, the game seems simple. You stamp passports. But then, you must check tickets, then entry permits, then work passes, then terrorists come and next thing you know, you're going to check 7 different papers in one little screen. Some security, huh? Soon some organization comes and from there, things spiral out of control. That's the story portion. Then, once you're done, there is endless mode, which is pretty much what the title suggests, it's endless. But, there's not just one endless mode, there are, in a sense, 12 different modes you can choose from. You can choose what type of papers to check, and the style on how you want to play. Very early on in the game, the game requires you make a major choice, thus meaning the game has a lot of replayability. Also, there are over 20 endings, which also add to the replayability. But, in order to do that, you have to make choices that may or may not affect gameplay. These endings can be endings that are refreshing, to just plain morbid endings. Sometimes, you don't even know you got an ending until the next day or few days after.Although you meet people who talk in the form you will see a lot, there are some characters that have very special dialogue, or who are very memorable, like Jorji Costova, for example. He comes early on as a guy who has no papers, and every time he comes, he seems to be one step behind. That, to me, is something that is memorable, as every time I see him, I think, ""Jorji! What's wrong this time?"". The only problems I have with this game are the discrepancies. Although mostly clear on what to do, sometimes when looking out for criminals, someone comes to the booth, and you highlight the man's face with the criminal's, and it says, ""NO CORRELATION"" even though they look identical! But, other than that, I really have no complaints! Of course, someone might think differently, but that's my opinion on the matter.The graphics are really crappy, on first glance, but it is very efficient and to me, this says, ""Just because a game has good graphics, doesn't mean a game is good."" And the opposite, ""Just because a game has bad graphics, doesn't mean that the game is utter crap."" I personally like the graphics, as they really match my stylings for this type of game. They are very simple and neat, and the slip screen is a really neat concept to me.This game is amazing. 9.3/10 No doubt.			"

												Papers, Please ReviewPapers, Please is a game about paperwork. Papers, Please is a game about 12 hour work days living life paycheck to paycheck. Papers, Please should not sound like a good game, and in theory it shouldn’t be. But Papers, Please is not just a good game, it is a great game. You play as a border guard in the fictional country of Arstotzka, your job is to control the flow of immigrants and exterminate all who try and cheat the system. You must care for a family of 5 and your pay is very little. Mistakes are not tolerated and every error will be deducted from the small amount of money you are given. It is very easy to starve to death in Papers, Please; death and insignificance play a large part in the overall theme of the game. You are not the hero, you are not important, if you fail to live up to expectations you will be replaced in a matter of hours. The heavy themes that Papers, Please possess are what make the experience so great, its depictions of war in the 20th century are expressed so well in the colorless background. There isn’t a single happy thought in Papers, Please. The whole game has a depressing feel to it, but this is what the creator was aiming for. He wasn’t trying to make a fantasy where everything is good and right in the world; his approach is honest and sinister.The sensational achievement that is Papers, Please art design is not enough on its own to be worth playing, but with the addition of its intriguing gameplay mechanics and consistent challenge makes for a level of enjoyment other artistic games miss, Papers, Please is not great because of its perfection at simulating paperwork, or its ability to depict gruesome settings and artistic impurity. It is great because it can balance the two elements so well and make for an experience like no other.Papers, Please proves that a game doesn’t need a million dollar budget and a team of thousands of developers to be good. Papers, Please was made by one man and standing up there with the biggest games of 2013. Papers, Please is the result of artistic brilliance and will be remembered and celebrated for many years to come.			"

												Papers Please!: A VERY addicting game. You're forced to work as an inspector, which basically is a person that confirms another person's documents to get into the GREAT country of Artstotska. So, let's begin!Graphics: 8/10, this game is meant to be a more low quality of a game because the game developers were focusing in on that fast paced gameplay and a very fun indie-type game with the graphics.Gameplay: 10/10, By far one of the best games I have ever played. Endless choices with everybody treated as themselves. Not repetitive at ALL. New characters appear almost everyday with their own background. Unlike other games, this game treats the little less important details as if they are the most important aspect of the game. WARNING: This game is emotional. Many characters want to enter this great country if it means to see a family member, tend to their sickness, or just get in and begin shooting all of your guards, you never know what's going to happen next. There is a total of 20 endings attatched to the game which is all based off of your decisions to let in or reject indivisuals. This game is very plot-based and random and at the end, everything gets pieced together. Also, it's extremely difficult to provide for your own family in this game, feed your son,mother in law, wife, and more as the story progresses OR, you can choose to kill them and keep the wealth to your own self.Addiction: 7/10, This game most of the times as soon as you beat it, you're done and over with. That's how I at first felt until I went back into it and tried out the alternate endings. This varies between the type of person you are, a person that's once you beat it, it's over. Or once you beat it, you try it again but with different responses.Sounds: 10/10, All sounds are incorperated into this game, such as the background people that're talking, and the sirens and etc. Everything is there which greatly helps the quality of this game.Music: 10/10, The music right as you go into the game is FENOMENAL. I have the song stuck in my head for hours. Really great work.Lag: No lag, it's a single player game, doesn't run too many scripts for it to lag your computer.Overall: 10/10. Really great game. Worth the money. I would play it for DAYS.			"

												Papers, Please is simply an amazing game. The graphics style is very good at capturing the ambiance of the late Cold War era in the USSR area. You become very attached to even minute characters, like a guard named Sergiu. It is extremely satisfying when you find discrepencies, but when you hear the noise of a citation, your heart wants to explode in angrivation. Nonetheless, it is a great game with humour, sadness, action, and suspense, and it is highly recommended.			"

												This game is so obviously Cold War. Takes place in 1986. Takes place in the east half of a city that is split between two countries with radically different politcal points of view. Straight out of Berlin, Germany.GAMEPLAY: Fast paced, intreging, and intentionally repetative, while also constantly changing. A fairly paced game. 83/100MUSIC: Beside the menu, and some cutscenes, their isn't any music. However, this fits the game, and the music fits the theme when used. 87/100GRAPHICS: Intentionally pixelated, so nothing really to complain about. A beautifully simplistic style that is reminiscent of soviet propaganda. 90/100STORY: It's a great change of pace when you play as a character that isn't some outspoken moral hero. You are just a guy that does very little. It shows that anyone in any position has a great deal of influence on the world as a whole. It's very interesting. 93/100CONCLUSION: It's a cheap game that is worth more than it costs. Pick it up if you'd like, as I strongly suggest you would. It's a great game. 89/100			"

												A harrowing tale of a dystopian totalitarian government in a failed soviet state. It has a story on par with Orwell, but hits a little closer to home, sparking apt comparisons to the TSA's policies. The game has fun, challenging, and unique game play that asks you to make difficult moral choices almost every minute. However as you play it through multiple times for different endings you may find that a few characters feel a little copy pasted. However if you can look past that the game is almost flawless. A unique art style, off beat sound track, stellar story, and one of a kind game play all add up to make Papers, Please a must.			"

												I don't often come across the video-game equivalent of a period film. That might be due to the fact that it's kind of dumb to compare two different mediums based on genre, but I digress. Papers, Please places you in the role of a border-control worker under a fascist regime in the 1980s that's eerily similar to the Soviet Union. Your job is to inspect the paper work presented by immigrating people and catch discrepancies and/or forgeries. The amount of people you deal with determines your paycheck, which adds a certain degree of urgency to the game. When you're not working, you're also managing your expenses in order to keep your family members healthy and, well, alive. If you make mistakes and turn away or allow people in based on incorrect paper work, you're eventually docked from your pay. The problem is, though, that a lot of the people trying to get into Arstotska have heart-felt stories to tell... and full wallets. You'll be offered bribes from desperate immigrants, your colleagues, and even a rebel group trying to overthrow the government.This is actually an extremely complex and engrossing game. The amount of paperwork you have to inspect changes entirely or increases as the game progresses. You're constantly learning new ways to inspect for forgeries; non-matching birth dates, weight, issuing city, gender, photos, fingerprints, etc. You learn to be overly-meticulous in your inspections as well as lightning-quick. I actually started to call old ladies names because they were wasting my time with forgeries. I could be dealing with two more people in the time that I'm spending clearing up your discrepancies, you idiot!Where a lot of other games might force you into the position of a daring hero with the aims to take down authoritarian governments head-on, Papers, Please demonstrates the tension and risk involved with everyday living under a realistic representation of fascism. I can't think of a single other game that tries to be historically accurate as well as give an honest depiction of what life for the bourgeois would be like in this sort of place and time. It's this level of immersion that contributes to a beautifully written narrative and abundance of side stories, as well. The gameplay is the story, and ultimately if you do your job right you come to feel overly invested in the well-being of your family and the people you encounter on the job. The game plays like a dream, too. I was able to drag everything around my desk and inspect literally every aspect of the paper work without a single lapse in responsiveness, which may have been on account of the pixelly-8bit art style. Like everything else in this game, though, the visuals are purposeful and contribute to the game's bleak atmosphere.Play Papers, Please! Play it!			"

												This is a game you need to play to fully appreciate - screenshots do not do it justice.  Think 'hidden object game' crossed with 'time management game' in a depressing Soviet landscape.It is a truly ingenious puzzle game at it's core and the dreary art style is a perfect fit.  You play as a border guard tasked with checking passports and visas and ultimately deciding who gets to enter the country.  It eases you into the game gently enough that anyone can play the first few rounds, but it quickly gets devilishly difficult as the rules and regulations for entering the country become more and more complex.  Accuracy and speed become factors if you care at all about feeding your family and protecting them from the bitter cold - you could always let them starve or freeze of course...  The game goes so far as to make you face moral dilemmas, it creates a sort of paranoia where you trust no one and even begin to question your own intentions.Once I started playing, it was really difficult to stop and I would highly recommend trying this game if you like detail oriented puzzle games.  There's an overarching story that's actually quite interesting. It does get repetitive, but the variation between levels and the difficulty factor is enough to keep you entertained for a good while!			"

Recommended: A strangely-compelling game, Papers Please tells an intriguing story of a backwater communist nation through the medium of passports and dialogue.  A little rough in the graphics, albeit intentionally so, and a bit of a niche game given the subject matter, but there really is no game like this one and on that token alone, it is assuredly worth giving a look.  Just watch out for a bit of a difficulty wall to press past, towards the end of the game.Read the full review on Highland Arrow here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												NEXT!Papers, Please...DETAIN!!!!How can a game about a border control booth be interesting? It's the characters involved. The premise is simple enough, point and click your way through documents making sure people have all the correct papers required to enter your glorious nation. Earn enough money to feed your family and keep them safe, and everything else is just secondary... or at least that's what you think.As you play through this game familiar faces are formed, characters and their stories start to become apparent and a small morality check starts to creep across your thoughts - do I keep my family safe or do I help this stranger out? This game might not be for all, as it's simple graphics and audio might put some people off, and it's not the most 'exciting' of games, however if you don't require constant action and zany cutscenes than you might find something different in Papers, Please. Jorji... dammit...			"

 PAPERS, PLEASE  If you're into checking papers and DETAINING people, this is the game for you! ^_^The first time I knew about this game was from my favorite youtuber. I wasn't interested on watching it at first, but when I gave it a try. I wasn't disappointed at all :D.Pros:1. Great choice of graphics, perfect for the setting.2. Cool characters like Jorji :D.3. Has multiple endings, each one is interesting.4. The EZIC is awesome!5. Has a challenging part, especially when you don't want to get Citations XD.The whole concept is really enjoyable and impressive.Con/s:1. Gets repetitive after sometimeOther/s:1.  When you encounter an immigrant that looks like a guy, but is actually a woman or vice versa. Don't be surprise XD 2.  Sergiu and Elisa = ^_^ <3 3. When they're mean, you just DENY! HAHA but when they are stubborn, you just have to DETAIN! (Though you may get a citation if there's nothing wrong with their papers) LOL Overall: 9.5/10 GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!			"

												This game is strangely compelling. Shuffling around paperwork, looking up rules, seals, and district names and eventually stamping passports sounds boring, but I'm mentally adding this to the list (along with Euro Truck Sim 2) of games that look/sound boring but are actually very engaging. There is a surprising amount of little side stories in the game that is given to you just through interaction with people at your checkpoint window. I highly recommend it if you like checking other people's paperwork for errors, or if you find satisfaction in denying service to someone who has been waiting in line for many hours. I also recommend it if you like unique games; this game is extremely unique and can be thought-provoking as well.			"

												Papers, Please lets you in the shoes of the Arstotzka's Immigration Inspector.In a strange way, this game is not only about checking the entrants and see if everything matches: while doing your job, you will meet different people and you will have to face different situations, according to what you do during the gameplay. For instance, you can either decide to help criminal organisations, with the risk of getting yourself jailed, or either stay loyal to your leaders, with the risk of remaining without food for your family because of your underpaid job. This unique Indie Game offers you a quite long and enjoyable gameplay, which is going to make you want to play it more and more, wondering what would have happened if you made different choices.			"

												After I reached 100% in this game(all three main endings), i think it's time to do a review. Papers please, is a game that really ""takes"" you. It has some special feeling to it, that i haven't seen before. You feel like you are a piece of that little machinery that is Arstotzka and it makes you wanna play it again and again. It has an 16-bit graphical type that is really good for it being developed by only on person. But i can't understand where the 2GB Ram needed to play this game come from. It has a really cachy theme and an ending music that really makes you feel happy, but except for these two, there is no music. The gameplay is really a new thing i haven't seen before, but you could call it a ""simulator"" if you want, but it really isn't that much of one. It also features a challenge mode with leaderboard, for people who that, it's an extra of 4-5 hours of gameplay. To end it here, Papers please is a really interessting game, a crown of the indie gerne and and worth the few bucks. But if you don't think it'll be interesting for you, don't pick it up. You really have to engage in it to have fun. But once you have, it's a hell lot of fun. This game gets an Indie 8/10. Thanks for reading ^^			"

												Not in a million years did I think a game this simple could be so fun. Being a boarder security guard just reached another level of awesomeness. Just as the trailer shows you check passports - but it gets progressively harder over the course of time, not to mention interesting. The trailer literally nails what the game is about and does a good job of it. I found myself playing for an hour easily the first time I played. It literally delivers what it is designed to and isn't meant for a person who cannot sit still and analyze the finer details required to meet the games challenge demands. I like it as it forces me to pay attention. There are surprises in the game and nothing works exactly as it's supposed to. You may be offered a bribe half way through the game, and if you take it, you may get away with it. However, you may get caught down the line and then thrown in prison. Subsequently, you must try your best to keep your family alive. Money pays for heat and health needs of the family. Upgrades are also available for the booth, as well as your dwelling. You will run into an assortment of characters (to say the least) that will keep you on your toes. Graphics are basic. Is this bad? Not at all as the person who did the designs was extremely careful in what they were trying to achieve. Sounds do not have much of a variation, but I guarantee you'll be repeating what the guy on the loud speaker says every time you click it. This is most likely the only indie game I ever recommend to friends.Indie rating : 7.9/10RATING : 7/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C+ Overall  B- "

												Papers, please. A dystopian document thriller.Nothing would sound more boring right? Well, you are right. It does sound boring.But dont let the graphics, the minimalistic gameplay and repetetive music fool you. This game is one of the greatest out there, and easily beats AAA titles. I peaked you interest yet? Good.You play as a border inspector in the fictional communist country of Arstotzka, just having finished a war against the neighbor country Kolechia that lasted 6 long years. Your job is paperwork. All you do is stamp passports and look through papers. Fisrt day, only citizens of Arstotzka are allowed entry. Next up, foreingers with valid passports are allowed to enter. Same day terrorists attack the border. Next day all foreingers must present a valid entry ticket. It all goes on and on and on. Eventually you will be dealing with a lot of papers. Still, you are expected too keep the same amount of presicion and speed as you had before. Why? At the end of each day you manage your expenses: Heat, food and rent. On top of this, we have your family: Son, wife, mother in law and your uncle. Not paying for food or heat will result in them being sick, which will result in them needing medicine. If you cant pay for medicine, one of your family members die. But on top of that, if you make a mistake at work, you get a citation. First two are warnings, after that you have to pay 5 credits per mistake. Incedentlly, every entrant you procces correctly will give you 5 credits.Now, with that out of the way, this game has a lot of choices. There is no black and white, there is only gray. This women does not have the right papers, but she will be killed if she returns to her home country. Do you let her in at the expense of your family, or do you deny here and move on? This man carries what he calls 'harmless medicine' and pays you 10 credits to let him pass. Do you detain him, or do you give a stamp?Do you help a secret group overthrow the proclaimed corrupt goverment? Do you do your thing as a upstanding citizen?Papers, Please is a work of art. Amazing and fitting gameplay, awesome story and sub stories.Also, you might wonder what happens when your family dies or you run out of money. You will be replaced and put either into forced labor or ported back to your village.Glory to Arstotzka.			"

												What a bad day i just want to stamp these papers and go home, (explosion). …. I did not let him through  I was on break…IntroPapers, please at first glance looks like a boring simulator of a tedious job but the first impression couldn’t be anything but horribly wrong. Accept or DeclineYou can accept or decline people to pass through or not. The interesting thing is finding the errors in their passport. Finding errors in the start of the game was not interesting at first but as  the game progressed though it got more complicated and always mixed up the circumstances. This allowed for pretty interesting engagement.Memorize Memorize MemorizeThis most obvious requirement of the game is to memorize rules,cities and symbols in order to properly do the job quickly and efficiently. You don’t need to be einstein or anything but it really does help your budget to be good at your job. Since the rules constantly change its best to know the basics through repetition so if a person forges it you are able to tell quickly and not get tricked. If you screw up you get a citation which will eventually penalize you for making mistakes. Starting with 0 - 5 - 10 etc and constantly increasing. Sometimes its not about the quality of your work but rather the guilt of your heart when you pass someone with improper documentation because you would rather have that person succeed at what they told you then make them turn back.People MatterThere is a really gray area in this game where you have to make constant choices throughout the days between your family or strangers. These strangers mind you, weather telling the truth or not, can have their lives greatly effected on your decisions. Its up to you to decide who you prioritize, your family and reputation or strangers and their dreams. There are npc’s that add more depth to the game from trying to decode cult-like messages to using your power to jail lots of people to make the officer more money to split with you. Endings and ConsequencesHow you proceed through the game will effect what ending will occur. In many situations it can happen sooner than later. The variety of endings and context is actually pretty good and not a blatant copy and paste of each other unlike a certain other game I rather not mention.Endless ModeThere is endless mode which allows you to select 3 categories timed, perfect, endless. The courses are basically difficulties and the higher you go max being 4 the harder it becomes to process people. This also has steam leaderboards in case you want to compare yourself with friends but that would look rather silly wouldn’t it?  Hey, I am the best stamper of my steam friends group wooo!.... Random Experiences“hey I want to be with my husband!” Ok lady you are the 1000th customer so we will let you through… (citation pops up) “You screwed up again”“Hey buddy! You are the greatest here is my passport” “sir that passport looks like your kid drew it” “GOT A PROBLEM ? oh i mean well yes sorry i will come back with a better passport”			"

												I copy edit for my campus newspaper. Basically it's spell-checking, grammar-checking, and fact-checking since staff writers are too lazy to check their own work. Papers, Please is much harder, not just because it requires much closer attention to detail (even staff writers usually don't get a person's gender wrong), but also because when you're correcting a mistake in a newspaper article, you don't have to worry that you're separating a woman from her husband, or allowing an abusive pimp to kidnap two women, or giving an assassin an opportunity to strike at your local mom 'n' pop terrorist cell. And when you're copy editing, you also don't need to worry that when you screw up, you might get sent to the gulag or your son might die of pneumonia. It's great practice, though.			"

												It's a very fun game. It takes monotony and finds away to make it fun and you feel invested in what you're doing. You're scanning people's passports for errors using various tools as an immigration officer for a fictional Russian-like country. For the most part it's pretty stright forward but as time goes on the things you have to look for become more numerous and more subtle raising the difficulty as time goes on. For every day you complete you get money. And with that money you decide which necessities your family can afford. Maybe today they get to eat. Tomarrow they may get some heat in your apartment so they don't freeze to death. Maybe your son needs medication or he won't make it through the night. Rarley will have enough to do everything and if you don't manage your funds it's very likley that some or all of your family will die.But it's not all just checking passes and hoping your family doesn't die from having their basic needs go unforfilled. There is a bigger story happening and while you're never outright told if you fulfill certain requirements the story will turn down one of a handful of paths. It's a very interesting game and I highly recommend it.			"

Papers, Please starts with very simple mechanics and becomes more complex as you go through the story.  Part of the complexity is deciding whether to help out the people who visit you.  Your ""job"" and ""salary"" depend on following the protocol, but underneath the mechanics is a story about Arstotzka and the surrounding countries that people travel from.Overall, a fun game if you explore the details.  Your choices affect the outcome of every playthrough and decide the fate of the country as well.			"

												While I've played document thrillers before like Presumed Guilty or Floor13, Lucas Pope created a quite unique experience with Papers, please!You are a border checkpoint officer in the fictional pseudo-communist country Arstotzka. Your goal is to process as many entrants as possible per day to earn enough money, pay your bills and keep your family fed and healthy. And while you drown in paperwork the game constantly confronts you with moral dilemmas. It's your choice: will you strictly follow the rules given by a facist arbitrary bureaucracy or will you turn a blind eye to that poor refugee's expired passport? Will you accept bribes or even risk your family's lives by turning against the regime?I'm not sure if Papers, please! is fun, but it is indeed a 'strangely absorbing experience' and it will make you think about individual responsibility.One playthrough is about 4hrs... due to multiple endings and an unlockable endless-mode you can extend this time significantly.

												What appears to be a simple game with primitive graphics and tedious repetitive tasks unveils to be a one-of-a-kind unforgettable experience not a single triple A title has managed and probably will never manage to provide. The simplicity in graphics turns out to be just right for the grim, monotonous setting of the game, where the present is not bright and the future is not promising to be any better.The necessity to follow every instruction to the letter. As the government becomes more and more paranoid and constantly implements new rules as they're meant to fix the mistakes it has made, the difficulty increases - for you, the mere paper worker.Combined with the fact you're being paid accordingly with the amount of papers you've processed, it turns out that you cannot process them as quickly as when you got this position. A single detail is missed, and you're fined. You've got to make a choice between analyzing papers carefully and giving up on your earnings and trying to get through them quickly risking to miss on a little detail.Later on, it turns out that you cannot even put a little piece of decoration in your office, a little display of humanity in yourself. A swift reminder that you aren't a human - you're a human unit, a worker supposed to operate at a machine level efficiency, no matter the difficulty.The longer you play, the more tension there is - and no way less morbid one than the one against the final boss of the level/the game. The longer you play, the more questions there are to ask and to answer to yourself. The longer you play, the further your work style shapes who you become closer to the end. No surprise there are 20 endings - the game, being simple in graphics and context, not moving you any further than but one location, provides a pretty wide range of moral choices, work styles, opportunities for a better future, and overall psychological development of your character. You aren't the same since you've occupied this post. Who will you turn out as? 10/10 Glory to Arstotzka			"

												Papers, Please is a very original game, but unfortunately it doesn't reward the time you spend with it. During the first hour or two of playtime it's easy to find yourself immersed in the dystopian fictional world and curious about what will happen next. However, after a while you realize that there is very little variety in terms of the scenarios that present themselves. Assuming you manage to stay on the good side of your superiors, this lack of variety leads to sessions that drag on and on and become extremely tedious.After reaching the end of any given playthrough there's little point in playing again. The only changes you'll encounter are when you get to choose a slightly different path by allowing somebody's wife through (or not), confiscating a diplomat's passport (or not), and so on. The differences in outcome are minor at best and certainly not worth 30-60 minutes of drudgery as you click through endless piles of documents.The game's presentation is bare bones, but I think the audio and visual style works well and accomplishes what it sets out to do. The interface is decent, although the small space you have to work with means papers get lost under other ones and lots of annoyance as you go digging for whatever it is you're looking for. The system for finding discrepancies is fairly opaque at first, which will lead to frustration as you wonder how to properly execute your instructions. Even later on this can be an issue at times as the demands you're placed under become more and more complex.I think Papers, Please is an interesting experiment and worth at least playing around with for a few hours. I'd definitely wait for it to go on sale though. I just don't think most people will find enough enjoyment here to justify paying full price.			"

Papers, Please, which celebrated its 1-year anniversary last week, is described as “a dystopian document thriller” – quite an intriguing mouthful for a game description, but nonetheless a very fitting description for a truly unique game. Heavily influenced by the border systems present during World War II, Papers, Please introduces the player to the communist state of Arstotzka, which recently ended a 6-year war with its neighbors and otherwise reclaimed its rightful half of the border town, Grestin.Winning the lottery would be a nice thing – everywhere but in Arstotzka and in Shirley Jackson’s novel. Unlike Jackson’s novel however, the player gets to live after winning the lottery, but they are forced to take the job as an immigration inspector. And without further ado or formal introduction, day one starts and the player has to face foreigners wanting to immigrate and citizens wishing to return – all with both poor and good attempts to cross the border and (re-)enter Arstotzka.The gameplay appears extremely simple, but as the game progresses and more regulations are added to the border-security and immigration processes, the harder and more complex the game becomes. The player has to ensure details ranging from name, day-of-birth, sex and passport number to appearance, height and work pass’ are in correct order. Should the player fail to do so, more than three times per shift, a penalty is applied which ultimately hits the player hard as they are under a massive pressure to support a wife, mother-in-law, son and uncle with food, heat, medicine and shelter.This ultimately introduces a great range of moral choices – should the player bend the rules after hearing some visitor’s heartbreaking stories and let them enter; knowing the consequences? A few achievements are in fact challenging the player’s moral stance – for instance, should an aging woman be allowed to visit her son despite having discrepancy in her papers? Similar, as the entry requirements tightens – following the significant increase in terrorist attacks inside Arstotzka against the oppressive government – more people may be detained. The choice, however, ultimately lays with the player – but as the nearby guard continues to declare his willingness to share his payment, which happens to be based on the amount of detains, the more tempted the player becomes. It becomes a simple matter of survival and thus prioritization.An interesting aspect to Papers, Please is the sound effects, audio and graphics. There are no identifiable voices (in any language), but rather extremely robotic and inhumane voices – something which follows the unidentifiable, gender less and anonymous queue outside the inspector booth. Both elements together with the Kafkaesque, colourless and overall dystopian environment greatly amplifies the alienation between the state and the people.The lack of human compassion is stunning, but perhaps very fitting for a totalitarian bureaucracy which values the state above everything and everyone. This, once again, introduces the player’s role – no action is inconsequential, and with every coin having two sides nothing is just black and white. Yet the player is ultimately the only one who can question the procedures and do the unexpected and unwanted; show compassion and empathy. The choices will ultimately impact the player’s family directly as illnesses, hunger and cold all follows rapidly though.Papers, Please is in truth a unique game which pokes to the player’s moral and human compassion. It introduces the player to a very special and dystopian environment which, if allowed, greatly influences the player. It is not a game for everyone, but those who wishes to find a raw pearl within the ocean of indie-games and for those who treasures great narrative and design, this is the game.Glory to Arstotzka.

												Papers Please is a great game. It's basically a game where you control a checkpoint at the edge of a country and you can decide whether people are let in or not. Simple, right?Well, if it was THAT simple, it probably wouldn't even be on Steam.The country you work for, Artzstotska (I bet I spelled that incorrectly) apparently has a lot of issues, and it gets to the point where billions of documents have to be checked before you can clear them for entry. One tiny mess-up, and you can get fined, warned, or worse. And at the end of the day, the money you make is immediately spent for your family so that you and your family can stay alive. I actually found myself really concerned about my family while I was playing this game and felt overwhelemed as if I was actually a poor man not doing so well in a communist country.Also, I'm not very good, because my uncle, wife, and son died :(That would STILL be boring if it wasn't for the immense variety of people that come in. Some are smugglers, some are reporters that I can't let through, some don't have the right papers but beg and bribe me, some have stories, some cuss at me, some threaten me, and some launch terrorist attacks. Personally, I'll let anyone in that will bribe me enough to compensate for my violation fees, and detain anyone because I made a deal with a security guard to have half of his bonus whenever I detain a person with him. I am now trained to use a gun to deal with attackers, and I am a very good shooter. Secretly though, I am part of a special underground operation that aims to take down the horrible government and I recieve messages from them every day.This game has a lot to offer. Seems simple at first, but when you get into it, it turns out to be really great. Papers, Please is a true storytelling masterpiece.			"

												Everyday I walked to work, my eyes on the cold grey and lifeless ground to an even bleaker work environment. I feign a weak smile and say hello to the guard everyday but on the days he doesn't regard me, he looks at me as if he was looking at the void on the horizon. Then he lights up a cheap cigarette he got from the commissary. Life is grey and sad and blue. The people are never happy except for one curious fellow. Some have stories that kill my soul more and more each day when I have to reject their entry. But I have a family to feed. Others are allowed in, but they are ♥♥♥♥♥s.

												This game is even better than expected. Go buy it at full price.The hype in the reviews is at the very least justified.If you check a few negative reviews you'll see most of them say the game is repetitive or like work.1. Yeah it's repetitive, it's a game, do you never get bored of shooting bad guys or conquering stuff?2. Yeah it's like work, you play a clerk, duh. But if this game reminds you of your job, I recommend a career change and immigration.Glory to Arstotzka!			"

Mundane tasks makes a good game? Actually I think it does. You check papers, trying to handle as many applicants as you can in one day to earn your salary. There are a lot of things to keep track of, and sometimes you miss out and get a penalty. Penalties are bad and are deducted from your salary which you need to pay rent, heat, food and medicine for your family. Papers, Please is somewhat stressful with a ""survival"" element. The game may become easier to handle when you've learnt all the locations and spot the different things you need to check.			"

												It's kind of hard to review this game mainly because I've never seen anything like it. You play as an immigration post worker, approving (or denying) the entry of citizens while fighting away terrorists and caring for your family on the side. It's an original concept for a game and it's actually a whole lot more fun than it seems.			"

												""Papers, please."", the name of this game is also that one piece of dialogue you will read over and over and over again. You are an inspector for a communist regime, in a fictional country set in 1982. It is your job to keep the country safe, now that its borders have opened up again (a little). Natives and foreigners alike will have to show you their papers, including passports, ID cards and permits of various sorts and you must check them for credibility. Basically, Papers, Please is a simulation of the actual job of a border guard. Since this is set in a dystopian, cold war-era though, it is far from boring. Security is tight and you cannot afford any mistakes, especially because the life of your own family depends on it. After each day of sieving through papers, you will have to spend your hard-earned salary on rent, food and warmth for your loved ones. This forces you to work fast, though working fast makes you more prone to errors, which in turn might lead to penalties for any mistakes, even those as small as forgetting to check the date of expiration on a worker's permit.Putting yourself and your family first will mean absolute obedience to your regime, however, and a strict and methological approach to every single one of the (partly random, partly story-related) visitors. Some will tell you sad stories about how much they miss their family, others will flat-out lie to you and it is always up to you if they may enter or not. A psychological experiment, one could say. Will you stand up against a cold government and turn a blind eye on those with no malicious intend or will you be absolutely loyal in order to secure your paycheck for the day?Playing through the storymode will confront you with various events, setting off chains and affecting the game later on. Apart from this, there are also some endless-gamemodes included, such as endurance (work until you run out of money) or time-trial (finish up as many people as possible within a given time).Papers, Please is one of the most interesting games out there right now and it does not even need any graphical miracles to pull that off. In fact, the monotone, pixelated world only contributes to its disturbingly grim atmosphere.What would you do?			"

												You play as an immigration official in a communist state, working in cramped conditions and under severe duress. If you screw up too much, your family goes hungry. Sound interesting? Then you'll probably like the game, as the gameplay part is handled very well. There's definitely skill involved and you always feel like you could process applicants that little bit faster. My first time around, I stuggled to keep everyone in my family alive, but the second, everyone is living comfortably. There's also the Endless mode where you can keep playing to your heart's content with randomized applicants, so together with all the endings and the achievements, there's some replay value.There's an ongoing story in this 4-hour game, and there are some interesting moral dilemmas. Overall though, the writing is pretty terse, the 20 endings are brief and the lore is not developed. Don't get this for the story, or if you don't find the concept particularly appealing.			"

												I guess I'm really late to the party. For a long time, I've been hearing this game take a lot of praise -Yahtzee even loved it! So why am I so late to play Papers Please? Well, I kept thinking that it's a morality-driven game, that seeks to soften your heart with emotional shortcuts about NPC strangers and darkside vs lightside choices like we see in so many games (cough...Bioware...cough). Boy, I'm sure glad I was wrong.Make no mistake, this game has a lot of empathy potential. It paints a dystopian picture of a soviet country in a world region with poor living standards. Lots of people are seeking to enter the borders from other countries around you, be it to flee conflict, to seek work or to have surgery in your country's better-equipped hospitals. You have to manage helping strangers with their implied problems who sometimes don't have their paperwork in order, with not slipping up at work to keep you and your family fed and sheltered. Bonus points if you come from an ex-communist country like me and you know from your parents what it means to live with rationed food and heat in a government-assigned apartment. However, the game also gives you incentive to play the villain once in a while, and it's sort of fun be be a prick. You're stuck at a clerk's desk doing a monotonous job, and then a guy comes in and insults your son's pencil drawing he lovingly made for you? I'll be sure to comb that jerk's passport for ANY small irregularity. The game likes to play with you quite a bit, small spoiler examples include  the guy who insults your son's drawing is always clean. The guy who admires your family photo is always trying to distract you from something.   Some immigrants can be really lousy people up to no good. It's very satisfying to catch smugglers, abusers or even smug little NPCs like the aforementioned who like to come in your office and give you lip. If it were only about the morality, though, I wouldn't have played Papers Please so obsessively. The gameplay though is more than satisfying:  in late stages, very intricate paperwork requires you to sweat while checking each paper carefully, praying you don't ♥♥♥♥ up a mini quest, then clenching your teeth for a few seconds after you process someone waiting to see if you're getting that dreaded citation for messing up. Most of the narrative is implied instead of spoon-fed and depends on you making mental connections; it's really fun when you catch some little typo in the name of some bloke's hometown that tips you off they forged their passport and are up to no good; or when you notice a lady has 2 extra pounds than it says on her entry permit - you search her and she has drugs strapped beneath her skirt. Papers Please has a wonderful playful tone very appropriate to a cartoonish satire. Precisely nailing the style of humour of Russian jokes, where people poke fun at heavy themes in a light-hearted stoic manner, the game's dark humour and catoonish estethic (from its delightfully sovietic music to its laconic, stilted English) suit this soviet dystopia masterfully.  The game has very little exposition. The longer you play, the more you'll become familiar with the various nations and their particularities, gleaning the geopolitical situation of this fictional area from newspaper articles (that react to your perfomarnce guarding the border) and from dozens of personal stories. I'm really glad that I bought this game on a whim and I hope I'll get the chance to see more creative gems like Papers Pleaser and to support more devs like Lucas Pope who enrich our experience.			"

												11/10Papers, Please is an indie game that mimics the border control of the Cold War Era Soviet Block. You play the part of a border control officer, checking all the people's papers are intact, and with each day you have something new to look out for like a forged stamp, different wanted criminals and such. You can take many paths (with up to 20 possible endings) but need to be sure to keep your job and support your family at the same time (I managed to kill my son on about the 5th day).The graphics and visuals of this game are ingenious, with 8-bit, clunky visuals on the top third of your screen and a more smooth, in-view area on the bottom two thirds of your screen to give a sense of realism, like you're really in that booth.The gameplay has the potential to be very boring, with the repetitive task of checking people's papers everyday, but the fact that you never know what's going to happen is the beauty of the game. Will a terrorist attack the guards, will a wanted criminal walk into the booth? This one lady insulted my plaque. I was proud of that ♥♥♥♥ing plaque, the ♥♥♥♥♥.The sounds in this game are great too. Clunk, approved. Just the sound of the papers in the manual turning is a beautiful touch. It's the attention to detail that makes this game beautiful.This game is my favourite indie game by about 300 miles, and probably even my favourite game maybe of all time. The developer, Lucas Pope, is brilliantly talented and needs to carry on creating games and never, ever stop. The attention to detail in this game is beautiful. Thanks for making it.			"

												It took me a long time to eventually getting around to beating this game. Why, you ask? Because the game is just not fun to play. It's a pain in alot of ways. I've got a good memory and detail for spotting errors, and even then I messed up so often in this game that it got rather embarassing. But I did get to the end, and got all the achievements. So even my utter failure at being a border inspector managed to be ok in the end.So if it's not fun to play, why is this a ""yes"" recommendation? Atmosphere. The lack of fun adds to that, oddly enough, and what you get is a game where you feel like a bureaucrat working for a pseudo facist/communist government that pays you crumbs and is all too ready to throw you in jail. The whole game dips you into this unpleasant world and does not let you escape unless you beat it or quit the game.So it's an unfun game that uses that to add to the game's superbly done setting. If nothing else, it's often a very cheap game so you won't lose much money buying it. I'd say its worth checking out, if only to see what the fuss is about and to be the jackass government employee you always wanted to be... for only a few hours.Glory to... no. That place sucks. Glory to somewhere else!			"

												I haven't dumped a lot of hours into this one yet.  But the keyword here is ""yet"".  This game captures one thing impeccably well: going through the daily grind over and over and over.  Definitely recommend a mouse and not just a trackpad for this one as each day is time sensitive.Another really great aspect is the ability to choose personal morals over the morals of the state.  Do you buy the sob story and let the lady pass, or do you send her back to her war torn country because her stamp is invalid.  Will that affect how much you can feed your family?!As to your family: you make a certain amount of credits each day based on how many people you correctly allowed to immigrate.  Each day the rules get a little harder.  Each day you make a little less.  At some point, you have to use money management to decide if, with the pittance you just made, you are going to: heat your house, buy food for your family, purchase medicine or upgrade your booth.  If you can't pay rent, the game is over.If given the chance would I buy it again?  Absolutely, even if I had to pay full price for it.			"

												Glory To Arstotzka.Papers, Please is a truly remarkable little game created by a single man, Lucas Pope, who has previously created many freeware titles with a similar look and feel to them. Papers, Please has you being randomly chosen as the chief inspector of the newly opened border to the oppressive and corrupt glorious country of Arstotszka, your family has been moved to a class-8 settlement and you will need to balance how quickly you get people through your border with making sure that you are only letting through people with 100% valid paperwork to get paid and to support your family so they don't die cold, hungry, and sick. Which seems easy enough, but as the border becomes more and more strict and as the game adds more and more rules to watch out for it can become quite the challange which requires a lot of observation to do your job right. Alongside this, the game will offer a lot of moral dilemmas of desperate people who want into your country who you can approve, but would suffer a penalty for doing so. you shall not approve under any circumstance unless they have the correct paperwork.The game's story is told very behind-the-scenes and you might not even notice how expansive the story is until the end of your first playthough, with the game having twenty different endings to get to depending on the choices you make and the people you do and don't let through. The game, like some other games of Pope's, seeks to make a political statement about security, violation of privacy and rights, and unjust censorship.This game is in no ways pretty, the look is dark and dystopian, and the world barely has any color in it, but it's all made this way to help suit the style of the game and also to not blind the player with too much information. It allows you to easily see if a picture is false and if there is something wrong about someone's papers, such as a forged seal.Overall, the game is very good at what it does and I believe that it actually is worth the ten dollar price tag, as it has a lot of replayability to see the different endings, and the game also has an endless mode. Frankly, there is so much more I could talk about in this game and why it's genius but it would spoil much of the experience, it's really a game that you have to play for yourself.Now,Papers, Please.

 A definite recommendation 'Paper please!' is a testiment to the capabilities of indie developers out there. Never mind the likes of games such as Bastion, Binding of Isaac, Undertale, Prison Architect and This War of Mine. Each with a point where they stood out the most. From the philosophical Talos Principle to the beautiful Transistor to the fantastic Dust: An Elysian Tail, one aspect all of these games had in common in comparison to 'Paper please!' is that they are all more complex games by design. And yet, 'Paper please!' wowed the world with this simple but effectively complex system of border duty (how they could think to make such a mundane and boring job a fun gameplay concept is anyone's guess). I believe the game is intentionally designed to be rather dull with a sense of oppressiveness to flex its storytelling capabilities (more on that below). Truly, an oxymoron in the sense that it is truly simplistically complex.What surprised me even more was the curious story occuring around subtly. From seemingly framed criminals to helpless refugees with forged documents to a man wanting to immigrate to stay with his family to people wanting to enter the country for its revolutionary medical scene but lack the appropriate paperwork because it was lost/taken away, all these points to real and serious moral dilemmas that resonates with people in reality. Factor in the fact that you have a family to care for and a duty to serve your country, would you make the ""morally right"" decision all the time at the cost of your loved ones well-being and risk endangering your country or would you just stick to the system and make your choice based on what you are told/taught to do? What is the ""right amount"" of balance between making these kind of choices? You aren't wrong for following rules and regulations after all. And you could also argue against say, allowing a man in without proper paperwork because he could be a criminal or that by allowing him in without proper procedure is to condemn him to further hardship since if he was ever caught he would have to bear consquences. But it is exactly this sort of balancing between rationality and morality that makes us human, that we can have sympathy and empathy for peopl but also to question the extent and how much sacrifice we are willing to take before we sacrifice our conscience in order to get by? The narrative and design of the game reminds me very much of amazing pieces of literature and movies such as  The Pianist ,  Bridge of Spies ,  Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy ,  The Book of Daniel  by EL Doctorow,  Crime and Punishment  by Fyodor Dostoyevsky,  Brutus's Dilemna  by William Shakespear and  Prisoner's Dilemma: John von Neumann,Game Theory, and the Puzzle of the Bomb  by William Poundstone just to name a few. Not for everyone Be warned though, this game is not for everyone. I can understand why people would find the gameplay boring at first sight or genuinely boring. So if you don't mind being very meticulous, careful and essentially doing the ""same thing"" all the time, I strongly commend you to pick up this marvelous piece of interactive media. If you're doubtful, give it a shot. If you're not into it, you could always get a refund provided that you played for less than 2 hours (which is more than enough time to consider whether if you enjoyed the game). Possible spoiler The one thing that strikes closer to home was the dilemma of buying a present for your child on his birthday. The dilemma of using what little savings you have for rainy later (or even worse, at the cost of daily neccessities) over buying a present for your child that would undoubtly shine some light into a bleak existence kills me because of how relatable it is to me during my younger days as a child and to every parent out there barely making ends meet. Few games could evoke such emotions and compelling narrative without actually saying much.			"

												I haven't dumped a lot of hours into this one yet.  But the keyword here is ""yet"".  This game captures one thing impeccably well: going through the daily grind over and over and over.  Definitely recommend a mouse and not just a trackpad for this one as each day is time sensitive.Another really great aspect is the ability to choose personal morals over the morals of the state.  Do you buy the sob story and let the lady pass, or do you send her back to her war torn country because her stamp is invalid.  Will that affect how much you can feed your family?!As to your family: you make a certain amount of credits each day based on how many people you correctly allowed to immigrate.  Each day the rules get a little harder.  Each day you make a little less.  At some point, you have to use money management to decide if, with the pittance you just made, you are going to: heat your house, buy food for your family, purchase medicine or upgrade your booth.  If you can't pay rent, the game is over.If given the chance would I buy it again?  Absolutely, even if I had to pay full price for it.			"

												This game is a true and unique masterpiece, possibly my GOTY 2013. Lucas Pope really managed to come up with an interesting and compeling game filled with great mechanics and should I say, never used before? The soundtrack of the game is also one of the strong points for me. The game basicly puts you to work on the border of Arstotzka and you have to approve or deny passports to natives and foreign people. I honestly can't really describe it because it's SO FREAKING UNIQUE AND GREAT AND JUST AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! BUY IT ALREADY WILL YOU!?!?!?! GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!			"

			Hello Ability Powered gamers! Glory to Arstotzka! This week we are working the border to feed our family. Check Out: http://www.abilitypowered.com Subscribe:...		

Disabled Gamer considering buying this?  Wonder about accessibility options?  This review is for you:I have been wanting to check out this game forever.  What’s more exciting than working the border & telling people who aren’t allowed in to bugger off?  That’s pretty much the basis of Papers, Please.  You check passports and paperwork to allow people into Arstotzka.  You need to earn enough money to support your family. But all that info does no good if we can’t play it.  So, how’s accessibility?I can’t explain how excited I was to see this.  You can get windowed mode before you even open the game.  Thank you developers!  Windowed mode is borderless so you can access your desktop with ease. Onscreen Keyboard was a click away but honestly wasn’t needed in the first look.  So far the game is pretty point and click.  I haven’t found a way to control gameplay with the keyboard alone, but will keep trying and will definitely report back if a solution is found.  Colorblind mode is also nowhere to be found.So far Papers, Please has been a joy for mouse only players.  The first level took nothing more than point and click or drag and drop mechanics.  The speed at which you complete each level does determine income, but during early levels I haven’t felt the need to rush thus causing fatigue.  Things may change at later levels.			"

												I can recommend this game for it's unique gameplay and ideas. There's a lot of detail to it and if you wanted to you could spend quite a bit of time with this game. Due to the nature of this game I didn't really have an incentive to care about any particular character except myself and potentially my family (honorable mention to Jorji). It's not a very fun or even enjoyable game, it feels more like work. It really does feel like a border check simulator in a way. From my playtime you can see I finished it as quickly as possible.Even though I didn't really enjoy playing this game all that much I can respect it for what it is and that's why I can recommend it to anyone that thinks they would like to play a game like this.

												Papers Please accomplishes something many would consider impossible. It takes a completely mundane, boring job, makes a game about it, and makes it fun.Seriously, imagine some pitching the following idea to you.""How about a game where you play a customs officer? People come into your office on the country border, hand you their passport and other documents, and you check to make sure everything is in order.""If you are a publisher, you would stop listening to that person. If you aren't a publisher, you would still probably think it's a bad idea.The thing is, though, that's exactly what the game is, and it's still fun to play. Even more mind-bogglingly, it's fun to play through two or three times.What makes this possible is the scenario. You work the border of a communist country that's clearly supposed to be a rip-off of Russia. (At least that's my interpretation. There are apparently several other valid possibilities, but it's clear that every country is ripping off some real country.) This is the job the government has assigned to you. Said government doesn't take♥♥♥♥♥♥from slackers, so rather than pay you by the hour, they pay you by the person. You have to provide for you and your family though, so the faster you work, the better the pay. That is, unless you start screwing up. If you let someone in that had bad papers, or deny someone with good papers, you get paid nothing, and also get docked pay for each mistake past the first. This alone creates a tension; work too fast, and you get screwed by mistakes, but work too slow, and you get screwed by inadequete pay.On top of this, there are several unique characters that visit you every day. Many of them can be described as ""I know my papers aren't in order but pleasepleaseplease let me in."" For example, a husband with good papers asks you to let his wife in, who's next in line, but missing a critical paper. Do you take pity and let her in, or stick to your job and separate them?There is a lot going on; the game reacts to your choices in a very natural way. Did you catch a wanted criminal trying to get through customs? The newspaper headline tomorrow will exclaim ""Criminal caught in customs!""There are too many examples to list, especially when several of them will spoil key elements of the game.Trust me. Just buy this game. It's worth the price tag. I know the concept is a hard sell, but you will NOT be disappointed.			"

												A game that is almost ridiculously addicting, considering its rather simple mechanics. The game takes place in the ficticious country of Arstotzka, you are a worker at the border control. The main gameplay element is to check the papers of the entrants and either deny them or let them through. What sounds tedious and repetitive at first, soon develops into moral conflicts and hard decisions. Papers, Please is not just a ""border control simulator"", but tells a story. You have a family to feed, so you want to do your job good. Unlawfully letting entrants through leads to citations and finally penalties, you might even lose your job. But do you really want to disunite a family or change the fate of other people to the worse, just for the sake of doing a good job? Do you let a drug smuggler or terrorist through because he bribes you with money that could save your family from starving? It's decisions like these that make Papers, Please a unique experience and definitely worth its money.			"

												How do you make paperwork engaging, dramatic, moving and tense? This game does just that.Papers, Please takes the rote job of a customs inspector and turns it into what would already be an engaging puzzle game by itself - think Ace Attourney, but now you're looking for discrepancies in paperwork instead. By the end of the game you're juggling an insane amount of documents that makes the game really hectic, so don't expect it to be easy.That'd be enough by itself, but Papers, Please also finds a way to make all this busywork meaningful, involving you in the minutiae of your customers' lives and the ongoing political turmoil in a way that will make you seriously invested in its world.Papers, Please is a fantastic example of gamifying a system that you wouldn't expect to even work, and then making it engaging and heartfelt. It is also my favorite game of 2013.Glory to Arstotzka.			"

The amount of depth and personal responsibility that goes into how you treat each character make for a unique experience.

												Papers, Please is a very interesting game, only for the first 10 hours playing.It's very interesting for the first few playthroughs with various endings. But after playing it for many more hours, it's becoming much more like a tadious training programme than a funny game, and I feel quite weary of playing it. Unlike other games, it makes me feel like at work.Never play the endless mode which I think will be chanllenging, but no more entertianing.In any case, it's a quality game, worth playing. Recommended!			"

												For a pixelated point and click indie game, It definitely surprised me in more ways than one.The concept is very simple: You regulate the borders of a make believe country called Arstotska and you approve or deny immigrates passage, depending on the rules of the day. However as you progress the story unfolds to something more complex, maybe even emotional. Throughout your work you discover people and their stories, which can have a deep impact. E.g. an immigrant hasn't seen her son in six years but has expired documents. Do you deny her entry? Or do you let her through and face disciplinary action from your superiors? The pressure builds, as you are the only financial provider for a family of five. You decide how the story unfolds.			"

												I bought this during the Summer Sale not particularly knowing what to expect. It starts off sorta relaxing, doing your brotherly duty to your comrades keeping the border safe from capitalist swine and dirty Imporians, typical stuff.  But then suddenly you're faced with decisions. Will you let the sick man enter the country to use Arstotzkan doctors, or is it tough luck Republian pig? Will you take bribes or will you be loyal to your country? Join a plot to overthrow the government?  There are multiple endings, and only on my 3rd playthrough will I get all the achievements. (and have seen most of the endings.) For a game with no exact story, there's a lot to be noticed. There's a lot of neat details and a few characters that really grew on me. The gameplay may not be for everyone, I mean you're checking papers and documents for errors and forgeries, but the enjoyment for me was the implied stories and situations that occur. Some of it gets absurd and I love it. I bought it on sale, and bought a copy for a friend. Would gladly pay full price as I'm getting 14-15 hours out of it once I finish achievements.GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!EZIC LIVES			"

												Papers, Please was first introduced to me in Alpha, and it was already great. I followed it through development and into Steam, where it got bigger and better. The constant being on-edge, management, strategy and difficulties you face are balanced by a wonderful simplistic art style and great soundtrack. The interface is perhaps a little counter-intuitive at points for me, but that's really my only problem with it. Given the number of endings, its replay value is immense. Even today after [insert large number here] hours of gameplay, I'm finding new things to do, new things I like doing in the game.The best part is the waiting, which makes no sense without context. After you approve an applicant, there's the little tense wait to see if you got a citation. You begin to hate the little *clickity click* sound of the citation appearing, and makes you get angry at the system. You want revenge, and EZIC are there to help. Personally, I've always gone against EZIC, but the game adapts to your playstyle, once you adapt to it. The best kind of game is one that impacts upon the player and vice versa. Papers, Please is definitely in that category.			"

												More than a border guard simulator, Papers, Please is a pleasantly unique game that forces the player to make difficult decisions. The game-play sounds boring compared to the sheer number of action games; however, the game-play is actually quite addicting. That being said, the multi-branched storyline of Papers, Please is the biggest selling point. With various endings, players are encouraged to replay the game, and experience other possibilities. YOUR DECISIONS MATTER. When pitted against difficult decisions, players must decide what is more ethically important to them. Do you believe the government or the pleas of individuals? Do you purposely make a mistake to ensure the safety of others? Your actions greatly changes the outcome of the game.It's not by mistake that Papers, Please grabbed the attention of many gamers. It's a big change from typical games, but it's a change worth taking. Glory to Arstotzka.			"

												honestly, I bought this game expecting to be disappointed with it because it is so different from any other game i've played or showed interested in... Oh boy was I wrong.This game really impressed me in ways that I never would have expected. Every action in this game has consequences, some good, same bad, and some have both good AND bad.To start, the game gives you only a single game mode, the story mode, but a simple google search will give you the code to unlock the endless mode. Warning about unlocking endless before playing story completely, you will have to play it with no previous knowledge about the rulesendless mode continued: endless mode has a few different sub-modes that allow you to play with different rules, such as timed or perfection, but I highly recommend that you play story mode first.This game has 20 different endings, which really allows you to play the way you want to play it. That is a very important factor in my book.Sometimes people come into the booth that have male facial features, but are actually female and vice versa.The story, your decisions, and the characters can really make you reconsider your morals and make you think twice about how you really feel about the things you do in this gameI rate this game 9/10 for the great story, the characters, the games general unique-ness, and because of the minus points from the nudity feature Glory to Arstotska			"

 What do i think of Papers Please? After playing a good few hours of this amazing game i decided that i would write a review on why its so good (as there is no negative points about this game THIS is why you should pick it up):1. It was 2013 GOTY in Indie Development.2. It is difficult but not impossible as i found myself the first time through getting to 7 days but on the next time knowing how the game played out i was able to get a lot further as i saved money daily and made sure i made small compromises so that my family didn’t die of hunger or being cold.3.The game gives you very hard choices to make for example in day 2 (i believe) a man says ""my wife is next in line we are going to start a new life"" which he has correct everything so i let him in but then the wife comes without an entry pass you have to decide to risk getting a fine or to let her into the country with her husband (HINT let her in achievement hunters).4. The theme tune along in the background deserves a pickup of the game as it really sets the tune of a communist country out of a war.5.The art style of this game is impeccable as it is very arcade and 80's feeling6. Glory to Arstotska!			"

'Papers, Please' is a round based inspection game, where you play as immigration inspector.Desc:You play as immigration inspector to earn the livelihood for your family. At the end of each round you will get your daily salary - if your daily salary is too low and your reserves are too low, then you have to option whether your family will get no food and/or no heating. Your salary will get lowered, when you do mistakes during your inspection and you let somebody past who is not authorized to cross the border. Your family will get sick and yes; they will die, when you do to much mistakes at your work. Mistakes means, that you haven't asked the immigrant why his passport says that he is female but he looks male or you haven't followed the order that immigrants from a certain country won't be past, because of threat of terrorism. After certain days and enough money you can upgrade your booth to work more efficient. Over the time there will be scripted events where you have to make moral decisions. These decisions will influence the story. The final goal is to help or to infiltrate the country you are working for - and yes; it has multiple ends! ^^Pros:+ nice artwork+ music and sound fit to the artwork+ multiple ends+ great game concept+ rising level of difficulty+ moral decisions which have effects+ replayabilityCons:- a bit hard at the beginning - you have to train! (a selectable level of difficulty would be great)Recommended, even if it's not on sale, because the overall package is just right.9/10 "

												""Papers, Please.""8/10Ok! Here we go!Glory to Arstotzka!The greatest country!You are an immigration inspector, stationed at the Artotzkan side of the city Grestin, a city which shares the border with neighboring Kolechia. Your job is to conrol the constant flow of poeple entering your country. Massive hordes of people wish to enter Arstotzka, many of whom are not friendly. You'll encounter smugglers, spies, murderers, and terrorists. Using only the documents provided by travelers and the Ministry of Admission's primitive inspect, search and fingerprint systems, you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.Gameplay in Papers, Please is rediculously fluid. Almost completely randomized, the game manages to make border inspection fun. As soon as a civilian approaches the booth, you must instantly snap up and pay attention. There are so many things to check for. Just to name a few: date of birth, expiration date, gender, face, if wanted criminal or not, weight, height, ID number, legit passport, and more. Terrorist attacks will be frequent, and you must be ready. You have a tranq at your side from day 16 on, and you will use it.  You'll always be on your toes. Papers, Please has many attractive features as well. The game in itself looks attractive, yielding a more harsh style. Everything in-game gives a nice vibe that definitely add to the experience. The interface may be a little difficult to get used to, but, with a little practice, become very easy. Booth upgrades increase fluidity and generally make the play quicker. Papers, Please, in addition to beautifully executed mechanics, has an amazing degree of humour and variability. With many, many references, Papers, Please does not dissapoint in the ""entertainment"" category. Random events will occur, as well as some scripted, more out-of-the-ordinary, ones. EZIC agents will require your assistance in restoring the Arstotzkan government, and amusing certain others (I'm looking at you, Jorji.) will attempt to surpass your stand. The game is endlessly fun. Aside from the 20 different endings of story-mode, there is an unlockable ""endless mode"" available to play. This mode takes full advantage of the Papers, Please's randomization, and effectively increases the game's length. All in all, Papers, Please is an enjoyable gaming experience that I would happily recommend to any gamer of any type.Glory to Arstotzka.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Papers, Please. Glory To Arstotzka's Boring Yet Compelling JobGenre: Point & Click Puzzle SimulationDeveloped & Published by: 3909Platform: Windows, Mac and Linux. Business Model: Base Game. Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsYou are a border guard of Arstotzka, a fictional government that has forced you into your current job. Your job, I might add, is to get as many people processed through the border as quickly as you can. The more people you process correctly, the more money you earn for the day. However, the job is made difficult with forged documentation, lists of rules you must make sure everyone has adhered to and an ever-increasing pile of paperwork to sift through. As you make mistakes, it costs money and could potentially get yourself jailed if you’re that terrible at your job. Your family has demands as well and the cost of living will go up, demanding that you work harder at processing more people through the gate every passing day. Papers, Please isn’t a pleasant stroll through the park. The work you’re doing is tedious and dull. Every new face a source of income and potential frustration. Inspections taking progressively longer as you become more paranoid of your fallibility. Let one guy through and he’s fine. Let the next woman through, whose paperwork seems legitimate, only to get instantly penalized as her documentation was expired. Then I begin checking documentation to make sure it isn’t expired only to get penalized for letting a criminal through. Curses! Then you deny the next person because something seems missing with his documentatio--oops, nope, he was completely fine. I just denied a man from seeing his wife. Now I have to be extra-careful with the next guy, which takes me over an hour of in-game time just to realize that his paperwork completely checks out. Damnit it all! I need to move faster. The Next person has concealed explosives but I forget to check his weight so he gets through and blows up the guards. The day is abruptly over. My income cut short, my family starves. I curse my inadequacy. Papers Please is a constant balance of fact-checking, observation and being as quick as possible with some of the most intentionally-clunky tools a border guard could possess. Each tool taking their own portion of precious time to make sure the documentation is or isn’t correct. Even if you know that person’s paperwork is wrong, you have to verify it with the in-game data checker, interrogate the person to be sure you’re correct and then and only then, can you call for the guards. All the while, the clock ticks on insidiously. Waiting to instantly call you out on that inevitable mistake you’ll make. Game ModesThere are two main game modes, story and endless. Story is a 31 day campaign with branching story paths based on the decisions you make. Whether it’s support for the rising rebellion against Arstotzka, support of the old government, getting caught doing illegal activities or adverse conditions affecting your family, ultimately remains up to you. The story is excellently paced and down to earth with each decision you make being personable. While some decisions may seem black and white at first, you may find out later that events didn’t play out as you expected. The story more or less gives reason for why you’re there and how your decisions affect what ultimately ends up happening. To you, the government or other factions at work. While many that try to cross the border are procedural generated, in the story mode there are some that aren’t. These crafted characters can be depressing, heart wrenching or sometimes amusing. This isn’t a simulation of a border guard’s job but it’s the closest game to being one while remaining entertaining for many. Endless gives you three ways to play with four levels of difficulty. There’s a timed mode where you process as many travelers in 10 minutes as possible. Perfection which has you going as long as you can until you make a mistake. Finally, there’s Endurance which has you playing until the score balances out from your mistakes. These simply give you a way to enjoy the game after the story and are a nice, simple addition. PC SettingsUnsurprisingly basic settings, but usable for a 2D game. You have fullscreen, windowed mode and software rendering in case your hardware isn’t good enough. There’s a nudity on/off switch as well as an “Easy Mode” which gives you 20 credits every day. Separate volume sliders exist as well. However, there’s only one very catchy song that’s played in the main menu. The graphic style is, what I would consider, an oppressive & depressing pixelart. It looks great despite it not being a very colorful title. Final ThoughtsPapers Please is one of my favorite games of 2013. It keeps the dry experience of a border guard but still has depressing stories to tell. The pixelart and dreary atmosphere combine with the constant & insidious pressure to make for a very compelling experience. It’s a game that I shouldn’t find enjoyable but yet I do. Its an odd game that says something not only through words but through the game’s mechanics as well. Read the Review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												Mind numbingly boring and methodical in theory but it really works in practise. In between the criminals, border hoppers and people who just plain have bad luck there's a myriad of personalities to learn about with their stories well crafted into the game, making the player question their moral obligations against their better judgement. Though a bit rocky in it's startup, once you get the hang of it it becomes easy, before quickly being presented with yet another spanner in the works by the glorious Arstotzkan higher ups. Increasing the tension and complexity one must go through to get the barest of savings to keep their families fed and warm, encouraging the players to be thorough, yet fast with their decisions.A good experience with solid gameplay and intriguing characters. Would reccomend. "

												Papers, Please is a fun simulation game in which you play as an immigration border patrol agent for a Communist government. You have a book of rules and it is your job to either approve or deny citizens. If there is a discrepancy between the rules and their passport or paperwork, you have to interrogate them. Upon interrorgation, you can detain them (like if they have weapons or forged papers) or let them through. There are some moralistic choices along the way. For instance, one husband has all the correct paperwork, but his wife is next in line with missing paperwork. Do you let her through and risk a citation or deny her because of the rules? As the game progresses, there are more and more information you have to keep an eye on. Even the tiniest error can glaze over your eyes like mismatched gender and weight on the paperwork. The game may seem ""boring and repititive,"" but that is the point of the game. It's suppposed to simulate a boring, real life job. There is also a secret organization that tries to take down the government and you can choose to participate with them or not. Papers, Please has a great sense of humor with 20 different endings and memorable characters. In order to attain a better apartment for your family as well as food and heat, you have to process people faster and correctly to make more money. ""Glory to Arstotzka!""			"

												Arthouse games get a bad rep, not because they try to make videogames into a serious form of art, but because most of them are pretentious as ♥♥♥♥. Because of this, there are only two games other than this one that I consider ""art"", Shadow of the Colossus and Limbo. But SotC and Limbo both have similar atmospheres and worlds, something that Papers Please doesn't bother trying to set up to the same extent.Papers Please works instead as the videogame equivalent to Albert Camus's ""The Stranger"", in that you have to choose what is morally right and logically right. There's no real answer to any of the major border holdups you encounter throughout the game. By supporting a totalitarian regime you help secure your family's safety, but at the price of the immigrants and revolutionaries crossing the border. By helping the underground resistance movements, you put yourself and your entire family at risk, without the closure of knowing you became a martyr for a bigger cause.So there's the holdup. Do you go with what is ethically right, appealing to your emotions to do what's best in the grand scheme of things? Or do what is logically right, sacrificing your own humanity for protection and security?Game's pretty fun too.			"

												This game is a piece of art. It makes you evaluate yoursef. For being a game where you sit and stamp papers day out and day in, it's incredibly well made. The story is deep, the characters are charming, and it really manages to make you care about the safety of your family. To the point, even, that you might put your own life in jeopardy. Now, don't go thinking there's a lot of content in terms of gameplay, because there isn't. You might get bored after a while, but if you're one who loves a good story in a pretty dark world, just stay around and see the brighter parts of it.			"

												Papers, Please is a game which shines through its tremendous writing. The story questions the morals of pride, nationalism, and humanity. Although the game's heart is at its story, it still has functional and enjoyable gameplay, which continues to refreshen itself on each progressive day. The lack of music within the work day is at times annoying, but overall adds to the dull, monotonous and monochrome environment the game tries to enforce. It also becomes fidgety at sometimes with certain instances, where I felt I was unfairly penalized for following the instructions as written. Nonetheless, it is still an exciting indie title that breaks the mold and gives off unique vibes.Overall, the game is a truly one of a kind experience and should not be passed up by anyone who enjoys a compelling story.With a price tag of $9.99, the game is affordable for the playtime it provides and SCREAMS of replayability.9/10			"

												Papers, Please!Papers, Please is a fantastic game where you, the player, assume the role of an immigrations officer where as you decide who may or may not enter Arstotzka. Arstotzka is a fictional country bearing a resemblance to the former soviet union before its collapse on December 26th of 1991. As the game starts it's very simple and straightforward, and as you would expect as the game progresses it become more challenging. However there's a catch, you're not just stamping passports without a goal, mind you! Every person you process correctly gains you an income, this income is then put towards maintaining your family's well being and as well as upgrading your workstation to improve efficiency. Papers, Please also has a compelling story that's choice based and is definitely worth replays to experience each choices effects.Overall this game is designed to challenge you. You need to know how to maintain a level head when faced with a stressful work environment, however that being said it's not rage inducing at all. The one thing to consider is that each day in the game will timed, but fair. The other major reason I love this game is that it makes you pay attention to detail and if you have a keen eye it can be quite satisfying to spot forged documentation.While I never like to give a game a score I must say that it’s looking like a 9/10 for me, and the reason I never like giving scores is because the game is only as good as what you put into the game.Glory to Arstotzka!

												I was definitely hesitant about this game at first, I watched a couple videos online and it seemed so repetitive and boring. But boy am I happy to say I was wrong. I love how there's different story lines where you can follow the rules or trust in some dodgy people and see what happens. This was my 2nd steam game completing all the achievements and now I plan on playing the endless mode! Definitely try it out, it's fun and frustrating at the same time as you facepalm yourself over silly mistakes over and over.			"

												Who'd have thought checking paperwork could be so fun?Labelled as a dystopian document thriller, 'Papers, Please' sees you trying to support your family as you check and punch paperwork on the border to the fictional country of Arstotzka. Checking date-of-birth and ID numbers match, asking for tickets and work permits, checking thumbprints and keeping an eye out for reported criminals, your list of tasks grows day by day and the opportunities for deceit begin to pile up. Just as you get used to the system, someone throws a molotov across the border and new, tighter regulations get introduced.The game is fantastic in how it presents itself, the story and gameplay are seamlessly integrated, and you face tough moral decisions and questionable actions. Do you let a man's wife pass into the country with her clearly forged passport? Do you detain someone smuggling in medicine for her own family? When you're struggling to pay the bills and your wife and son are sick, do you take the bribe pushed your way? The game is generally bleak, although offset with a quirky charm, and it is always interesting.New twists to your expected procedures are frequent, and the citizens you deal with range from terse to vibrant. There are multiple endings, most of them grim, but there's the opportunity to replay the start of any day with a fantastic branching save system.Thoroughly recommended. Glory to Arstotzka.(P.S., I've played the iOS version for about 6 hours, hence my low playtime)			"

												At first glance this game looked absolutely horrible. It seemed boring and stupid but after much persuasion from my brother, I gave it a chance. WHAT A MISTAKE. I have never felt such intense internal conflict from a game before. It makes you question your moral standings and there is no doubt that every decision I made was a difficult one. It's quite addicting and challenging. However, I thought these challenges, the music, and the overall drama of the game made it excellent! It might have been a little too real for me but that didn't stop me from playing for five hours straight.Clearly I have mixed emotions about this game but I would recommend it to people who want to cry a lot and feel like a bad person.

												I'm not sure why I'd even bother to write a review for this one, because you already know if you want it. Either you're intrigued by the concept, curious just how they can manage to make such a boring idea into compelling action, or you're instantly repelled by the premise, and rightfully so. This is about as indie as indie games get, and also as brilliant as they get. It takes such a simple thing, and wraps it up in politics, real-world parallels, and perhaps even some genuine feels to make you feel more invested in the fate of a fictional immigration officer than you ever would about a generic grimacing action hero. But drama and intelligence aside, it's also surprisingly fun, with a very smooth difficulty curve that makes you feel your own skills improving just enough to meet the game's increasing demands. It even comes with some bonus high score modes that you could conceivably see yourself playing. It tells an interesting, branching story through simple means while also somehow managing to make boring real life work into entertainment I want more of. This is pretty much the epitome of why I love the indie game market despite all its warts.			"

												I haven't reviewed this yet?  Well, it's overdue then.Papers, Please is simply a MUST HAVE on Steam.  Especially if you like to try your hand at beurocratic tasks in a video game in an exciting way.  It's monotonous, but enjoyable.   I know it's less than 20 hours to get 100%, but I logged in (at the time of this writing) at least 43 hours of gameplay.  It's that good.You play as an unknown inspector who was elected through a lottery to work  as a security guard running a graveyard shift at Freddy Fazbear's pizzeria for 5 nights as a border inspector between the cursed Kolechia and the wonderous motherland Arstotzka for one month.  But you have a time limit in which you can work, which adds pressure to your performance.  Inspect more and provide the correct responses quickly to get paid more.  Make mistakes and it'll come out of your paycheck after 2 free warnings a day.  By the end of the day, you'll need to pay for rent, food (optional), heat (optional), medical bills (optional if heat or food is neglected), and various other opportunities.  You play as a father providing for your family.  If your family dies (or other conditions occur), the game is over.   It's also a plus that it throws in ethical dillemas to keep you on your toes.People say this game is communistic and I'd say I agree with their statements.  You are playing in a job you did not choose and are dissuaded from trying to make more than you actually do...which makes it understandable why people would take bribes in communistic or socialist countries.There are various paths you can take to different endings.  You can choose to complete your tasks in a purely beaurocratic manner for the motherland Arstotzka, you can help aid in a revolution for the Order of the EZIC Star, or you can escape Arstotzka by moving away with forged passports.   The fate of the people, the nation, and your family are in your hands.PROS:Addicting gameplayGreat (yet simple) storyGreat challengesNice Puzzles (if you choose to work for EZIC)Implementation of ethical dillemasNo bugsRandomized portraits and stats based on a database (great programming)Arstotzka  (Joke pro.  XD)CONS:Limited music choicesNo planned sequel at this pointCan be infuriating if you make mistakesNot all moral/ethical choices are judged/rewardedMay be too bland/boring/monotonous to some  (Not for me, but there are times where it can feel dull)Kolechia  (Okay, that's a joke con.  Just making sure you're reading these.  lol)This game is a great experience that seems simplistic, yet is so much more.  You can lose yourself for hours at a time playing this game.  I cannot say whether or not it's worth full price, but if it is on sale, you would have to be crazy to not grab it.  This game truly competes with ""Triple A"" First Party companies and proves that indies can be great things.9/10  Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												Papers, Please is definitely an addicting game. It has 20 different endings, so there is replay value. Your first playthrough will really be entirely getting used to the system and to be as quick and efficient as possible, in order to maximize how much money you make everyday. Additionally, as a Passport Control Officer, you have to make decisions which will affect your character's, and your family's lives. Whether helping take down the government by letting terrorists through, letting people take vigiliante justice, denying people entry even though they may be executed if they return to their home country, or personally killing people to provide for your family. This is not ""Passport Control Simulator."" In this game, you really have to pay attention, and it is good for your brain, because you have to juggle multiple documents at the same time and remember dates and so forth off the top of your head on the fly. Not only that, it realy makes you question what you would do in these circumstances; help others at your family's expense, or only look out for yourself. Though it will get dull rather quickly, it is definitely worth the few bucks it costs.			"

												Allow me to explain why this is one of better games I've played in a while.Granted the graphics don't look like much but what it lacks in Hi-res PhysX it makes up for in atmosphere, tension, gameplay  and consequence, in abundance. (I rather think the graphics and audio are matched perfectly and harmonise each other well)It took me a two or three levels to fully understand how this game plays. (Essentially a spot the difference)But it is so much more than that.It places you in a dead end job with ever changing rule & regulations thrown upon you.But it thrusts completely grey area moral choices at you, interesting people and events.It has a large amount of replayability.Truly earned it's place as one of my most favourite games.

I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to try something new, and wants to do more on-the-spot thinking instead playing your average combat-filled games. The plot line is good, following a mock simulation of the Cold War Era and how foreign relations with the Soviet Union affected people. It does get frustrating at times  (I sometimes wanted to smash my computer), but it really helps your critical reading and fast-paced problem solving. If you're on the fence as to whether or not to buy this game, I say give it a shot, because it's such an original and interesting concept that you'll be missing out if you don't play it.			"

												Absolutely an amazing title, very original as far as I am concerned.You play a person that decides who and who can not get into your country. Rules changes every day as to who can get in, making it easier and easier everyday to miss stuff, so you better pay attention, the game requires your attention if you don't want to go in debt.You're faced with many moral decisions.For example one time a woman will be the next in line and she has valid papers but begs you to approve her husband, who is after her, who does not have valid papers. Do you want to ignore the rules and accept him into the country and risk going in debt or do you want to follow the rules of Arstotzka and deny him?Glory to Arstotzka.9/10, must buy.			"

												The best game.You need to play this. It is a work of art. The atmosphere and plot alone are better than some AAA titles. The 'morality' choices you will make are deeper, and more fulfilling than any sort of binary 'good/evil' choice you make in games that try to simulate it. (Like bioware or bethesda games.) You will find yourself roleplaying, perhaps against your will.Do an internet search for the free beta and play it for a taste. The finished product is even richer.I guess the gameplay may not be for everyone. But, I love it. It has a unique tension all its own as you wait to find if the person you admitted was legitimate or not.Glory to Arstotzka.			"

												Unique game, in a way it's like a timed puzzle game that teaches a story in a way that can only work via a game. If I was a curator at a museum, I'd say this game best exemplified story telling in a video game without relying on using cutscenes/scripted events, dialogue, or reading books.  Plus it's simply very fun to play trying to compete against the clock while trying to effectively prioritize speed over accuracy.tl;dr Fun game, tells story in a way only a game can, unique mechanics, challenging.

												Papers, Please is a punishing puzzle with an inventive story, told in a unique manner.Hopefully that didn't scare you off. It's clear that this is an indie game; most big publishers would be scared off by the game's punishing yet fundamentally repetitive gameplay. However, anyone who enjoys brainteasers and an excellent story will be impressed with Papers, Please.The game, which takes place in an Arstotzkan border checkpoint at East Grestin, is based on sorting through papers. Does this person have all required papers? Are the papers valid? Does anything about the documents conflict with something else? These, and other new complexities, are difficult to understand at a glance, so game difficulty is no problem (though I haven't tried the Easy Mode yet). New twists, often caused by events at your own checkpoint (Kolechians are temporarily forbidden from entering Arstotzka following a Kolechian terrorist attack), are introduced, and often moral dilemmas arise, as bribes, anti-government rebel agents, and star-crossed lovers (Ooh-la-la) are frequent occurences on this border. Money troubles also appear, as you must maintain your family of four (fun things like ""Your wife, uncle, and son died"" are treated with little fanfare).The depth of the story (which has 20 endings) is (quite) deep. The unique method of storytelling, where you see just a snapshot of the lives of travelers, is enough to recommend the game on. The gameplay is interesting, but loses much of its appeal early on. For one to look at this as an incredibly difficult and intense virtual novel would be a good summary, and if you enjoy those types of things, then this could be one of your favorite new indie titles. For gameplay first, story second players, the game is likely to bore you, as the story is the real selling point here.			"

												Papers please is a fantastic title, constantly arising situations where you have to combat your personal ideological doctrines (presumably western ones) with the normative ethics situated within Arstotzka, all the while forcing you to create a balance between logic and emotion, at the cost of your family's salvation. The gameplay and story is nigh perfect, and definitely worth the experience.			"

												This game is oddly addictive. As a passport agent for a fictional (assumably Soviet-like country), you can deny or allow people entry to the country based on the papers they're carrying, and the rules instituted by the state (which get more complex over time). Small storylines get told through brief conversations with each individual, and daily newspapers. Sounds boring but is an incredibly fun game.			"

												This is one of the most unique games to come around in many years.  A cold war based theme set in 1982 where you decide on the entrance of people into your country, the ""Glorious"" Arstotzka.  The game difficulty starts slowly as you check the validity of people's documents at the border. This continues to build as more complex events occur adding more and more information to verify and new methods to test the stories of the masses.  At the end of the work day, you are paid by how many people you processed and penalized for mistakes made.  Your money is used to support your family, providing as good a living as you can for the necessities of life: Rent, food, heat, medicine.  It is a serious challege to process as many as you can while not letting criminals, terrorists, and other ""undesirables"" into your country.A word about the graphics:  they are intentionally low end to give the feel for what games were back in the 80's.  Nevertheless, what gamers often times fail to remember, it is the imagination that is the most important piece of play.  Many of you will recall how the BEST and most fun you had as a kid was when you had a tree branch sword, a pine cone grenade, or a fort made of boxes.  This frame of mind is nearly lost on the current generation as graphics have all but stunted their ability to dream and pretend.  This game deserves a look for the price, currently $5.  Those of you who remember the cold war era will laugh at the feel of the game, while those who do not may find that they actually have a great time with it as they strengthen ""the muscle of their imagination"" that has been dormant for perhaps their whole lives.

												I'm so conflicted... I love this game, even though it makes me feel very depressed/apprehensive about things. The reason why I like it so is beause of the masterful way the story is told. Games are a unique storytelling medium because of the level of interactivity. Really, no other media has that level of interaction (movies, books, comics, theater, music). What makes this game special is that through its mechanics and gameplay, the story unfolds. Line, hook and sinker the mechanics get you before you realize you're in too deep. Overall, if you play games for them to invoke some sort of emotion... This is it. Highly recomended.			"

												This is a very interesting game. The depressive world and story mixed with that intense music, a game i've never played before. It's very difficult and challenging, it requires all your concentration to not miss a tiny detail on any of the given papers; this game is for open-minded people who like very challenging, brain straining games. I really enjoyed the flow of the game, and loved the story changing characters, which appear ever so often, as well as all the other little details put in it. While intensly working on checking data from the papers, you always have to be ready for a terrorist attack or some other event which may come unexpected. I also especially like the moral choices (which do not have influence on the story), for example, will you accept the wife to get to her husband even though she doesnt't have correct data? Will you accept bribes for people with not enough money to get the needed papers? Then there are bigger decisions that may change the complete story of the game, which I will not give an example for, because they might contain big spoilers. This game is definitely worth checking out, if you don't want to buy it, you might as well check out some videos on the web.			"

I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to try something new, and wants to do more on-the-spot thinking instead playing your average combat-filled games. The plot line is good, following a mock simulation of the Cold War Era and how foreign relations with the Soviet Union affected people. It does get frustrating at times  (I sometimes wanted to smash my computer), but it really helps your critical reading and fast-paced problem solving. If you're on the fence as to whether or not to buy this game, I say give it a shot, because it's such an original and interesting concept that you'll be missing out if you don't play it.			"

												Set in a dystopian world. You have ""won"" a job at your country's border. You stamp passports, granting or denying entry to people trying to get into Arstotzka.Sounds dull? Well, it's actually incredibly addictive. This game is innovative and surprisingly fun--albeit rather grim. The game is presented as a story that takes place over 31 playable days (there is also a endless mode that can be unlocked). As the story progresses, stamping passports becomes more and more complicated and there will be moral choices you must make. There's even a fair amount of replayability, as you can get different endings depending on what choices you make throughout the game.The only thing I found irritating was how incredibly nitpicky the game can be sometimes. But it's still very fun and very addictive.Highly recommended if you want to experience a game that is different.			"

												Frankly, this game is masterfully done. The idea is original, the graphics fit the claustrophobic and choking atmosphere, the music enhances the idea of a smothering government regime in which the player finds himself as both citizen and employee, and the stories told through the window of your booth are engaging and develop themselves with intrigue and secrecy. It's hard to find where this game could be improved. It's something that works so well as a game, and as an educational experience that it could almost be used in a teaching environment. The idea that a citizen of this government would be placed into the position they are, allowing or denying various people access to their country, seeing the amount of paperwork involved, watching the rules and regulations pile up and change over the course of time leading to frustration, being faced with the moral dilemmas asked of them, and deciding how to handle their allegiance to country versus their conscious and compassion for other human beings is something that truly isn't captured as well as it is here with Papers, Please. I will say that the game is so well done, that it actually feels like work after awhile, which cuts into the fun factor, though it enchances the simulation aspect. It's almost hard to qualify it into a genre. The mechanics are crisp and clean, they build on themselves day after day, slowly increasing the difficulty by usually adding one or two additional rules, and eventually the player will find that they are totally immersed in the experience. It does feel like work after awhile though, so some players may actually be glad to 'punch out' after an hour or two of game play.This is a game that has  left me thinking about it long after I exit the program. It's something that reaches a state where it's actually more than a game, it's a slice of actual human life. This falls into the same category as This War of Mine in that it's an important game, and one that people should play with more in mind that just entertainment. Excellent, excellent purchase.			"

Quick Breakdown: A stellar game where you play as an inspector working at a border checkpoint between your communist country of Arstotzka, and the neighboring country Kolechia, which your country has just recently ended a 6 year war with.Length: 2-4 hours (Main game), 8-10 (Completionists)Score: 8.5/10Full Review: Papers Please is a truly unique game. Admittedly, it’s a pretty tough sell. On paper, the game sounds like it’d be awful. Even when I purchased the game, I wasn’t really sold on it, but I took a chance on it based on the ravings from my friends, and the low sale price of $2.50. After playing the game, I’m glad I did. It’s worth getting at full price even, but this is Steam, we all wait for the sales, don’t we?So why’s it a tough sell? Well, you play as an inspector at a border checkpoint. People give you their papers needed to enter, and you look over them and either let them enter your country,  deny them entry if their papers are not all in order, or even detain them if need be. Sound like fun? To me it didn’t, but maybe you can see the appeal there.So why is it worth playing? Odd as it may be, that very task I talked about in the last paragraph actually is a lot of fun. But there’s further reason that is even more compelling. You work for the glorious country or Arstotzka, at the checkpoint the border town of Grestin. The half of Grestin belongs to the neighboring country of Kolechia, which Arstotzka has just ended a 6 year war with. Your border checkpoint has just opened because of this, and people are once again allowed to enter Arstotzka for the first time in 6 years. This setting, and the people it brings through your checkpoint, and the events it leads to, are the game’s biggest strengths. You’ll encounter natives trying to re-enter the country, foreigners who can finally come to Arstotzka to work or visit, or even just pass through. There will also be terrorists, who aim to harm your glorious country, and it is your duty to deny and even detain them.The game’s story and dialogue are both well written. Your actions during the day (the gameplay portion, which we’ll get to in a moment) affect the story between days, and down the road. Both the one time characters passing through, and those who are recurring are interesting, and some even quite memorable. (I think everyone who’s played this game loves Jorji). The dialogue is quite good, and has plenty of memorable lines.So what of the gameplay? It’s done in a single screen, divided into 3 portions. Roughly the top third of the screen is a top down view of the border checkpoint, the line, and the guards. This part isn’t used too often for gameplay. The bottom two thirds of the screen are divided as well, the left third presents a first person point of view from your place inside your border checkpoint. This is where applicants seeking entry to Arstotzka come in and give you your papers. The rest of the bottom portion of your screen is where you can look at said papers up close.Now this is the part of the game that I think is the hardest part to sell someone on, but I’m going to try anyway. When the game starts, applicants give you a passport, and so long as they are a resident of Arstotzka with a valid passport, they may enter the country. You simply stamp all passports with either “approved” or “denied.”At the end of the day you will be paid 5 credits for every person you correctly processed. The first two incorrectly processed applicants will earn you a citation with a warning and no payment, each error after that will also incur a penalty docking some of your pay. Citations are reset at the beginning of each day.During this end of day phase you will also need to balance your finances, and decide if you have money to pay for heat in your apartment, or to purchase food for your family. If you’re not able to take care of them properly they can die. If they’re all dead, or if you run out of money entirely you’ll get a gamer over (there are other ways to get a game over, in total the game has 20 different endings). So it’s important to do your job well.On day 2 things become more complicated, and foreigners may enter as well so long as their passport is valid. On each passport you have various things to check for, a valid issuing city, that their photo matches their physical appearance, and that it hasn’t yet expired.As the days go on more documents and rules will be introduced. I won’t go over all of them, but you will also have documents for entry permits, work permits, and you’ll need to crosscheck the name and passport number -as well as other information- on these documents with what’s printed on their passport. Sometimes you’ll also need to fingerprint an applicant, or search them for weapons or contraband (can’t let the drug smugglers and terrorists in). You’ll need to go over the documents carefully, pointing out discrepancies, and even giving a proper reason for denial. On occasion you’ll need to detain some of the applicants instead of simply denying them entry.That about covers the basics of the game, so let’s move on to the graphics. They’re done in a simple pixel style, they’re not anything fancy, but they are pleasant to look at, and they help set the dreary mood of the game.And it is quite dreary working this sort of job in an oppressive country, barely making enough to care for your family and survive. The music is good, and helps compliments this mood, and so do the sound effects.My main criticism of the game is levelled at trying to point out discrepancies. Now, it’s not that I have issue doing this, I enjoy it. No no, my issue is that while you know which rule is broken, it’s not always clear how to properly point this out. Once you do figure it out, it’s a non-issue the next time you must deny someone entry for the same reason, and it’s not an issue most of the time, but it happens occasionally, and there’s not really a good reason for it.In the end though, Papers Please is a fantastic game. If you’ve not played it yet, hopefully I’ve been able to convince you to give it a go, if you’re on the fence though, I urge you to gamble on it anyway, wait for a sale even if you wish. Just make sure that you do play this game.Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												A fantastic game from 2013. I wasn't able to play it until i had the urge to use steam as i am primarily a PS3 player, but i watched a bunch of youtube videos of people who played it and it looked great then. While it may look bland upon first glance; you are a border inspector checking passports and documents to decide who enters and who leaves and it isn't the best job to have in real life. In the game however this job becomes interesting as you encounter various characters that can affect you and events that you can choose or choose not to take part in. All of which change the course the story takes.I like how the game presents choice in the game. It isn't in your face about whether or not you should or shouldn't take part in the situations you come across and whether or not it is good or bad like the decisions in many bioware games. So if your roleplaying as yourself in the game you make the decisions you think are right. Or you can roleplay as something else and do what the character you are roleplaying would do. The atmosphere and asthetics feel right. The simple graphics give it an old time feeling that go well with the setting in the game. The main theme and sounds throughout the game are unique.The only bad thing i can really see about the game is that it may get repetitive on multiple playthroughs in the story mode as many events take place on the same day everytime. Although you can set yourself some challenges to spice it up a bit like a no mistakes playthrough. You may notice the same npc's in the same playthrough as well. Although you can set yourself some challenges to spice it up a bit like a no mistakes playthrough. The game has an endless mode as well so events are randomized and there are other game types in there.Overall it is a fantastic game to playthrough at least once just for the experience. It may not be appealing to some people but give it a shot.Glory to Arstotska! And Jorji!			"

												Context is everything in this game. You need to get money to look after yourself and your family in a country with a ♥♥♥♥ed economy. That's it. For the actual premise of the game (Literally checking immigration papers), it's surprisngly really immersive and absorbing. Can easily play for hours at a time.Visual style and story progression are both very appealing, the story and events following will change according to the players decisions within key events.A must play indie title.

												When I first turned on Papers, Please...I wasn't sure what to expect, I hadn't watched any videos about the game or even read very much about it. It was a Humble Bundle pack-in and I thought it might be interesting.I was absolutely right. Papers, Please is easily one of my top games of ALL TIME. The gameplay begins as simple, but gradually becomes more and more challenging as the game carries forward. Small subplots twist and turn the otherwise very straightforward storyline...There is a good chunk of comedy relief as well (Lolibutts loves you Jorgi), and a little heartstring pulling here and there. There are also 20 different endings. Which is pretty damn cool if you ask me. Overall, I'd say give this game a try if you're in the mood to try something ""Different"". It can get frustrating at times when the slightest detail was overlooked and costs you credits or just ups your citation count...but luckily you can always replay the day later. Addicting, fun, and just plain original. Glory to Astolska. 9/10			"

												Papers, Please is a game where you cannot judge the game based on gameplay alone, because let's face it - when has checking papers at a checkpoint ever been any fun? That's the point of the game; you do it because it is telling you a story - the story of a man who despite juggling responsabilities provided by a corrupt government and a terrorist organization; has to do his job to help his family survive. The story can and will go in any direction depending on what you do as the inspector, and even tests your own morality and ability to bend the rules for others in desperation.It is a gritty, unshaven and spirit-crushing masterpeace.

												Well then.  I feel like this will forever occupy the spot of ""A game that no sane person could comprehend without playing"" and anyone who tries to describe it will sound like either a madman, or the most boring man in existence.  Yes, it's a ""Paperwork Simulator.""  Or as Yahtzee put it best, a ""Beurocracy 'em up.""  And yet it genuinely is something worth trying.  I doubt it will enrapture everyone, it's definitely for the ""Art Game"" demographic - but it gets its point off well, and is a surprisingly engrossing thriller of sorts and there's a weird charm and atmosphere that takes you in, and while its still best played in short bursts - it doesn't get as repetitive as it might seem either.  It's not going to appeal to everyone, but if you want to try something that just might surprise you - this is a good offering at a nice price.			"

												Papers, Please is definitely an addicting game. It has 20 different endings, so there is replay value. Your first playthrough will really be entirely getting used to the system and to be as quick and efficient as possible, in order to maximize how much money you make everyday. Additionally, as a Passport Control Officer, you have to make decisions which will affect your character's, and your family's lives. Whether helping take down the government by letting terrorists through, letting people take vigiliante justice, denying people entry even though they may be executed if they return to their home country, or personally killing people to provide for your family. This is not ""Passport Control Simulator."" In this game, you really have to pay attention, and it is good for your brain, because you have to juggle multiple documents at the same time and remember dates and so forth off the top of your head on the fly. Not only that, it realy makes you question what you would do in these circumstances; help others at your family's expense, or only look out for yourself. Though it will get dull rather quickly, it is definitely worth the few bucks it costs.			"

												HIGHLY recommend this game. Essentially, in this game you play as a border agent who has to examine passports and other official documentation to determine whether a person is allowed entry into your country or not. The game starts off relatively easy and slowly progresses into a more complicated game as you progress. If you mess up, you'll be deducted pay at the end of the work day and your family will undoubtedly suffer as a result. While it sounds rather tedious and repetitive, it does suck you in. Before you know, you've wasted 6 hours trying to provide for your family while watching out for illegals.			"

												Once again, another staggeringly unique title is pulled out of the seemingly endless hat of indie game concepts. This time in the form of a disturbingly farmiliar dystopian society known as Arstotzka. While it may seem like the monotonous, dull drone of endlessly stamping passports; Papers, Please is a game of moral conflict. In the world of Papers, Please, you play as an unnamed protagonist, a mid level beaurocrat, working in a border checkpoint that seems like a parallel to East and West Berlin in the 80s. We can only assume these countries are roughly based on the Soviet Union or other Soviet influenced republics. The graphic style has an appropriately grey and muddled appearance that fits the situation very well. The gameplay is deliberately dull, which may be difficult for some to appreciate. As you go down the line, you begin to work in a rhythm. As you gain this rhythm you have satisfaction for catching frauds and it becomes fun in a droning, dull way. Later into the game you may look up, horrified, and realized that you have become a cog in the machine. You have begun processing people and are shocked with how you can dehumanize them in such a way. Sometimes you want to help others, but your family is still barely hovering above the poverty line. How can you keep them alive without accepting bribes or perhaps sending a poor traveller back to their home country where they will die because they do not have the correct papers? That is the beauty of Papers, Please or better yet, that is what is ugly and disgusting about Papers, Please; but we love it so.			"

												I work in security, and do this job on a daily basis, and even I find it difficult to scan through documents fast enough to turn a profit in this game. Perhaps I'm just in the habit of being too thorough, having been trained to check, double-check, and cross-reference every piece of information I collect.That said, this is an otherwise excellent execution of concept, and does a good job of putting the player in a difficult spot. Very few games are going to make you choose between feeding your starving children and risking a prison sentence, and even fewer are going to succeed at making it fun.			"

												""Why not to take a trip to pass-dystopian 80s, and see all the might of Eastern Europe autocracys? Let's face together those lousy travellers and immigrants, as they wish to entry trough our strict borders. Get your documents ready, citizens! Check your passports, inhabitants! Make sure you have proper entry permits, foreigners! Or should we perhamps support our local conspiracy theoretics and shoot some arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, before they cross the line? We might also need to accept some of those bribe offers we're encountering to feed our starving families. Oh boy, my dear son's birthday is tomorrow, need to get a gift for him! But then we won't be able to buy any essential food or medicines tomorrow..."" The atmosphere of this game is over the edge.

												This is the best game about working at a border checkpoint in a Soviet nation in the 1980s ever made.Seriously it's surprisingly fun to stamp passports and very satisfying to ferret out inconsistencies in paperwork. And the saving system is incredibly forgiving, it's not as hard as it seems at first. A great example of what you can do with a good UI and an interesting concept.			"

												For one month in late 1982, you are an immigration officer who must allow those with valid passports to enter, and turn away anyone with conflicting, outdated, or falsified credentials.  Easy at first, but something new gets added to the mix each day during the intensifying conflict, paranoia, and border tension between two countries.  Do well enough, and you might just make enough money for you and your ailing family to survive the winter...but time is short, mistakes are costly, and increasingly harrowing dilemmas will present themselves.  You will likely learn something new about yourself if you make it all the way through, and it won't be a pleasant revelation.You should play it, it's awesome.GLORY TO ARSTOTSKA			"

												Very polite title, which I appreciate. Most other games are so aggressively named, but Papers Please has the decency to ask nicely. Especially good given the nature of the game and its depiction of a totalitarian police state with strict and unwavering border control regulations. Juxtaposition is a great word to play in Scrabble if you can get your hands on an X or a Blank. Just wait until somebody writes ""position"" and then add the ""juxta"" with the biggest look of smugness you can muster. That's my favourite part of Scrabble. My favourite part of this game though is the achievement you can get for being arrested for being too honest. That made me happy.			"

Not that this is that game necessarily. #99 - You like pressing flashing red buttons with words like ""fingerprint"", or ""search"" on them.#100 - But mostly, you like stamping stuff.			"

												I didn't buy this last time I'd seen it on sale, but it had certainly peaked my interest. I bought it this time and I'm glad I did!I wasn't really expecting much of this game, but it ended up being splendid - simple yet wonderful. You have a choice no matter the situation and you have up to twenty endings you could end up with (reminds me of those stories when I was a child with the multiple endings, can't remember what they're called). Most of the endings seem to require different sacrifices you have to make along the way and give a realistic insight to the life of a border officer. It explores not only moral issues but corruption, blackmail, terrorism, bribery, etc. which is honestly a good portrayal of today's society. Following the rules to a T or being honest will not give you a good ending. As each day moves forward, you are introduced to new daily tasks, many of which might be unfair to the person crossing the border. You get plenty of different people - some who are obviously crooks and some who just want to be free of their old country or visit a family member. There's a secret organization trying to infiltrate your country as well and whether you decide to help them or not, the consequences might never be the same. I don't know. It's entertaining and makes you ask questions. I think that makes this game a very good one, despite how repetitive it is. You're at least engaged with the central story and your life, your family's lives, and countless other families' lives depend on your decision, whereas other games like this might not make you have such conscious choices where so much relies on said choices, which really makes Papers, Please stand out.Definitely recommended.

Papers, Please manages to make what would seem like a midless task mean lots to the player, all while presenting new challenges and thrills throughout the game and managing to be terrifyingly immersive. This is the only game where poor controls can be described as intentional, and they are, to make the grinding task of passport-stamping intentionally tedious and frustrating. Even as a humble worker, you feel powerful as you stamp the papers of endless npcs, some of which contribute to the story. While it won't appeal to those gamers who want nothing but the finest gameplay, the aesthetic, story, message and overall tone of Papers, Please draws many to enjoy it. In fact, the strenuous task of paperwork shuffling can actually become fun and addicting to perfectionists like myself.While short, there are 20 endings in the game, 3 of which are considered ""good"". Obtaining my desired good ending is one of the most rewarding thigs I've experienced from a game.10 dollars is a bit of a stretch for those who don't know what they're getting from this game, but I would reccomend it to absolutely anyone on sale.

												This is a very interesting game. The depressive world and story mixed with that intense music, a game i've never played before. It's very difficult and challenging, it requires all your concentration to not miss a tiny detail on any of the given papers; this game is for open-minded people who like very challenging, brain straining games. I really enjoyed the flow of the game, and loved the story changing characters, which appear ever so often, as well as all the other little details put in it. While intensly working on checking data from the papers, you always have to be ready for a terrorist attack or some other event which may come unexpected. I also especially like the moral choices (which do not have influence on the story), for example, will you accept the wife to get to her husband even though she doesnt't have correct data? Will you accept bribes for people with not enough money to get the needed papers? Then there are bigger decisions that may change the complete story of the game, which I will not give an example for, because they might contain big spoilers. This game is definitely worth checking out, if you don't want to buy it, you might as well check out some videos on the web.			"

												Papers, Please is a punishing puzzle with an inventive story, told in a unique manner.Hopefully that didn't scare you off. It's clear that this is an indie game; most big publishers would be scared off by the game's punishing yet fundamentally repetitive gameplay. However, anyone who enjoys brainteasers and an excellent story will be impressed with Papers, Please.The game, which takes place in an Arstotzkan border checkpoint at East Grestin, is based on sorting through papers. Does this person have all required papers? Are the papers valid? Does anything about the documents conflict with something else? These, and other new complexities, are difficult to understand at a glance, so game difficulty is no problem (though I haven't tried the Easy Mode yet). New twists, often caused by events at your own checkpoint (Kolechians are temporarily forbidden from entering Arstotzka following a Kolechian terrorist attack), are introduced, and often moral dilemmas arise, as bribes, anti-government rebel agents, and star-crossed lovers (Ooh-la-la) are frequent occurences on this border. Money troubles also appear, as you must maintain your family of four (fun things like ""Your wife, uncle, and son died"" are treated with little fanfare).The depth of the story (which has 20 endings) is (quite) deep. The unique method of storytelling, where you see just a snapshot of the lives of travelers, is enough to recommend the game on. The gameplay is interesting, but loses much of its appeal early on. For one to look at this as an incredibly difficult and intense virtual novel would be a good summary, and if you enjoy those types of things, then this could be one of your favorite new indie titles. For gameplay first, story second players, the game is likely to bore you, as the story is the real selling point here.			"

												Papers, Please is a game about the morality of beaurocracy. It's not necessarily fun; in fact, I think it's generally experienced as either mundanely boring or extremely stressful, but it's extraordinarily rewarding. You play as a border checkpoint inspector overseeing the entry of immigrants, returnees, and visitors into a fictionalized analogue of East Berlin under the Soviet Bloc, and the game follows your everyday life in your job over the course of one month. You have a family to feed and the political situation is worsening. On the first day, your job is easy: the checkpoint has just opened, so you only have to let citizens back into the country and keep everyone else out. The next day, the restrictions loosen and foreigners can be let in if they have the correct documentation. Soon terrorist attacks stop your days short and the security requirements tighten. From there, things get complicated.There's basically two parts to this game: you have to figure out what you're ""supposed to"" do and what the correct protocol is, and then you have to decide whether or not you should do it. Rigidly following the system of often sexist, transphobic, racist, classist, or just generally heartless beaurocratic policy will leave you facing the human results of those actions, but be too kind and your family will starve or you might be sent to prison. There's 20 different endings reflecting the variety of ways in which your actions can influence the game world, a standard RPG feature these days, but perhaps uniquely all of the most powerful moments in the game come on the way to those endings and not in them. It's a hugely moving and interesting experience, and the utilitarian faux-Soviet aesthetic of the thing never breaks for a second. One of my favourite games of all time.Glory to Arstotzka. Cause no trouble, friend.			"

I feel like this will forever occupy the spot of ""A game that no sane person could comprehend without playing"" and anyone who tries to describe it will sound like either a madman, or the most boring man in existence.  Yes, it's a ""Paperwork Simulator.""  Or as Yahtzee put it best, a ""Beurocracy 'em up.""  And yet it genuinely is something worth trying.  I doubt it will enrapture everyone, it's definitely for the ""Art Game"" demographic - but it gets its point off well, and is a surprisingly engrossing thriller of sorts and there's a weird charm and atmosphere that takes you in, and while its still best played in short bursts - it doesn't get as repetitive as it might seem either.  It's not going to appeal to everyone, but if you want to try something that just might surprise you - this is a good offering at a nice price.			"

												Papers, Please has to rank up there as one of my favorite gaming experiences of the year. You take on the role of border passport inspector for an impoverished East German-esque dystopia. Your job is to check each applicant's paperwork, verify their authenticity, and either approve or deny them entry. The graphics and gameplay are incredibly drab and monotonous, yet there are many well developed underlying story arcs, truly difficult moral choices, and an ever present sense of oppression that gives this game a unique and amazing feel all its own, and makes it hard to walk away from until you see it through to one of its many (usually grim, or at best, bittersweet) endings.This is a tough game to describe and sell to friends, because at its core, it's a paper-pushing bureaucracy simulator with pixelated graphics and a depressing mood, but it is so, so much more than that (trust me!). If you like games, or you even like a really interesting (and not too time consuming) experience, you owe it to pick up this jem for its bargain bin price.Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												Who would have thought that doing something as boring as managing a border would be so fun? Honestly, I didn't think there was any way it could have been entertaining. Oh boy was I proven wrong real quick. It's micro-managment, loophole searching and timed frenzy gameplay all at once. Do you try and rush through to get more people through in a day and risk missing something? Or perhaps take your time and make sure your making the right choice letting this person through? Or just through all of the rules out of the window and let someone pass because they give you a story about their family waiting for them on the other side of the checkpoint and make your own sob story worse? And speaking of story, it has to be one of the best game narritives in recent past with all of the people interactions and ending you can get. All in all, don't judge this game based on what it looks like because it is so much better than that. It's fantastic.			"

												Many games and companies claim to be inovated or trying to push the norm and being progressive. In the past Nintendo were the biggest innovators pushing the gaming industry with new ideas on how to play video games. The past few years the gaming industry has seen little to almost no new ideas since the wii came to store shelves. All of this is important because you won't see innovation from some big company; you will find it from some indie developer called Lucas Pope. A man who used to work for Naughty Dog Studios working on the beaten to death series Uncharted broke free and decided to do his own thing.    This game just surprised me from every aspect and I just wanted more and more. The gameplay consist of reading things carefully and making sure everything matches to what it is supposed to be. If things don't match or seem fishy you will deny or detain a person. Sounds easy at first but you must do all this under a strict clock. You get money for every person you deny or pass, but you do thing wrong and you get fined for it. And you need this money to pay rent, feed your family, keep them warm, and healthy. You can barely get enough money to do all of these things for your family. You need to manage your money very carefully.     This game is maybe one of the best games I played in my life. It is so different and original and it does it all in such a fantastic way. I highly reccomend everyone to play this game if you ever get the chance. I only wish more games to take such new approaches to gameplay can come out sooner.			"

												This is one of the most unique games to come around in many years.  A cold war based theme set in 1982 where you decide on the entrance of people into your country, the ""Glorious"" Arstotzka.  The game difficulty starts slowly as you check the validity of people's documents at the border. This continues to build as more complex events occur adding more and more information to verify and new methods to test the stories of the masses.  At the end of the work day, you are paid by how many people you processed and penalized for mistakes made.  Your money is used to support your family, providing as good a living as you can for the necessities of life: Rent, food, heat, medicine.  It is a serious challege to process as many as you can while not letting criminals, terrorists, and other ""undesirables"" into your country.A word about the graphics:  they are intentionally low end to give the feel for what games were back in the 80's.  Nevertheless, what gamers often times fail to remember, it is the imagination that is the most important piece of play.  Many of you will recall how the BEST and most fun you had as a kid was when you had a tree branch sword, a pine cone grenade, or a fort made of boxes.  This frame of mind is nearly lost on the current generation as graphics have all but stunted their ability to dream and pretend.  This game deserves a look for the price, currently $5.  Those of you who remember the cold war era will laugh at the feel of the game, while those who do not may find that they actually have a great time with it as they strengthen ""the muscle of their imagination"" that has been dormant for perhaps their whole lives.  Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												Papers please is a funny great game which can make you lose hundreds of hours in. Definetly recommend this to anyone who loves strategy and humor. It is up to you to dermine who can get by the border into the country. Tons of different options to chose from and the game evolves with the story. Will you feel sorry for those you have fallen or hard times? Or is your families well being more important. Papers, Please tests your human morals to new levels.Amazing game. Great story highly recommend.			"

												When I first turned on Papers, Please...I wasn't sure what to expect, I hadn't watched any videos about the game or even read very much about it. It was a Humble Bundle pack-in and I thought it might be interesting.I was absolutely right. Papers, Please is easily one of my top games of ALL TIME. The gameplay begins as simple, but gradually becomes more and more challenging as the game carries forward. Small subplots twist and turn the otherwise very straightforward storyline...There is a good chunk of comedy relief as well (Lolibutts loves you Jorgi), and a little heartstring pulling here and there. There are also 20 different endings. Which is pretty damn cool if you ask me. Overall, I'd say give this game a try if you're in the mood to try something ""Different"". It can get frustrating at times when the slightest detail was overlooked and costs you credits or just ups your citation count...but luckily you can always replay the day later. Addicting, fun, and just plain original. Glory to Astolska. 9/10			"

												Arstotzka is best country. Help defend Arstotzka against Kolechian filthy terrorists. Do not fail, or a new inspector will be found. Glory to Arstotzka.In all seriousness, this game is fantasic, an instant classic. While the idea of a game based on how detailed you can be may not seem too apealing, the game is much deeper than that. In the post-war corrupt communist county of Arstotzka, every day is a struggle to survive, both for you and your family. However, you are not the only one you are looking out for: A man makes it through the checkpoint, and his wife follows, but does not have the proper paperwork. Do you let her through, accepting the consiquences, or do you destroy a family? Do you assist the mysterious group claiming to try to overthrow the corrupt government? Do you allow a potential terrorist through, if his bribe is good enough to buy medicine for your son? All of this geniously squeesed into a simple choice: Approved or denied.			"

												It is a dark age of communism.  Your country has just ended hostilities with its neighbor and are now allowing travel into the country.  You are in control at the Berl...I mean Grestin Wall.  Not by choice, but by threat of death if you are not able to provide for your family or if you even inadvertantly perform the tiniest act that may be traitorous.  Slight missteps result in citations that take away what little money you are paid to support your family.  Enjoy the great communist pasttime of:  Food or Heat?  Will your family starve or freeze?  All up to you in this dystopian masterpiece that is a lot better than I have described.  Yet it is exactly as I described it, but for some reason it is one of the most addictive games I've played in awhile; fair warning, it can be repetive and menial and I have some minor OCD which could be why I enjoyed it.

												Papers, Please has to rank up there as one of my favorite gaming experiences of the year. You take on the role of border passport inspector for an impoverished East German-esque dystopia. Your job is to check each applicant's paperwork, verify their authenticity, and either approve or deny them entry. The graphics and gameplay are incredibly drab and monotonous, yet there are many well developed underlying story arcs, truly difficult moral choices, and an ever present sense of oppression that gives this game a unique and amazing feel all its own, and makes it hard to walk away from until you see it through to one of its many (usually grim, or at best, bittersweet) endings.This is a tough game to describe and sell to friends, because at its core, it's a paper-pushing bureaucracy simulator with pixelated graphics and a depressing mood, but it is so, so much more than that (trust me!). If you like games, or you even like a really interesting (and not too time consuming) experience, you owe it to pick up this jem for its bargain bin price.Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												'Papers, Please' is not easy to describe. It isn't what most people would consider a traditional game. There are no points, and winning or losing isn't as black-and-white as you may be used to. You could categorize it as a bureaucracy simulator or an everyday survival game, and that wouldn't necessarily be wrong, but it would definitely miss the point. 'Papers, Please' is — at its heart — an adventure game.Though everything takes place from within a tiny border checkpoint, the game's drama and tension all comes from the decisions you're forced to make. You'll never feel more anxious stamping a piece of virtual paper than you will when playing this game. You will legitimately hate your supervisor, and you might even care about the people who pass through your little booth.TL;DR: Get this game if you're looking for insightful, clever political commentary.

												HIGHLY recommend this game. Essentially, in this game you play as a border agent who has to examine passports and other official documentation to determine whether a person is allowed entry into your country or not. The game starts off relatively easy and slowly progresses into a more complicated game as you progress. If you mess up, you'll be deducted pay at the end of the work day and your family will undoubtedly suffer as a result. While it sounds rather tedious and repetitive, it does suck you in. Before you know, you've wasted 6 hours trying to provide for your family while watching out for illegals.			"

												A friend of mine once remarked that there's no way to describe this game that still makes it sound fun once you've explained it. By all reason, Papers Please shouldn't be as much of a good time as it is. You serve as an unnamed male citizen of the Arstozkan Empire, employed by lottery to rigorously scan and verify documents at the newest border crossing station in your dystopian, communist nation circa the 1980s. The names are all changed, but you essentially control Checkpoint Charlie at the Berlin Wall, and it's your job to make sure illegal immigration in your sector grinds to a halt. If you fail, your impoverished family will starve and freeze even worse than they already do.But in spite of all its Cold War doom and gloom, Papers Please is a wonderfully intricate and engaging experience. The charm and humor of its characters, such as the permanently cheerful Jorgi Costava or the irascible Dimitri (Your supervisor, who stops by to inform you how bad you're doing each week) draws you in with each passport you process. Soon, you're reading your employee handbook to pass the time, determined to serve your country well and provide for your family. Or maybe you begin working undercover with the resistance, smuggling revolutionaries into the country with falsified papers. Or maybe you set up a smuggling business with a few regular border-crossers, and plan to flee the country yourself. With 20 different endings to unlock and hundreds of stories to hear, Papers Please is unique kind of game; one that defies the genres of the medium and forces us to think differently about our entertainment. I highly recommend you pick it up. And remember! Always read the daily bulletin!Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												Set in a dystopian world. You have ""won"" a job at your country's border. You stamp passports, granting or denying entry to people trying to get into Arstotzka.Sounds dull? Well, it's actually incredibly addictive. This game is innovative and surprisingly fun--albeit rather grim. The game is presented as a story that takes place over 31 playable days (there is also a endless mode that can be unlocked). As the story progresses, stamping passports becomes more and more complicated and there will be moral choices you must make. There's even a fair amount of replayability, as you can get different endings depending on what choices you make throughout the game.The only thing I found irritating was how incredibly nitpicky the game can be sometimes. But it's still very fun and very addictive.Highly recommended if you want to experience a game that is different.			"

												A fantastic game from 2013. I wasn't able to play it until i had the urge to use steam as i am primarily a PS3 player, but i watched a bunch of youtube videos of people who played it and it looked great then. While it may look bland upon first glance; you are a border inspector checking passports and documents to decide who enters and who leaves and it isn't the best job to have in real life. In the game however this job becomes interesting as you encounter various characters that can affect you and events that you can choose or choose not to take part in. All of which change the course the story takes.I like how the game presents choice in the game. It isn't in your face about whether or not you should or shouldn't take part in the situations you come across and whether or not it is good or bad like the decisions in many bioware games. So if your roleplaying as yourself in the game you make the decisions you think are right. Or you can roleplay as something else and do what the character you are roleplaying would do. The atmosphere and asthetics feel right. The simple graphics give it an old time feeling that go well with the setting in the game. The main theme and sounds throughout the game are unique.The only bad thing i can really see about the game is that it may get repetitive on multiple playthroughs in the story mode as many events take place on the same day everytime. Although you can set yourself some challenges to spice it up a bit like a no mistakes playthrough. You may notice the same npc's in the same playthrough as well. Although you can set yourself some challenges to spice it up a bit like a no mistakes playthrough. The game has an endless mode as well so events are randomized and there are other game types in there.Overall it is a fantastic game to playthrough at least once just for the experience. It may not be appealing to some people but give it a shot.Glory to Arstotska! And Jorji!			"

												Frankly, this game is masterfully done. The idea is original, the graphics fit the claustrophobic and choking atmosphere, the music enhances the idea of a smothering government regime in which the player finds himself as both citizen and employee, and the stories told through the window of your booth are engaging and develop themselves with intrigue and secrecy. It's hard to find where this game could be improved. It's something that works so well as a game, and as an educational experience that it could almost be used in a teaching environment. The idea that a citizen of this government would be placed into the position they are, allowing or denying various people access to their country, seeing the amount of paperwork involved, watching the rules and regulations pile up and change over the course of time leading to frustration, being faced with the moral dilemmas asked of them, and deciding how to handle their allegiance to country versus their conscious and compassion for other human beings is something that truly isn't captured as well as it is here with Papers, Please. I will say that the game is so well done, that it actually feels like work after awhile, which cuts into the fun factor, though it enchances the simulation aspect. It's almost hard to qualify it into a genre. The mechanics are crisp and clean, they build on themselves day after day, slowly increasing the difficulty by usually adding one or two additional rules, and eventually the player will find that they are totally immersed in the experience. It does feel like work after awhile though, so some players may actually be glad to 'punch out' after an hour or two of game play.This is a game that has  left me thinking about it long after I exit the program. It's something that reaches a state where it's actually more than a game, it's a slice of actual human life. This falls into the same category as This War of Mine in that it's an important game, and one that people should play with more in mind that just entertainment. Excellent, excellent purchase.			"

Quick Breakdown: A stellar game where you play as an inspector working at a border checkpoint between your communist country of Arstotzka, and the neighboring country Kolechia, which your country has just recently ended a 6 year war with.Length: 2-4 hours (Main game), 8-10 (Completionists)Score: 8.5/10Full Review: Papers Please is a truly unique game. Admittedly, it’s a pretty tough sell. On paper, the game sounds like it’d be awful. Even when I purchased the game, I wasn’t really sold on it, but I took a chance on it based on the ravings from my friends, and the low sale price of $2.50. After playing the game, I’m glad I did. It’s worth getting at full price even, but this is Steam, we all wait for the sales, don’t we?So why’s it a tough sell? Well, you play as an inspector at a border checkpoint. People give you their papers needed to enter, and you look over them and either let them enter your country,  deny them entry if their papers are not all in order, or even detain them if need be. Sound like fun? To me it didn’t, but maybe you can see the appeal there.So why is it worth playing? Odd as it may be, that very task I talked about in the last paragraph actually is a lot of fun. But there’s further reason that is even more compelling. You work for the glorious country or Arstotzka, at the checkpoint the border town of Grestin. The half of Grestin belongs to the neighboring country of Kolechia, which Arstotzka has just ended a 6 year war with. Your border checkpoint has just opened because of this, and people are once again allowed to enter Arstotzka for the first time in 6 years. This setting, and the people it brings through your checkpoint, and the events it leads to, are the game’s biggest strengths. You’ll encounter natives trying to re-enter the country, foreigners who can finally come to Arstotzka to work or visit, or even just pass through. There will also be terrorists, who aim to harm your glorious country, and it is your duty to deny and even detain them.The game’s story and dialogue are both well written. Your actions during the day (the gameplay portion, which we’ll get to in a moment) affect the story between days, and down the road. Both the one time characters passing through, and those who are recurring are interesting, and some even quite memorable. (I think everyone who’s played this game loves Jorji). The dialogue is quite good, and has plenty of memorable lines.So what of the gameplay? It’s done in a single screen, divided into 3 portions. Roughly the top third of the screen is a top down view of the border checkpoint, the line, and the guards. This part isn’t used too often for gameplay. The bottom two thirds of the screen are divided as well, the left third presents a first person point of view from your place inside your border checkpoint. This is where applicants seeking entry to Arstotzka come in and give you your papers. The rest of the bottom portion of your screen is where you can look at said papers up close.Now this is the part of the game that I think is the hardest part to sell someone on, but I’m going to try anyway. When the game starts, applicants give you a passport, and so long as they are a resident of Arstotzka with a valid passport, they may enter the country. You simply stamp all passports with either “approved” or “denied.”At the end of the day you will be paid 5 credits for every person you correctly processed. The first two incorrectly processed applicants will earn you a citation with a warning and no payment, each error after that will also incur a penalty docking some of your pay. Citations are reset at the beginning of each day.During this end of day phase you will also need to balance your finances, and decide if you have money to pay for heat in your apartment, or to purchase food for your family. If you’re not able to take care of them properly they can die. If they’re all dead, or if you run out of money entirely you’ll get a gamer over (there are other ways to get a game over, in total the game has 20 different endings). So it’s important to do your job well.On day 2 things become more complicated, and foreigners may enter as well so long as their passport is valid. On each passport you have various things to check for, a valid issuing city, that their photo matches their physical appearance, and that it hasn’t yet expired.As the days go on more documents and rules will be introduced. I won’t go over all of them, but you will also have documents for entry permits, work permits, and you’ll need to crosscheck the name and passport number -as well as other information- on these documents with what’s printed on their passport. Sometimes you’ll also need to fingerprint an applicant, or search them for weapons or contraband (can’t let the drug smugglers and terrorists in). You’ll need to go over the documents carefully, pointing out discrepancies, and even giving a proper reason for denial. On occasion you’ll need to detain some of the applicants instead of simply denying them entry.That about covers the basics of the game, so let’s move on to the graphics. They’re done in a simple pixel style, they’re not anything fancy, but they are pleasant to look at, and they help set the dreary mood of the game.And it is quite dreary working this sort of job in an oppressive country, barely making enough to care for your family and survive. The music is good, and helps compliments this mood, and so do the sound effects.My main criticism of the game is levelled at trying to point out discrepancies. Now, it’s not that I have issue doing this, I enjoy it. No no, my issue is that while you know which rule is broken, it’s not always clear how to properly point this out. Once you do figure it out, it’s a non-issue the next time you must deny someone entry for the same reason, and it’s not an issue most of the time, but it happens occasionally, and there’s not really a good reason for it.In the end though, Papers Please is a fantastic game. If you’ve not played it yet, hopefully I’ve been able to convince you to give it a go, if you’re on the fence though, I urge you to gamble on it anyway, wait for a sale even if you wish. Just make sure that you do play this game.Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												Amazing game, one that changes the concept of gameplaying and brings back 8 bit nostalgia. Expect more copycats after this title. I did have one problem when I tried to play the game on fullscreen... the mouse just doesn't click on the bottom half of the screen. Please advise if there is a solution to this. Great game nevertheless!			"

												On paper, (no pun intended), this game has a pretty boring premise. See how much mind-numbing paperwork you can process in a day to make ends meet. It sounds like a level of enjoyment that can be achieved through the use of Microsft Excel. However, clever storytelling, surprising character development and a difficulty curve that increases as the layers of beaurocracy stack up, make this game intriguing and surprisingly addictive.It is 1982 in a fictional slice of Eastern Europe. The player becomes a border control inspector in the nightmare totalitarian state of Arstotzka, turning away impoverish families into the cold because their visas are a few weeks out of date. Or maybe you want to play the good guy and let a few desperate people slip through the net? But you also have a family to feed, and in this communist society, your salary is paid based on how many people you process correctly in a day. Too many citations and you’ll be the one left out in the cold.The simplistic graphics of this game are more than just nostalgia. They add to the impact when something shocking and unexpected happens. Like that guy with shifty-looking eyes strutting out of the ticket booth and shouting ‘GLORY TO KOLECHIA’, shortly before blowing himself up and redecorating the wall with the innards of your security guards.Your moral choices can alter the stormy political atmosphere, re-unite friends and lovers and deliver justice in any way you see fit. For people don't just live in the country. They ARE the country. I think my only complaint about the game is that it feels dry, sinister and clinical. I know that it was designed to be this way, but it means I can't play for any more than a few minutes before I just feel ... dirty inside ... and want to play something brighter, more colourful and happy.Nevertheless, Papers Please gets 9/10 from me. Glory to Arstotzka, komrade.			"

												Lucas Pope's Paper's Please is an oddity, in that it's a ""Dystopian Document Thriller"". Reminiscent of Orwell's 1984, Papers Please takes place in Arstotzka, a fictional country that resembles an Eastern European country during the Cold War. Here in Arstotzka, you are a border checkpoint officer, looking over the passports and documents of all citizens attempting to cross into glorious Arstotzka, making sure they have all proper paperwork, whilst also making sure you family doesnt starve to death or get sick.Whilst this seems like it would make for a boring game, Papers Please is probably one of the tensest games i've played. It riddles you with moral choices, decisions that affect your future (and that of your family), and the stress of taking care of 5/6 individuals, being paid based on your performance. You have to decide if you are going to let you're family go hungry so that you can help you co-workers, or maybe not have any heating, in exchange for letting in one too many people whose stories touched you. Maybe you'll find yourself aiding a terrorist organisation, or even a vengeful father. Or perhaps you will stay a hardworking, productive member of Arstotzka, with all which that entails.Papers Please is an excellent game, with unique gameplay, hard moral decisions, a large amount of replayability and a fantastic audiovisual aesthetic. It is truly unique, and definitely a game that everyone needs to play. Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												Papers, Please is the game that made me think I'm a terrible person. This game simulates a life in a totalitarian regime where you work on the border, deciding people's lives.  If you do good and let people who don't have a passport but want to go over the border continue, your pay will be deducted. If you don't have money, your family will starve, and if you don't have money to pay the bills you will be arrested. On the other hand, if you don't help the people you will feel like you are a terrible person. I made this mistake once in the game, and never again. I destroyed their regime, saved my family, but alas my son has died.I would recommend this game to everyone to check their moral codex, and especially to people in rich countries, so they can know what is like living in poverty.

												First, I love the choice of graphics for Papers, Please. It captures what I remember from old point-and-click games. The overall feel is cold and oppressing, and the art supports that.On the surface, the gameplay is checking papers. The fun I had came from outcomes of how I dealt with residents, bribes, and assassination.What makes this game interesting is the morally gray area. You have to decide right from wrong, and it can be tough.The game is short, though it has 20 endings.I recommend Papers, Please because I haven't felt this game's vibe from any other game. The emotions are oppression to a degree, the pressure of decision making, and sometimes, tough luck.			"

												When I first heard about this game late last year, I thought ""how on Earth can such a game be fun?"" Now that I've finally played for some hours, I have to admit my first reaction to the game idea couldn't have been much farther from the mark. The background story is quite grim, having been influenced by the not so distant history, and this brings unforeseen depth to the game. However, humor is present as well, in the myriad funny details, cultural references, and indeed, the somewhat sparse unique characters. Even the cumbersome old smuggler who kept wasting my valuable inspector-time made me smile every time he trotted in front of the desk and started rambling cheerfully. The mechanic is quite ingenious in that it forces the player to make difficult choices: for instance, is it better to buy the essential supplies that are needed for the family to survive, or upgrades to the inspector's gear that, in the long run, enable the player to gain more money with which to secure their family's well-being? Choices that at first seem good investments in the future may turn out to be little more than shortcuts to an early grave, since a certain amount of randomness in the game's events ensures that each decision the player makes is laden with uncertainty. The carefully balanced mix of random and scripted events effectively create an addictive feeling that the player's actions have real consequences for the player's character and other characters as well. Well done.			"

												You have to buy this game, there's no option about it, if you have the money just buy it right now!This game forces you into a situation where you have to do your job near-perfectly to get enough money for your family to survive and be happy, but that involves screwing over a lot of helpless people in situations similar to yours! Will you work hard, not questioning the authorities and provide for your family; or do you make a sacrifice to help the common folk? That's up to you! A lot of other things go on, but I'll leave you to discover that because it's pretty mind blowing on your first play through! (As the game says, it's a Thriller)The gameplay is also surprisingly fun for a game about checking over paperwork, it involves a lot of thought and skill! It is extremely unique and it constantly throws new rules onto your job based on the events that happen in the game world, changing up the gameplay and making it more interesting day by day! The game also has a lot of replay value, with many different endings you can achieve and lots of different ways the story can drive forward based on your choices each day. You can replay any day or start a completely new game at any time without losing the progress of later days, so they give you full freedom to experiment and retry when things don't go how you wanted them to! You see all these people saying that video games can't be an art form, and this game can't be further from the truth. After playing this, no one could deny that video games are an art form. Just buy it now because you'll love it and you need to support true innovative and artistic games. BUY IT! I'm waiting...Bought it yet? No? Why the f*** not!?			"

												Start playing this game and think it's easy.Spend 5 minutes in it and realise you're not paying attention, so you get a notice from the government.Begin to spend more time on details. The day is over.Notice how you earn less money because you took too much to inspect so few people.Basic needs like food and rent need to be paid.Get to work again and rush more people. Make mistakes; The government is all over you.This game is amazingly fun and a real exercise to your brain.Try to memorise all the provinces of the different countries (good luck) and the game will tip you off your chair with more government rules.Though some things are easy to check once you get the hang of it, when pressure starts to build up the game will break your concentration with some hilarious comments, love stories or pure  eyebrow rising momments from the immigrants.All in all, this game has simple repeat step X and Y to achieve goal, but all of those steps may or may not come for each of the immingrants you need to inspect, and even if they appear, they will be in a random order.This is what really makes you think. The game has Story Mode and Endless Mode.You will also have an option to enable ""easy mode"".			"

												This is the mosty addictively boring game in the world. It's billed as a ""dystopian document thriller"", and I can say it certainly lives up the title. You're a border inspector for the Great Nation of Arstotzka, and all you will do all day is check the papers of travelers who are seeking entry into the country. In the beginning, all you have to do is check for one or two things. By the end, there's a massive list of potential things that could be wrong with some of the paperwork. I didn't believe the person who told me this game would be super fun. I picked it up for 75% off during a Steam sale anyway, because they raved about how good of a game it was. When I tried it, I understood. It's extraordinarily fun. I can't recommend it enough. It's definitely worth the $10, but if you want to wait until it goes on sale, then it's even more definitely worth it. Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												This is the kind of indie game that I really like... it's obviously low-budget, and the graphics, interface and sound are totally old school. Yet, it doesn't matter, as the game itself is pretty unique and interesting... maybe even addictive.Basically, it's an exercise in concentration. Each day, your job as a passport-controller becomes more difficult. At first, there are like 2-3 things to watch out for. Each day, a new thing to observe and look out for is added, and so you need to remember more and more things to watch out for. Some of them don't come up for quite some time, but once you get too careless, you miss those things and fail. Fortunately, you can mess up a few times each day without having to pay a fee from your measly pay. Then again, the more complaints you get, the worse it gets, as there also is some kind of inspector who will judge your efficiency every once in a while. I recommend to write down the issueing cities from each region on a piece of paper... otherwise, you might lose quite some time checking every time. I have played this for 5 hours so far, in two sessions, and I notice that it really can eat away at your ability to concentrate, so I think this is best played casually... do like half an hour at a time so you don't burn yourself out.I really like the theme, as it DOES make you think a bit about how unfair the system in that country is, and you have to make some harsh decisions. There even are a few puzzles in there in the story-mode. Kudos to the developer... this is a fun little game, and to me, the old school graphics don't matter at all, as the core of the game is very well thought out, and it's fun!			"

												I wasn't really interested in this game when I bought it, nor did I really have a good idea of what it was.  My friend had said it was good, and it was on super sale.  Anyway...I wouldn't have thought that I would enjoy a game in which the main portion was scrutinizing papers, and looking for falsified documents, but I would have been wrong.  This game is loads of fun.It's unlike any game I have ever played for sure.  It's all about attention to detail, and you notice more and more as you play.  I feel like the skills I've earned in this game could even serve me in the real world.  You will learn to quickly scan and cross-check information for discrepancies. Everyday, more complications are added in various intriguing forms.The lives of your family depend on your performance at work, and it creates a sense of urgency.  The more people you process, the better you can take care of your family, but rush through it and you will start missing some of the most obvious mistakes.I'd go on, but I've hardly scratched the surface of this game.  If you think you have an eye for detail, and would like to put it to the test, then this is the game for you.  If not, try it anyway, because, like me, you might be surprised.  Feed your family.			"

												Papers, Please is an incredible game. It happens to be one of my favourites on Steam. The gameplay is always fun and engaging and is also rather addictive. The great thing about this game is that there is lots of replayability. The scenarios are always different, meaning that you will always be challenged, which is a great thing. Who knew stamping passports could be so much fun? So, for the love of God, please buy this excellent game.Glory to Arstotzka.			"

Short ReviewNarrative: Focuses on role-playingGameplay: Time Rush ""Match the Picture"" Point-and-ClickScore: 8/10Recommended: YesRecommended buying point: Any discount of 50% or aboveRecommended for: People who don't care about a game's length and more focused on the intensity of an experience it can giveDetailed ReviewThe NarrativeStory:You are the husband to a family of five, including you. You have been selected to work as an immigration officer in the border of the country. Basically, you are the paperwork inspector of the eastern side of the infamous Checkpoint Charlie[en.wikipedia.org].And that's it. You get a few snips of the immigrants' lives and story, and there is indeed a ""larger"" storyline that somewhat follows the historical Checkpoint Charlie, but the core focus of the story is you and your decisions. You have the greatest agency in the entire game: You get to decide the fate of all sorts of people and even that of the country itself! All through a bunch of bureacracy decisions. Of course, you need to remember that your decisions, ill-informed as it can be, also decides the fate of you and your family too. Rather than direct storytelling, the game puts a strong focus on storytelling through role-play.If there is one weakness with the story, however, is that some of the puzzles can be hard that it will lead you into searching for guides to solve them (an adventure game trademark, really) which would really break immersion in the game and story. The moment you stop making on-the-spot from-the-heart decisions with the scant information available and think of getting a certain achievement or ending, at that moment the game really lose its grip on you.Character:There isn't much of a characterization in here. As a character, the main character is 100% defined by your actions. You have a family, but they don't show up in the game - they barely even do anything other than being a bunch of mouth for you to keep warm, feed, and stay healthy - keep the alive as having all of them killed nets you a gameover. Some of the immigrants shows a certain characterization, but they are basically stranger which you only see for a few moments - as they are to you both in-character and meta-wise. The closest you have to legitimate characters are your co-workers.Most of the characters are just blank canvas for you to paint one - one person might think of one character as a jerk the other might think that he's not really a jerk. The focus in this game is in the role-play, there is little characterization so you fill in the blanks with what you think of them. Provided that you play this game completely honestly (which I recommend you doing until you reach Day 32/end-game once) then it can say a lot of interesting things about you. Apparently, I'm someone who can bend some rules and go against some moral and ethic codes so long as it isn't too big or if I need it. It is a rather interesting experience, and what makes this game really strong.The GameplayMechanics:The core mechanics of the game is basically similar to ""Find what's different with the pictures"" type of games. And easy comparison would be the Ace Attorney series of game, except this one is much more minimalistic in its storytelling, more focused in the 'courtroom' session, and less absurd or ""anime-ish"" but more grounded in reality.You are presented with a bunch of documents, you need to find what's wrong with it, and match it with the rules or the other data that acts as a reference for how they are wrong. You then need to find if the discrepancies were simply outdated data or if the documents really are invalid. If it was all cleared and there's nothing wrong with the document, you approve their visa, and if it's not, you can either deny them or detain them (the latter gives a small bonus). At the end of the day, you can choose if you want to feed your family and keep them warm or not, as well as whether or not to give them medicine if they are sick. You can upgrade the booth for some shortcut commands and you can move to a more expensive appartment at certain days (which does nothing except for getting one achievement). Other than the rents and fines, the bills are opt-out while the upgrades are opt-in.The game started rather difficult as there is a lack of tutorial - which admittedly does fit the image of the fictional country in that they demand nothing but the best from their workers. The game asks you to be constantly vigil and have a good memory about the rules. If you do not, then you might miss something that makes you get a warning from your superior or alternatively takes too long a time inspecting one immigrant meaning less immigrant processed and thus less money for you and your family. In a way, the core gameplay revolves around weighting your choices. Whether to rush the inspection out or to take your time, whether to be merciless or be nice, whether to accept bribes or not. The game focuses on these small moments and what it says about you. The gameplay mechanics are really just a vehicle for the role-playing part of the game, which is the main meat of the game.Overall, it's not really fun - and I'm sure it's not intended to be fun or at least not in the traditional way of fun - but it's good at what it's trying to do and it didn't overstay its welcome (you can finish this game in a single weekend, provided that you are good at it and know what you are doing). Although it is very annoying that many of the achievements are hidden and can be very hard to find unless you search a guide or the wiki (which as I said, can really break immersion in the game).Optimization:I was honestly surprised and floored by how light this game is. I would have thought that it would take a few hundreds megabyte, but then I saw that it only took about 50MB when I was downloading the game! And I have a rather old computer and to my surprise, it ran smoothly despite how I was opening a bunch of Chrome tabs and Notepad++ (with five open documents in it). My guess is that this is because of the very traditional art-style and how a lot of its contents are procedurally generated except for some few scripted encounters and dialogues in the game.The AestheticsGraphics:The graphics is very traditional - it wouldn't be out-of-place in the NES console. In terms of fidelity, it's pretty high in fidelity in spite of its look, and it could clearly show everything that is needed. The art style was rather drab, but it fits the tone and theme of the game, as well as that of the setting. If there is one thing I have to criticize out of the graphic is that the in-game photo and the game's sprite can often looks rather different, leading to some confused moments. Not much to say other than that - it does its job and that's that.Sound:There isn't much to say about the sound department. It has about two or so music and about a dozen or so of SFX, and that they do the jobs they needed to do. The music sets the mood pretty nicely but is otherwise not notable, especially since during the main segment of the game they do not have any music at all (the music are only on the main menu and ending, I believe). The sound effects were okay - very minimalistic but nothing out of place.]Final Verdict:8/10 - Overall, this is a very good game not in the gameplay but because of how immersive and bleak in can be. Is it worth your money? Well, if you want a lot of milestone from your games, then I'd say Maybe with capital M, but if you are searching for unique and interesting experiences, however, then I would definitely recommend this game. If it has a discount of 50%, then I strongly recommend buying this game.			"

												At first, I was skeptical of Papers, Please, and felt a little silly explaining it to friends. I was pleasantly surprised how ever at what a wonderful and immersive concept it turned out to be. Yes, you are checking papers at a Border Checkpoint. However, you soon come to find there is more to it than the mundane stamping of passports. As days go by, terrorists attacks occur and it is clear that a more strict border regulation is needed. So, mostly each day, a new rule is implemented that you must adhere to. But then, then there are the people. Jorji... Ah, I'll let you experience this gem for yourselves. There are choices you have to make though. You must make these more decisions based on what YOU think... Will you let the wife pass with her husband even though she doesn't have proper papers? Over all, this is definitely worth the price and I would pay for it if it were more.			"

												Unbelievably grim, sad, depressing, almost frustrating game. The world you live in has real stories, your decisions will have irreversible consequences, not only to the people you decide upon, but your own consience. Should you take care of your sister's daughter after your sister death, when your own child have no food for 3 days now? Should you let a wife of a just passed-through traveller, to enter when her papers are not correct, knowing that any penalty can cause you to have no money to pay for heat and your own wife is sick at home? Even your desk does not have enough space to put on all the papers that you need to check...A magnficent game, one of the few games that can really TEACH something to you and your kids, how real life can be sometimes, and at the same time, enjoyable with interesting twists in the storyline that makes every decision you make count until the end. It is so amazing that this simple but well-polished game was developed by a single indie developer.			"

Not all games should be about fun! --- Pros --- Good storytelling Art style and music Will make you feel the feels The puzzle aspect of the game keeps changing/adding rules --- Cons --- Slow Boring Clumsy interface (this are not actually cons read below for further explanation)You play the role af an Inspector on a border checkpoint and your job is to put stamps on passports... You gain little to no money from your job and have to provide for your family.... You will see many people wanting to cross borders in hopes of getting a better life but you find a discrepancy on their documents and you reject their entry... because its your job!For this facts some might say ""Papers, Please"" is a slow, boring game with clumsy interface... and i will not argue with that...That is its purpose! And by doing this it makes it the most humane game i ever played! Your character is as miserable as the people trying to cross the border! From doing a monotonous and meticulous job to having to toss/move papers around, everything makes it belivable and brings you in to the reality of their dystopia!I found myself laughing, saddened, puzzled and even mad while playing the game. What more can you ask of a game?Mandatory: GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA! "

												Papers, please is a unique and interesting game, you're basically a one man border control and trust me, it gets more interesting...Just looking at someone's face and seeing if it matches the passport photo isn't all of it, a lot of minor detail is included so that you have to pay attention carefully such as expiry date on the passport and region they are from etc. Don't worry, you get a warnings if you get it wrong but any more than 2 mistakes and you get fined.As you progress through the story, it's gets more challenging and there is more specific requirements thrown at you such as workers have to present a valid work permit and certain documents are needed.When you finish work, you get your pay and you have to feed your family, pay for heating and if your family is ill; medicine.The worst part is to make wise decisions, such as sacrificing heating for your sons medicine, if you don't pay for the medicine, your family member might die and thats pretty depressing since your salary is quite low.Although it might sound boring, there is an actual storyline to it, some events happen and your choice of actions might change the story a bit. You'll be glad that everyone you meet are different.Also, you can get some grumpy people who can♥♥♥♥♥♥you off or you can get people who are desperate to migrate because of war and they beg you to let them in even though they don't have a passport. Decision making is pretty heavy in this game.Overall, its interesting and fun game. I recommend it to those who have some time to kill and those who want pursue a border control career ;)			"

												A great game which enables the player to make his own choice which has very concrete consequences on the storyline ! One may think a lot before making his choice, each leading us to one of the 20 possible endings.			"

												One of my favourite games so far! Storyline is rich and art style is oddly charming and the intro music is engaging to say the least. Discovered it through the Jacksepticeye playthrough series on YouTube. Only real critisism would be that after day 22 the gameplay really does become very difficult, and the majority of the possible endings to the game aren't very imaginative. Other than that, this is definitely worth trying out!			"

												Papers Please is one of the most unique and interesting games you can find on steam, not only is the gameplay addicting and interesting but the overall storyline, endings and possible outcomes make this game a must have. This game also has incredible replayablilty making you just want to keep playing it over and over again to either get better, waste time or find all the secrets. Another outstanding fact about this game is how much it makes you question what sort of person you are, will you do your duty to your country and do as they request? Or will you let in people who want to get in to escape their horrible past? Overall this game is definetly a 9.5/10 from me.			"

												Papers, Please is a repetitive but challenging indie game where you act as a border control passport inspector. The goal of the game is to let the qualified people pass and reject the inqualified people. Every day there is a new set of rules or addition to the rules making each day still challenging and fun. The game is challenging at first to learn of the different conditions and what each is (such as the passport nations). However later on it becomes more of a ""spot the error"" kind of game. If you get 2 wrong, you will not be penalized, but if you get 3 wrong, you will start to lose money. At the end of every day you can devote your money to different things such as heat and food. However, if you chose not to devote money to those for long enough, bad things will happen to your family which is dependent on the money. If you go into the negatives after a day, you get arrested and it is game over.Overall pretty fun game and has a fitting soundtrack that plays when the game gets to certain points.Rating: 8.6/10			"

												Unbelievably grim, sad, depressing, almost frustrating game. The world you live in has real stories, your decisions will have irreversible consequences, not only to the people you decide upon, but your own consience. Should you take care of your sister's daughter after your sister death, when your own child have no food for 3 days now? Should you let a wife of a just passed-through traveller, to enter when her papers are not correct, knowing that any penalty can cause you to have no money to pay for heat and your own wife is sick at home? Even your desk does not have enough space to put on all the papers that you need to check...A magnficent game, one of the few games that can really TEACH something to you and your kids, how real life can be sometimes, and at the same time, enjoyable with interesting twists in the storyline that makes every decision you make count until the end. It is so amazing that this simple but well-polished game was developed by a single indie developer.			"

												Papers, Please is a very strange and difficult to rate game. You are an immigration officer, charged with determining who to let into the fictional Eastern European communist country of Arstotzka. Even the genre of the game is rather hard to pin down; ultimately, the game boils down to trying to find inconsistencies in the papers, making it a puzzle game of sorts, but it somehow lends checking people’s paperwork an air of great gravity and tension, even if the actual activity itself is rather boring.I don’t know if you can really say that Papers, Please is a fun game; there is a great feeling of tension throughout, and yet also of monotony. Somehow, you feel obligated to keep your faceless family members alive; somehow, you feel like the question of a bribe is a real one that has real weight; somehow, you feel like what you’re doing is important. And yet, ultimately, you’re just checking paperwork and determining whether or not to let people through based on the paperwork and your own feelings about the situation.It is definitely an engaging experience, but I'm not sure if I can really say that I had fun playing it, apart from the interactions with Jorji and the tasks I did for EZIC. But I still played all the way through without putting it down.			"

												""Why not to take a trip to pass-dystopian 80s, and see all the might of Eastern Europe autocracys?

Make sure you have proper entry permits, foreigners! Or should we perhamps support our local conspiracy theoretics and shoot some arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, before they cross the line?

Not all games should be about fun! --- Pros --- Good storytelling Art style and music Will make you feel the feels The puzzle aspect of the game keeps changing/adding rules --- Cons --- Slow Boring Clumsy interface (this are not actually cons read below for further explanation)You play the role af an Inspector on a border checkpoint and your job is to put stamps on passports... You gain little to no money from your job and have to provide for your family.... You will see many people wanting to cross borders in hopes of getting a better life but you find a discrepancy on their documents and you reject their entry... because its your job!For this facts some might say ""Papers, Please"" is a slow, boring game with clumsy interface... and i will not argue with that...That is its purpose! And by doing this it makes it the most humane game i ever played! Your character is as miserable as the people trying to cross the border! From doing a monotonous and meticulous job to having to toss/move papers around, everything makes it belivable and brings you in to the reality of their dystopia!I found myself laughing, saddened, puzzled and even mad while playing the game. What more can you ask of a game?Mandatory: GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA! "

												I only picked this game up since Zero Punctuation's Yahtzee recommended it. After all, what sane person would get tingly below the belt for what is essentially a paperwork simulator? Well I would for one. Begin the story mode and you immediately have to start working to earn enough to support you're family you've never met while being careful enough not to get cited, fired, or imprisoned! And as simple as that may seem, there are so many possible things to watch out for, and so little instruction, that you will mess up completely on you're first run. Combine that with the high stakes for you and your family and you've got plenty of tension and atmosphere. Also the constant oppresive music is a nice touch.			"

												While the first glimpse says to a store-wanderer ''boring, boring, boring'', this idea is completely false. Papers, Please is the complete opposite of boring.Taking place in a fictional semi-corrupt semi-just-want-MIA-members-kept-in-place country named Arstotzka, you play as a border control agent, accepting or denying job-seekers, immigrants and criminals. While this game's first few hours/minutes (depending on how quick your fingers are and how long it takes to strain them dragging documents around your messy desk) are quite dull, the people I saw in just that little amount of gameplay made me rage, laugh and stare. This is a brilliant attribute as it jolts the brain and your emotions to a flying start. Time to time the game gets harder and more time-consuming, but still follows the same laugh-rage experience. It also displays attributes of a shooter - you will sometimes see a terrorist attack and have the power to stop one at your protagonist's twiddling fingers. It also gives you opinions and puzzles (including the bomb some idiot thought would kill off an inspector and all the guards surrounding him), like managing your expenses and doing whatever it takes to not be arrested for giving a single document to the police. While this isn't too frequent it still makes you happy there's a change in the game and you have some freedom. Graphics-wise the game is pixellated, but looks lovely at the same time. This style fits the time the game was set, as I just thought, considering it is set in the 80s, a time when 8-bits were first introduced. It also displays musical talent, and the theme makes me want to go on a march in synchronization with it. So, overall, I'd say Papers, Please, from such a simple idea, turns out to be one of my favourite games of all time, and I congratulate Dukope for making such a brilliant game. 10/10. Glory to Arstotzka.			"

Papers, Please manages to make what would seem like a midless task mean lots to the player, all while presenting new challenges and thrills throughout the game and managing to be terrifyingly immersive. This is the only game where poor controls can be described as intentional, and they are, to make the grinding task of passport-stamping intentionally tedious and frustrating. Even as a humble worker, you feel powerful as you stamp the papers of endless npcs, some of which contribute to the story. While it won't appeal to those gamers who want nothing but the finest gameplay, the aesthetic, story, message and overall tone of Papers, Please draws many to enjoy it. In fact, the strenuous task of paperwork shuffling can actually become fun and addicting to perfectionists like myself.While short, there are 20 endings in the game, 3 of which are considered ""good"". Obtaining my desired good ending is one of the most rewarding thigs I've experienced from a game.10 dollars is a bit of a stretch for those who don't know what they're getting from this game, but I would reccomend it to absolutely anyone on sale.

												This is a game that stuck with me and told a grim yet realistic story. While the graphics aren't spectacular and it's not the high intense gameplay you can get from other games, this is a game that took a mundane job and made it into a political commentary. I was skeptical initially thinking that a paper pushing game would be easy and I'd get bored of it. In reality, it was the opposite. The game's difficulty progressed with the story line, or in other words, the levels of bureaucracy and trying not to get too many citations. It gets harder when you have to deal with terrorists and providing for your family. The historical backdrop of East and West Germany (ofc in fictional terms) made it even more realistic and moving. This game  impacted me and it is a true masterpiece.Of course, it is not flawless, at times it can feel a bit repetitive and while you can have many endings (20 in fact), it's hard to replay it immediately (better wait a few months to try it again). In short, if you'd like a break from an FPS and try to be an immigration inspector then this game is for you.Glory to Arstotzka.			"

												Papers, Please is one of the most innovating and impressive games from this year. Being a sort of point-and-click game, Papers, Please excels in the way it uses it.You take the role of an Arstotzkan border controller who regulates the border checkpoint in Grestin, Arstotzka.You must earn money by doing your job accordingly and with as few errors as possible in order to feed and protect your family, as well as keeping them healthy and living under a roof.The game focuses on the basic mechanics of point-and-click, but uses this mechanic in a very different way by allowing the player to check entrees' passports as they attempt to enter the country of Arstotzka. Your duty, as border controll, is to make sure that only people with valid documents enter the country.If you make any errors, small amounts of your salary will be held back, and you may even allow in a terrorist if the person that you allowed entrance carried a bomb and you forgot to x-ray them because they had expired documents, for example.The game has a very simple art direction, as well as a very simple sound design. Lucas Pope, the creator of the game, really nailed it with Papers, Please, as he created something inspiring, entertaining, and very different.Papers, Please is one of its kind, and is one of those rare indie games that you should defnitely try out.The only complaint I have is that the main story is too short, but even so, the game has a freemode and so you can continue to play on without focusing on the main story, even though the main story is crafted in a specific way and has its own events, the freemode is very fun too.No more needs to be said.Glory to Arstotzka.

												The concept of this game could be deemed to be somewhat repetitive, however the main point of the game is to make the  player think. Finding the discrepancies between the documents can be quite engaging at times, as you have to make sure that they follow the rules that are set out. Following these rules such as remembering what is and what is not allowed, stamping documents can be challenging and for the first time possibly overwhelming, however the more you play the easier it gets and you will have a better experience. The pixel art style works well for this game as it gets you to focus more about the task at hand rather than the graphics shown. This game is definitely one to play if you have an hour or so to pass.			"

The game is also excellent for keeping you on edge and questioning your morals. You'd be surprised as to how many different endings the game has. "

												With over 20 hi-standard awards achieved already, Papers, Please is seriously ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES  published in 2013.It's old-school, it's innovative, also imo beautiful in a classic way in its brutally simple appeareance and it made me laugh out loud few times (can't remember when single-player made me actually laugh :D). The concept itself is let alone just brilliant but when laced with a great storytelling in which player can impact and with a gameplay that enhances the back-to-the-childhood feeling you get, Papers, Please is one to remeber. Just the ancient-sounding theme music brings an amused grin to your face - a reminder of the good old times. This is not easy game by any means, requires some brains and sharp eye but not in an annoying way. I found the difficulty very fitting and enjoyable. Papers, Please may not offer something to play for a very long time right away (depends on person), that said it will surely exceed its value by far anyway in the hands of an average gamer. On the other hand I can see myself returning to this game in future, similarly as with e.g. Max Payne, DOOM, etc. I do not want to give spoilers - one's has to experience this game like it happens in it's story - out of the blue. As I fancy 2013 not a great year regarding to game releases I am glad I have now something to remember and to recommend to fellow gamers. Glory to Arstotzka!			"

Not only the player can experience what it is like to serve as a desk worker, players also had to make moral decision that often go against the book. It is also players' decision to earn money through the rat tunnel to help your own family lives a little more bareable. Truly a cruel and realistic storyline.Glory to Arstotzka.			"

												Papers Please is the perfect example of gameplay and idea, over graphics.  In this day and age, we are forcefed fantastic graphics over what normally turns out to be marginal gameplay.  This game may not win any awards in the graphic and sound department (Indie game title), but the gameplay is surprisingly eclectic.  Without spoling anything, you are solely responsible for the admission of people in to your glorious nation with communistic undertones.  What seems like a very simple idea, quickly becomes nerve-wracking as you balance the wishes of your government with the need to maintain your family.The interface is functional, it does what it sets out to do.This game claws at your personal ethics and viewpoints, and challenges you to do it efficiently.  The only reason I have not played more, is due to being snowed under and having limited game time.  I suggest you prove me wrong.			"

												There will be several instances where, throughout gameplay, you will yell out, ""I do not have enough room to do all of this."" -- and this is exactly the game's purpose. Working for a totalitarian government is not supposed to be easy, nor is it supposed to be accomodating -- in fact, it is simply exhausting. It feels like work, it is work, and by the end of your day, you feel more and more broken down. The first rejection was hard, then the 500 more just become a statistic; their faces become blurs; their stories become muddled; your morals become bland. Their pleading for your mercy only becomes time wasted to accumulate enough money to feed your family for the day, if they are still alive that is. Friends are murdered, families grow sickly, and the innocent with nothing more than a typo on their passport are hauled away to a place only God knows of. ""Papers, Please"" is nothing short of brilliant, where you will be stunned as to how a pixeleated game could conjure such visceral emotions out of you -- thereby also realizing that effective storytelling is never a matter of graphics.5/5			"

How could someone in their sane mind create such a disgustingly addicting game.  This game is more addicting than Angry Birds, Candy Crush, and Flappy Bird all mashed into one sandwhich put together on a plate of annoying gold!!!!  This game is also very difficult!

												Papers, Please is one of those very pleasant, tiny surprises that comes along every now and again. And I do mean tiny: 30 megs tiny. That's four times the price of an iTunes HD episode for less than one-fifteenth the size, but believe me when I say that you'll spend more time on this game than you ever would watching any episode of any TV show.The power of the game lies in its simple and complex art style and moral elements, respectively. Your position sees very little of any colour other than greys and blacks, probably reflecting that the morality that the game pushes you towards. Almost your money goes to rent, food and heat for your family at the end of each workday, and you get paid by how many people you process correctly. This would normally just serve to give the players incentive to pay attention and not ♥♥♥♥ up, but the game has the simple trick of any citizen just claiming what any citizen would. Maybe they want to get into the country to see their family or reunite with their significant other, and turning them away means breaking that. Of course, letting them through means you might not be able to afford heat this evening.The game has problems, sure. If you're not the type for it, the morality system falls completely flat and you just don't care, because there's no real penalty for simply doing your job aside from citizens calling you an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in 16-bit text before disappearing forever. The booth upgrades aren't very helpful, and I can't say that this is the most thrilling game to play if you're playing on a stationary rig that can run many more exciting, if not as compelling, games. That being said, it is still surprisingly engaging for its size; I found myself able to play it (before I bought the Steam version) in class for sometimes hours at a time, just processing and processing over and over. And its size and almost non-existant graphical tax means that no matter your specs, you could run it.In conclusion, it's more than worth recommending. The phrase ""Simple, yet elegant"" is thrown around a lot but it really does find a place here, amongst the endless passports and tickets that will inevitably clutter your desk. If you're the type for it, pick it up anyway, but if you're on the move a lot and switching computers, frequently finding yourself with nothing to do, I couldn't recommend Papers, Please higher. It takes some real talent to make a job that should be boring fun and captivating, and that's just what Mr. Pope has done.Final Score: 8.5/10			"

												This is a game I quit half-way through, probably never will play again, but yet recommend strongly.As a foreword, bear in mind that I am an oversensitive wuss that gets uncomfortable by the random killing I commit when I play a GTA game.The game puts you at the forefront of the misery and violence of the modern world : the visa check-in. It will resonnate strongly with whoever had to be familiar with such situation.Fellow reviewer Brandon Cackowski-Schnell stated on multiple occasions he was amazed and scared at how the game turned him into a robotic mostly uncaring machine, just to protect those dear to him. In my case, the reaction was the exact opposite : I couldn't cope with the harshness of the job and so I did what I love to think I would have done in real life in such a position : I quit. (Please don't ask my in-game relatives what happened of them ;)In that sense, as Dark Souls, I think it truly can be the closest you can get to a real role-playing game on a computer.			"

												Papers, Please is a strange game.  The gameplay is entirely monotonous: someone hands you documents, you cross check these documents against a set of ever changing rules, point out any discrepencies, repeat for several hours.  Despite the seeming simplicity, PP is incredibly addicting and I ended up completing it in a single sitting, something I haven't done with a video game (even short ones) since high school.  Maybe it's the moody atmosphere that's as disturbing as it is darkly humorous.  Maybe it's the idea of having absolute authority over the lives of these virtual citizens.  Whatever the case, PP is worth every cent.			"

												Papers, Please is a great game that I don't really enjoy playing.

For me the draw to this game is how bleak and unfair it is, in regards to making the right decision both morally and to progress through the story.

												I’m not going to sit here and say Papers, Please is an artistic masterpiece, as those terms get thrown around far too often in this industry. The game isn’t perfect, but is more than interesting enough to overcome its downsides. If you’re looking for something truly unique in the modern swamp of AAA titles, Papers, Please will definitely fill that role. At $9.99, it’s a low-entry oddity that tells a compelling story about failure. And who knows? You might just experience a newfound perspective during your stay in Arstotzka.			"

												Papers, Please is an indie game developed by Lucas Pope, in which you play an immigration inspector whom is working at a border checkpoint in a country named Arstotzka . The goal of the player is to inspect documents using a set of tools and in some occasions to inspect the individual per se, in order to keep criminals out of the country . Everything is a bit unknown, until it will be disclosed , the more you play .  Every work day, you receive a document with informations about particular things you have to notice about, the arrival of important people and/or if you have to take some measures if a specific occasion happens, like having to do body scanning to all civilians who belong to the country of Kolechia . We also have a rule book all the time, so we can know what is allowed in the documents we inspect and if there are any discrepancys, you have to reject the entry to the person and later on, if you want, arrest them . A situation with a spy, terrorists and smugglers with not be uncommon, and you will decide if you will let them pass by, because you can bribed and even threaten . After a day of work, you receive a wage, which depends on how well you did your job, and you will have to decide where your wage will go, some option include 'food', 'medicine' and 'heat', also as you progress in the story you will be able to choose to move to a better house, but it will also have bigger expenses . You also have freedom of will in basically everything since the game changes with your decisions . Be careful too, this game will play your emotion and will play mind games with you, sometimes you must choose between doing your job or doing the right thing sometimes, there will be families slip apart because of you, but if you decide to let someone passe the border without the correct documents so he or she can be with her/his family, you will face the consequences . Your gaming experience with this game could end in 20 different ways, each occur depending on what decisions did you take in a certain way because you actually have a lot of choices throughout the story, some of them may include, being part of a conspiration group named EZIC against the government of Arstotzka, accepting bribes and even saving money on medicine or food, which will let to the starvation of members of your family .  This game is worth all your attention, since its incredibly addicting, has a great plot and the gameplay its really original, you will not regret it .Glory To Arstotzka! ~ 10/10			"

												'Papers Please' is not just a game, it's a complete art statement. This simply looking game impressed me more than many good books and movies i enjoyed lately. And for sure it raised some thoughts and ideas. Also i find very amazing and inspiring the fact that this game was made entirely by one person. I would really be happy to be as talented as this guy.			"

												Bizarrely addictive considering its premise, this game is half puzzle, half survival simulator. Essentially you're given a changing set of rules of varying complexity and have to compare the passports and other documentation of immigrants to your brutal Communist home country. Enjoy features such as your wife, son, uncle, and mother-in-law dying as a result of cold, hunger, disease, or any combination of the three as you fail to bring home enough money to save them all. You're going to lose in this game, but there's a lot of fun to be had in the process. Highly recommended at a sale price.			"

												I must admit to being wary of all these 8/16-bit graphic games. But Papers, Please is surpisingly good. It could have been made 20 years ago. Regardless, it feels very playable, which is most important. There's even a slight touch of humour in there. Well done to the developer. Recommended.			"

												You never knew how much fun working as a border office can be. You live in a soviet-inspired country in 1982 that faces threats of terrorism and revolution. Its your job to look out for forged papers while the story unfolds, the dangers get more and more and the things to look out for get numerous. It can be feeling quite depressing and desolate, as your family is starving and/or sick at home if you don't make enough money (for instance, letting people through that weren't supposed to go through will give you penalties). But it is fun in its own way. Glory to Arstotzka.			"

												The banality of evil shown beautifully. And nothing is more banal than powerless beaurcratic simulation. I guess, it's technically a puzzle game. Yet somehow, despite its subject matter, it's compelling and pleasing to play. Papers, Please is one of the best pieces of sociopolitical commentary in games.  It is /the best/ example of mechanics-as-message I can think of. I don't know if you'll like it, but you should play it: it's astonishing. And if you're games designer, it should be mandatory. There's no quick time events here, chief.			"

												I never would have given this game a chance had my boyfriend not been streaming it on Twitch.  It's not necessarily a ""fun"" game, but it is entirely too addicting!  You shuffle the papers, try to keep your nose out of trouble so you may keep your job, and support a family including your wife, son, uncle, and mother-in-law.  But along the way you have to make some moral choices, such as allowing a woman across the border to see her son, or allowing a woman to immigrate with her husband though she doesn't have the correct paperwork.  This game is all about balancing being a decent human being and trying to save your own skin and that of your family's, who are depending on you.  It's a test of what you'll do to help others, while also trying to help yourself.  Get good enough at the game, and you may be able to do both.			"

Posted: December 12, 2013
												What kind of person am I?I like to think I’m loyal to my friends, as honest I can possibly be, hardworking and generous. Everything I keep around in my life seems to point to those things to some degree. I’ve had the same friends since elementary school, I try to be as upfront as possible even when it can knock me down, I get consistent work from quite a few outlets, and I like to give my time, my love, and even gifts. There’s a beautiful joy in doing that. In fact I love giving people presents more than I get them.So I must be a good person, right? …Right?But what would I be if circumstances were different? What would I be if, say, I had a sick family that counted on me to get medicine, pay for food, make sure the amenities were paid for and running such as heat, or simply paying rent to keep a roof over our heads? Would I be as honest? Would I be as loyal? I like to think so, but given my time playing Papers, Please, I’m starting to wonder about myself.This PC game is a self-described “Dystopian Document Thriller”. I prefer the term “Dystopian Emotional Rollercoaster That Rips Out Your Morals, Waves Them In Front of You and Laughs While You Pretend You’re Not What This Game Lets You Be”. But I can see why they went with that one. It’s a bit easier to roll off the tongue.You start the game as a rookie Immigration Inspector working at the newly acquired border town of Grestin after a six-year war with the neighbouring country of Kolechia has finally ended. The game begins on a positive note – you’re given a job, an apartment, and a seemingly easy enough task. You check over immigrant documents – much like a border guard does – and make sure the person coming through is clean.How is this done? Cross-referencing ID cards with passport numbers. Matching pictures, making sure no document has expired, questioning minor discrepancies, checking their permits, etc. Normal things most of us have experienced one time or another just on the other side of the screen.When I played for the first 10 minutes nothing seemed odd to me. It was just a different kind of puzzle game with a unique outlook. Rather than find the right pieces to mash together, I looked over documents and cross-referenced them with my Immigration’s rulebook, just to be safe. All in all, a pretty uneventful first day. I turned away some people and let others through.Day two was when I realized this game was, as Michael Caine would say about Batman, something more.I started my morning off as usual: I walked over to my booth, checked over notes my government had left for me, and proceeded to call in the first person wishing to enter the country. This was when I noticed the atmosphere this game is just oozing out its pores. The colour pallet is somber: blacks, browns and dark blues cover just about everything. On the top half of the screen is a bird’s eye view of the border. There’s my booth, a few guards, and a massive line-up of immigrants waiting to cross. Here’s what caught my eye – each person has no identity in that line. They are just a black silhouette. Another cow in the herd. I can’t connect with a person who has no face, so I don’t. Given the depth of this game and the sheer brilliance in its questioning of humanity, I know this was an intentional design choice. Emotion can only tangle logic and affect your decision. Or perhaps it’s not my view of them, but the government’s? I’m still not sure.When I called in my first person to inspect, a black silhouette slowly dragged themselves over inside my booth. In steps a small man, standing just about 5 ft. tall and he hands me nothing. He tells me about how proud he is of Arstotzka and he excitedly recounts his itinerary. I ask him for his passport and immediately the excited tone goes away. “I need one?” “Yes.”He promises to return with a passport and apologizes for wasting my time.I found it a bit odd, but oh well, I moved on and called for the next person. In comes this tall, skinny woman and she hands over her passport, work permit and even slips me a card for a nightclub she says she works for. She tells me to call and let her know if I’ll be stopping into town and her girls will take care of me. I left the card on the counter and started reading her documents. Her passport number seemed OK, the names on the permit and the passport matched, she said would be staying to work for two months. Everything seemed hunky dory. I stamped an approval on her papers and gave them back to her and told her not to cause any trouble.She smiled and walked past me.As I call in the next person to inspect I notice this woman’s black silhouette isn’t moving in the same direction the others did. Instead of taking a right and heading off screen, she turns left and walks towards the border guards. Suddenly, the game stops. This woman takes out a grenade and tosses it near her and the guards. Before anyone can do anything it explodes, killing her and the three men on patrol. The game fades to black.Oh god, what did I do? I’m responsible for that? Was it game over?No. Up pops a newspaper headline about a bombing from the Kolechian terrorist that I let through. The deaths. The terror. It’s all there. Then the game fades back in and guess what? It’s day three on the job. I failed, but the game isn’t over. That’s just part of it.It turns out I made a mistake and had my paycheck docked some. So I couldn’t pay for medicine for my sick son and food for my family.This is when I started to pay attention to the game a bit more. Each person in the line-up wouldn’t have a face until they were in the booth with me. When they were, I was so crazy about not having another terrorist come through I would detain anyone – anyone – who looked at me wrong. Work permit says you’re here for three months but you said 7 weeks? Search and detain. That way I’m cracking down on enough people to lower the odds of a psychopath getting through and getting a few extra dollars. I was fine with this procedure and thought I would be good doing this for the rest of the game.(Gah! There's a word limit I hit. The rest of my review can be found on my blog at http://gamesnshit.wordpress.com/).			"

												Buy it now. This game may not look like much, but it is the most unique expierience I ever had in a game. You are selected by a lottery to work in a border checkpoint in the glorious country of Arstotzka and you spend 10 minute ""days"" checking peoples documents and either accepting them or denying them. Each day the difficulty raises, whether it is having to watch out for criminals or stop terrorists who are attacking the checkpoint. At the end of the day you have a home screen. If you didn't process enough people, you may not have enough money to buy heat or food for your family.This game shines with the people you process. In between the hundreds of people you process in your checkpoint there are little stories that are told. A basic one that you get very early on is that a husband has the required papers but his wife doesn't. The wife pleads to let her in and it is up to you. Do you go against your new rules and risk getting fined, or do you deny her and leave the family seperated (I denied her, Glory to Arstotzka!). Later in the game deeper stories uncover, including a plot to overthrow the government. Everything can change for these digital people because you decided one of two choices. It is amazing.There are 20 different endings and an endless mode after you beat the story once. Overall this is one of the best indie games I played and I recommend it to everyone.Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												I really loved this game. Going into it I had only bought based on some recomendations and it's low price, but it's already consumed a good couple hours of play and looks like something I'd go back to. There's something viscerally entertaining about working a dead end buerocratic nightmare of a job, maybe just that it makes your real life one seem less dire. DEFINITELY worth a buy while it's on sale, mayhap worth one at full price if you have a penchant for detail and routine oriented games.			"

												WOW!! I was a little hesitant to buy this game because it looked limited and repetitive from the preview videos, but I already spent more time playing it than most of the indie games i bought before. The possibilities in this game are surprisingly huge and the replay factor also. And beside all the dark theme and the dictatorial society themed, the game is very cute with all the little ads, coins and drawings you have to handle. An indie masterpiece. 8/10			"

												Papers, Please is an exciting game where you are playing as an volunteered inspector in a fake Communist country called Arstotzka after a six year war with Kolechia. Because of this you may experience a terrorist attack if a Kolechian passes. The game feels real and when I play it I feel like its really my duty to make sure everybody passes the border correctly without making any mistakes. What makes it feel more realistic is how you don't forget you have a family and you have to take care of them by making sure they are healthy, they have food to eat, and you have to buy things for their birthday. Even if you do have a crappy computer/laptop you can still play this game because you aren't moving around or going anywhere. The graphics are in 8 bit so that makes it better if you have a bad computer. You sit at a desk and make sure people pass the border without flaws. In some parts of the game you may have to go back levels which isn't very happy to find out, but it just made the game better for me. And even though sometimes you may be a bit low on cash you can turn on easy mode and earn an extra 20 bucks a day/level. Also, the music in this game makes it even more fun and playable. The only flaw I could find is, how nobody really likes you besides your family, Jorgi, and a guard. So on a scale of 1 to 10, this amazing game deserves a 9 out of 10.			"

												Papers, Please is good. It has travel documents and good manners, what more could one want.

The more people who buy this, the more the world will be ready to donate to my future kickstarter for my point-and-click game version of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, set in glorious real time. Yes, it will have 3652 rounds of NG+ mode! And once that is a massive success, I will funnel my efforts into a full blown FPS version of Cancer Ward where you play as the head doctor of radiotherapy who blasts cancer zombies with a powerful X-Ray gun. The twist? You've got cancer too! This leads into a final boss fight where you're sucked into your own body to fight The Malignanton, where you gloriously triumph. ""You're in remission, ♥♥♥♥er!""

												Very fun little game. You play as a border inspector. After completing, I recommend replaying it with a different attitude - you can help mysterious underground or try to bend the rules for your fellow men or be the ruling party's lap dog - ""You haven't seen your son for 6 years? Well tough luck grandma, that entry permit expired yesterday. ENTRY - DENIED! NEXT!"".Different actions have different results. ~20 endings.Try to get it at a sale, since after you finish the game 3 times (~15hours total) it has no more replay value - all the major events are scripted. So at normal price as of this day (~10€) compared to ~20€ for Starcraft 2 or Bioshock:infinite it feels like a rip off.There is some sort of endless/challenge mode after you complete the game, but it seems like working a second job with nothing to show for it...

												It may look simple and goofy, but it hooks you and keeps you! What seems like such a simple idea turns out to be a lot of work. The developer did an incredible job building in great details. This is old school border control. No computers to search through lists. Nothing more than the good old Mark 1 eyeball :) I think the decision to leave the lower resolution graphics was the way to go. The focus is the information, not the graphics. This game is only an incredible 40 MB - there are sprites in modern games that are bigger than that! This game is playable over and over and over again. Great way to kill some time and walk away.Great job!			"

												Clearly one of the best games I've ever played. It's not only a game where you check the papers of travelers and say ""DENIED"" if the papers are wrong. No, this game is about decisions and choices. You have to choice between the strict rules and your morally humanity. Papers, Please shows that the people who travel to your checkpoint aren't only what's their papers say. They are humans. Humans with fear and wishes. And you have to make the choice. And every choice has consequences, which guide you to one of many endings this game has. Nice soundtrack, many endings, good gameplay. This game is really worth the money.			"

												Well, this game was kind of sitting on my wishlist so one day I figured I would get it to see what everyone is liking about it, first i'll say this, for a simple game it holds a heII of a lot of weight on it.PROS:Story: The story is a little simple, you are a man who got a job at a border controll station into Arstotzka, some kind of Russian like country, you're job is to make sure that whoever doesn't have their paper work in order gets a ""Denied"" stamp, and who has it correct gets a ""Approved"" stamp.Money: You have to get money to care for your family, your son, father, wife, and *shiver* ""Mother-in-law"", how it works is every Deny you make you get paid, every Approve you make you get nothing (least I think you do), so you want to clear as many of those people as you possibly can.Paperwork: Yes, this game is basically a paper-work simulator, but it's a heII of a lot more than just that, theres a whole background network of stuff that happens, organizations wanting in, other countries Arstotzka can't trust, democrats who could be possible terrorists.Characters: The characters you meet are a little weird at first, like a guy who wants into Arstotzka but doesn't have the right paper work on him, or a woman who wants to go through the checkpoint cause her husband went first but she doesn't have the paper work to be allowed in, or the organization who wants into Arstotzka with their spies to see what's going on, choices you have to make and could have consequences.Choices: Throught your one/many playthroughs you'll have to have some choices, whether it be help or disregard the Organization, not or let the husbands wife through the checkpoint regardless to be nice, let that little d%$khead through even though you REALLY don't want to cause of how annoying he can be.  Be careful with what you decide to do, because one wrong move can mean you lost the whole game.  Honestly at times when I had to pick choices I was kind of scared, I was afraid of what the outcome would be, and since i'm on a timer I have to be very careful about what I picked.Paperwork/What Civies need: When you start off in the game, it's simple, every Arstotzkan is allowed in if they have the right passport, everyone else isn't allowed in, but later on the paperwork just starts piling up like crazy.  Permission to come in Arstotzka, permission to work, permission to go through, permission to go to the bathroom, permission to walk, permission to talk, it starts to get annoying at times, but after a while you start to notice errors in documents without so much as even blinking or going to the handbook.  But every once in a while even I end up screwing up the simplest of things.Pay attention to details: What I mean by this is you need to look at every little detail about the paperwork, the names of people, passports, expiration dates, the stamps, the city and district names, the persons height, their weight, their gender, EVERYTHING, don't overlook anything, if you think it's fine check it anyway, you'd be surprised.  Cause if the person misspells their name just once then it's off to the guys with guns and they go into the building people go into but don't come out of so much.Discrepency machine: This machine is basically a analysis tool and I like it a lot, say it's hard to read the screen and you can't tell if the persons name on the passport matches their entry permit or work permit, you hit SPACE BAR or click the button on the bottom right, click one name, then the other, it scans it for any errors and if it's clean you are fine, if it's a discrepency then a icon appears over the little ""Talk machine"" and you click on it (without going out of the discrepency machine) and it asks the person a question to whatever it was you scanned, sometimes you need to do fingerprints, others it may be a search.Upgrades: Your booth ends up getting upgrades that you can pay for, they aren't big, they are a little simple, like for the handbook for rules and country city names you have to manually flip through the pages, later you can buy a upgrade which gives it 'tabs' so you just click on the tab and get sent to the area you clicked whether it be rules or stamp symbols, or the deny/approve slider, instead of clicking it you get a upgrade where you hit TAB and it comes out automatically, hit TAB again to put it back, and for the discrepency machine you hit SPACE BAR to bring it up, and SPACE BAR again to put it away.CONS:The Citation Error Machine: I hate this f#$ker with all of my heart and soul, I call this thing the ""F#$k Up"" machine, because everytime you f#$k up, it makes this irritating noise and comes up saying what you missed or didn't look over, and after a while I sometimes want to just throw my monitor out of the damned window.  Yes it's annoying but atleast it tells you what you missed or didn't look at, good job Arstotzka, I feel great that a machine can do my job better and yet it's free.  This thing is basically a invisible scanner, on the way out of the checkpoint it scans the person for if they had everything correct or something wrong and tells you what it was.Endless Mode: This isn't in the cons section because it sucks, it's a little fun actually, especially if you play the Papers, Please theme while you do so, you can pick what you want to do and how much paperwork is required to pass, but honestly after a while it can get a little dull, what I think they should have done is put some kind of randomized game in, where you pick how much paperwork is required but you don't know what could happen, the guards could all die from a terrorist or something if you accidently pushed someone through who had incorrect permits or something, seriously, would add a lot of replay value.Easy game overs: I only beat 1 of the 20 endings that there is but you need to be very careful about what you do SPOILER ALERT, at one point if you let one of the Organizations spies in you get 1k, yes, 1 thousand bucks, but if you keep it and don't use it or something the government takes it and puts you in jail, as well as your family members.  Another time was I had to let this d*$khead advisor for the checkpoint, make me let a woman through yet she wasn't supposed to, and I forgot the woman's name so I ended up putting her in jail, then I got ANOTHER game over, and it gets annoying to have to resort to previous days and go through ALL the work again and try not to let the f$%k up machine go off just to get to a certain point.WHAT I THINK: I think this game is something very special, it's so simple yet so amazing all at once, ""EA would never make something like this, infact it would probably remind them of their Customer Support Services."" = Yahtzee Croshaw.  All and all though, it gets a damn good 9/10, minus the f$#k up machine and some things I think would have enhanced the game, it's pretty damn good, but i'm sure after you get all of the endings it could get a little dull.  This game is totally worth it as it sits and when it's on a sale.			"

												Papers, Please is an utterly brilliant game that really shouldn't be. You play as an inspector on the border of the 'fictional' country Arstotzka, which has just emerged from a 6 year war with it's neighbour Kolechia, located between the now divided cities of East and West Grestin. You job, should you be chosen to accept it, is to inspect immigrants paperwork and ensure border security as ever more complex rules are placed on those attempting to cross the border. Somehow Papers, Please manages to capture (What I imagine to be) the monotony of the day-to-day goings on of a border checkpoint whilst somehow making it fun to play. The game is surprising engaging, presenting moral choices that will often force you to choose between doing your job (and thus being able to provide for your family) or helping someone out and facing the potential consequences. There is also a sub plot throughout featuring a shady organisation looking to destabilize the government. GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!			"

												I was actually very surprised by how immersed I was in this game. I bought it on a whim because it was in the autumn sale and I heard some things about it so I thought, ""Why not?"". You start the game off and listen to the really catchy music with the title going slowly upwards as it bobs to the rhythm of the music. I thought the music was also very thematic as well, telling me the kind of setting I would be playing in, so that's a plus. Okay, then I started a new game and, at first, it starts up kind of slow, showing me what to do and how to use the certain controls in the game. I'll get back to that in a bit, though. But just as I as getting bored with the game, thinking that it was becoming repetitive, it started to add story elements. On any random day the border can be attacked by a terrorist bomber or a group of them kill all the guards around the border and its up to you to take them out. And then there is also a secret organization that tries to get you to help them with their cause. It was all of these things that kept me interested in the game, more immersed. I really couldn't stop playing it because I wanted to see what happened next, if something even happened next. Well, I guess I also got a sense of satisfaction of being given the power to dictate whether a person can enter or not. Anyway, I thought it was a really good game, very creative because of its unique gameplay and style that it gave me. Plus, it also multiple endings! So you have tons of replayability if you're done with the first playthrough. I do have a complaint though. I just kind of thought that one of the upgrades was kind of useless. Like the 'double click to use inspection mode'. There was already another upgrade to activate it with the spacebar so I didn't think there was any need for that upgrade. I'm not sure what could've been in place of that but I'm sure that the creator could've thought of something. I would say the same thing about the book shortcuts but I found those useful so I'll leave that one be. Other than that, I had a great time playing the game. It required me to be real attentive and I think it actually helped increase my perception because sometimes there is just one tiny thing that you can overlook and you can get a citation for it. So you have to really pay attention to the dates, genders of the people, serial numbers, and even the cities in the passports that they're using. Sometimes they try to trick you with that so be careful. Also the dialogue with the characters can sometimes feel very natural so that is another aspect that can immerse you into the game. Now, Papers, Please definitely won't be the most exciting game you would ever play but it will pull you in with its unpredictability, interesting setting, and very intuitive gameplay mechanics. So if you're in the market for a PC game I highly recommend Papers, Please. If you are on the edge of whether or not to buy this, do it. You won't be disappointed with it at all, and it's only 9.99 so it's a really good price for what you get with this game. My rating for Papers, Please is a 9/10			"

												After only achieving4 of 20 possible endings I can say without a doubt that I will be playing this game a lot more. Thats after already spending 12 hours within about a week of owning it. It's not a game that is to be taken lightly though the tone of the game does jab a satirical finger into your funny bone. At first it seems like any other casual game with an amazing commentary on strict and overbearing political power. Then you begin to see the weight of your actions, how  every day could cost you your life or the lives of others (including your family). The people who communicate their needs and shortcomings to you in the checkpont are various and always fun to replay and try different responses. Its not hard to do what you want, but you don't always know exactly how the world of the game will react which is what make sit fun!Get this game as soon as you can even at full price. There is no way you can avoid enjoying this distopian world. GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!			"

Some travellers from certain countries always have their paperwork in order while other travellers from other countries always have the wrong sex or something on the passport. Then you'll have to take nude pictures of them and stuff. There are no beautiful, white women in this game. Only old, alcoholic russianish people. I'd pay good money for just a single nude, beautiful white woman to be there. With some golden hair and some firm breasts.

Wow. The human element.. the struggle.. the oppression.. it's so real!After playing this game for only an hour, I have never felt so invested in such an elaborate game that feels so.. real. (and you're just sitting in a border patrol booth the whole time!) Not only must you take careful precision in deciding the fate of desperate immigrants, careless citizens and cunning terrorists, but you must also do this as quickly as possible to earn the proper cash to pay rent and feed and hospitalize your own weak, precious family. You are literally playing with people's lives here!With this combination of panic-driven motivation and life-like themes of nationality and humanity (and even a set of memorable characters!), this masterpiece is certainly one to purchase if you want to try something that feels a little more human and igniting than your average title.Will you seperate families for faulty documentation to feed the starving family of your own?

												While the indie gaming revolution has brought a lot of side-scrolling retro-platformer clones, it also has allowed games like Papers, Please to be released to the public and thrive. The premise of being an immigration officer seems like an absurd concept for a game, but Papers, Please boils down to a familiar puzzle format, tasking you with finding differences between multiple sets of information. The game becomes intense as more and more rules pile on and you attempt to get through them as fast as possible to meet your quota. earning the necessary funds to  provide for your family. Tough choices become more and more common as you risk your family's well-being to help a stranger into the country. Overall, the game is solid and supports it unique premise with plenty of moral and mental challenges.			"

												Addictive gameplay in this one, you play as an immigration officer on the border of fictional pseudo-communist-eastern block country of Arstotzka. Every day you must check immigrants' IDs, permits, work passes and so on, trying to not let down your superiors and in the meantime taking home as much money as possible, even by being corrupted, in order to guarantee your family food, heat and medicines.Every day new regulations are established and being fast, without committing errors, checking every single document with the right tools, is really hard and stressful, but really fun!! 20 different endings are available, together with many unpredictable twists, and include mysterious plots uncovered, breakaways to foreign and safer countries, terrorists attacks, personal richness and so on.Technically is a really basic game, but Papers, Please strengths reside in its peculiar mechanics, it was a really nice surprise and I would suggest it to anyone interested in something fresh and unique, easy to learn but difficult to master, a good example of ideas winning over graphics awesomeness!

												Step into the boots of a underpaid and overworked border inspector!You are tasked with processing immigrants on the border between dirty Kolechia and Glorious Arstotzka!  Check papers for disrepancies and make sure that they are not falsified.  Inspect the foreigners and make sure that they do not carry contraband and illegal substances.  Stamp Passports to approve or reject immigrants!  Decide if you are to listen and believe to the 101 sob-story about a family forced apart, or coldly give them a firm ""NO"" and send them back into their♥♥♥♥♥♥countries.  Take care of a large family, give them food and heat and pay the rent on time.  If your meagre paycheck is not enough, take bribes and let possible terrorists over the border!  Detain innocents and have them sent off to an uncertain fate and get a few dollars in return.  Practice your aim on armed men trying to tear your checkpoint down and kill the guards!   Manevour yourself between the watchfull eyes of your totalitarian government that will put you in jail for the slightest mistake, and a shady terrorist organization claiming to be fighting for Arstotzkas feedom.  Who will you belive?  How will you feed your family?  Who will you let through the border?  Will your survive the winter?  And maybe the most important thing of all: Are you going to stamp that Passport?I give it 10/10 Glorious Arstotzkas!			"

												From a game that started off simply as a short 'demo', Papers, Please introduced a wonderful new concept that literally no one expected would be such an interesting experience. Maybe the idea of stamping passports and arresting criminals is slightly boring, but what elevates the wonder of this game is the subtle overlying storyline and furthermore, the increasing difficulting as the 32 day story progresses. The simplicity of the task at hand is easy to understand, yet when accompanied with the task of sometimes having to check 5+ documents under a time limit is gutwrenching and challenging, thus allowing this very simple' game a very 'complicated' gameplay. 9/10			"

												I first played a cracked version of this game, simply to try out, as i often do, an uncommon looking game, for the purpose of experiencing different the different things this medium can offer. At that moment i was not expecting Papers, Please to be one of the most absorbing and exciting games i've had the pleasure of playing, after my first play through of about 2 hours, i rushed to buy this game, as it simply wouldn't have been fair from my part not to.The fact that the gameplay, which can basically be summed up as spot the differences, ends up being as engaging as it is, is truly a testament of the ability this game has draw you into the world and it's ambient. And for me personally I found this to be one of the most engaging experiences I've had with entertainment(including movies, books, etc), there were moments of moral decisions which call out to the best of mankind, at the cost of your 'score' in the game, which i find great since it makes us think more of what it is we are doing while playing a game, since it presents us with either the path to move the game forward and the cost of our morals, or stick to our beliefs despite the consequences, and i truly appreciate when a game makes us go that far. I haven't been able to play all the games i've wanted to this year, however from the ones i've played, and from what i've seen and heard of the others, this is unapologetically my game of the year of 2013.  p.s. Apologies for any orthography errors, i did this kinda in a rush, since i'm at the end of the semester and i really should be studying :(.			"

												This game needs another look. At first glance it seems to be merely a boring subpar puzzler, when actually it needs a second chance to show its true colours.You have a job in immigration control on the border of Russia – sorry, “Arstotzka” – to control the flow of people into the country. You may choose to admit or refuse each person who walks up to the desk. Some will have the wrong entry permit; some will have forged their documents; some may have simply changed their name, and you will have to check against official records whether he or she uses an alias. A few people may try to bribe you with money that is hard to get hold of in the current economic climate, and you will have to choose to be kind or professional. There are an impressive 20 ways to finish the game, depending on what choices you make, from joining a criminal organisation to escaping the country with a stolen passport. Gameplay involves administration of the papers according to the rule book, which is constantly changing and any discrepancy should be challenged to see if the entrant has anything reasonable to say, e.g. the various expiry dates must agree with the current date.It’s all about attention to detail, and how quickly and efficiently you notice the mistakes. The game is perfect, maybe even a masterpiece.			"

												Ok, I want to start this review with my time is false. I have played at LEAST 10 more hours of this game, but I played offline so it wasn't tracked. This game, to put it simply, is a bureaucracy simulator. The entire point of the game is to work. There is no way to live on welfare in Arstotzka, either. You work. That's the game. However, this game has a comedy aspect to it. In Glorious Arstotzka, you can look forward to being greeted by: drug smugglers, strippers, pimps, normal people, terrorists, rebels (why would they want to rebel against glorious Arstotzka?!), more terrorists, murderers, human traffickers, communists, facists, and many more amazing people! I mean, who wouldn't want to spend hours sitting in one place and earning fake money while running a fake job?! Everyone did it in Rollercoaster Tycoon! Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												This review was initially written as a joke in my music and technology class when the professor assigned us to do a podcast. The original version was in French, here it is translated for the average Steamer.This jewel of a game was developed by Lucas Pope, who has also authored Flash browser-based game ""The Republia Times"", based on the same in-game universe.You might see this game as minimalistic, but that would in no way diminish its completely original, immersive concept and humor. The premise is ridiculously simple, but from there we go to an entirely different place, very colorful, very ""espionage""-like, reminiscent of the old James Bond movies (before it all went full-blast action), and of course, very communist.The game uses deceivingly simple, pixellated graphics, and primitive audio effects, not unlike an old Casio keyboard, to establish and maintain an oppressively austere environment.The action is also very convincing with intense rythm which requires maximum efficiency. If the player slows down, there are immediate repercussions.There are two available difficulty levels, the ""standard"" and the ""light-weight"" version lightened by a so-called ""crutch"" subsidy, pushing sarcasm up to derision of the player unfit to fill the shoes of a true bureaucrat beneath the Iron Curtain.In the introduction the player is announced that they have won the employment lottery in totalitarian state Arstotzka, neighbor of a few other fictional countries in a region probably situated East of known Europe.Every turn in the game, the player shows up for customs officer duty and examines paperwork of incoming travelers. The game starts up simple, then the difficulty gradually increases, emphasizing attention to detail and quick mental sorting into categories.When I first fired up ""Papers, please"" I played beginning-to-end in less than 5 hours, which would be disappointing if the game did not contain 27 other endings!Even if it isn't clearly delineated from the get-go, the game has a varied moral spectrum taking into account more lawful or chaotic, good or evil directions, which ultimately makes a difference to the ending.The decision tree never feels too obvious, which luckily avoids that ""scripted"" feeling that has attracted criticism of other, even AAA games.From a technical standpoint, this game flows as beautifully as a calligraphy exercice, requires few PC resources, runs bug-free and with no logical flaw. On the other hand, it is for its artistic value, and above all, its true likeness to real life that you should really pick it up and play it: after just one hour of gameplay, I broke down in tears after having accidentally made a decision against my moral values. Of course, having grown up in a post-Communist country I may be a bit more biased than the average Steam user. However I really believe that the realistic feel (AKA the paralyzing trudge through every day of Arstotzkian routine) as well as the few surprises that the developer has in store, will be a delight to any player equipped with unrustleable jimmies and unshakeable resolve.

												For me indie games offer a way to tell immersive and emotionally engaging stories in ways that are inaccessible in any other medium. I can easily say that Papers, Please is the most emotionally heart-wrenching game I have ever played. By far. I would go so far as to say that this is a perfect game. The gameplay itself is stressful and difficult, which may sound off-putting but that really is the point. You deal with the stress and paranoia because the game gives you reasons to do so. Throughout the game you make seriously difficult decisions which will always have consequences. In my first playthrough I took something that I knew I shouldn't, but I was scared that if I didn't my son would starve. That wasn't  a fabricated choice the game threw at me. It was the result of my gameplay affecting the story in a way that I had to make these difficult decisions. This is perhaps the only game I've played where your decisions truly affect the story. And not just for 'good' or 'bad' endings. Everything is grey and unclear.Papers, Please is an masterpiece with one of the most immersive stories I've ever played. This is all an attempt to say that I like it very much.			"

												There are few games this simple that are this fun. I love the dark, oppressive setting, the subtle humor and the thought involved with progressing through the game. There is something so oddly satisfying about finding discrepancies in the papers you're given and denying someone entry; there's also satisfaction from reviewing all of the documents and letting someone through, knowing you haven't missed any detail.With multiple endings and lots of replayability in both the story mode and the endless mode, Papers, Please is a game everyone should try.

There a total of 31 playable days and 20 different endings. Also with an endless mode to unlock after getting the best ending in the main story. The gameplay gets more difficult and adds new things to keep track of each day. It is a blast and I highly recommend it. The music is great and everything is great. Only problem is I wish there was music during the days. Other than that, like I said, great game, I give this game a 9 out of 10.			"

												This is by far one of the best indie games I have ever played! Papers Please was created from scratch by one man. Papers Please reflects on the checkpoints situated in Berlin during the Cold War. You might think that looking at dates, numerical values and pictures is boring, but the way PP does it is really great. It's a fun puzzle game that keeps you thinking.Everything from the music to the pixelated graphics is topnotch quality. Everyone has different passports and there are different ways of dealing with situations. You have to watch out for workers, diplomats, terrorists, spies and people of the secretive Order group. Of course, this game is not for everybody. If you enjoy playing generic COD shooters and that's all you play, this is not for you. You are working under time to deny and accept as many people into your country as possible without being fined. You have a family to look after and they all depend on you to pay for food, heat, medicine and rent in your class 8 dwelling.However, I really wish for new content to be added, like a war breaks out between Arstotzka and another nation and new enemies are added, or you are relocated to a whole new checkpoint or something. I just wish something new would be added. Apart from the noticable lack of updates and new content,  this game is worth it.Glory to Arztotzka!			"

Do you take a bribe and let someone through to help your family? Do you allow someone to come in with invalid documents because they're scared they're going to be killed if you send them away? Do you start detaining as many people as possible, for the smallest reasons, just to get a bonus to help feed your family? Decisions have to be made, Glory to Artstozka!			"

												While the indie gaming revolution has brought a lot of side-scrolling retro-platformer clones, it also has allowed games like Papers, Please to be released to the public and thrive. The premise of being an immigration officer seems like an absurd concept for a game, but Papers, Please boils down to a familiar puzzle format, tasking you with finding differences between multiple sets of information. The game becomes intense as more and more rules pile on and you attempt to get through them as fast as possible to meet your quota. earning the necessary funds to  provide for your family. Tough choices become more and more common as you risk your family's well-being to help a stranger into the country.

												I just love this game!So many things to do, so many documents to check late-game that they will **** your eyes, and you can end the game in 20 POSSIBLE ENDINGS!! SOME OF THEM REQUIRE YOU TO NOT DO THE OTHERS' REQUIREMENTS FORCING YOU TO START OVER, AND ONLY 3 ENDINGS ARE HAPPY!!!So many hard decisions, just SO MANY! For example: on a day, a mother that hasn't seen her son for 6 years will come with an expired document, and this is her only chance to enter, you must choose between denying her, or approving her.on another day, a husband and wife from a country that they describe as ""tyrannic"" are escaping to Arstotzka, the husband has valid documents, but the wife is missing a document, you must choose (again) between denying or approving!on another day, your sister will be arrested for an unknown reason, your niece now needs a home! your payment is low (5 credits/entrant), and you must choose between adopting her for 40 credits, or keep the money and leave her!and the hardest of all, a strange group (called *SPOILERS! you must find out yourself!*) will come asking for your help to ""free Arstotzka from its shackles"" and tell you that the country's leaders are corrupt and greedy. you can choose to help them and *SPOILERS!*, or you can choose to work for your country regardless and *SPOILERS!*also, the border gets occasionally attacked by terrorists, at first you can't do anything and they cut the day short but later on, the government gives you a single tranquilizer gun with 3 darts, and now, defending the border is your responsibility (and they still cut the day short!)the game is very stressing, at first, it will seem like an easy job, but it keeps getting harder and more stressing as you advance in the story, but once you find the key (Gotta go fast!) the game becomes easier, yet still stressful.despite the stress, the game is great! I can recommend it to anyone with pleasure!10/10 would get executed again			"

												I'm not sure how much this normally costs, but i got it for 2.99. I think its worth it for that price, but only for certain people. This game is not a game about ""Points"" or ""How fast can i do this"". this game is where you have to take care of your family on a salary barely enough for your rent, but its a lot more than that. You have to make choices that affect not only you, but the world around you as well. There are choices you make that match risk with reward, and there are choices where you must decided in between this person and your family. Every error you make gets a citation, and after two citations, you get docked payment. People ask you to smuggle them out of the city, but doing so can get your payment docked. This can be very bad for your family. They might beg you or tell you that they will die if they don't get out of the city. You can't do anything unless your willing to sacrifice your family. As for morals, you can accept bribes that can help you, but at a cost. I apologize if this reveiw is all-over-the-place, but this game really is a good game.			"

												I was a bit late to the party in playing this, but was pleasantly surprised when I did.An operator in a border control office doesn't sound like the most exciting premise, but it is confusingly fun.  The entry policy changes daily and you are paid/penalised on how many people you process each day; do you risk shortcutting a guy in the hope they're legit, go for a body scan only to find he is actually a she, or detain them and earn a sneaky commission from the supporting guard unit. (Note these are only a handful of the possible options as the game unfolds)At the end of the each day you must then mange your home finances; who from the family gets the food and medicine and who will go without and risk death. Certainly worth a look, it’s the bureaucracy you always dreamed of! "

												Ok, you'd think that a soviet-esque border guard paperwork sim would be a totally boring game, right? Quite the contrary, I've been enjoying this game so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much, there's something really relaxing about working through mountains of paperwork (even though seconds later you start to tense up waiting for the citation to pop up). Sometimes it makes you feel bad and question your decisions when you turn away refugees or poor people, or detain someone for not having the right papers. I really like it's simplistic style, it adds atmosphere and coldness to the game. Also a thing I'd like to highlight is the sounds. There's something really really pleasing about all those clicks and ticks when you press down a stamp or a button. I really recommend this game. Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												A solid investment for the argument that ""video games can be art."" Papers, Please puts you into the shoes of a border patrol police officer tasked with turning up all the fakes trying to enter your glorious country. It's more than that though: you are faced with choices as to how to spend your money (your son gets sick a lot and needs medicine) and there are other factors at play here. The game is quite simple, and the gameplay I found actually quite annoying. How many times do I have to double, or even triple check this document to make sure I haven't made any mistakes? However, if you don't mind immersing yourself Papers, Please offers one of the highest watermarks in simulation stories. I've only scratched the surface since I only got four endings of the 20, but if you're looking for something a little different this is right up your alley.			"

												This game is a perfect example of ""don't judge a book by it's cover"". It appears to be a mundane game of checking papers and doing nothing, but when you play it enough, you'll realize that it has a realistic setting, you'll be developing strategies, and loving some of the reoccuring characters. So the only true way to experience this game is to play it yourself. Buy it.Buy it now. If you don't, I'll cry.			"

												Papers, Please is a game of minimalistic design and creative gameplay. While it may sound boring to work as a Soviet-like border guard who will stamp passports with ""Accepted"" or ""Rejected"" for crossing the border, ""P,P"" manages to make it an interesting puzzle/skill game, which will be worth its relatively low price. This is an example of how the indie scene can break the limits of conventional game companies.			"

												It is a great game, well worth the price and I do hope that the success of this one will prove to the developer that they/he or she. Can do a 2nd game of this for I can see much better improvement if they are to look into it and make it possible more challanaging to play (with the option on the game for us.) Maybe have the year of the game be in the 2000 year and have more different ppl trying to get though or possibly have a co-op mode one plays as inspector and the other plays as the security guard of the checkpoint?either way if they were to make a second one I'd be more than willing to invest in the game if that what it takes for them to make a new one. If you have any doubts then just simply look it up on youtube, it is worth a try and is fairly cheap. The bad thing I can think of this game is that the gameplay screen is a little too small for my liking BUT it hasn't ruined my experience of the game, it is a defo game to add to your library. My final rating of this game is a 8/10 Only thing from stopping it from getting a 10 out 10 is the gameplay screen and after awhile playing it, it can be predicable so I'd love to see some dlc's added to this game or them making a second game of ""Papers, Please.""

												I get very nervous whenever I play Papers, Please. If you ever had to go through a ""tough"" immigration border you'll know what I mean (Hello, USA!). Despite that this is a fine game that takes most of your attention if you want to keep your ""in-game family"" alive (and this is not an easy task to accomplish). I keep playing the last day again, whenever I open the game, to try to remember the new rules. Time is ticking and it's extra hard to concentrate when you have to be fast in your passport analyses.

												Who would have thought something as mundane as checking papers would be so addictive? When I first saw Papers, Please in a gameplay commentary, I was immediately convinced I had to buy the game. I played the absolute bejesus out of this game as soon as I tried it out and completed 100% of the game in just a little bit over 20 hours. No regrets!In Papers, Please, you play as an inspector at a border checkpoint in a fictional country called Arstotzka. Each day you are required to check the documents of applicants who wish to enter Arstotzka, which means paying attention to every little detail of information you are given by the applicants (what documents they're supposed to bring, the expiration date of said documents, stamps, etc). At the end of each day, the game shows how much you've made and whether you'd like to spend your earnings on food, heat, and/or other expenses for your family whom you've got to look after throughout the game. If you're one who's attentive to little details, I highly recommend you to try this game. While the entire game may sound repetitive, you will be introduced to new NPCs and scenarios that will affect the way you play the game. It's a relatively small game so it can be played on pretty much any computer. Graphics-wise, I know it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I personally love it as it fits in really well with the whole theme of the game. 10/10 would befriend Jorji all over again.Glory to Cobrastan Arstotzka!

												This game is very interesting and addicting. You work at a entry checkpoint to the great country Arstotzka! You check documents for inconsistencies such as expired documents, non-match photos, incorrect issusing city, incorrect gender, incorrect seals, and the list goes on. The number of people that you process will determine the amount of money you make and you use that money to pay rent, buy food, pay for heating, and buy medicine when you need it. As the days pass some events take place. Terrorist bombings and shootings, inspections, and a mysterious group contacts you. All these and how you choose to handle the situations will determine the safety of you and your family. There are 20 different endings so the trick is finding them all.			"

I do miss the placeholder images that said 'image which perfectly matches the text below' or something along those lines but that's all I can complain about. The game is gripping and actually fairly stressful because of how imersive it is, I find myself genuinely worrying about my in game familly and I'm at pain when I turn away someone who desperately needs help but I know letting them in will lead to a fine which will prevent me buying medicine for my wife. I wouldn't say it's a fun game but it's gripping and imersive and just blows me away with how in such simple mechanics are made so difficult by adding tiny nuances to them.

												An absolutely unique and fantastic game. It creates an aura of tedium and monotony that is extremely engaging, and creates a unique and powerful experience. You have to deal with constantly changing regulations, need to maintain some level of accuracy to not get fined, yet you have pressure to pass as many people as possible through in order to feed your family.The game also makes you face countless moral dilemmas (accepting bribes, not allowing a husband to follow his wife due to missing a document, strip searching someone due to questionable gender), and really gives you a great amount of choice, with over 20 possible endings.I think starting the game is probably the hardest part, in that you are thinking ""am I really spending my free time validating hypothetical paperwork""? But I think once you get past those thoughts, you can immerse yourself into a very powerful and profound experience that is hard to find in gaming.			"

												Its a simple game by graphics and gameplay, but at the same time its a complex and difficult game about choices and decesions that will affect you and your familes well being. Will you be a kind and forgiving inspector and face the penelties charged or will you be a by the book inspector rejecting anyone for the most minor discrepancy?Each decison will affect you toward the end of the day, each person you allow or deny acces will determine the amount of money you earn at the end of the day. With the money you earn you take of your family as best you can.The more you play, the more the game opens up to a complex world of politcal corruption and human preservation. Easily the hardest point and click game I've ever played 10/10			"

												Papers, Please is definitely my favourite game this year. You take on the role as an Immigration officer needing to choose if you put your family between others. There is a choice of either taking a bribe and letting the person in, but risking your job or you can take the bribe and not let them in. There are also different orginisations that will try to get involved with you. These orginisations are very risky as one is Anti-Government. If you are caught being associarted with them you will get sent to prison and your game will be over, but if you don't get caught you will gain a lot of money. This game is a lot more than just a paperwork simulator, but still somehow manages to keep simple.Overall I give this game a 9/10			"

												Despite its simple premise and presentation, 'Papers, Please' is extremely captivating. The observable impact of your decisions and mistakes, coupled with societal, familial and monetary pressures, adds a lot of depth to this game. Papers, Please demands an eye for detail. If you couldn't get through the 'Spot the Differences' section of your doctors office Highlights magazine, steer clear of this title. If you REALLY get into the game and work towards seeing all of the endings, getting achievements, etc. you will definitely get your full-priced, $10 worth. On sale, this game is a no-brainer. Pick it up and play it on a rainy day. You'll be surprised how quickly you're hooked.Side note: Don't play this game before bed. I literally had dreams about phony passports, entry passes and diplomatic documents. Terrible night's sleep.			"

Checking documents isn't just a repetitive mini-game, Papers Please is a high-quality creation full of tension, fear, drama and humor.The more you know about the game, the better it will be. Do not spoil yourself by watching gameplay beyond the first 30 minutes of the game. This is absolutely the best indiegame of the year. You will have no regret buying it. The campaign will keep you on the tip of your seat, sweat going down down your neck and tension in your fingers. And beware of the unlimited free-play mode: It's as addictive as Kolechian tobacco.Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												This game delivers dismal and oppressive atmosphere layered on top of a repetitive mundane task that increases in needlessly bureaucratic complexity, all the while you sit in cramped quarters just trying to do your job well enough to provide your family with ample food, medicine, and housing.Brilliant! This game entertained me, and engrossed me, far more than I thought such a simple concept could have achieved. It can be very frustrating, due to the layers of detail and bureaucracy, but the more you play this game the better you get at it as those aspects become more and more familiar.Even at full price it was worth the cost.

												This has been one of the most strangely absorbing experiences I have had with a game recently. Basicially its a beurocarcy-esk game where you play a boarder control guard whose job it is to check papers of all incomming travellers (Papers Please? Geddit.) . Interogate them over discrepancies and make a final accept/decline decision. Except there is some kind of secondary, invisable checkpoint that automatically finds ♥♥♥♥ ups and fines you. So one wonders why we are even here? More layers of beurocrazy are added over time (Passports, Permission to travel, Permission to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Permission to use run on sentances...) until immigrants are handing you scrapbooking projects, and if they spelled their name with a different vowel once, then it is off to talk to the nice men. its hard to sympthathise as you get payed on a per passport total. This is the beauty of the game, there is no right choice. Every couple you reunite comes at the cost of food or medicine that night. There is a lot of telling without showing. Definitely would recomend.			"

You work on the border of your communist country, deciding who does and does not get to enter, and are faced with some difficult decisions at times.  The game gets more and more challenging, and if you mess up too much, or go in debt, you could end up in prison.			"

												Papers, Please is has two types of players: those who try it out and find it boring after ten minutes, and those who really enjoy it and still play it. I'm with the second kind. it can keep who imerssed until the end and the 20 endings it has can make you want to play it again. The gameplay is simple you stamp passports yes or no, but then more documents are  added to make you job as border control harder, and soon you take down attackers with a traq gun. then the story with ""the order"" can get interesting but you should play it to find that out. I've also never felt bad for characters you don't even see. You need to take care of your family at the end of each day they could get sick, cold, hungry,etc. If you don't fill these needs they will die. If you are unsure about the game get the demo, the game is also on sale at the time of this review, at a good price.			"

												Government Admin Simulator 1982.Or, that is how it would be if this game weren't addictive, engrossing and filled with misery everywhere you look. You are a lowly citizen given the opportunity to admit people into the country. You need to be alert for any problems with their documents, a typo here, the height of the person, anything can be wrong, and you need a sharp eye.Having worked in admin before make me realise it's easier when you've done this kind of focused examination of documents to ensure the people have everything they need. Pre-scripted events like terrorism, bombs, a secret government organisation, bribes from applicants, favours from officials appear to make you question the orders you receive from above, along with potential opportunities to give your family a better home. And yes, you do have a family, though you don't see them, you need to inspect enough people each day to earn money for rent, food, heat, and medicine etc when needed.Multiple endings, so plenty of chances to get it wrong or right. Overall, a very well made game which harkens back to the era of the fall of the Soviet union, East and West Germany and the breakup of Yugoslavia.			"

												Papers, Please is a game that seems to undersand that the player has morality and encourages them to follow it but with the result being that their actions also affect their pay check, too many citations you lose pay or even fall into debt. Papers, Please gets it's players to bond and sympathize with a character who is nameless, faceless, and only speaks what it required on him and his family who is never seen. You have the option to aid a rebellion or just follow orders among other things, each stamped passport could be terrorist you missed or a agent of the rebellion you forgot about. Papers, Please has amazing replay value and with twenty endings it's not surprising that it does. Most consiter the art style hidiouse but it futhers the athmostsphere of the game, it's supposed to show the downtrodden people who are trying to get into Arstotska, people who you might be suspisous of and be more inclinded to detain or deny them entry. Even amist the suspisoin of the game with the normal immigrants there is a reoccuring character named Jurji who is quite hilarious everytime he comes to visit.Papers, Please is ceratinly worth your time.

And this is a great game!The story makes you make some really tough decisions - it forces you to understand that sometimes bad people are actually just desperate, good people.  A word of warning - this game relies on attention to detail... if that isn't your thing, you're probably going to get super frustrated.

												Its a good game. To some, it may offer hard desicions at the expense of money that you need to keep your family alive, to others including me it is a Nazi dictatorship simulator where you reject anyone if they have a dot over the i to small and other equally trivial things. Well not to that extent but you see what I mean. You have a time limit to make money and if you ♥♥♥♥ up your family dies. May your wrists be quick and your wits be quicker. I'd recommend this game if you have good skills in notcing small errors and logic.			"

												Ah, Papers Please, how I have spent countless hours playing this super addictive game! Why it is so addictive I know not, yet somehow, it is. It seems as each day goes on you want to be faster and make more money. If no money is made then you cant buy food, medicine, and heat. And, if you cant buy that then your family will be sick thus resulting in later death, thus ending the game. And each time I made a mistake I found myself trying even harder next time to spot the discrepency. I almost think it is like a spot the difference game but more fast paced. So I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to spend countless hours owning a passport station.			"

												Absolutely brilliant, interesting game. So simple yet I found it hugely compelling and quite upsetting too. You are an immigration officer who is fortunate enough to win the labour lottery and have to work at border control, deciding whether people can cross the border into the country. What starts out so simple becomes increasingly complex as you have to make emotional decisions - do you let the pimp in and earn your money to feed your family or do you reject him and save potential hurt for many women? Buy the game and make your decisions! :)			"

												Few games have been able to absorb me the way that Papers, Please has. What seems like a monotonous, bureaucracy simulator is really a powerful and surprisingly addicting experience. Constant rule changes, addition of mechanics, organic world beyond your desk and the plethora of overwhelmingly complex moral and social dilemas did more to me than what most 60$ games today have done. Add in a well built atmosphere and a dash of good humor and you have a powerful and engaging game that will sure to stick in your mind long after the credits.			"

												I've enjoyed several aspects of this game. Although it is minimalistic by design, it is enough to submerse you in a progressively chaotic envirnoment. It may not make much of a difference to some people, but I'd recommend playing this game with headphones on. Reasons: the soundtrack for this game, although repetitive, is very catchy, adding to the authoritative environment that is Arstotzka. Second, *spoilers* when the opportunities come to use the tranquilizer/sniper gun, the sudden surprise of the alarm sound made me jump and realize how attentive I was looking for descrepancies. As you play through the game multiple times, for the tokens, achievements, endings, or endless mode, you will be able to adapt faster and more efficient ways to correctly grant or deny access to incoming people; it wasn't easy for me my first playthrough, but it began to be easier after a few playthroughts to process about 15 people on most days (except on the days where certain events happen).My only problem, slight at that, is the last upgrade. I understand it may make it easier for those that use their trackpad on their laptops, or those that find it easier that using the space bar. It's a hit or miss, I didn't find it helpful; if anything, it made finding descrepancies more problematic. Excellent game, I'd highly recommend this game. GLORY TO NEW ARSTOTZKA.			"

Wrong! It's an odly satisfying and unique style of gameplay that is second only to the story that happens around you.Difficulty: 10/10 It doesn't matter if you play it on hard or easy this game requires you to pay attention to details, if something wrong happens then you simply didn't look hard enough.Graphics 8/10 Although they may not be top of the line they do their job and they do it well.It's worth the price by a long shot and I would recommend this to anyone who likes story driven games or extremely difficult games.

												This game is certainly very different, but it is a masterpiece. You play as a man working at the border checkpoint of a fictional country  called Arstortzka. You check passports, documents, permits, etc. of anyone trying to enter Arstortzka. This might sound boring, but it's actually very fun. Once you get into the game, it offers a lot of variety. You don't just check paperwork in this game. You can also test fingerprints, search for concealed weapons, detain suspicious individuals, or even shoot terrorists with a tranquilizer. The game also gives you several moral decisions that will be very hard to decide. It's very hard to explain how this game offers you plenty of variety. It's better to play it yourself. Even after you finish the story, there's still another ending to unlock, and there's an ""endless"" mode (which I haven't unlocked yet). This game also has awesome music and sound effects. A masterpiece of indie work.Score: 92/100			"

												An absolutely unique and fantastic game. It creates an aura of tedium and monotony that is extremely engaging, and creates a unique and powerful experience. You have to deal with constantly changing regulations, need to maintain some level of accuracy to not get fined, yet you have pressure to pass as many people as possible through in order to feed your family.The game also makes you face countless moral dilemmas (accepting bribes, not allowing a husband to follow his wife due to missing a document, strip searching someone due to questionable gender), and really gives you a great amount of choice, with over 20 possible endings.I think starting the game is probably the hardest part, in that you are thinking ""am I really spending my free time validating hypothetical paperwork""? But I think once you get past those thoughts, you can immerse yourself into a very powerful and profound experience that is hard to find in gaming.			"

												It's hard to describe what's so fun about Papers, Please. To put it simply, the game is about checking the documents of people trying to cross a fictional Eastern Bloc nation's border with ever-changing rules and procedures. It's an oppressive environment as you're constantly choosing between strictly enforcing the rules of your superiors, or bending them at your own expense to do what seems right. You can have people detained for cash. You can take bribes. Everyone seemingly has a story or excuse for their discrepancies. And all the while, the rest of your family is starving and cold because you can't afford food and heat.But it is fun! It's so fun. It's almost entirely mouse-driven, but everything feels perfect. You move the documents onto your desk for closer inspection. Stamping papers makes a satisfying ""kachunk"" sound. Upgrades to your interface bring shortcuts. There's a time limit to each day, and you get paid by the person processed, with fines for screwing up (either intentionally or unintentionally) more than twice. It moves pretty briskly but once I got a rhythm down, I never really felt oppressed by the clock. Everything just works great. I got about five of the 20 endings, and I will probably go back to see if I can find the rest. Glory to Arstotzka.			"

I follow actor and indie game creator Wiley Wiggins he's known for his fantastic roll in Dazed and Confused. Well I asked him what was one game I should get on here for the sale and he told me ""You should get a indie game called Papers, Please"" he gave me so many details about it I started to get intrested and man I made the correct choice. Not only is this game Terrific but it's also a very well thought out History lesson you'll but it and Study it, it has so much to offer yet the backround is sadly the truth I had to stop a few times to question and to think never has a game done that for me. I highly reccommend this game not only is it a game game to play but again it makes you really think. I saw puzzel and I really didn't think I would like it but I'm glad I got the great review from an expert like Wiggins. Glad I added it to my Library.

For example: on a day, a mother that hasn't seen her son for 6 years will come with an expired document, and this is her only chance to enter, you must choose between denying her, or approving her.on another day, a husband and wife from a country that they describe as ""tyrannic"" are escaping to Arstotzka, the husband has valid documents, but the wife is missing a document, you must choose (again) between denying or approving!on another day, your sister will be arrested for an unknown reason, your niece now needs a home! your payment is low (5 credits/entrant), and you must choose between adopting her for 40 credits, or keep the money and leave her!and the hardest of all, a strange group (called *SPOILERS! you must find out yourself!*) will come asking for your help to ""free Arstotzka from its shackles"" and tell you that the country's leaders are corrupt and greedy. you can choose to help them and *SPOILERS!*, or you can choose to work for your country regardless and *SPOILERS!*also, the border gets occasionally attacked by terrorists, at first you can't do anything and they cut the day short but later on, the government gives you a single tranquilizer gun with 3 darts, and now, defending the border is your responsibility (and they still cut the day short!)the game is very stressing, at first, it will seem like an easy job, but it keeps getting harder and more stressing as you advance in the story, but once you find the key (Gotta go fast!) the game becomes easier, yet still stressful.despite the stress, the game is great! I can recommend it to anyone with pleasure!10/10 would get executed again			"

												I'm not sure how much this normally costs, but i got it for 2.99. I think its worth it for that price, but only for certain people. This game is not a game about ""Points"" or ""How fast can i do this"". this game is where you have to take care of your family on a salary barely enough for your rent, but its a lot more than that. You have to make choices that affect not only you, but the world around you as well. There are choices you make that match risk with reward, and there are choices where you must decided in between this person and your family. Every error you make gets a citation, and after two citations, you get docked payment. People ask you to smuggle them out of the city, but doing so can get your payment docked. This can be very bad for your family. They might beg you or tell you that they will die if they don't get out of the city. You can't do anything unless your willing to sacrifice your family. As for morals, you can accept bribes that can help you, but at a cost. I apologize if this reveiw is all-over-the-place, but this game really is a good game.			"

												This game's premise sounds simple - people present you with their travel documents, you check if everything is alright and accept/deny their entry across the border. However, there is an incredible depth to  the system as it incorporates moral elements - e.g. some people have invalid passports but their family is awaiting them across the border - will you let them through or send them back?'Papers, please' rewards you with a salary based on your speed  and accuracy. The money you earn are necessary to support your family, so you'd better work hard. The game has a story mode with multiple endings and an 'endless mode' so there is plenty of replayability as well.Heaps of fun packed into 50 megabytes of data. Would recommend on any day.			"

												They do not make games like this anymore. One of the best indy games I have ever played, and I'm not pontificating. This is the real deal™ folks.This game, on the surface, looks like it would be a bore. It's not. The game is HARD, which makes it all the more satisfying as you begin to master it. The county you're from, Arstotzka, is a terrible no-good place of dystopian horror -- and I enjoyed every minute of it .  I laughed, I cried, and I died inside whenever my family starved to death in the cold. In the end, I'm glad I was able to save my niece from certain death. Creativity, check. Unique graphics, check. An excellent look and feel, check. 32 megabyte install, check. This is about as perfect as it gets. Glory to Arstotzka.This review is for you, Jorji. Your tenacity is inspiring.			"

												Simple, yet challenging game... Seems more like an actual job than a game infact, though it can be a challenge to be 100% about details... unless you hack of course...The Game mechanic is basically looking at documents and picking out infomation, about a person, that is right or incorrect, and judging whether they have the right enter  or be sent away.  Fo instance, you will often have to check dates, passport numbers and even have people strip searched!  The quicker you do it, the more people you 'process' and therefore  the more money you get and the better chance your family dont die"" (If your family die : the state sacks you as it seeks to help people with larger families... How considerate of them...)The game is not linear in any sense either with added plots that crop up, like a woman who is being transported in as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to then work as a slave, asks for you help her by not admitting a man in.. Besides you are doing the same thing, it seems to develop somewhat with added techniques... I have bearly gotten to grips with this game, but feels like it has plenty of life in it... Perhaps I will take away the 'non-linear' statement when I play more or play 'endless' mode, but for now there appears to be plenty of detail and interesting aspects to consider it to not be linear.If you have an attention span of a fish, then you will not enjoy this game... If you enjoy problem solving and a good challenge, then working as an inspector for The Glorious Arstotzka  and keeping a family fed, warm and healthy will be right up your street!Once again an Indie game which presents more than what most A++ industry games do and for a fraction of the price! Get it !			"

												Even though it consists of rough pixel graphics and comes up with an almost ridiculous gameplay idea, this game provides great immersion and atmosphere. You inspect passports and either deny or approve immigrants. Time is running and if you can't check enough immigrants or make too many mistakes, you won't earn enough money to feed your family. Soon you won't notice the faces in front of you anymore. What you see is numbers and details. And mistakes, letting you press the ""detain"" button to get a little more money. Take bribes, still deny. More money. Something wrong with passport? Why did you even bother to come here and waste my time? ""Oh didn't know passport was required"". ♥♥♥♥♥, please. DENIED! DENIED! DENIED! Out with you, Glory to Arstotzka!The desk is always too small and always filled with papers. Passports, permits, supplements, work certificates, id cards, vaccination certificates, various bs the immigrants drop. There are stories told, you can make your own decisions wether and how to get involved, and there will be terror and blood as well. The game hardly ever gets boring, too much is happening and often you have to take care of many things at once. It's a masterpiece when it comes to game design and storytelling. Play and watch what it does to you.			"

												Jut bought it given the reviews and the 75% off sale at 2.74, figured it had to be worth 3 bucks!After 2ish hours I find myself not wanting to go to bed.  This game is just tricky enough to keep things interesting but not so difficult that I want to put the game away.Lots of matching and looking around, you have to look at EVERYTHING and even what appears to be a legit Yes, can somehow turn into a No, because you overlook something simple like the expiry of the passport or the gender (admittedly, multiple times).This game does a great job of recreating the monotony of repetitive work, which leads to mistakes and lack of attention to detail, but is still fun as I found myself getting genuinely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for my performance failures so I started taking notes and trying to commit key details to memory so not having to waste time looking it up in the manual.Great job devs, what a pleasant change of pace in gaming for me, and I'm sure plenty of others.Worth 20 at reg price, DEFINITELY worth 3 bucks on sale!

												OK, so I'm sure that when you are reading this review, that you are probably sceptical about getting this game. I think, though, that this game is worth buying for a multitude of reasons. This game requires the player to be very observant. I find it interesting that everything you do in this game affects the story line. I do recommend this game for people who like the Stanely Parable and other strategy games. Brief Overview (Don't worry, no spoilers...): You have just won the labor lottery, giving you a job working for border patrol. While working for the patrol you have to accept or deny people into the country based on their criminal record, ID, and etc. Some people try to forge documents and illegaly get into the country. You can choose to help the country with its corrupt government, or you can gain the trust of the country and try to destroy it from the inside.Even though all you do is click your mouse and choose wether people are entering or not, I find this game very fun and neat.   8.5/10			"

With the rules of immigration changing you may find yourself taking time just to get one person through. Also trying to keep four family members healthy, you have to spend the low ammounts of money you may be earning. With this struggle you may find tempations on buying a new booth. You can even get beta versions of the game giving you a better look. Although it is a retro game, there is not much to look at in the background for this, I give it a 8 out of 10!			"

It has the perfect Dystopia. And it gets very interesting from time to time. For example, terrorist attacks could occur. A secret rebel organization bribes you in many differen't ways to convince into supporting their actions into destroying the corrupt government. You can interrorgate people by having their pictures taken on a body scanner (Which could unvail some disturbing things the entrant might not want you to discover) such as having guns strapped on their backs, and even contraband strapped onto their legs, etc. The bottom line is, this game has a lot of potential.

												This is by far one of the best indie games I have ever played! Papers Please was created from scratch by one man. Papers Please reflects on the checkpoints situated in Berlin during the Cold War. You might think that looking at dates, numerical values and pictures is boring, but the way PP does it is really great. It's a fun puzzle game that keeps you thinking.Everything from the music to the pixelated graphics is topnotch quality. Everyone has different passports and there are different ways of dealing with situations. You have to watch out for workers, diplomats, terrorists, spies and people of the secretive Order group. Of course, this game is not for everybody. If you enjoy playing generic COD shooters and that's all you play, this is not for you. You are working under time to deny and accept as many people into your country as possible without being fined. You have a family to look after and they all depend on you to pay for food, heat, medicine and rent in your class 8 dwelling.However, I really wish for new content to be added, like a war breaks out between Arstotzka and another nation and new enemies are added, or you are relocated to a whole new checkpoint or something. I just wish something new would be added. Apart from the noticable lack of updates and new content,  this game is worth it.Glory to Arztotzka!			"

The game also values your morals, for example there is a women who wants to go live with here husband in Arstotzka but does not have all the requried papers to pass the strict border control however if she goes back to her home country she will be killed!

Each potential immigrant presents you with a set of papers that may or may not fit the rule of the law, and it's up to you to find discrepancies in the paperwork - and to occasionally let humanity win out and break the law to help others.

What starts out so simple becomes increasingly complex as you have to make emotional decisions - do you let the pimp in and earn your money to feed your family or do you reject him and save potential hurt for many women? Buy the game and make your decisions! :)			"

With the rules of immigration changing you may find yourself taking time just to get one person through. Also trying to keep four family members healthy, you have to spend the low ammounts of money you may be earning. With this struggle you may find tempations on buying a new booth. You can even get beta versions of the game giving you a better look. Although it is a retro game, there is not much to look at in the background for this, I give it a 8 out of 10!			"

Your duties are to check if applicants meet the current requirements to enter, but it doesn't end there.  You'll face terrorist attacks, criminals and people that rely on you to break the rules (or not) to help them.  In a nutshell, your decisions have some actual weight in this title.

I went into it very closed minded not expecting much but when I came off, I had already sunk a couple hours into it.Despite its dull grey look, oddly enough it fits very well with the style/tone of the game. Gameplay, much to my surprise, is very stressful (in a good way) and keeps you thinking. My eyes are constantly darting across the screen checking for faults and such.  With the addition of your familys health/welbeing on the line of your work, it adds an element of ergency to it too.If you haven't already definately pick it up in the sale, though by all means its very much worth its full price too.

The campaign will keep you on the tip of your seat, sweat going down down your neck and tension in your fingers.

												This is a game that warrants a double take. When you first hear the concept it seems strange. A dystopian border patrol simulator. While at first the premiss of this game may disinterest many people browsing the large selection of games on steam. Trust me this game deserves your inspection. While its not your typical simulator it does a great job of putting you in the game's world. You are a citizen of a communist country called Arstotzka. Your name was pulled in a lottery for the job of the passport checker in the newly opened border of this imaginary country. The whole game is checking and double checking. The object is to either admit or dismiss as many people correctly in a limited amount of time. While this may seem repetitive at first its addictive. Whenever you start to feel bored of the gameplay they add a new twist or challenge to keep you busy. I have put a few hours and have only found one of the supposed twenty endings of this game. If you just want to play for the gameplay there is an endless mode for you to challenge yourself. For as simple as the story may seem it keeps you intrigued. The choices are everywhere. You are faced obvious options on such things as betraying the government, accepting bribes, or just helping people out. The atmosphere is immersive. After playing for a while you start to feel like a horrible dictator. The dark atmosphere and the things you have no control over provide surprising amounts of emotion. This is one of my favorite indie games of this year and am looking forward to more thing from the developer. I highly recommend buying it now or if you are a cheapskate nabbing it during a steam sale. GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA			"

The feeling that you get for wanting to support your country, and fight the terrorists, but still having your family in the back of your head as the upmost important thing is great, it leads you to do things that might be corrubt in order to give your family food, and it will make you betray friends and innocent people can get hurt. All the while trying to stay a good person. The only problem I have with the game is that you can much too easily cheat by going through another day that went bad, this time knowing what will happen, which can take some of the chalange away.

												Before I played this game, if someone had told me that I would find comparing and evaluating paperwork to be at all enjoyable I would have called them a liar and a couple other names to boot.  After having played Papers, Please though, I have to admit that - at least in this game - paperwork can be fun.It doesn't seem like such a difficult concept at first: receive documentation from person, examine documentation (and sometimes the person) for any discrepancies, approve and deny as appropriate.  Like many things though, what is explained simply is not so easy to do.  While the game starts off with one document you need to examine, before long you're looking at as many as 5 pieces of paperwork for any one person, each which must be examined for consistency within itself AND compared to all other documentation.  It could be overwhelming, but the difficulty curve of Papers, Please is ramped up perfectly, neither too fast nor too slow.  By the time you're faced with this wall of documentation you're prepared... mostly.I know, I know, what I've described sounds like a harrowing experience.  Yes, it can be tense at times, but for some reason it's also rather fun.  The precise reason why escapes me in part, but a good deal of the enjoyment comes simply from the challenge of trying to figure out when someone is attempting to slip something past you, potentially for nefarious reasons even.  Every forged document, stolen identity, or smuggled bit of explosives you find is a satisfying emotional payoff, a virtual pat on the back for having stopped someone up to no good.Truthfully though, what makes Papers, Please an enjoyable experience isn't so much the gameplay as the story.  Not that the gameplay isn't solid, but much of the appeal would be meaningless without the personal drama that comes across on any given day of it.  Love, death, loss, joy, sadness, humor, all come across in the small conversations and interactions the player character has with the various people he encounters. Mindlessly approving or denying paperwork all day is somewhat trivial, but what if your decision to approve or deny a passport could make the difference between a family being reunited and one being torn apart?  Between true love and tragic loss? What if it could shape the very future of the country you serve?  All of these things come up as part of the plot of Papers, Please, and there's no right or wrong answer to each.  Your actions have consequences, and for better or worse you can see them out.Bluntly put, Papers, Please is a perfect example of how decent plot and unique gameplay can combine to form something greater than the sum of each.  Examined separately, the plot of Papers, Please is a bit derivative, while the gameplay is mostly unique rather than truly gripping.  Combined as expertly as they are, however, leads to a final result that is both highly enjoyable and very memorable.			"

I'm with the second kind. it can keep who imerssed until the end and the 20 endings it has can make you want to play it again. The gameplay is simple you stamp passports yes or no, but then more documents are  added to make you job as border control harder, and soon you take down attackers with a traq gun. then the story with ""the order"" can get interesting but you should play it to find that out. I've also never felt bad for characters you don't even see. You need to take care of your family at the end of each day they could get sick, cold, hungry,etc. If you don't fill these needs they will die. If you are unsure about the game get the demo, the game is also on sale at the time of this review, at a good price.			"

												Government Admin Simulator 1982.Or, that is how it would be if this game weren't addictive, engrossing and filled with misery everywhere you look. You are a lowly citizen given the opportunity to admit people into the country. You need to be alert for any problems with their documents, a typo here, the height of the person, anything can be wrong, and you need a sharp eye.Having worked in admin before make me realise it's easier when you've done this kind of focused examination of documents to ensure the people have everything they need. Pre-scripted events like terrorism, bombs, a secret government organisation, bribes from applicants, favours from officials appear to make you question the orders you receive from above, along with potential opportunities to give your family a better home. And yes, you do have a family, though you don't see them, you need to inspect enough people each day to earn money for rent, food, heat, and medicine etc when needed.Multiple endings, so plenty of chances to get it wrong or right. Overall, a very well made game which harkens back to the era of the fall of the Soviet union, East and West Germany and the breakup of Yugoslavia.			"

												""Papers, Please"" is a cold-war era alternate earth game where you inspect people's papers at a border crossing and either deny or pass them based on if their papers are correct, or depending on the situation, based on your morality.It's a very ""serious"" game, but has the potential to be extremely funny as well, usually with dark humor. Take for example the man named ""Jorji Costava"" (A pun on George Costanza) a man who repeatedly tries to get through the border crossing with papers so effortless (""Arstotzka so great, you don't need a passport!"") that it just makes you laugh as you repeatedly call authorities to haul his♥♥♥♥♥to prison.""tupac alive in artotzka, tupac making album of artotzka . fast rap tupac artotzka. we are rich and have gold now hahahaha ha because of tupac... you are ppoor stink kolechian... you live in a hovel hahahaha, you live in a yurt2pac aliv and real strong wizard kill all the kolechian farm aminal with rap magic now we the artozkan rule""			"

If you don't have enough money, your family gets cold, sick, or hungry. You want to keep them alive.Bottomline: You should DEFINITELY try it out!			"

												Papers, Please is simply put a game that'll make you think whilst pushing you further than you should go.In Papers, Please, players must try to get through as many people as possible making the least mistakes possible. The longer you spend checking someone's passport and details,the more money you end up loosing out on. So you have to be able to notice the smallest abnormalities as quickly as posible. You also get people with sob stories and beg to be let in, it's up to you whether you wish to do your work right or be a nice guy. You also have a family to look after, which adds to the stress of hurrying and is what can make you slip.Papers, Please is a wonderful game with great music, great story progression and is able to absorb you into it and get you to question everything you do. 9/10			"

												Papers, Please is one of 2013's new cult classics and I'd say for good reason. You play the role of an inspector at the border checkpoint of two fictional Soviet sattelite states. The game itself is pretty simple. You look over doucments and look for anything out of place. As you progress there are more things you have to look out for, and eventually you will have the choice to arrest and even defend your checkpoint with a sniper rifle and a tranq gun. Game Informer put it well. There is just something oddly satisfying about locking up a terrorist or finding something wrong with someones passport. The game also gives a good look into what sattelite states were like in the 1980's. Overall I think Papers is a good game, albeit short. While the game is short (the entire game takes place within just thirty one days), there are twenty possible endings so the replay value certainly is there. If you got ten bucks lying around, and you like puzzles and games that present you with moral decisions, then Papers, Please is definitely a good choice to spend that ten bucks on.			"

Will you take the brides ? Will you decide to join a rebelion against the gourvernement or do you prefer to play it safe to save your family ? These are some of the many questions you will ask yourself during the game.Papers, Please is definitely the type of game where you start playing by telling yourself ""Ill give it a shot a few minutes"" to finally have to force yourself to stop 2 hours later. This game have a way to pull you in its universe in an unexpected manner, i even find myself a bit sad in my first game when a member of my family died of disease because i wasnt able to buy medicines.This game is a must that everyone should have in their library.

												I would say the subtitle of 'dystopian document thriller' is partly correct.  The setting and mechanics in this game are fairly unique I think, where you play a border agent in a country with an oppressive government.The gameplay itself is actually fairly routine, and can be summarized as rule memorization and observation skills.  This is fine, as it works and makes sense within the story.  The sound design and aesthetic lend to this very well.  There were no performance issues.I don't think there is that much replayability to the story despite the variety of endings.  There is an unlockable endless mode, which could make this fun as a pastime too  Still, I'd reccomend this game for its unique experience.  Its really not something you see every day.			"

												Dystopian document thriller may be the most apt description for a game that defies genre as much as this one does. While at its barest it can be called a game of spot the difference all the various pieces combine to turn it into so much more. The washed out pixilated aesthetics give off a somber and oppressive mood. The audio provides crisp sounding paper noises that make you feel like you’re actually shuffling papers, a satisfying ka-chunk when the stamp comes down and the ever nerve racking noise of a citation slip being printed that will haunt you for days to come.  Then there’s the narrative which gives the game its tension and stakes. It creates interesting moral quandaries that you have to deal with and doesn’t come off as judging the player or having a right way to play.  No karma meters, no paragon/renegade points, just your decisions and their consequences and whether you can live with them or not.  All these turn a game which should feel like work into a tense, nerve racking, and wonderfully cohesive experience that’ll stick in your mind.  It’s a harsh game, in tone and gameplay, so expect to lose a few times as you get the hang of it but thanks to the games day save system you’ll never lose a lot of progress and it should be easy to start back up where you died/left off last.  This may not be the game for you if you’re looking for something quick and relaxing to pass time, but it’s an experience that should be experienced and I’d highly recommend it.			"

												Well, this game was kind of sitting on my wishlist so one day I figured I would get it to see what everyone is liking about it, first i'll say this, for a simple game it holds a heII of a lot of weight on it.PROS:Story: The story is a little simple, you are a man who got a job at a border controll station into Arstotzka, some kind of Russian like country, you're job is to make sure that whoever doesn't have their paper work in order gets a ""Denied"" stamp, and who has it correct gets a ""Approved"" stamp.Money: You have to get money to care for your family, your son, father, wife, and *shiver* ""Mother-in-law"", how it works is every Deny you make you get paid, every Approve you make you get nothing (least I think you do), so you want to clear as many of those people as you possibly can.Paperwork: Yes, this game is basically a paper-work simulator, but it's a heII of a lot more than just that, theres a whole background network of stuff that happens, organizations wanting in, other countries Arstotzka can't trust, democrats who could be possible terrorists.Characters: The characters you meet are a little weird at first, like a guy who wants into Arstotzka but doesn't have the right paper work on him, or a woman who wants to go through the checkpoint cause her husband went first but she doesn't have the paper work to be allowed in, or the organization who wants into Arstotzka with their spies to see what's going on, choices you have to make and could have consequences.Choices: Throught your one/many playthroughs you'll have to have some choices, whether it be help or disregard the Organization, not or let the husbands wife through the checkpoint regardless to be nice, let that little d%$khead through even though you REALLY don't want to cause of how annoying he can be.  Be careful with what you decide to do, because one wrong move can mean you lost the whole game.  Honestly at times when I had to pick choices I was kind of scared, I was afraid of what the outcome would be, and since i'm on a timer I have to be very careful about what I picked.Paperwork/What Civies need: When you start off in the game, it's simple, every Arstotzkan is allowed in if they have the right passport, everyone else isn't allowed in, but later on the paperwork just starts piling up like crazy.  Permission to come in Arstotzka, permission to work, permission to go through, permission to go to the bathroom, permission to walk, permission to talk, it starts to get annoying at times, but after a while you start to notice errors in documents without so much as even blinking or going to the handbook.  But every once in a while even I end up screwing up the simplest of things.Pay attention to details: What I mean by this is you need to look at every little detail about the paperwork, the names of people, passports, expiration dates, the stamps, the city and district names, the persons height, their weight, their gender, EVERYTHING, don't overlook anything, if you think it's fine check it anyway, you'd be surprised.  Cause if the person misspells their name just once then it's off to the guys with guns and they go into the building people go into but don't come out of so much.Discrepency machine: This machine is basically a analysis tool and I like it a lot, say it's hard to read the screen and you can't tell if the persons name on the passport matches their entry permit or work permit, you hit SPACE BAR or click the button on the bottom right, click one name, then the other, it scans it for any errors and if it's clean you are fine, if it's a discrepency then a icon appears over the little ""Talk machine"" and you click on it (without going out of the discrepency machine) and it asks the person a question to whatever it was you scanned, sometimes you need to do fingerprints, others it may be a search.Upgrades: Your booth ends up getting upgrades that you can pay for, they aren't big, they are a little simple, like for the handbook for rules and country city names you have to manually flip through the pages, later you can buy a upgrade which gives it 'tabs' so you just click on the tab and get sent to the area you clicked whether it be rules or stamp symbols, or the deny/approve slider, instead of clicking it you get a upgrade where you hit TAB and it comes out automatically, hit TAB again to put it back, and for the discrepency machine you hit SPACE BAR to bring it up, and SPACE BAR again to put it away.CONS:The Citation Error Machine: I hate this f#$ker with all of my heart and soul, I call this thing the ""F#$k Up"" machine, because everytime you f#$k up, it makes this irritating noise and comes up saying what you missed or didn't look over, and after a while I sometimes want to just throw my monitor out of the damned window.  Yes it's annoying but atleast it tells you what you missed or didn't look at, good job Arstotzka, I feel great that a machine can do my job better and yet it's free.  This thing is basically a invisible scanner, on the way out of the checkpoint it scans the person for if they had everything correct or something wrong and tells you what it was.Endless Mode: This isn't in the cons section because it sucks, it's a little fun actually, especially if you play the Papers, Please theme while you do so, you can pick what you want to do and how much paperwork is required to pass, but honestly after a while it can get a little dull, what I think they should have done is put some kind of randomized game in, where you pick how much paperwork is required but you don't know what could happen, the guards could all die from a terrorist or something if you accidently pushed someone through who had incorrect permits or something, seriously, would add a lot of replay value.Easy game overs: I only beat 1 of the 20 endings that there is but you need to be very careful about what you do SPOILER ALERT, at one point if you let one of the Organizations spies in you get 1k, yes, 1 thousand bucks, but if you keep it and don't use it or something the government takes it and puts you in jail, as well as your family members.  Another time was I had to let this d*$khead advisor for the checkpoint, make me let a woman through yet she wasn't supposed to, and I forgot the woman's name so I ended up putting her in jail, then I got ANOTHER game over, and it gets annoying to have to resort to previous days and go through ALL the work again and try not to let the f$%k up machine go off just to get to a certain point.WHAT I THINK: I think this game is something very special, it's so simple yet so amazing all at once, ""EA would never make something like this, infact it would probably remind them of their Customer Support Services."" = Yahtzee Croshaw.  All and all though, it gets a damn good 9/10, minus the f$#k up machine and some things I think would have enhanced the game, it's pretty damn good, but i'm sure after you get all of the endings it could get a little dull.  This game is totally worth it as it sits and when it's on a sale.			"

												A gripping and emotional story that seriously makes you question your morals. Also, the gameplay itself is surprisingly tough, with you having to pay attention to each and every detail, and rather than chucking everything at you at once and overwhelming you, it slowly adds more and more pieces of paperwork and rules, so you have plenty of time to understand each one before you have to learn a new one.

												I put off buying this game for quite a while, after all it doesn't really seem that interesting, but it truly is a great game.If you're considering buying this game but aren't sure then just do it. As you progress through the game the story, or should I say your story really develops. New rules are introduced by the government and old ones removed. It's constantly a challenge to deal with the barrage of documents that are thrown your war.The save system is excellent, allowing you to return to any single day and make a different decision regarding certain people in order to change the outcome of the story. The game is a humourous but morally challenging parody of what would be an impossible job.Well worth playing, this game will be a classic.			"

												I played this game in Beta and it's got a lot better, it was great then but now it's just brilliant especially considering it was a 1 man project. I do miss the placeholder images that said 'image which perfectly matches the text below' or something along those lines but that's all I can complain about. The game is gripping and actually fairly stressful because of how imersive it is, I find myself genuinely worrying about my in game familly and I'm at pain when I turn away someone who desperately needs help but I know letting them in will lead to a fine which will prevent me buying medicine for my wife. I wouldn't say it's a fun game but it's gripping and imersive and just blows me away with how in such simple mechanics are made so difficult by adding tiny nuances to them. Great game worth every penny			"

												Despite its simple premise and presentation, 'Papers, Please' is extremely captivating. The observable impact of your decisions and mistakes, coupled with societal, familial and monetary pressures, adds a lot of depth to this game. Papers, Please demands an eye for detail. If you couldn't get through the 'Spot the Differences' section of your doctors office Highlights magazine, steer clear of this title. If you REALLY get into the game and work towards seeing all of the endings, getting achievements, etc. you will definitely get your full-priced, $10 worth. On sale, this game is a no-brainer. Pick it up and play it on a rainy day. You'll be surprised how quickly you're hooked.Side note: Don't play this game before bed.

												This game is dare i say near perfect, a grim thriller with a fun addictive gameplay macanic and alot of replayability.U r a man from a small village who has been picked at random through a labour lottory to work at the east grestin border checkpoint.The objective of the game is to look through all of the persons papers make sure they're ok and approve them so they can go to the country of Arstotszka.Sounds simple right? mother f***king wrong,everyday a new rule is added which makes very new day more and more stressfull than the last. the first day only people from Arstotszka can go through,the next day fourginerss r let through but they're passport must be valid.The next day everybody need a valid entery ticket to go through etc etc.All that combined with the fact that theres a family at home that needs food and heat and medicene if there sick.AND u need to pay rent.all that with some collectible tokens along the way for being a good guy but making the wrong desitions bisnuss wize makes this game a 9.5/10 one of the greatest indie games out there.

												To be brief, Papers, Please is a game that is unlike any other in terms of gameplay. The best way to describe it is working in Stalin's DMV, sifting through enough papers throughout a day to make a redwood tree flinch in horror. Unique gameplay itself is more than enough to give Papers, Please a look, but what really makes the game pop is its story. Everyone has problems, and you are no exception. The game puts you in a mentality that lets the little details get to you, taking perfect advantage of its setting to make you worried about even getting to work another day. This game is an interactive experience like no other, and I recommend it to any gamer look for something different.			"

If you enjoy fast-paced games then you probably won't like this game, but if you enjoy an immersive game then you should definitely give this game a chance.

												Ok, you'd think that a soviet-esque border guard paperwork sim would be a totally boring game, right? Quite the contrary, I've been enjoying this game so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much, there's something really relaxing about working through mountains of paperwork (even though seconds later you start to tense up waiting for the citation to pop up). Sometimes it makes you feel bad and question your decisions when you turn away refugees or poor people, or detain someone for not having the right papers. I really like it's simplistic style, it adds atmosphere and coldness to the game. Also a thing I'd like to highlight is the sounds. There's something really really pleasing about all those clicks and ticks when you press down a stamp or a button. I really recommend this game. Glory to Arstotzka!			"

												Amazing little game. The concept is so mundane but it is genuinely so entertaining to hold these little simulated lives in the palm of your hand waiting on the stamp to fall. Slowly but surely increased the difficulty. A few hours in your are scanning 5-6 different bits of paperwork but the ramp is so gradual you dont even see the difficulty increase. Starts to introduce little things to play on your mind, that maybe the place where you live isnt so good? Maybe I should start letting in these decent people even though their paperwork isnt so good? What about these shady resistance characters? What about this guy who is clearly mentally ill trying to get home but his passport is written in crayon? You need to balance all of this with your family who rely on your wages, wages that will be cut if you get caught letting people in illegally/erroneously.The graphics look simple, the concept looks simple, but this game will stir things inside of you. It will make you realise how much of a bureaucratic fascist or peace loving do-gooder you are. That, to me, is what games are all about. Buy it.			"

												They do not make games like this anymore. One of the best indy games I have ever played, and I'm not pontificating. This is the real deal™ folks.This game, on the surface, looks like it would be a bore. It's not. The game is HARD, which makes it all the more satisfying as you begin to master it. The county you're from, Arstotzka, is a terrible no-good place of dystopian horror -- and I enjoyed every minute of it .  I laughed, I cried, and I died inside whenever my family starved to death in the cold. In the end, I'm glad I was able to save my niece from certain death. Creativity, check. Unique graphics, check. An excellent look and feel, check. 32 megabyte install, check. This is about as perfect as it gets. Glory to Arstotzka.This review is for you, Jorji. Your tenacity is inspiring.			"

												This is exactly what indie gaming is all about. From time to time, while shoveling through all the garbage, you stumble upon this kind of gem that makes it all worth it.That being said this beauty is not without its fauls. It can get a little tedious and frustrating fast (easy crutch mode will alleviate some of that), and once you let it go it takes a little bit of... self convincing to come back to it. Being from or conected to the eastern bloc from where this story draws its roots will help a lot for the general feeling. It will hit home in a special way, but I don’t think it’s mandatory. It’s just a bonus for some of us :)			"

												If you like retro-gaming and hidden-object games -- this is a great take on the genre. You play a ""Check-point Charlie"" -- a person who checks papers crossing the border of a progressively authoritarian regime. You must work as fast as possible (or your family will starve or worse) as well as thoroughly (not careful enough and not only will your pathetic pay be docked, but you may be sanctioned or let terrorists into the country!) It's a very rich game narratively, and you have a great deal of freedom to act for somebody stuck in a box the whole game. You can support resistance or state oppression, grift or keep your nose clean, or just do your job and not stick your neck out. The game has 20 endings and only a couple I found were pleasant. Good fun -- I was surprised how sucked into the game I got!			"

You might end up really liking it or you might dispise the crap outa it, it's a bit of a gamble, but when it's only a few dollars there's really nothing to lose.			"

												This game is absolutely wonderful. If you like a mind stimulating and challenging game about any analyzing discrepancies and having the power to put down the mighty denied stamp, this is the game for you. If you think it will be easy, it will not. When I see bad reviews for this game, it is usually about the graphics (it's on purpose!!), or about how they don't know how to play the game. Make sure you are ready to not gloss over the details, because this game is very tedious and specific. Not analyzing one small discrepancies will cost you on the long run. I would not recommend this game if you want something that will be a cheap, easy and fast game to play. Fabulous game!			"

												A simulation of what it is like to be a border guard. What seems to be a trivial matching game on the surface is actually a much deeper simulation with surprising complexity.PROS:-A simple ""gimmick"" mechanic that is expanded upon in a surprising way leading to surprising depth of play. -Amusing secondary decisions and backstory (managing finances, choosing who to let in at cost to yourself, and other political impacts in the fictional world).CONS:-The font is a little hard to read at times.-The large graphic at the top of the screen showing the line of people is rather unneccessary and takes up critical screen space. It would have been better if this graphic was shown whenever something happened rather than just being there all the time.			"

												While the indie gaming revolution has brought a lot of side-scrolling retro-platformer clones, it also has allowed games like Papers, Please to be released to the public and thrive. The premise of being an immigration officer seems like an absurd concept for a game, but Papers, Please boils down to a familiar puzzle format, tasking you with finding differences between multiple sets of information. The game becomes intense as more and more rules pile on and you attempt to get through them as fast as possible to meet your quota. earning the necessary funds to  provide for your family. Tough choices become more and more common as you risk your family's well-being to help a stranger into the country. Overall, the game is solid and supports it unique premise with plenty of moral and mental challenges.			"

												Simple, fun game to play while travelling and on a laptop or just taking it easy at home. However, loses its appeal after just a couple hours of gameplay. Would still recommend to pick it up if you like flash style games, especially during a sale!			"

												Papers, Please is an utterly brilliant game that really shouldn't be. You play as an inspector on the border of the 'fictional' country Arstotzka, which has just emerged from a 6 year war with it's neighbour Kolechia, located between the now divided cities of East and West Grestin. You job, should you be chosen to accept it, is to inspect immigrants paperwork and ensure border security as ever more complex rules are placed on those attempting to cross the border. Somehow Papers, Please manages to capture (What I imagine to be) the monotony of the day-to-day goings on of a border checkpoint whilst somehow making it fun to play. The game is surprising engaging, presenting moral choices that will often force you to choose between doing your job (and thus being able to provide for your family) or helping someone out and facing the potential consequences. There is also a sub plot throughout featuring a shady organisation looking to destabilize the government. GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!			"

												Papers, Please is good. It has travel documents and good manners, what more could one want. I got about 5 hours out of this, so I was getting one hour to the dollar which is pretty decent mileage. I laughed, i cried. It ran the whole gamut of emotions. The more people who buy this, the more the world will be ready to donate to my future kickstarter for my point-and-click game version of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, set in glorious real time. Yes, it will have 3652 rounds of NG+ mode! And once that is a massive success, I will funnel my efforts into a full blown FPS version of Cancer Ward where you play as the head doctor of radiotherapy who blasts cancer zombies with a powerful X-Ray gun. The twist? You've got cancer too! This leads into a final boss fight where you're sucked into your own body to fight The Malignanton, where you gloriously triumph. ""You're in remission, ♥♥♥♥er!""

												This game. Is so good. A true one-man tour-de-force. And how ironic that it simulates one of the most boring, frustrating, and time-consuming jobs on the planet, and revels in the fact that many of us come home from one of these jobs and play Papers Please for fun. How post-modern. How Orwellian.First of all, this game has an overall meaningful story and meaningful choices to be made through all of the paper grind. This is what really drives the game and makes it a game. Holding out (and looking for) the decisions that will change your future and your family's future is strangely compelling. The game engages very well with Dystopian ideals.Finding discrepancies and doing a good job is rewarding in its own right, however. There is something about a job well-done after all. Developing a 'system' of dealing with the papers that works for you has quite a learning curb. The gameplay itself has a good difficulty curb, but is so terrible at the start as you learn the names of the countries, the issuing cities, the passport layouts.Visuals are wonderful! I can't express how-- iconic-- the people are in this game. Though it's a bit frustrating when you let someone through with a fake ID because it's a bit difficult to tell a male from a female (unless you take a clotheless picture, lol).Sound is also stylized and well thoughtout.Pretty much EVERY decision the creator made in this game gave it a dark, bitter flavour like a fine coffee.10/10. I'm so happy that games like this are still developed and that there is still room for one person with an idea to take that idea and make it into such a meaningful game.			"

												I'm not sure how much this normally costs, but i got it for 2.99. I think its worth it for that price, but only for certain people. This game is not a game about ""Points"" or ""How fast can i do this"". this game is where you have to take care of your family on a salary barely enough for your rent, but its a lot more than that. You have to make choices that affect not only you, but the world around you as well. There are choices you make that match risk with reward, and there are choices where you must decided in between this person and your family. Every error you make gets a citation, and after two citations, you get docked payment. People ask you to smuggle them out of the city, but doing so can get your payment docked. This can be very bad for your family. They might beg you or tell you that they will die if they don't get out of the city. You can't do anything unless your willing to sacrifice your family. As for morals, you can accept bribes that can help you, but at a cost. I apologize if this reveiw is all-over-the-place, but this game really is a good game.			"

												This is exactly what indie gaming is all about. From time to time, while shoveling through all the garbage, you stumble upon this kind of gem that makes it all worth it.That being said this beauty is not without its fauls. It can get a little tedious and frustrating fast (easy crutch mode will alleviate some of that), and once you let it go it takes a little bit of... self convincing to come back to it. Being from or conected to the eastern bloc from where this story draws its roots will help a lot for the general feeling. It will hit home in a special way, but I don’t think it’s mandatory. It’s just a bonus for some of us :)			"

												Papers, Please is a very good game. It might not seem like it (Due to the fact that mostly all you do is press stamps on paperwork) but believe me, there is MUCH, MUCH more to this game. It has the perfect Dystopia. And it gets very interesting from time to time. For example, terrorist attacks could occur. A secret rebel organization bribes you in many differen't ways to convince into supporting their actions into destroying the corrupt government. You can interrorgate people by having their pictures taken on a body scanner (Which could unvail some disturbing things the entrant might not want you to discover) such as having guns strapped on their backs, and even contraband strapped onto their legs, etc. The bottom line is, this game has a lot of potential. There is even an excessive number of endings you could get (A little bit over 40 to be exact), to keep you more interested. 10/10			"

												If you like retro-gaming and hidden-object games -- this is a great take on the genre. You play a ""Check-point Charlie"" -- a person who checks papers crossing the border of a progressively authoritarian regime. You must work as fast as possible (or your family will starve or worse) as well as thoroughly (not careful enough and not only will your pathetic pay be docked, but you may be sanctioned or let terrorists into the country!) It's a very rich game narratively, and you have a great deal of freedom to act for somebody stuck in a box the whole game. You can support resistance or state oppression, grift or keep your nose clean, or just do your job and not stick your neck out. The game has 20 endings and only a couple I found were pleasant. Good fun -- I was surprised how sucked into the game I got!			"

												This game was surprisingly good. Everything about the game from the visuals, the gameplay, and the sound all add to and help develop the mood and story of the game. You are a desk clerk at a checkpoint charged with approving visas. You face ever changing conditions, penalties for incorrect approvals and denials, and a family that needs the money you earn to stay healthy. On top of this strange things happen, people make odd comments about the rulers of your country and you're never sure who to trust. Do you approve the man who is missing his health certificate because he offered 10 bucks which you need to buy medicine for your son? Do you deny a man with all the correct papers because the lady before him pleaded with you not to let him through as he plans to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ her?

												I was actually very surprised by how immersed I was in this game. I bought it on a whim because it was in the autumn sale and I heard some things about it so I thought, ""Why not?"". You start the game off and listen to the really catchy music with the title going slowly upwards as it bobs to the rhythm of the music. I thought the music was also very thematic as well, telling me the kind of setting I would be playing in, so that's a plus. Okay, then I started a new game and, at first, it starts up kind of slow, showing me what to do and how to use the certain controls in the game. I'll get back to that in a bit, though. But just as I as getting bored with the game, thinking that it was becoming repetitive, it started to add story elements. On any random day the border can be attacked by a terrorist bomber or a group of them kill all the guards around the border and its up to you to take them out. And then there is also a secret organization that tries to get you to help them with their cause. It was all of these things that kept me interested in the game, more immersed. I really couldn't stop playing it because I wanted to see what happened next, if something even happened next. Well, I guess I also got a sense of satisfaction of being given the power to dictate whether a person can enter or not. Anyway, I thought it was a really good game, very creative because of its unique gameplay and style that it gave me. Plus, it also multiple endings! So you have tons of replayability if you're done with the first playthrough. I do have a complaint though. I just kind of thought that one of the upgrades was kind of useless. Like the 'double click to use inspection mode'. There was already another upgrade to activate it with the spacebar so I didn't think there was any need for that upgrade. I'm not sure what could've been in place of that but I'm sure that the creator could've thought of something. I would say the same thing about the book shortcuts but I found those useful so I'll leave that one be. Other than that, I had a great time playing the game. It required me to be real attentive and I think it actually helped increase my perception because sometimes there is just one tiny thing that you can overlook and you can get a citation for it. So you have to really pay attention to the dates, genders of the people, serial numbers, and even the cities in the passports that they're using. Sometimes they try to trick you with that so be careful. Also the dialogue with the characters can sometimes feel very natural so that is another aspect that can immerse you into the game. Now, Papers, Please definitely won't be the most exciting game you would ever play but it will pull you in with its unpredictability, interesting setting, and very intuitive gameplay mechanics. So if you're in the market for a PC game I highly recommend Papers, Please. If you are on the edge of whether or not to buy this, do it. You won't be disappointed with it at all, and it's only 9.99 so it's a really good price for what you get with this game. My rating for Papers, Please is a 9/10			"

												Well, this game was kind of sitting on my wishlist so one day I figured I would get it to see what everyone is liking about it, first i'll say this, for a simple game it holds a heII of a lot of weight on it.PROS:Story: The story is a little simple, you are a man who got a job at a border controll station into Arstotzka, some kind of Russian like country, you're job is to make sure that whoever doesn't have their paper work in order gets a ""Denied"" stamp, and who has it correct gets a ""Approved"" stamp.Money: You have to get money to care for your family, your son, father, wife, and *shiver* ""Mother-in-law"", how it works is every Deny you make you get paid, every Approve you make you get nothing (least I think you do), so you want to clear as many of those people as you possibly can.Paperwork: Yes, this game is basically a paper-work simulator, but it's a heII of a lot more than just that, theres a whole background network of stuff that happens, organizations wanting in, other countries Arstotzka can't trust, democrats who could be possible terrorists.Characters: The characters you meet are a little weird at first, like a guy who wants into Arstotzka but doesn't have the right paper work on him, or a woman who wants to go through the checkpoint cause her husband went first but she doesn't have the paper work to be allowed in, or the organization who wants into Arstotzka with their spies to see what's going on, choices you have to make and could have consequences.Choices: Throught your one/many playthroughs you'll have to have some choices, whether it be help or disregard the Organization, not or let the husbands wife through the checkpoint regardless to be nice, let that little d%$khead through even though you REALLY don't want to cause of how annoying he can be.  Be careful with what you decide to do, because one wrong move can mean you lost the whole game.  Honestly at times when I had to pick choices I was kind of scared, I was afraid of what the outcome would be, and since i'm on a timer I have to be very careful about what I picked.Paperwork/What Civies need: When you start off in the game, it's simple, every Arstotzkan is allowed in if they have the right passport, everyone else isn't allowed in, but later on the paperwork just starts piling up like crazy.  Permission to come in Arstotzka, permission to work, permission to go through, permission to go to the bathroom, permission to walk, permission to talk, it starts to get annoying at times, but after a while you start to notice errors in documents without so much as even blinking or going to the handbook.  But every once in a while even I end up screwing up the simplest of things.Pay attention to details: What I mean by this is you need to look at every little detail about the paperwork, the names of people, passports, expiration dates, the stamps, the city and district names, the persons height, their weight, their gender, EVERYTHING, don't overlook anything, if you think it's fine check it anyway, you'd be surprised.  Cause if the person misspells their name just once then it's off to the guys with guns and they go into the building people go into but don't come out of so much.Discrepency machine: This machine is basically a analysis tool and I like it a lot, say it's hard to read the screen and you can't tell if the persons name on the passport matches their entry permit or work permit, you hit SPACE BAR or click the button on the bottom right, click one name, then the other, it scans it for any errors and if it's clean you are fine, if it's a discrepency then a icon appears over the little ""Talk machine"" and you click on it (without going out of the discrepency machine) and it asks the person a question to whatever it was you scanned, sometimes you need to do fingerprints, others it may be a search.Upgrades: Your booth ends up getting upgrades that you can pay for, they aren't big, they are a little simple, like for the handbook for rules and country city names you have to manually flip through the pages, later you can buy a upgrade which gives it 'tabs' so you just click on the tab and get sent to the area you clicked whether it be rules or stamp symbols, or the deny/approve slider, instead of clicking it you get a upgrade where you hit TAB and it comes out automatically, hit TAB again to put it back, and for the discrepency machine you hit SPACE BAR to bring it up, and SPACE BAR again to put it away.CONS:The Citation Error Machine: I hate this f#$ker with all of my heart and soul, I call this thing the ""F#$k Up"" machine, because everytime you f#$k up, it makes this irritating noise and comes up saying what you missed or didn't look over, and after a while I sometimes want to just throw my monitor out of the damned window.  Yes it's annoying but atleast it tells you what you missed or didn't look at, good job Arstotzka, I feel great that a machine can do my job better and yet it's free.  This thing is basically a invisible scanner, on the way out of the checkpoint it scans the person for if they had everything correct or something wrong and tells you what it was.Endless Mode: This isn't in the cons section because it sucks, it's a little fun actually, especially if you play the Papers, Please theme while you do so, you can pick what you want to do and how much paperwork is required to pass, but honestly after a while it can get a little dull, what I think they should have done is put some kind of randomized game in, where you pick how much paperwork is required but you don't know what could happen, the guards could all die from a terrorist or something if you accidently pushed someone through who had incorrect permits or something, seriously, would add a lot of replay value.Easy game overs: I only beat 1 of the 20 endings that there is but you need to be very careful about what you do SPOILER ALERT, at one point if you let one of the Organizations spies in you get 1k, yes, 1 thousand bucks, but if you keep it and don't use it or something the government takes it and puts you in jail, as well as your family members.  Another time was I had to let this d*$khead advisor for the checkpoint, make me let a woman through yet she wasn't supposed to, and I forgot the woman's name so I ended up putting her in jail, then I got ANOTHER game over, and it gets annoying to have to resort to previous days and go through ALL the work again and try not to let the f$%k up machine go off just to get to a certain point.WHAT I THINK: I think this game is something very special, it's so simple yet so amazing all at once, ""EA would never make something like this, infact it would probably remind them of their Customer Support Services."" = Yahtzee Croshaw.  All and all though, it gets a damn good 9/10, minus the f$#k up machine and some things I think would have enhanced the game, it's pretty damn good, but i'm sure after you get all of the endings it could get a little dull.  This game is totally worth it as it sits and when it's on a sale.			"

												Fun, deceptively simple game that has a lot of depth to it. Manage your own personal needs with your job and your own morality as you work in the Immigration office of a fictional facist country. This game has 20 different endings and lots of achievements, so there's a lot of replay value there. A fun, low-stress game with a really unique premise.			"

												You never knew how much fun working as a border office can be. You live in a soviet-inspired country in 1982 that faces threats of terrorism and revolution. Its your job to look out for forged papers while the story unfolds, the dangers get more and more and the things to look out for get numerous. It can be feeling quite depressing and desolate, as your family is starving and/or sick at home if you don't make enough money (for instance, letting people through that weren't supposed to go through will give you penalties). But it is fun in its own way. Glory to Arstotzka.			"

												Its a really Intersting game, its a fun quirky game about a you as a checkpoint inspector. You have to learn how to move quickly because if you don't have enough money you will not beable to pay rent, heating, food or medicide for your family, who are prone to getting deathly ill for no aparent reason.  But you have to be thurorgh bc if you let the wrong people in you get money deduced. There is a surprizing amout of story packed into the different characters and events that take place from inside the book. I highly reccoment it just to play for at least 3 hours so you really get the game.			"

												Don't be wary of the conversation around it, this is a highly playable and polished game.  The message doesn't get in the way of the mechanics.  Rather, they work together perfectly.  The result easily accomplishes what it intends without becoming too heavy handed/on the nose, or sacrificing interactivity.   Buy it if you like to feel things, and especially if you like gray area morals vs. ethics decisions.I want to keep playing and keep playing even though it ties my stomach in knots.			"

												A fantastic indie puzzle game that has you playing as a border control worker.  You're tasked with checking people's passports and documents against various rules and regulations that become more and more strict as the game progresses.  It's very atmospheric too, which doesn't really come across in the trailers. My only problem with the game is that it can give you a headache, as you will have to look through and check a lot of forms - which has the same effect on you as doing so in real life would.  This means you'll probably struggle to play it for longer than one hour at a time.  The game is also kind of strict when it comes to saving your progress.  You progress through the game one day at a time, and it saves your progress after each day.  The problem is that when you fail the game, the mistake that caused the failure could have occurred at any point in the game, so you can't just start from the previous day and carry on.  This essentially means you'll have to restart from the beginning each time you mess up, which can become annoying when you're checking through forms you already checked on your first playthrough.  It's an excellent game though, and I'd reccomend picking it up if there is any money off.			"

												Games can make you feel joy, pity, embarassment, humiliation, community, and even friendship. Perhaps the best example of one of these games is Papers, Please. From the recurring characters, to the brief stories spun before the player's eyes, enough so to manage to break up the monotony of being at a virtual desk-job.On the other hand, the game very much is a desk job, and if you don't have the patience of a minute or two to go through an entire in-game day of processing people, then this might not be the game for you. It's well worth the experience for the price, and has enough replay value to ensure a few extra hours of content after the ""story"" mode. I would strongly recommend this game for anyone who has a fun time playing the role of their character in other games.			"

												Papers, Please puts you in the shoes of a father, husband, nephew, and son in-law who has been selected in a labor lottery to be an immigration inspector. You decide if the people going into Arstoska are allowed in or denied. Your job is to check the papers or each person and make sure that everything is in check. At the end of each day, you get your paycheck and decide how it is spent. This game can get frusturating at times when you need to decide what gets payed for and what does not get to be payed for. You will lose family along the way, but that is just part of the job description. Each day will be a hectic one and terrorists are to be expected. This game is great for the price and is one of the first, if not the first, of it's kind.     If you want something to do or have some time to sit around and check papers, this is the game for you.Glory to Arstoska! "

												While it may seem like a slow-paced and droll Indie game, 'Papers, Please' is truly a work of art. The Player (you) is just a Border Officer, working day in and day out in order to support their (your) family, but not only can they (once again, you) support their (Do you see what I'm getting at?) family, the Player is also given the choice to bend the rules for desperate immigrants, seperated families, and even  overthrow the government! 'Papers, Please' constantly tests the Player's sense of Morality, but not all good deeds for desperate immigrants are really...'good'... I've let in quite a number of immigrants whom I thought were trying to see a relative, and then they exploded outside of the gate.I digress, so I'll just give my opinion:'Papers, Please' is a masterpiece that will pluck at the strings of your heart, and I HIGHLY recommend that you purchase this game-no, not game, but this piece of art.Final Verdict: 'Papers, Please' earns a 10/10, and is approved to enter Asrtotzka.

												""Papers, Please"" is a 2D adventure game rendered with old school graphics that allows you to follow the life of a border inspector in the fictional country of Arstotzka. Your objective is to control the papers and documents of every person trying to cross the border and interact with the other characters you will meet through several days of work. While at the beginning the controls you are tasked with are pretty simple, later on you will recive new orders that will require you to examine the papers you are given more and more carefully, in an effort to let pass, detain or reject the right people.""Papers, Please"" features an evolving story: you will recive tasks or orders from several characters and your actions will reflect the final outcome of your adventure. The game itself has a total of twenty different endings and you can choose to replay whatever day of work you wish, should you want a different outcome.Another important element of the game is your outcome: at the end of each day you will be noticed with all the expanses you can cover, especially the ones involving the well-being of your family or the opportunity to purchase automatic control systems. Neglecting some of them could bring an abrupt end to your career, as well as accepting money and gifts from the wrong people. Making several mistakes during your dury is also sure to cause you some trouble.All in all, ""Papers, Please"" is an excellent adventure game, with a simple but engaging gameplay and a branched story that offers a lot of replay value			"

												I finished this game couple of times with different endings, but it wasn't until latest playthrough that I thought of writing review.What is this game about?On the surfaceOn the surface it's about working as the immigration officer, processing documents of people trying to gain entry to the country of Arstotzka. You analyse documents and people themselves, searching for discrepancies in papers, signs of forgery, contraband or threats to internal security, after each day, allocating earnings to tend to needs of your family.But that's just a surface for something deeper.Below the surfaceYou see, this is a game about evil.Not the stylish and over the top but ultimately fake moustache twirling kind of evil. That doesn't really exist in real life, apart from some edgy teens who, for the lack of moustache, can't pull ""moustache twirling"" part anyway. No. This game is about real evil. The sad, scared, ubiquitous and hideous kind of evil that hides behind words like:""I'm only doing my job.""""That's not my problem.""""I was only following orders.""John Stuart Mill said: ""Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing."" which often is misquoted and misattributed to Edmund Burke as ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."".Good and Evil.Papers, Please lets you play either side.It's easy to be the hero in games designed to have no other option, you can't not be a hero in Mass Effect series, no matter your choices you end up a hero, the only way to fail there, is to die and refuse to reload the save. Here you can be a villain, complicit in the existant evil or you can be a hero working to change, if you are willing to risk not just your life, but also those of your family, but then again, can risking lives of others be the right choice?When you hear someone misspeak duration of stay, you are allowed to deny them entry without saying a word, or, you can let them correct the mistake. Both are valid choices and there's nothing to stop you from doing either. When you catch the wind of sex-slave trader before police does, you can let him in if his documents are right or you can expose and arrest him, neither choice is wrong within rules of the game. You can mercilessly stick to the rules, or you can sometimes bend them to set right what someone else made wrong. You can reinforce the regime, acting as one of multiple fingers of it's iron fist hoping that other fingers never find reason to crush you, you can work within regime, softening it on that little spot which is your kingdom despite severe risks it carries or you can help topple the regime, if you are willing to risk that your family may pay ultimate price.Some technical detailsAs can be seen on screenshots, graphics and sound are made in retro style. In this case it's not just an artistic choice, this convention helps connect theme of the game with certain places and events that happened in real life. Portraits are clear and distinguishable. Sound as well as colour palette work well with the mood of the game.I can't recall any crash, lag or stuttering. And I don't believe I encountered any bugs.From technical point of view game appears flawless.ConclusionIn Papers, Please you won't be the villain dreaded by billions and you won't be the hero remembered by generations, instead you will be the villain, or the hero, of the kind that you meet every day of your real life.Play this game, it will help you understand real meanings of often touted but rarely understood terms like ""good"", ""evil"", ""responsibility"" or ""courage"".
